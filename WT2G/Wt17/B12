Study
</FONT> </CENTER><P>
<hr>



<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">You have self-selected to participate
in the third round of the 1996 Global Look-Out Study. The first
round collected 142 developments that Millennium Project participants
judged to have important future implications, that were either
largely unrecognized or seriously misunderstood.  In the second
round, the participants were asked to judge the developments'
likelihood, importance, and the agencies that might be instrumental
in addressing the development. Additional developments were also
suggested during Round 2, extending the list to 182 items. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Enclosed is the third round.  It
is composed of 15 issues synthesized from developments rated the
most important and likely by participants in Round 2.  Following
a brief description of each item is a list of actions. You are
invited to assess these actions and add others. Both the descriptions
and suggested actions were drawn from participants' input and
augmented by staff research.<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">Please fax, email, or airmail your
responses to arrive by October 21, 1996. The results of Round
3 will be used to prepare Round 4 interviews with political, corporate,
UN, and NGO leaders. Your recommendations for leaders to be interviewed
are also welcome at this time.  Interviews are expected to be
conducted during November, by Millennium Project staff, participants,
and chairs of the Project's nodes.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">The conclusions of the 1996 Global
Look&#173;Out study will be sent to all those who respond to this
questionnaire, and will be included in the 1997 Millennium Project's
<I>State of the Future Report</I>.  As in other studies of this
sort, participants will be listed in Project reports, but their
names will not be associated with any particular answers &#173;
all answers are be kept confidential.  <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Times New Roman">As you go through Round 3, please
rate only those actions that you feel comfortable judging &#173;
you do not have to respond to all 15 issues, and you do not have
to rate all actions for the issues you select.  If you have not
already done so, please send us a copy of your resume and any
other information about you and your work that you feel is relevant.
Let us know if your resume can be included on the Millennium Project's
homepage on Internet.  If you have any questions, please contact
us at anytime.<BR>

<TITLE>"Ted Christensen"</TITLE><BODY BGCOLOR="#c0c0c0">
<CENTER>
<FONT SIZE=6 COLOR=#000080>Ted Christensen</FONT></CENTER>
<HR SIZE=2>

<p>
Ted Christensen received his  Bachelor of Science in 1966 and his Master of Science in 1970 from
Utah State University .  Other Graduate and Certificate Courses  were completed at the Stanford
Broadcasting Institute, Stanford University, and in Adult and Higher Education, Arizona State
University.
<p>
At present, Mr. Christensen  is the Assistant Vice President for GW Television at The George
Washington University. His administrative responsibilities fall into four general areas:
<p>
First, the development of a distance learning program that will assure the University's leadership
position in a changing world in which technology assumes a much larger role within the academic
process.  Second, supporting the entire campus in the need to introduce and integrate 
communication technologies into academic programs.  This responsibility includes working with
academic departments and individual faculty members to identify appropriate technologies, offer
assistance in content modification,and provide the necessary faculty training.  It also includes
initiating and managing coordination activities with several other University information 
resource units, such as the library and computing services, to facilitate effective utilization of new
technologies and processes.  Third, direct supervision of television production staff and facilities.  
Facilities include three broadcast quality television production studios, an eight-channel I.T.F.S.
community broadcasting system, a 41-channel campus cable television system, and satellite
uplinking and downlinking services.  Finally, GW Television is viewed as a largely self-supporting
unit of the University.  This feature brings planning, proposal development, marketing and 
distribution activities into the range of responsibilities.  It also involves considerable involvement
with public and community groups and organizations.Much of the funding for media projects is
the result of revenue generated through production services provided for non-University
organizations.
<p>
Academically, Ted Christensen serves as Visiting Faculty, primarily for the University of the
Virgin Islands.  In 1995, he developed and taught an in-service course for faculty of UVI who
were preparing to modify their courses to be offered over a new distance learning television
network.  He is Adjunct Professor of Educational Technology Leadership for School of 
Education and Human Development at The George Washington University since 1993.  He
developed the course, "Telecommunications in Education," as part of the Education Technology
Leadership's Master's Degree Program.  This course, presented on a regular basis, is distributed
nationally to over 25 million homes through a major cable television network.
<p>
Mr. Christensen serves as consultant on distance learning and the educational use of technologies
to such firms and organizations as Annenberg/CPB, the American Bar Association , the U.S.
Department of the Interior, the Agricultural Satellite Corporation (Ag*Sat), the U.S. Department
of Agriculture, Boise State University, and the Arizona Department of Corrections, among others. 
 He is often called upon to address associations, many times giving the keynote address.  His
presentations involve distance learning and developing technologies.

<HR SIZE=2>

<p>
Dr. Huddleston is an internationally recognized policy strategist who consults with organizations,
corporations, and communities as they develop new frames of reference to assure continuing
prosperity in a climate of ongoing, rapid global change. Over the past two decades, she has
worked with senior level executives and policy makers to help them solve complex
organizational problems. She guides management through the process of discovering how present
policies and systems are not working optimally and then helps them create approaches that ensure
open,flexible organizations. With Dr. Huddleston's guidance, clients develop innovative systems
and ongoing policies in which they can thrive with vital sustainability through ongoing change.
She formed The Consortium International with affiliates globally positioned to bring a truly
international perspective to policy strategy.
<p>
Maintaining dialogue with government officials, business leaders, and researchers over the world,
Dr. Huddleston operates in the reality that we are now a digitized, borderless world society as she
brings people together who are politically, culturally, and ethnically diverse and enables them to
work in successful high-performance teams. She strongly emphasizes her belief that every person
in the organization operate in a leadership position, exhibiting individual responsibility-and that
each individual's influence reach beyond the structure of the organization into the community. It is
her philosophy and experience that corporations are better able to maximize their profits over time
by becoming good global citizens.
<p>
<h4>Profile:</h4> A recognized leader in global policy research, Dr. Huddleston utilizes the
finest minds and technologies in academia, research, business, and governments. She brings
together eminent scholars and researchers to identify and establish direction for global
development through her international policy research think tank. Because of her keen interest in
moral and ethical behavior in the global socio-economy, she is organizing the World Future
Society's Professional Forum on that subject to be held in Washington, DC in July 1996.
<p>
Dr. Huddleston is a credentialed organizational behavior analyst, communication strategist, group
dynamics specialist, and dispute resolution mediator. She isknown for moving past the usual
symptomatic problem-solving interventions to create innovative, permanent solutions for difficult
issues.

<hr size=2><p>
For the past several years I have been concentrating my technical energies
(much of my time is unfortunately spent on administrative responsibilities)
on developing new ways to use games, simulations, Outward Bound type
activities, and other action learning technologies to convey subtle
understanding of complex social and environmental systems. I manage a 100
acre campus of the University where we run short courses for almost 6000
people every year.
<p>
One element of the program is a large grant from a Japanese foundation to
create a 4 day training program, "Creating Transformational Teams for
Sustainable Development." The workshop conveys: team skills, principles of
sustainable development, and tools for systems thinking. This is a
curriculum that will be boxed and disseminated widely. I am working closely
with directors of training centers in Thailand, Costa Rica, Switzerland,
Czech Republic, Latvia, Mexico, and the US to design the workshop and
develop in each of their countries the physical facilities and the staff
necessary to begin offering it on a frequent and sustained basis to local
organizations.
<p>
This group will come together for the third time for two weeks in Durham
this summer.

<HR SIZE=2>

<p>John L. Petersen is a futurist who specializes in the area of national and global security.  He is the
president and founder of The Arlington Institute (TAI), a Washington, DC- area research and
policy institute. TAI concentrates on studies of the future with emphasis on the emerging global
role of the U.S., the changing nature of the concept of national security and the development of
the discipline of foresight.

<p>Since receiving a degree in electrical engineering, he has had a varied background in both business
and the national security sector of government. Mr. Petersen has worked in sales, manufacturing,
long-range strategic and product planning, the nonprofit social sector, real estate development
and advertising and marketing, mostly with companies that he started himself. His government
experience has included stints at the National War College, the Naval War College, the Institute
for National Security Studies, the Office of the Secretary of Defense, and the National Security
Council staff.  He was a naval flight officer in the U. S. Navy and Navy Reserve and is a
decorated veteran of both the Viet Nam and Persian Gulf wars.

<p>Mr. Petersen is an authority in the area of foresight and long-range strategic planning and has
written extensively on those and a variety of other subjects.  The Diffusion of Power: An Era of
Realignment, the 1988 report he wrote for the National Security Group characterized the coming
period of fundamental change.  His 1993 book-length report, The Road to 2012: Looking Toward
the Next Two Decades is being used at the highest levels of American government as a basis
strategic planning.  Info War, an article for the U. S. Naval Institute's journal PROCEEDINGS
won the AFCEA and U.S. Naval Institute 1994 Writing Award for the single best article
published in 1993 concerning communications, intelligence and information systems in the naval
and maritime services. His award-winning book, The Road to 2015: Profiles of the Future, was
published by the Waite Group Press in late 1994.  He has been involved in a number of
presidential political campaigns, serving in positions of senior responsibility in the areas of
politics, issues and fundraising.  He was the Illinois State Chairman of Gary Hart's 1984
presidential campaign and was an advisor to the campaigns of Al Gore and Michael Dukakis in
1988.  He was an elected delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1984. The Arlington
Institute works with the leadership of the U.S. military and other organizations to help them
develop new concepts of what might evolve in the future and how those trends may translate into
global and national security issues.

Educated in chemistry (B.Sc., M.Sc.) and philosophy (B.A.) at the
University of Leiden (1959-1965); Ph.D. (Social Responsibility of Chemists)
University of Leiden, 1981.<p>
After doing research in physical chemistry at the University of Leiden, I
developed a program of teaching and research in chemistry and society
(1969-1974) and was responsible for this program until 1984 (in the last
three years of that period, I was also connected (half time) to the
Sociology Department at the University of Leiden. After three years' guest
professorship in Science Dynamics at the University of Amsterdam
(1984-1987), I became Full Professor of Philosophy of Science and
Technology at the University, and Head of Department. The work of the
Department focusses on social and policy studies of science and technology
and their role in society.
<P>
My own research has addressed issues of chemistry in society, of dynamics
of scientific development, controversies, technology assessment, technology
dynamics, and science and technology policy (including contextual and
methodological aspects of evaluation and foresight).
Apart from almost 100 scholarly papers and book chapters on these topics,
and some 20 (co)authored reports of commissioned research, I (co)authored
or (co)edited some 12 books and monographs.

-Michel Callon, John Law, Arie Rip, Mapping the dynamics of science and
technology. Sociology of science in the real world. London: Macmillan,
1986.<br>

     Allen Tough writes about future generations, our long-term
future, and the scientific search for extraterrestrial intelligence. On
the international level, he is active in various projects and
conferences that focus on these three topics.  
<p>
     His most recent book is called Crucial Questions About the
Future.  He is currently finishing a book called A Message from
Future Generations.   His three earlier books are The Adult's
Learning Projects, Intentional Changes, and  Expand Your Life.

<p>
     Allen grew up in Toronto, attended the University of Toronto
for his first two degrees in psychology and education, and then
attended the University of Chicago for a PhD in the social sciences. 
His early research studied the adult's successful efforts to learn and
change, particularly the 70% that are self-planned without relying on
institutions or professionals.  
<p>
     Here are some numbers, in case they are of interest.  He has
made 170 presentations at conferences in 15 countries.  He is the
author of 7 books, plus 75 published papers.  His research has been

<h2>Employment</h2><p>
5/88-10/88 and 2/89-Present: Program Director for Neuroengineering (about $2 million/year) in
the Engineering Directorate of the National Science Foundation.  The job mainly involves defining
and communicating priorities, collaborating with other parts of NSF and the government to
coordinate initiatives and share proposals, advancing neuro-engineering in broad terms, deciding
on proposals and maintaining a budget.  Since 3/94, Technical Coordinator for the NSF Small
Business topic on the Next Generation Vehicle (fuel cell/electric cars), which I originated. Two
patents pending since 1993 for new neurocontrol and elastic fuzzy logic designs. In consulting for
a small private company, developed approach to stock forecasting successfully transferred to a
major fund, where it nowyields 6 percent per month above Dow. For program information and
papers, start from www.nsf.gov; clicking on Engineering Directorate, then Electrical and
Communication Systems, then Engineering Systems or neural networks or neuroengineering.
<p>
12/79-5/88 and 11/88-2/89: Operations research analyst and mathematical statistician, U.S.
Department of Energy, Division of Energy Analysis and Forecasting and Quality Assurance
Division.  Initially, I was lead analyst for evaluating and comparing long-term energy models.
Later, I was asked to be lead analyst for the industrial, transportation and (for a shorter time)
commercial sectors; after evaluating the existing literature on these sectors, I built hybrid
economic-engineering models, and developed both the official EIA forecasts of these sectors and
in-depth analyses of them. I also built the spreadsheet model of the natural gas industry used in
the 1987 forecasts, using techniques borrowed from the neural network field.
This job involved substantial management of contractors (though I did the model design work
myself), substantial interaction with the Conservation and Policy offices at DOE, and fairly
frequent interaction with EPA and the DOE Energy Research group. I was also asked to give
frequent talks, to groups such as the National Coalition on Consumer Education, the Global
Futures Roundtable, and so on. Last supervisor at DOE: Dr. Barry Cohen. Served on the Global
2000 Phase II interagency committee organized by CEQ on improvements in models and data
required for improved global modelling. 
<p>
12/78-12/79: IPA (technically employed by U. of Maryland), Census Bureau. Close to full-time
work on time-series analysis and optimization methods, developing ways in which
backpropagation and related techniques might be applied to large-scale (multi-billion dollar)
resource allocation problems involving regional economic development.
<p>
8/75-12/78: Assistant professor, U. of Maryland, College Park.  One-third of my time was spent
teaching advanced quantitative methods (optimization and forecasting) to graduate students in
political science.  Two-thirds was spend as a Principal Investigator on a DARPA grant, in which I
mostly worked on developing new designs and concepts for neural network control. (Some of the
methods developed and published in that period go well beyond backpropagation, and are just
now coming into application.)  In the last year, I demonstrated that forecast error could be
reduced substantially in a major Joint Chiefs of Staff global model, when these new concepts were
applied to that model.
<p>
6/73-8/75: Research staff, full time, MIT Cambridge Project.  Responsible for debugging and
upgrading major user-oriented software packages used by DOD/AFDSC and others. For example,
I implemented a Time-Series Processor command using backpropagation (transparent to the user)
to estimate regression-type models with a correction for "errors in data."  This
position required detailed understanding of a wide variety of analysis tools, understanding of user
needs and applications, and debugging of complex unstructured code in FORTRAN and PL/1
written by other people.
<p>
Pre-1973:   A variety of summer and part-time jobs -- research assistant in forecasting political
conflict and Vietnam data (cf. Jeff Milstein, formerly at JCS/Strategy and now in the Defense
Export Security group), lab instructor in electronics at Harvard, modeling of educational
psychology at Abt Associates in Cambridge, statistical analysis of quasars, numerical
analysis work at Jefferson Hospital in Philadelphia.<p>
<h2>Professional and Volunteer Work</h2>
Elected as Governing Board member (1989), Secretary (1990) and then President (1991-92 term)
of the International Neural Network Society. Consistently advocated INNS-IEEE collaboration
and joint meetings. Reelected as Governing Board member. General Chair of 1994 World
Congress on Neural Networks (WCNN94).Served on IEEE Control Systems committee to
define intelligent control.<br>
 <p> Former Washington representative of the L-5 Society, in which capacity I worked to
support greater foresight and cost reduction in space policy. Worked actively as an associate
member of the regional B'nai B'rith Energy committee.  (Was eligible only to be an associate
member because I am a Quaker.) At Harvard and the London School of Economics, I was a
member of the Young Republicans, the Young Conservatives, the Bow Group, and the European
Student Union.
 <p> Member, IEEE, Control Systems Society and Systems, Man and Cyberbetics (SMC)
Society. Elected to AdCom (Governing Board) of SMC Society, 1995. IEEE Neural Network
Council Pioneer Award, 1995, awarded for work on backpropagation and intelligent control.
<p>
<h2>Education</h2><p>

Ph.D.:  Harvard U., 1974, Committee on Applied Mathematics, Division of Engineering and
Applied Physics.  My Ph.D. thesis proposed the method now known as "backpropagation," and
suggested a number of possible applications. This thesis is now widely cited as the original source
on backpropagation, which is used in 30-90% of neural network applications, depending on which
survey you believe. (70% is the most common estimate.) My thesis adviser, Prof. Karl Deutsch,
died very recently.
<p>
M.S.: Harvard U., 1969, Committee on Applied Mathematics.  Major in mathematical physics,
minors in decision and control and mathematical techniques.  Physics courses were all graduate
courses in quantum theory, quantum field theory, general relativity and nuclear physics. I took
courses under Julian Schwinger, Nobel Prize winner and co-inventor of quantum field theory, the
foundation of all modern physics; many of us (including Cooper) believe that Schwinger is right
up there with Einstein, Heisenberg, DeBroglie Schrodinger and Feynman as the top physicists of
the century.
<p>
M.Sc.: London School of Economics (UK), 1968.  International political systems, with a
concentration on European institutions (especially Common Market). 
<p>
B.A : Harvard U., magna cum laude, 1967, economics.  Courses included graduate-levels work in
optimization methods, psychological simulation, and the strategy of conflict.  Scored 930 out of
950 in the economics Graduate Record Examination, compared with 700-800 for the 99th
percentile and the Harvard mean.
<p>
Pre-College: Received credit for seven half-year mathematics courses (21 credits), at the U. of
Penna. and Princeton U. junior level and above, taken between ages 12 and 15.  At 14, completed
the U. of Penna. Moore School advanced summer classes in computers with 100%.  At 14,
received FCC 1st Class Radiotelephone Commercial License.  MAA prize for highest scoring
mathematics student in New Jersey.

<title>1996 Global Look-Out Panel, Round 2, Cover Letter</title>
<body bgcolor="#96E1FA">

<font size=+1><i>June 4, 1996</i><p></font>

You have self-selected to participate in the Millennium Project.  It is policy to include leading
futurists and scholars found through a variety of methods explained in the feasibility report available
on this  homepage - AND - to allow innovate individuals with fresh thinking to find the Project and 
participate.<p>

As a result, you are invited to participate in the second round of a three-round inquiry referred to as
the <i>1996 Global Look-Out Study.</i>  This is an activity of the Millennium Project, a globally
decentralized capacity for futures research.  The project is being coordinated by the American Council
for the United Nations University in collaboration with the Smithsonian Institution and The Futures
Group.  Current funding us provided by the Ford Motor Company, Monsanto, and others are
anticipated.<p>

The first round collected 142 emerging global issues and opportunities that Millennium Project
participants judged to have important future implications and were largely unrecognized or seriously
misunderstood.  These developments have been placed into the six domains for your inspection.<p>

You are invited to rate these developments in section 1. You are also invited to comment in more
detail on those developments within the domain closest to your areas of expertise in section 2.  The
full-text of all 142 developments is too long for a questionnaire.  Instead you can select one of the
domains in section 2 and download its full-text from the Millennium Project's homepage. You can
comment on developments in more than one domain, if you like.<p>

Please complete and return the attached questionnaire by July 15, 1996. The results will be used to
form a third and final round that will be sent to you as soon as possible.  The conclusions of the three-round Global Look-Out study will be sent to all those who returned the questionnaires and will be
included in the 1997 Millennium Project's <i>State of the Future Report.</i><p>
 
As in other studies of this sort, participants will be listed in Project reports, but their names will not
be associated with any particular answers - your answers will be kept confidential.  Please answer
those questions that you feel comfortable answering - you do not have to answer all the questions.
If is possible, please respond to this questionnaire via e-mail (to prevent errors in re-typing). If email
is not possible, then respond via fax or airmail. Please see the instructions.<p>
 
If you do send in your reponse to Round 2, please send us a copy of your resume and any other
information about yourself and your work that you feel is relevant. Let us know if your resume can
be included on the Millennium Project's homepage on Internet.  If you have any questions please
contact us at anytime. We look forward to your responses. <p>

 
Sincerely yours,<p>

<i>1996 GLOBAL LOOK-OUT STUDY</i></font>
<p><hr><p>
<font size=+1>ROUND 2 QUESTIONNAIRE<p>
INSTRUCTIONS</font><p></center>

Many important, innovative and imaginative responses were received in the first round of the
Millennium Project 1996 Global Out-Look Study. This first round posed several questions about
emerging developments in the fields of expertise of participants. Each participant was asked to
identify current developments that are likely to result in important future issues or opportunities but
are not yet generally known outside of their fields or that are seriously misunderstood.  Participants
were also asked to identify possible consequences of the developments they suggested and at least
one goal or strategy for each development. <p>

This second round questionnaire comes in two sections. The first section presents a one-line summary
of each development suggested in Round 1.  You will be asked to judge the likelihood and
importance of each and to identify the primary agency that should lead strategy to address each
development.  The second section presents the full text of responses from round 1 in the six domains
below.  You will be asked to comment on consequences, goals, strategies, and references of each
development in your domain.<p>

<center>
         <TABLE WIDTH= BORDER=0 CELLSPACING= CELLPADDING=1 >
<TR>
	<TD>1. Demographics and Human Resources</TD><TD>4. Governance and Conflict</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD>2. Environmental Change and Biodiversity</TD><TD>5. International Economics and Wealth</TD>
</TR>
<TR>
	<TD>3. Technological Capacity</TD><TD>6. Integration and Whole Futures</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE><p>
</center>         

Selection of the domain sent to you in second section was based on your resume, first round
responses, previous expressions of interest, Internet and literature searches, and our best judgment.
Again, you do not have to rate all developments and comment on all text.<p>

The third round will be sent in several weeks, and will focus on strategies associated with the most
important ideas provided by the panel.<p>

The full text of all developments submitted in Round 1 are available to all participants. If you want
to see the full text of other domains, please download anything you wish from the Millennium
Project's homepage: <i>http://nko.mhpcc.edu/millennium/Millennium_Project.html.</i>  If you are not able
to do this, then send your request to <i>jglenn@igc.org</i> or fax 202-686-5179.<p>

Please complete the questionnaire and return it by July 15, 1996. Please respond by e-mail if that is
possible, to:  <i>jglenn@igc.org</i>  otherwise fax to 202-686 5179 or mail to: AC/UNU/Millennium
Project, 4421 Garrison St. NW, Washington, DC 20016 USA.<p>

ISSUE 9:<HR WIDTH=25% Align=left>
The severity of religious, ethnic, and racial conflicts is increasing.
</FONT>
<HR>
Religious, ethnic, and racial hostilities held in check by the 
Cold War have now emerged as a major theme of armed struggle. 
Many groups feel a sense of persecution and isolation. Rapid rates
 of technological, political, and social change cause many to fear 
the future, giving rise to feelings of being "left behind," and 
the need to re-establish fundamental principals.  Increases in 
regional and inter-regional migrations are provoking political and 
economic tensions. The recent successes of other separatist 
movements, perceived injustices, and long held animosities, all 
fuel the fire.  Extremists can focus the media through violence.  
Stinger missiles, chemical and biological weapons, and computer 
viruses, are cheap and easy for smaller groups to use and have 
significant affects on "superior" military forces, the media, and 
the general public.

ISSUE 8:<HR WIDTH=25% Align=left>
The status of women is changing.
</FONT>
<HR>
The striving for equality crosses cultural, geographical, 
racial, class, religious, and ethnic boundaries.  Yet, the very 
nature of  equality has different meanings in different parts of 
the world, and in some parts, it is a matter of fierce debate.  
In addition to the issues of equality for women  in developing 
countries, economic and social barriers exist in industrialized 
countries as well. Although diminishing, wage disparity and limits
 on access to executive power pose particular problems, especially 
in corporations. Worldwide, the overall status of women is 
improving, and there are significant breakthroughs.   
In the developing countries, the last 20 years has seen women 
advancing twice as fast as men in literacy and school enrollment, 
womens life expectancy increasing by nine years, and maternal 
mortality rate has nearly halved worldwide. Nevertheless, women 
have a long way to go as the implementation of the Platform for 
Action, passed by the UN Fourth World Conference on Women in 
Beijing 1995, has only just begun.

ISSUE 5:<HR WIDTH=25% Align=left>
The capacity to decide seems to be diminishing as issues become more global and
complex under conditions of increasing uncertainty and risk. 
</FONT>
<HR>
There is an increasing need for effective global decision making, 
responsibility (especially moral responsibility), action, and 
results.  Today many believe it is possible to shape the future, 
rather than simply prepare for a future which is a linear 
extrapolation of the present or a product of chance or fate.  
Yet, globalization, complexity, number, and frequency of choices 
seem to grow beyond the ability to know and decide.  
Skills development in concept formulation and communications 
seem to be decreasing relative to the requirements of an 
increasingly complicated world.

The growth of population and economies interacts adversely with environmental
quality and natural resources. 
</FONT>
<HR>
Current world population is 5.8 billion and, according to UN 
projections may reach 10-12 billion by the middle of the next 
century. As population concentrates, urban environmental problems
intensify.  Most countries are expected to increase consumption 
of natural resources and energy. While some experts argue that a 
sustainable future requires slower economic growth, others point 
out that technology and economic incentives have always provided 
solutions to increasing demand, such as centralized wastewater 
processing systems. Although the outcomes of the complex 
interactions among population, economic growth, environmental 
quality, and natural resources are uncertain, the stakes are high.

Terrorism is growing in intensity, scale, and threat.  
</FONT>
<HR>
Terrorism is increasingly destructive, proliferating, and 
difficult to prevent.  In addition to conventional explosives, 
chemical weapons, computer viruses, the weapons that may become
  available to terrorists, e.g. nuclear and biological weapons 
make the threat increasingly ominous.  The arsenals of the United 
States, Russia, and many other nations contain biological and 
chemical weapons that also have massive killing potential.  
These materials need not be stolen since their manufacture 
requires easily obtainable raw materials and conventional 
technology.

Fresh water is becoming scarce in localized areas of the world.

<HR>
Lack of adequate waste management in most places in the world; 
excessive consumption and contamination of water aquifers; 
excessive farming on marginal lands, and population and urbanization trends are affecting the availability - and future expectations of availability - of fresh water. The countries facing scarcity include: eleven African countries, nine Middle Eastern countries, northern China (including Beijing and the agricultural lands surrounding it); India (including New Delhi and thousands of rural villages); Mexico (including Mexico City and irrigated farmlands in northern Mexico); and portions of the Western United States.

ISSUE 3:<HR WIDTH=25% Align=left>
The gap in living standards between the rich and poor promises to become more
extreme and divisive. 
</FONT>
<HR>
According to the World Bank, low income countries' average per 
capital income grew 3.4% from 1986 to 1994 compared to 1.9% for 
high income countries.  One might conclude that both the rich are 
getting richer and the poor are getting richer, but that would be 
misleading.  Excluding India and China, the low-income countries
 fell by 1.1%.  Hence, while some poorer countries are getting 
richer per capita, incomes in most of the low income countries 
either dropped or did not grow.  According to the UNDP's Human 
Development Report 1996: "Nearly 90 countries are worse off
economically than they were ten years ago ... the gap in per 
capita income between the industrial and developing worlds tripled
 from 1960 to 1993, from US$5,700 to $15,400...today the net worth
 of the world's 358 richest billionaires is equal to the combined 
income of the poorest 45% of the world's population - 2.3 billion
 people."  Besides the moral implications, this issue could lead 
to increased instability and conflict.

Recent outbreaks of bubonic plague in India, ebola virus in

Organized crime groups are becoming sophisticated global enterprises. 
</FONT>
<HR>
With vast sums of money from illegal drugs and other sources, 
organized crime is buying the technical know-how to generate even 
more profits in new ventures ranging from information fraud to 
human organ and arms traffic. Examples include: 1991 bank fraud of 
US$2.2 billion; telephone fraud $4 billion; credit card fraud $1.5
 billion. Financial institutions in the United States alone 
transfer over one trillion dollars via computer networks daily, 
this and other international financial flows provide tempting 
targets. Power vacuums across the world created by the fall of 
Soviet authority and weakened national governments in other 
regions are being filled in part by new forms of criminal power. 
Indecisive or untimely responses are likely to encourage an 
expansion of these criminal trends.

Information technology holds both promise and peril. 
</FONT>
<HR>
Interactive cyberspace has become an important new and 
unprecedented medium for civilization.  Prices for 
telecommunications, computers, and software are continuing to 
fall while capacity grows and these systems are spreading 
throughout poorer regions of the world.  Email and other gateways 
connected virtually all countries by the end of 1994.  AT&Ts 
Africa One Project and the Global Information Infrastructure 
vision of U.S. Vice President Al Gore are expected to accelerate 
Internet growth in developing countries. By the year 2000, the 
Internet Society expects 187 million hosts connected world-wide, 
2 million networks outside the U.S., 2.5 billion users, and more 
traffic than voice telephone.

Nuclear power plants around the world are aging.  
</FONT>
<HR>
All nuclear power plants are aging and will have to be
decommissioned when their lifetime is expended. Techniques for 
decommissioning are not well in hand, and long term storage of 
decommissioned plants and materials will be required. In addition, 
some plants (e.g. Chernobyl) use technologies and control systems 
that have higher than standard risks.  Nuclear power plants are 
designed to operate for a period of between 30 and 50 years; after 
that time, the plants have to be dismantled and the sites made 
safe for other uses. More than 300 facilities around the world 
will have to be decommissioned by 2010.  Decommissioning may also 
be required in the case of an accident or nuclear plant closing 
for other reasons.  With the decommissioning of nuclear power 
plants and the accelerating energy requirements, new electric 
production will become far more important that generally 
appreciated.

The meaning of work, unemployment, leisure, and underemployment is changing.   
</FONT>
<HR>
Automation, globalization of business, regional trade agreements, 
the shifting locus of low labor costs, improved productivity, 
the aging of the population, and the drive for improved corporate 
efficiency are causing changes in the labor forces of almost 
all nations. The changes include: increasing percent of service 
sector employment while manufacturing percentage is falling;  
the ratio of retired relative to active workers is growing almost 
anywhere, placing an economic burden on workers in the future; 
the displacement of many low-skilled, well-paid workers in the 
developed world occurring simultaneously with a shortage of people 
with adequate skills; the inability of some developing countries 
to use developed technologies effectively. Underemployment and 
isolation of women from the cash economy remains an important 
issue in developing countries. The fundamental shift in how the 
"world's work gets done" is creating a truly global labor force, 
yet lack of training and access divides labor into those capable 
of performing high paying work, and those who are not. If world 
 demand for a workforce is significantly less than the supply, 
will there then be more creative uses of leisure, or will chronic, 
turbulent, destabilizing under- and unemployment result?

The HIV epidemic will continue to spread.  
</FONT>
<HR>
In 1995, more people than ever before,  4.7 million, were infected 
by HIV. The number of new cases of AIDS also set a record: just 
under 2 million.  About 1.7 million people died from AIDS in 1995. 
The number of newly reported cases of HIV has doubled since 1991. 
The infection rates exceed 25% in a number of major sub-Saharan 
African cities.  According to National Academy of Sciences (USA), 
"By the year 2010, demographers estimate that AIDS will have 
lowered life expectancy from 66 to 33 years in Zambia, from 70 to 
40 in Zimbabwe, from 68 to 40 in Kenya, and from 59 to 31 years in 
Uganda." The growth rate of new cases has apparently peaked in 
sub-Saharan Africa, but new cases in Southeast Asia now exceed 
those occurring in Africa. Variants of the virus which had been 
confined to distinct geographical locations are now appearing 
elsewhere; if a vaccine can be found for one strain it might not 
protect against another.

Economic growth brings both promising and threatening consequences.  
</FONT>
<HR>
The driving force generated by the interdependence between 
economic growth and technological innovation has been the most 
significant engine of change for the last 200 years.  
Economic growth is responsible for changing the standard of 
living for most people in the world.  It is shaping the physical 
and social environment, creating new global business relationships,
 changing the nature of work, employment, and expectations about 
the role and responsibilities of governments. The consequences of 
economic growth is subject to pessimistic and optimistic 
interpretations.  There is pessimism over the nature and number of 
jobs, widening income gaps, trade disputes, energy consumptions,
 political disorder, environmental degradation, migrations from 
lesser developed countries, technological displacement, conflict 
between societal and economic aims, and uneven distribution of
wealth among nations. And there is equally intense optimism over
economic growths production of food, shelter, clothing, health 
care, and knowledge as well as the potential of new technologies 
for improved environmental management and global information 
access. During the same period of economic growth, infant 
mortality has fallen, life expectancy has risen, and living standards for 
hundreds of millions have improved.

<b>Message:</b><br> <b>Miconia Threatens the Big Island and Help is Needed...</b><p><p>


1)We need to obtain permission to survey properties,
and many of the owners are not responding.  The word needs
to be spread to unknowing owners.  Any Big Island land owners
are asked to call the hotline (961-3299) or e-mail your
permissions complete with your name, tmk# and property
location.  Especially if you do not know if it exists on 
your property, we need to check.  It has been found in nearly
all subdivisions already, nothing can go unchecked.<p>

2)We are fortunate here on the Big Island to have such a
greatly concerned populace.  500 or so people have seen
miconia and reported their sightings to the hotline.
THANK-YOU!!!<p>

Also for those who have called in, please be patient with
our program.  Our #1 problem is what keeps us from treating
the one that you keep seeing.  Even now, many of the plants
are in the flowering stages, but our hands are tied.  This 
is why we must contact owners.<p>

Thanks again,<p>

<B>Fungus being tested on Kauai as weapon against banana poka </B><P>

Scientists say a fungus hand-sprayed on the banana poka vine is<BR>
taking hold on the alien weed, but say it's too soon to know <BR>
whether the fungus will control its spread.<P>

The banana poka vine was identified as one of the major alien<BR>
species that had the potential to spread rapidly across Kauai<BR>
following the deforestation and defoliation caused by Hurricane<BR>
Iniki.<P>

A project team from the state Department of Land and Natural <BR>
Resources received a waiver approval from the U.S. Department<BR>
of Agriculture in March and sprayed Septoria fungus spores at <BR>
five demonstration sites on Kauai.<P>
 
The department reported Tuesday that the fungus was located <BR>
on some of the banana poka plants within three weeks, said<BR>
University of Hawaii plant pathologist Eduardo Trujillo.<P>

The plants will will remain under observation so scientists <BR>
can better refine the fungus application techniques, said Trujillo,<BR>
who discovered the fungus during an expediton to South America<BR>
funded by the state Legislature.<P>

The fungus, Septoria passiflorae, infects banana poka leaves,<BR>
causing them to fall off the plant, said Victor Tanimoto of the<BR>
departments's Division of Forestry and Wildlife.  This process<BR>
weakens the plants and they eventually die. <P>

"Biological control is not definite and the 'proof of the pudding'<BR>
wouldn't be evident until plants die at and epidemic rate,"<BR>  
Tanimoto said.  "However, we hope that once the Septoria fungus<BR>
is established on banana poka, the fungus will be moved to the<BR>
far reaches of the banana poka infestations."<P>

Additional spraying and monitoring are planned for banana poka<BR>
infestations on Kauai, Maui and the Big Island.<P>

"Elimination of banana poka vines will enable our forests to <BR>
flourish and provide a suitable habitat for Hawaii's unique <BR>
and diverse tropical plants and animals," DLNR Chairman Mike <BR>
Wilson said.

<B>WHAT IS IT?</B><P>

Miconia is a fast-growing, weedy tree from South America 
that is now invading Hawai`i.<P>

<UL>
<LI>It has large, dark green leaves with purple undersides.
Leaves can be up to 3 feet long and are oval-shaped.<BR>
<LI>It looks like a bush when young, but can grow up to 50
feet tall.</UL><P>

<B>Why is it a threat?</B><P>

Miconia shades out other plants in native forests, pastures, 
and farmlands.

<UL>
<LI>It causes increased erosion by killing groundcover 
plants.
<LI>A single plant produces thousands of tiny seeds that 
spread quickly.
<LI>It has already destroyed 70% of the forest growth on 
Tahiti.
<LI>Miconia plants have now been found on the Big Island, 
Maui, O`ahu, and Kaua`i.</UL><P>

<B>What can you do?</B>

<UL>
<LI>If you think you've found Miconia, call the hotline 
on your island.<BR>
An expert will confirm your sighting (several other 
plants look like Miconia) and will tell you what to do next.

<b>Message:</b><br> Dogs are overpopulating residential
neighborhoods. These large carnivores attack horses, 
cats, and mailmen. I wonder how much damage these
alien preditors have done to indigenous birds and
other animals. It seems that dogs are more important
than any safety or environmental issues in the minds of
dogowners. It may be too late for many Maui species, 
but presence of forty-thousand dogs indicates that 
many people are dedicated to repopulating the island
with powerful carnivores.

<b>Message:</b><br> <pre>This bit of information came out of the conference:

<B>How We Affect Marine Habitats</B>
We damage or destroy productive coastal habitats in several ways:
1) alteration of habitats, such as filling or dredging marshes to
  build waterfront houses;
2)contamination of waters with toxic substances, such as industrial
  chemicals and pesticides;
3) pollution of waters with excessive nutrients, such as agricultural
  and home fertilizers and deomestic sewage; and 
4) construction on coastal rivers of dams, which block upstream fish
  migrations and destroy downstream migrants in power turbines and
  other intakes.
Our activities have direct and indirect effects. For instance, when
 we dredge a ship channel to remove accumulated sediment, we may also
 destroy seagrass beds and other habitats that provide food and
 shelter for fish and shellfish.  Also, this can resuspend pollutants
 that thave settled in the sediments.  Recycled pollutants can harm
 fish and shellfish by reducing the ability of young to survive.
When we dredge, an area must be found to deposit the dredged materials.
  In the past, we have often deposited these materials in marshes that
 many have regarded was worthless and suitable only for development. 
 In doing so, we have covered some of the most important and productive
 marine habitats.
Activities far from the coast can also damage marine habitats. 
 Agricultural activities can result in soil, pesticides, fertilizer
 residues and other pollutants being carried into streams during rain
 storms and then to coastal waters.  Excessive amounts of fertilizers
 washed into marine waters can cause undesirable blooms of algae.  In
 high concentrations, the otherwise beneficial algae screen sunlight
 from other marine plants that are depended upon by fish & shellfish.
 When these algae die and decompose, they may deplete the oxygen from
 brood areas of water, killing fish and shellfish.
Dams on rivers often prevent marine fish that lay their eggs in fresh
 waters from completing their migration from the ocean., Dams and
 diversions also reduce the flow of fresh water into bays and estuaries,
 resulting in loss of marshlands, seagrass beds and water quality important
 in the early life of marine fishes and shelllfish.  
Highway construction, improrper disposal of motor oil, use of persticides
 and fertilizers in redsidential areas and on golf courses, release of
 poorly treated or untreated sewage, faulty spetic tanks and discharge of
 toxic wastewater by industrial facilities all add contaminansts to coastal
 water.
More oftern than not, habitat loss and degradation have caused serious
 reductions in fish and shelllfish populations. From industrial giant to
 individual citizem we all have a hand in determining the health and
 productivity of our coatal waters.

<b>Message:</b><br>  I'm interested in whales and dolphins. I think you know
that we Japanese continue whaling. So that I think I have to 
study more about them and make it clear that whether our 
action is wrong or not. I want to protect them if they are
endangered. I did a resarch of dolphins as a volunteer this
March. From this experience, I got to think that we mustn't 
disturb them by our selfish behavior. They have their own
life. We can enjoy whale watching or dolphin watching, but 

it mustn't be an obstacle for them. 
 Please inform me what we can do for them in Japan or in
the world.

<P>

  Maui needs more trees just as most of the Earth 
does!  It's fun, social and is a great way to improve the   
air, soil, weather, and fauna habitat.  Bring a shovel if 
you have one, drinking water, lunch, raincoat, 4x4 if
you have one of those, too.
<p>
 Next planting date is November 3rd, 1996.
  Call 575-9449 or 297-0392
 8AM to 9PM for meeting time, location and carpooling.
  Children welcome to work, also, with playtime afterward.
If you can't make it to this event, you can put yourself 
"on call" for next time, or make an appointment to come 
visit our nursery in Haiku.    
<P>
    ALOHA

The Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary

The shallow, warm waters surrounding the main Hawaiian Islands
 comprise one of the world's most important humpback whale habitats. 
 Scientists estimate that two-thirds of the entire North Pacific
 humpback whale population migrate to Hawaiian waters to engage in
 breeding, calving and nursing activities.  The continued protection
 of humpback whales and their Hawaiian habitat is crucial to the
 long-term recovery of this magnificent endangered species.    These
 waters are also home to the highly endangered Hawaiian monk seal,
 sea turtles, seabirds and many endemic coral reef fish and
 invertebrate species.                       

This Spring, the Governor of Hawaii will decide on whether to
 approve or reject NOAA's Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National
 Marine Sanctuary.  The Governor needs to hear that there is public
 support for the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine
 Sanctuary or it may be rejected.  The Hawaii Sanctuary provides
 an opportunity to coordinate the various activities of Federal,
 State and local government agencies and the public that may affect
 humpback whales and their habitat.  The Sanctuary also has
 established a citizen's advisory council to allow public input into
 the management of the site and will provide additional resources for      
marine-related research, long-term monitoring and education projects.

If you would like to write to the governor to express your support of
 the sanctuary, please direct letters to:         

Honorable Benjamin J. Cayetano   
Governor         
State of Hawaii
Executive Chambers        
Hawaii State Capitol

Subject: Re: newborn whale stranding in January

Dear marmamers,

you might be interested to know that, regarding the newborn gray 
whale which stranded in January, there is not just the "official" 
website

>http:www.bev.net/education/SeaWorld/GrayWhale/graywhale.html<

but also that of Peter Wallerstein (Whale Rescue Team home page) 
- who was THE person who actually rescued it

>http://www.blacktop.com/whalerescue/<
         
Two sides of a story.

Best wishes,     
Stefan Jacobs

<b>Message:</b><br> Today I witnessed Southern Humpbacks off Palmer Station, Antarctica that appeared to be feeding.  They approached our Zodiac and dove, then large amounts of bubbles would appear next to the boat.  One of them would slowly rise to the surface and then the other.  Our encounter with the Humpbacks lasted several hours.  I was able to capture their behavior on high resolution video.  Needless to say it was an exhilarating experience!

Keep your eyes open for the last of three broadcasts of "Live from Antarctica" on PBS on the 6th of February.  There may be some whale shots in that show.

<b>Message:</b><br> I know just how you feel about the whales and dolphins. 
We really have to work hard to help them. I will be moving
 to Hawaii in July. Does anyone know of how I can get involved
 with the research out there? I have experience working with
 the beluga whales at the New York Aquaium and would love to continue
 my research out there with the humpbacks or dolphins.
 Can you direct me in a direction where I might get soem help?
 Thanks! Jeanne

<b>Message:</b><br> <pre>The Dolphins Are In Danger Again! A hearing on the Dolphin
Death bill, S.1420 and H.R.2823, has been scheduled in the 
 House subcommittee on February 29, 1996. Please Call, Write 
 and Fax your Senators and Representative Today!!! Please urge
 them to Oppose S. 1420 and H.R. 2823, and to Support and 
 Co-sponsor the Boxer/Biden/Miller Dolphin Protection Act, 
 (S.1460 and H.R. 2856), which maintains existing dolphin 
 protections. 
 
 S.1420 and H.R.2823, if passed, would repeal the ban on 
 import and sale of dolphin-death tuna, and would even change
 the legal definition of "dolphin-safe" to allow chasing, 
 harassing and intentional setting of nets on dolphins, as 
 long as no dolphins were "observed" killed outright in the 
 nets. But many dolphins die in the mile long purse seine nets
 without being observed, and the new definition, designed to 
 fool consumers, invites cheating.
 
 TIME IS VERY SHORT! PLEASE CALL AND WRITE TODAY! Thank You!

 Without details, I am not certain to what the Coalition is referring
 here, but the Boxer/Biden/Miller bills do NOT maintain the status quo.
 This is a misrepresentation I have seen again and again and it's getting
 ridiculous to have to keep correcting it.  The Boxer/Biden/Miller bills
 allow the U.S. fleet to return to full participation in the IATTC
 dolphin conservation program (they once again will have a per-vessel
 Dolphin Mortality Limit and full rights and responsibilities under the
 IATTC program -- currently they are at a DML of zero, which they claim
 puts them at a competitive disadvantage with the foreign fleet).  And
 the Boxer/Biden/Miller bills will lift the nation-wide embargoes and
 allow dolphin-safe tuna to be imported from anywhere (currently both
 dolphin-safe and dolphin-unsafe tuna is embargoed from nations with any
 dolphin-unsafe fishers).  The Boxer/Biden/Miller bills also establish
 the 5000 dolphin mortality cap (to be ratcheted down over time) found in
 the Panama Declaration -- the current dolphin mortality cap under U.S.
 law is 0.  The Boxer/Biden/Miller bills represent compromise; the
 Stevens/Breaux/Gilchrest bills represent an unnecessary give-away.

 The author of this post shows a dismaying lack of understanding about
 species ecology when making this statement (another which I have seen
 made again and again, by various non-biologists).  Yes, there are about
 9.5 million dolphins in the ETP -- the combined total of several
 different stocks and species, of which about seven interact with the
 fishery.  The two most frequently set-upon stocks, the eastern spinner
 and northeastern offshore spotted, make up less than 1.5 million of this
 total and are severely depleted, to about 1/5 of their original
 estimated population abundances.  Their numbers have at best remained
 stable in the last five years, show signs of having continued to decline
 (even WITH the 95% reduction in mortality in those same five years), and
 most certainly have shown no signs whatsoever of recovery.  One obvious
 interpretation of this is that the continued harassment they have
 suffered in this time period through the chase and encirclement has
 affected their productivity.
 
 >Around the U.S., the Marine Mammal Protection Act allows fishermen an

 Takes of DEPLETED stocks are seriously restricted -- to allow the
 present level of take (harassment, injury, and death) of these two
 severely depleted stocks to continue unabated through passage of the
 Stevens/Breaux/Gilchrest bills sets a very disturbing precedent for the
 future implementation of the MMPA.

Thanks to a special limited-time offer from Microsoft, you can read the Web's leading source of business news at no charge until the end of December. And as a user of Microsoft's Internet Explorer, you'll also be able to take advantage of all the Interactive Edition's latest features and conveniences.<p>

This free subscription plan requires that you use Internet Explorer each time you access the Interactive Edition through Dec. 31, 1996. Use the most recent version of Internet Explorer available for your operating system. <b>Please Note: If you're running Windows 95, you must use Explorer 3.0; previous versions, including 3.0 beta versions, do not apply to this offer. </b> If you have questions, call Customer Service at 1-800-369-2834 or 609-514-0870, Monday-Friday, 8 a.m.-9 p.m. ET.<p>

<HR>
<p><b>If you have not yet subscribed to  the Interactive Edition...</b> 
<ul>
<li><b> And you're using Internet Explorer now,</b> just <A HREF="/regchoice.html"> subscribe </A> to the Interactive Edition today. Your subscription is free, courtesy of Microsoft, through Dec. 31, 1996.
</li>

<li><b> And you're not yet using Internet Explorer,</b> <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie">download</A> version 3.0 for Windows 95 (or other Internet Explorer version that works with your operating system) to qualify for this special offer. </li>
</UL>

</p>

<HR>
<p> <b> If you already subscribe to the Interactive Edition...</b>

<LI><b>If you gave us your credit card when you registered and you wish to take advantage of this offer</b>, you actually need to <A HREF="/user-cgi-bin/UserMenu.html">cancel</A> your subscription so you won't be billed; this won't, however, affect your User Name and Password and you will be able to access the Interactive Edition as long as you're online with Internet Explorer. If, however, you use a variety of browsers and wish to continue as a paid subscriber, don't cancel your subscription. If you're a subscriber who signed on prior to Aug. 1, 1996, just consider this special offer an extension of your free trial period; you will not be required to provide credit card information until Jan. 1, 1997.

1997. Analysts believe investors should expect lower inflation, lower

seen in the past two years.<br>

turned in shining performances, and few analysts are ready to bet against

didn't sneeze. But as usual, there were also plenty of light-hearted
moments.<br>

1996 as a microcosm of almost every possible IPO environment, a reckless
buying frenzy in the spring, a brutal correction in the summer and a
conservative environment of tough pricing in the fall.<br>

money-management arena in 1996: One was the emergence of huge firms,
another was a resurgence in the popularity of indexing, and the third was
the increasing importance of mutual funds.<br>

off fears that the federal government will impose a flat tax, and wipe out
the advantage of buying tax-exempt securities. But danger lurks around
every corner in the market.<br>

watching the stock market's glimmering performance, several commodities

1997, move fast. Nearly all analysts see the dollar continuing to climb
early on, only to fade as the year progresses. Where they differ is in the
timing and degree of the decline.<br>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions -- <br>
Special Offer from Microsoft Internet Explorer</h2>





<p><b>I don't have Windows 95. Can I still qualify for this special offer?</b> <br>



 Of course. This promotion started with Microsoft's launch of its new Internet Explorer 3.0 for Windows 95, which is the company's state-of-the-art Web browser software--and the version that allows you to use some great shortcuts and other navigational tools we've developed exclusively for use with Internet Explorer 3.0.  However, as long as you're using Internet Explorer, you can get the Interactive Edition free, courtesy of Microsoft, through the end of 1996. To locate the version you should download, visit Microsoft's Internet Explorer site at <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/ie"> http://www.microsoft.com/ie </A>. (Please note: If you are using Windows 95, you must use the commercial release version 3.0. Previous releases or beta versions of 3.0 don't qualify.) 



<p><b>How will you know if I'm using Internet Explorer and what happens if I'm not?</b> <br>



Our system will detect that you're using Internet Explorer and will authorize your access each time you sign on to the Interactive Edition. If you're using someone else's computer or another browser, you'll get a message reminding you that you must use Internet Explorer to take advantage of this special arrangement. If you wish to use multiple browsers between now and the end of the year, you should sign up as a standard, paid subscriber.</p>



<p><b>I already subscribe to the Interactive Edition but I don't use Internet Explorer. Once I download Explorer and begin using it, should I cancel my Interactive Edition subscription and re-register to qualify for this special offer?</b> <br>


No, not if you subscribed to the Interactive Edition prior to Aug. 1, 1996; we'll automatically make sure you get continued free access through Dec. 31, 1996. Please note: If you gave us your credit card number when you subscribed (which means you subscribed after Aug. 1, 1996), you'll need to actually cancel that subscription; don't worry, your existing User Name and Password will work for this special offer. The only difference: You won't be billed until Jan. 1, 1997! The first time you sign on using Internet Explorer, you'll get a message that includes a link to the cancellation page--and complete instructions for how to proceed--if you wish to take advantage of this offer.




<p><b>What happens when this special offer ends on Dec. 31, 1996?</b> <br>



You'll be given the chance to subscribe to the Interactive Edition directly. An annual subscription costs $49 or $29 if you subscribe to the print edition of the Journal.

<p>Cheers! The mutual-fund celebration is still going strong, with
investors basking in the glow of an average 19.5% return for diversified
U.S. stock funds in 1996. Added to the previous year's huge 31.1% return,
the nation's stock funds as a group now have delivered 56 cents in profit
for every dollar invested as 1995 began.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>"It was almost like coining money," says A. Michael Lipper, president of
Lipper Analytical Services Inc., a Summit, N.J., firm that tracks
mutual-fund performance. Little wonder that investors have poured record
sums into stock mutual funds in the past year, boosting the assets of all
mutual funds to $3.5 trillion, or five times the level of a decade ago.</p>
<p>The average bond fund gained a less festive 4.7% in 1996, according to
Lipper, trailing the 4.8% average yield on money-market funds sold to
individual investors, as estimated by IBC's Money Fund Report, of Ashland,
Mass.</p>
<p>The very exuberance of the stock-market gala worries many fund-industry
veterans. In particular, they fear that small investors are intoxicated
with their recent gains and are paying too little attention to the
potential hangover.</p>
<p>"People seem to have their foot to the accelerator looking for maximum
returns," says John Brennan, president of Vanguard Group. The Valley Forge,
Pa., concern the nation's second-largest mutual-fund company in terms of
assets, after Fidelity Investments. Although many investment professionals
are bracing for a stock-market tumble, he says, "I sense less nervousness
on the individual side."</p>
<p>Mutual-fund investors who participated in a just-released survey
commissioned by Montgomery Asset Management certainly are an optimistic
bunch. Interviewed in November, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average was
steaming ahead after crossing the 6000 milestone, one-third of the
respondents venturing a guess expected the industrials to end 1997 at 7000
or higher. In fact, 13% envisioned the 30-stock average at 7500 or more.
Only 5% predicted a tumble below 5000.</p>
<p>But some investment professionals believe this year's stock market will
be a rough one that forces revelers to sober up.</p>
<p>"I would be surprised if we get through another year without a 10%
decline somewhere in the year" in the prices of large U.S. stocks, says M.
David Testa, director of the stock division of T. Rowe Price Associates in
Baltimore. Frederick Taylor, chief investment officer of U.S. Trust in New
York, is counseling clients to expect what he calls "a bear market in time"
--- that is, not a precipitous market collapse, but possibly years of
anemic returns.</p>
<p>The biggest threat to fund investors isn't the obvious one of losing
money in a market meltdown, Mr. Lipper says. Rather, "it's them panicking
at the bottom and leaving the game." Like other investment professionals,
he notes that stocks have usually beaten other investment vehicles over
periods of 20 years or more. If a market swoon prompts some people to swear
off stock funds altogether, Mr. Lipper says, they could wind up with too
little money for retirement or other long-term goals.</p>
<p>The end of the calendar year, and the imminent arrival of year-end fund
statements in the mail, provide an opportune time for individual investors
to reflect on how well their fund portfolios might weather a downturn.
Although stock funds are the best choice for long-term investing, Mr.
Lipper recommends putting some money into super-safe money-market funds in
order to "strengthen intestinal fortitude" and make it easier to hang onto
stock funds during inevitable bear markets.</p>
<p>Investment advisers typically recommend that investors put some money
into bonds and international stocks, and some market watchers are
particularly bullish on those investment options right now. Mr. Brennan of
Vanguard predicts that bonds will give stocks "very tough competition" in
investment returns over the next five to 10 years. Carol McMullen, a senior
investment officer at Putnam Investments in Boston, says international
stock markets as a group "are well-positioned for good growth and not
overvalued."</p>
<p>U.S. Trust predicts that in 1997, both bonds and international stocks
will deliver higher returns than U.S. stocks, as measured by Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index. But getting investors to move dollars out of the
U.S. stock market can be tough, Mr. Taylor says. Clients remember that he
and many other market watchers were similarly cautious on the U.S. market a
year ago. After a second bang-up year for U.S. stocks, he says, "it's a
little harder to lower client expectations."</p>
<p>The huge run-up in the U.S. stock market has brought warm and fuzzy
feelings to legions of mutual-fund investors. And the Montgomery Asset
Management survey suggests that most of them aren't focusing on a
performance yardstick that consumes fund managers, namely the ability of
funds to keep up with closely watched market benchmarks such as the S&amp;P
500 and the Dow Jones industrials.</p>
<p>Asked how their fund holdings have performed relative to "the stock
market in general," 53% of the investors surveyed asserted that their funds
had performed "in line with" the market, and 37% said they had done better.
A mere 10% said that their fund holdings had done worse than the
market.</p>
<p>Dream on. The reality is that in 1996, as in 1995, the majority of stock
funds lagged behind both the S&amp;P and the Dow Jones average, two
benchmarks that investors tend to think of as "the market." Only 25% of
diversified U.S. stock funds beat the S&amp;P 500 in 1996, according to
Lipper. The figure in 1995 was an even lower 16%. The average 19.5% return
posted by diversified U.S. stock funds for 1996 trailed a 22.96% advance in
the S&amp;P and an even racier 28.71% surge in the Dow Jones industrials.
(All of these Lipper figures are total returns, encompassing both the
impact of fund share-price changes and the reinvestment of dividends.)</p>
<p>Does this mean that investors ought to start 1997 by ditching "actively
managed" funds in favor of "index" funds that simply buy and hold the
stocks making up a benchmark such as the S&amp;P 500? Not so fast.</p>
<p>The S&amp;P 500 and related index funds "will not outperform
continually," declares Mr. Brennan of Vanguard, whose Vanguard Index Trust
500 Portfolio is the third-largest stock fund. A crucial reason that so
many funds have trailed the S&amp;P 500 benchmark is simply corporate size:
The largest companies have recently been the best performers in the stock
market and those stocks make up the S&amp;P 500 and Dow benchmarks. By
contrast, most actively managed stock funds hold a mix of large and smaller
stock issues.</p>
<p>Investment professionals are more divided than usual on whether smaller
stocks or large ones will do better this year.</p>
<p>The pros certainly got mixed signals in the fourth quarter, when returns
on various stock-fund categories were all over the lot. It was a robust
quarter overall, with the average diversified stock fund gaining just under
5%, according to Lipper. Funds specializing in shares of small and
medium-size companies, on average, were up less than half as much.</p>
<p>But within those small and midsize stock-fund categories, there were
some sharp differences depending on whether funds buy fast-growing
high-priced "growth" stocks or out-of-favor "value" issues. According to
fund researchers at Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, the average small-company
growth fund actually lost 1.8% for investors in the three months through
December. Midcap growth funds were up less than 1%. Funds in those two
groups ended up as "weaklings" after being the top-performing "glamour
funds" of 1995 and early 1996, says Morningstar's publisher, John
Rekenthaler.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, small value funds and midcap value funds, which had been left
in the dust in 1995 and early 1996, were among the fourth quarter's best
performers, returning 7.5% and 8.4%, respectively.</p>
<p>Mr. Rekenthaler believes this year's market, like that of the fourth
quarter, will favor smaller value funds over smaller growth. The value
funds hold stocks that are still reasonably priced, he says, and they might
actually beat the S&amp;P 500 if the stock market continues edging up. Some
funds he likes: Skyline Special Equities Fund, Fidelity Low-Priced Stock
Fund, T. Rowe Price Over-the-Counter Securities Fund and the small,
little-known Schroder U.S. Smaller Companies Fund.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Morningstar publisher worries that smaller growth funds,
particularly those holding stocks trading at 30 or more times company
earnings, will get creamed in any downturn. Lots of investors rushed into
these funds in 1995 and 1996, he says, and stock-price declines will be
exacerbated if those investors start barreling out. He is leery of selected
funds from the Aim, Alger, American Century (Twentieth Century), PBHG and
Van Wagoner fund groups.</p>
<p>Besides holding a mix of large-stock and small-stock funds, investors
may want to direct a small portion of their stock-investment dollars into
funds that buy specific types of stocks. For instance, Mr. Rekenthaler is
keen on utility-stock funds, which he figures are due for a rebound after
years of weak performance and investor withdrawals.</p>
<p>Ronald Roge, a financial adviser in Centereach, N.Y., suggests clients
keep a slug of money parked in natural-resources funds and real-estate
funds. Those investments sometimes zig when the market zags, he explains,
which "helps us control some of the volatility in the portfolio."</p>
<p>Those two categories actually turned out to be top performers in 1996,
and particularly the fourth quarter: Real-estate funds rose a steep 15.9%
in the quarter, according to Lipper, bringing them to a 30.8% return for
the year. The top 11 funds for the quarter were real-estate funds, led by
CGM Realty Fund, up almost 22%. Occupancy rates and rents have been rising,
and the high yields on many real-estate stocks make them attractive to
cautious investors. Natural-resources funds, which hold energy and metals
stocks, returned 8.9% in the quarter and 32.7% for the full year.</p>
<p>Mr. Roge uses T. Rowe Price New Era Fund for natural-resources exposure,
and for real estate, he favors Cohen &amp; Steers Realty Shares and
Fidelity Real Estate Investment Portfolio.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">The $100 Billion Fund Question:<br>
What's the Right Level of Cash?</h2>

<p><b>By R<font size="-1">OBERT</font> M<font size="-1">C</font>G<font size="-1">OUGH</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>It is the $100 billion question in the mutual-fund industry: With stock
funds' sliver of cash at such a low percentage, should everybody be
scared?</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>This is a figure that industry veterans watch like hawks. The cash
holdings of stock funds at last count, at the end of November, stood at a
stingy 5.8%, down from as much as 13% in 1990. In the eyes of some people,
it all adds up to a world where money managers have become too bullish,
investing hand-over-fist and leaving their wallets too skinny to keep the
stock-market boom going.</p>
<p>But there are reasons to look at the cash statistic a bit more closely.
One is that the small percentage of assets stock funds have parked in cash
nonetheless represents $100 billion -- or a healthy 5.7 days' trading on
the New York Stock Exchange. In January 1992, stock funds held a more
comfortable-sounding 7.2% of their assets in cash -- but that sum was
equivalent to only 3.4 days' trading on the Big Board.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is that there have been long stretches of time when cash
levels at stock funds have been even lower than they are now -- and stocks
did fine.</p>
<p>In January 1955, the managers of mutual funds had cut their cash
holdings to a bare-bones 4.9% of assets. But that year, stocks had total
returns (including dividends) of 31.6%, according to Ibbotson Associates of
Chicago.</p>
<p>In fact, from the mid-1950s, when cash holdings of funds were first
compiled, through the early 1960s, cash regularly made up only 4.5% to 7%
of the portfolios of stock funds. And that period was largely wonderful for
the stock market.</p>
<p>Alas, no single indicator will tell investors whether stocks have topped
out or are poised instead to hit even more new highs. So this is a good
time for investors to have a little humility, and to remember the wisdom of
diversification.</p>
<p>Different asset classes -- U.S. stocks, foreign stocks, bonds and cash
-- will perform differently over time, helping to even out the swings in a
portfolio's value.</p>
<p>Nowadays, analysts are paying especially close attention to cash levels
of funds because mutual funds have become behemoths in the stock market.
Mutual funds now account for the equivalent of more than 48% of the trading
on the New York Stock Exchange, according to Birinyi Associates, in
Greenwich, Conn. That is up from 10% in 1980.</p>
<p>Many investors are familiar with the idea that the sums of money pouring
into stock funds -- a record $210 billion in the first 11 months of 1996 --
has helped fuel the rally in stocks the past couple of years. Less widely
noted is the possibility that funds might one day have to sell stocks to
pay off departing investors, an action that could accelerate any
stock-price dive.</p>
<p>"At some point you're going to have a down market," says Melissa Brown,
director of quantitative analysis at Prudential Securities, in New York.
"I'm concerned about what investors are going to do with their assets."</p>
<p>The worry is about whether fund investors cut and run. "As long as money
continues to come into funds, the low cash levels are not a problem," Ms.
Brown says. "Where it becomes a problem is if for one reason or another,
people decide to slow down their investments or to shift their money out of
stock funds. Then you've got an issue of low liquidity and selling. You
could possibly run into the problem of managers having to sell stocks just
to meet redemptions."</p>
<p>That's the theory. But has it worked out that way in the past?</p>
<p>Ms. Brown points out that stock funds held less than 5.5% of their
portfolios in cash in 1972 and 1973, two of the bleakest years on record
for the stock market. But stock funds also had less than 5.5% of their
portfolios in cash in 1971, which wasn't such a bad year.</p>
<p>And what about those low levels of cash in the latter half of the
buoyant 1950s stock market? "The major difference between then and now is
stocks probably [on average sold] at eight times earnings in the 50s," Ms.
Brown says. Nowadays, they sell at 21 times trailing earnings. "So you were
probably dealing with a market that was a lot less risky."</p>
<p>Cash holdings may give some indication of money-manager sentiment. But
they are part of a much larger equation. Low levels of cash in a cheap
stock market may suggest less risk than higher levels of cash in a pricey
one.</p>
<p>Analyst Laszlo Birinyi, founder of Birinyi Associates, isn't worried at
all about low levels of cash in the average fund. He takes comfort in what
he calls the "buying power" of stock-fund cash.</p>
<p>As discussed above, stock funds had more than $100 billion in cash at
last count, or the equivalent of 5.7 days' trading on the Big Board. That's
plenty of fuel for the stock market, Mr. Birinyi says. This buying-power
indicator was at about the current level back in February and March of
1996. Though technology stocks subsequently hit a rough patch, the broader
market averages are up nearly 20% since March 1.</p>
<p>The highest his indicator has reached was 9.1 days of buying power, in
July 1994, and it was also at about nine days in August 1996. Shortly after
that, stocks took off. Because of the growth of mutual funds and their huge
influence on the stock market, Mr. Birinyi says, "the marketplace is
changing," and he says his buying-power indicator better reflects that
change.</p>
<p>The lowest this indicator showed was 1.4 days of trading power in
October 1982. Did this presage a bad market? Not really: The stock market
had begun what would become a huge bull market, and managers were busy
buying stocks. Mr. Birinyi thinks his indicator has been more predictive in
recent years, since mutual funds grew in importance to the market.</p>
<p>No doubt, one day the stock market will take a tumble. And if it occurs
while stock funds have only light holdings of cash, fund managers may be
forced to sell stocks to pay off departing shareholders -- worsening the
decline.</p>
<p>But are stock-fund cash measures "predictive"? That's something we'll
only know in retrospect.</p>

<p>Got a hunch? Bet a bunch.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The victors in the latest mutual-fund performance race followed similar
stock-picking strategies: fattening up on favorites instead of spreading
their risks. Such high-wire gambits pay off, of course, when the manager
concentrates on the right names. Choose the wrong ones, and returns
collapse.</p>
<p>The top fund last year was State Street Research Global Resources,
managed by Daniel J. Rice. He piled as much as 40% of the portfolio's
assets in oil-service companies, even though the market capitalization of
that sector makes up only 8% of the energy industry. Both the five-year
winner, Fidelity Select Electronics Portfolio, and the 10-year champion,
Seligman Communications &amp; Information fund, poured as much as 45% and
30% of their assets, respectively, into their top 10 holdings last year.
Stock funds on average invest about 25% of their portfolios in their top
picks.</p>
<p>The three funds' performances underscore that conviction and steely
nerves are required to land a manager at the top of the fund heap.</p>
<p>"A lot of managers have big mood swings on technology and get disgusted
with the sector," says Paul Wick of Seligman Communications &amp;
Information. "But I've always been an optimist."</p>
<p><b>ONE-YEAR WINNER:</b> The five-year high
that oil prices reached in 1996 helped power the Class A shares of State
Street Global Resources to a 70.25% return last year. Oil-exploration
companies benefited, but Mr. Rice's beloved oil-service companies did even
better. Two of Mr. Rice's best picks were
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=atwd&amp;page=15">Atwood Oceanics</a>, which surged
152%, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=esv&amp;page=15">Ensco
International</a>, which rose 111%. Consolidation in the oil patch
also buoyed Global Resource's gains; four of its top 10 holdings, including
Ensco, were acquired by other companies.</p>
<p>Mr. Rice shuns big issues such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=xon&amp;page=15">Exxon</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mob&amp;page=15">Mobil</a> and prefers relatively obscure
companies with strong cash flow. His current favorites include
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nev&amp;page=15">Nuevo Energy</a>,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sgo&amp;page=15">Seagull Energy</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ne m&amp;page=15">Noble Drilling</a>.</p>
<p>"We want to get into ponds that not too many people fish in," he says.
"We try not to live off the Street." Mr. Rice manages $1 billion in assets
at State Street Research &amp; Management (which is a subsidiary of
Metropolitan Life Insurance, but not affiliated with State Street Bank).
Most of that money is institutional. His State Street Research Global
Resources fund had $121 million in assets as of Dec. 31.</p>
<p><b>FIVE-YEAR WINNER:</b> Fidelity Select
Electronics, whose five-year returns were 373.78%, had four managers during
the period. But its continued strong returns are testimony to Fidelity's
deep bench.</p>
<p>The $1.4 billion fund's current captain, Andrew Kaplan, 33 years old,
took over in August. Mr. Kaplan, noting that the price of computer memory
chips was dropping when he took over, bought personal-computer makers such
as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dell&amp;page=15">Dell
Computer</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cpq&amp;page=15">Compaq Computer</a>,
and disk-drive maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=seg&amp;page=15">Seagate
Technology</a>. He also bought analog-circuit maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mxim&amp;page=15">Maxim Integrated Products</a>.</p>
<p>Shareholders in the fund got a total return of nearly 42% in 1996.</p>
<p>When he joined Fidelity in 1995, Mr. Kaplan was a semiconductor analyst,
and he says his job differs little now that he is managing a so-called
sector fund. At Fidelity, sector-fund managers, like analysts, are
responsible for recommending companies to managers of the company's mammoth
diversified funds, and Mr. Kaplan judges his performance on his ability to
convince those managers to buy the stocks he touts.</p>
<p>Mr. Kaplan remains "pretty bullish" on PCs. But he says last year's
overlooked semiconductor segments, such as communications and analog-device
concerns, will be particularly strong.</p>
<p><b>10-YEAR WINNER:</b> This was not an easy
year for Mr. Wick, a 33-year-old manager whose Seligman Communications
&amp; Information fund has gained 693.51% over 10 years. (Mr. Wick has run
the fund since 1990.) In March, his assistant left. Mr. Wick then spent
time helping his firm open a new office in Palo Alto, Calif. Most
importantly, the semiconductor industry stumbled in the first half of the
year, causing Mr. Wick's fund to fall 16% in the seven months through July.
The fund recovered to end the year up nearly 12%.</p>
<p>In the second half, Mr. Wick invested heavily in PC makers Dell, Compaq,
and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=gate&amp;page=15">Gateway
2000</a>, as well as hardware and peripheral companies such as
Seagate.</p>
<p>Mr. Wick says he expects consistent, high returns to continue as
technology permeates more parts of society. He sees continued strength in
the PC market, but his large positions in
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=stk&amp;page=15">Storage Technology</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=csco&amp;page=15">Cisco Systems</a> reflect his view that storage and
data-networking companies will perform well this year.</p>
<p>Mr. Wick says his job has gotten tougher: Assets in the fund's Class A
shares have surged to $2.5 billion, from $307 million in 1994. "Size
definitely affects performance, and anyone who tells you differently is
kidding himself," he says. He cannot move in and out of stocks as quickly
as he once could, and he needs to find companies with large enough market
capitalizations -- say, over $5 billion -- to really make a dent in his
portfolio.</p>
<p>Should investors take their money to smaller funds?</p>
<p>Of course not, Mr. Wick says: "We have the infrastructure in place to
better accommodate size."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Managers Stick With Stocks<br>
Despite an Uncertain Outlook</h2>

<p><b>By J<font size="-1">OHN</font> R. D<font size="-1">ORFMAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>For two years, the U.S. stock market has soared like an eagle. In 1997,
the managers of some of the nation's largest mutual funds expect it to look
more like a turkey.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Nevertheless, these managers are not taking defensive steps, such as
raising cash or increasing their holdings of foreign stocks. Instead, they
are pretty much sticking to their normal investment blends. To an extent,
the managers are responding to public demand. For the past two years, the
U.S. stock market has been a great place to be, with the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rising more than 33% in 1995 and 26% in 1996. Managers
worry that they will suffer the same fate as Jeff Vinik, the manager of
Fidelity Magellan Fund, who departed Fidelity after falling behind the
market because he had lightened up on stocks.</p>
<p>Still, fund managers say they aren't sticking to their investment blends
-- their heavy allocation of money into U.S. stocks instead of cash, bonds
or foreign securities -- because they are being bullied into it. Rather,
they say, they are adhering to their investment philosophies. Besides,
experience has taught them that no one can predict the markets ... not even
themselves.</p>
<p>Here's a look at what managers of three of the country's largest funds
are doing with their portfolios now.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Fidelity Growth &amp; Income Fund</b></p>
<p>Steven M. Kaye, manager of Fidelity Growth &amp; Income Fund in Boston,
thinks the fountain of gains that has spurted for the past two years will
slow to a trickle. He believes the Dow Jones Industrial Average will end
1997 "within a range of plus or minus 10%" from its starting point of
6448.27.</p>
<p>"The stock market is at 21 times trailing earnings," an unusually high
level, he says. "The rate environment is favorable, but it will be a tough
year... . I don't see a recession punishing the market. But to expect
anything near the past two years is not reasonable."</p>
<p>If the U.S. market looks uninspiring, what about foreign stocks? Mr.
Kaye says he has his normal quota of 5% to 10% of the portfolio abroad.
"The story [on a foreign stock] has to be that much better [than on a
domestic one] to compensate for the currency risk," he says. In his view,
the economy in Japan "is getting worse," while Europe is "not that
strong."</p>
<p>Fidelity Growth &amp; Income is the nation's fifth-largest stock fund
with some $24 billion in assets. In 1996, it underperformed Standard &amp;
Poor's 500-stock index, with a 20% return, compared with nearly 23% for the
index, assuming reinvestment of dividends. Mr. Kaye blames that on his
reluctance to buy such high-flying stocks as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ko&amp;page=15">Coca-Cola</a> and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=msft&amp;page=15">Microsoft</a>. But he has no intention of
buying them now, saying "there doesn't appear to be any room for error in
the stocks."</p>
<p>Mr. Kaye's favorite group at the moment is drug stocks. "A few years ago
they were value stocks. Today they're momentum stocks," he says. "New
products are being approved rather quickly. And unit growth is as good as
I've ever seen it." As of the fund's latest report,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bmy&amp;page=15">Bristol-Myers Squibb</a> was his largest
holding in the group.</p>
<p>He also likes defense and aerospace, "a consolidating industry with very
favorable cash flow." His biggest holding in the group recently was
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lmt&amp;page=15">Lockheed Martin</a>, "a boring name that nobody would think
of," but which "has quietly doubled in about the last three years."</p>
<p>Mr. Kaye is going light on cyclical stocks because he is "concerned
about corporate earnings." He also is wary of bank stocks. "The market
seems to think there will never be another credit cycle," he says, "but
history has a tendency to repeat itself."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Vanguard/Windsor Fund</b></p>
<p>"If I got paid for my stock-market prognostications, I'd be out of
here," says Charles Freeman, who has just completed his first year running
the Vanguard/Windsor Fund after taking it over from investment legend John
Neff.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman says he had predicted a flat market in 1996. Luckily, he
didn't invest on that premise, and enjoyed a good year with a 26.4% return,
more than three percentage points above the S&amp;P 500.</p>
<p>The fund, based in Valley Forge, Pa., has close to $17 billion in
assets, making it the nation's ninth largest. It is closed to new
investors.</p>
<p>A belief that it's unwise to try to time the markets is one of the few
factors separating his style from that of his predecessor, Mr. Freeman
says. Mr. Neff used to raise cash when he thought the stock market was
about to hit the rocks. The cash level was 20% when Mr. Freeman took over
last January, but he has been gradually working it down. "We will run fully
invested," he declares. Though he won't act on his hunch, Mr. Freeman
guesses that 1997 will be "flat at best." He thinks the overall stock
market is 10% to 15% overvalued, though he believes his own portfolio of
bargain-priced stocks is actually undervalued.</p>
<p>Mr. Freeman has only about 6% of his portfolio in foreign issues. "At
the margin, our foreign exposure is increasing," he says. But he buys
foreign stocks only when they provide "a cheaper alternative to domestic
issues," as with
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=rpr&amp;page=15">Rhone Poulenc</a>,
the French drug manufacturer.</p>
<p>One of his recent purchases is
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a>, accumulated over a
period of three months. As Mr. Neff frequently did, Mr. Freeman bought
heavily when bad news depressed the stock -- first when the company
announced that third-quarter profit would be disappointing, and then when
the stock dipped in reaction to the naming of John R. Walter as chief
executive. Mr. Freeman also is a strong proponent of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=c&amp;page=15">Chrysler</a> shares, recently at a dirt-cheap
six times earnings. Most investors view the auto companies' recent earnings
as unsustainable, but Mr. Freeman figures Chrysler could astound the
critics by earning $3 a share in a recession, rather than losing money as
most expect.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>New Perspective Fund</b></p>
<p>Here is one fund that has two-thirds of its assets outside the U.S., but
not because it has a bearish outlook on the U.S. market. As a global fund,
it always diversifies its holdings among many nations.</p>
<p>With close to $13 billion in assets, New Perspective is the 18th-largest
fund in the country. It is part of the American Funds family, run by
Capital Research &amp; Management in Los Angeles. Gina Despres, the fund's
president, says it has about 35% of its assets in North American stocks,
10% in Asia and 40% in Europe. The other 15% is in cash.</p>
<p>Those percentages change only mildly from year to year, Ms. Despres
says. The fund has extremely low turnover -- only 18% in 1996, for example.
The country allocation isn't planned, she says; it is a byproduct of stock
selection. Recently, New Perspective's five biggest stockholdings were
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=a&amp;page=15">Astra</a>,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mo&amp;page=15">Philip Morris</a>,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mnnsy&amp;page=15">Mannesmann</a>,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=abbby&amp;page=15">ABB</a> (formerly
Brown Boveri) and Ciba-Geigy. All are multinationals, as are virtually all
the fund's holdings.</p>
<p>Capital Research uses a multimanager system. For example, the New
Perspective Fund is sliced into six pieces, five of them run by five
different portfolio managers and the sixth by a team of research analysts.
The managers consult regularly with one another, but make decisions
independently. In recent years, New Perspective has lagged behind the
S&amp;P 500, which gauges the U.S. market, but has beaten the Morgan
Stanley world index. The fund returned 17.3% last year.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Bond Funds May Beat Stocks,<br>
But Will They Have Investors?</h2>

<p><b>By G<font size="-1">REGORY</font> Z<font size="-1">UCKERMAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>This may be the year that bond funds finally beat stock funds. But will
there be many investors in bond funds to celebrate?</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>That's the question on the lips of bond-fund managers following a
lackluster 1996. Money flowed out of almost every type of bond fund.
Instead, investors flocked to stocks, where they captured double-digit
gains.</p>
<p>Now bonds are due for their day in the sun, says a confident Bill
Dawson, chief investment officer of mutual-fund company Federated Research.
"Stocks will have a tough time beating bonds this year."</p>
<p>But few fund investors are flocking to the party. A mere $10.30 billion
moved into bond funds in the 11 months through Nov. 30, according to the
Investment Company Institute, a Washington, D.C., trade group for mutual
funds. That pales in comparison with stock funds, which took in $210
billion.</p>
<p>Moreover, the inflow into bond funds was spotty. Cash bled out of bond
funds during four of the final six months through Nov. 30. And if you
exclude high-yield bonds, which many view as stock-bond hybrids that have
more of the attributes of stocks than bonds, fund investors actually
withdrew money from bond funds over the year.</p>
<p>That outflow trend likely won't be reversed in a hurry.</p>
<p>"It will take a while for potentially mediocre results of the stock
market to work their way into bond-fund sales," says Bill Gross, who
manages $81 billion at Pacific Investment Management. "The second half of
the year would be a more logical entry point" for any resurgence of
interest.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>A Rebound From Two Grim Years</b></p>
<p>That bond funds got any money at all last year was an improvement. In
1995, bond funds had outflows of $4.81 billion, while investors pulled out
more than $43 billion during the bruising bond market of 1994, according to
ICI.</p>
<p>There are good reasons for the flight from bonds. Obviously, a raging
bull market for stocks is drawing investors of all stripes, including the
formerly conservative types who were once bond aficionados. Bonds proved so
unpopular in 1996 that well-respected stock-fund managers, including
Fidelity Investments' Jeffrey Vinik, were criticized for incorporating too
many bonds into their portfolios.</p>
<p>"It was a tough, tough year," admits Jerry Paul, who manages $3 billion
in bonds for Invesco Trust. "Interest rates went up, and you didn't earn
your coupon, although it wasn't as bad as '94, when everything was
down."</p>
<p>The average corporate-bond fund recorded a total return of under 4% as
of Dec. 26, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc. Funds focusing on
bonds with top credit ratings netted under 3%. Long-term Treasury-bond
funds yielded a paltry 0.77% in total returns, which include price changes
as well as reinvested dividends, while short-term Treasury funds returned
just under 4%.</p>
<p>Funds that took on more credit risk led the pack in 1996, with the
average high-yield, or "junk" bond fund sporting a return of more than 13%,
according to Lipper. The impressive returns led to consistently strong
purchases by investors, which helped lead the junk-bond market still
higher. Further, over $30 billion of bonds got their credit ratings boosted
due to takeover activity, while others were retired at premiums.</p>
<p>"A lot of people had anticipated defaults increasing [in 1996], but
we're ending with less than 1% defaults," says Thomas Ole Dial, who manages
$1 billion of high-yield assets for Northstar Investment Management.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Huge Emerging-Markets Returns</b></p>
<p>While junk-bond funds had an excellent year, they paled in comparison
with funds investing in the raging emerging-markets arena. Emerging-market
bond funds scored a heady 40.7% return, according to Lipper, as bonds from
Russia, Ecuador and Poland gave fund managers much to cheer about.</p>
<p>In fact, these assets were among the few that surpassed the gains in
U.S. stocks. So-called total return bond-fund managers, who have more
flexibility in which bonds to choose, got a boost from adding these bonds
to their portfolios.</p>
<p>"The returns were phenomenal relative to the broader bond world," says
an exuberant Mark Siegel, the head of emerging-markets fixed-income
investments at Putnam Investment Management. "There were positive credit
developments almost everywhere in the emerging markets as most countries
are moving in their own way toward Western economic philosophy."</p>
<p>Still, outside the few growth areas, bond investors could only watch
with dismay as their funds crawled while stock funds soared. The insipid
performance has only added ammunition to the argument of many investors
that bond funds, especially those that invest in government securities,
should be avoided.</p>
<p>In addition, many financial planners decry the high fees charged by many
funds.</p>
<p>While investors often turn to bonds to avoid the risks of stocks, funds
investing in bonds with long maturities have been quite risky themselves in
recent years. Still, some financial planners argue that shorter-term bonds
are a logical avenue for investors skittish of a stock market still near
its all-time highs. If interest rates remain stable, and steady economic
growth persists, bond funds could very well turn in a respectable
performance.</p>
<p>"It'll probably be a year of roughly earning your coupon, 6.5% on the
long bond and higher in high-yield, as interest rates remain relatively
benign and few recessionary concerns arise," Mr. Paul of Invesco says.</p>
<p>Bonds are just plain due for a good year, Mr. Dawson of Federated
Research says: "All the members of the capital markets have had their days
in the sun, so it's logical that bonds are next in the queue."</p>
<p>High-yield bond funds should continue to do well, as managers remain
relatively disciplined, unless the economy slows significantly.</p>
<p>"A stable economy is the perfect environment for securities with
additional yield, like high-yield bonds," Northstar's Mr. Dial says.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">It Pays to Comparison-Shop<br>
When Selecting an Annuity</h2>

<p><b>By E<font size="-1">LLEN</font> E. S<font size="-1">CHULTZ</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>So, how does your variable annuity stack up?</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Whether you're thinking of buying a variable annuity, or already have
one in your portfolio or in a 403(b) or other retirement plan, here's a way
to size it up. (The 403(b) plans, common among teachers, frequently hold
variable annuities.)</p>
<p>Variable annuities are essentially tax-sheltered minisupermarkets of
mutual funds. When you put money into a variable annuity, you can allocate
it among a variety of funds, typically from a number of fund companies.</p>
<p>Sold by insurance companies, brokerage firms, mutual-fund companies and
banks, variable annuities are virtually identical to nondeductible
individual retirement accounts. Earnings are tax-deferred until taken out,
when they are taxed as regular income, plus a 10% penalty on earnings if
you're under age 59 1/2 .</p>
<p>It pays to comparison-shop. Variable-annuity providers have been beefing
up the number of funds offered in their products, but they don't always
choose the funds with an eye to quality. So it's up to you to evaluate the
funds.</p>
<p>It's also a good idea to compare fees. As the number of funds grow
within variable annuities, what distinguishes one product from another is
often cost.</p>
<p>In making an evaluation, look at the funds available in the annuities
you are considering. The way to put a fund's performance into context is to
compare it with the average performance for its fund type. For instance, if
the fund is a "growth" fund, compare it with the average performance for
growth funds. These are
<a class="external" href="/public/resources/documents/q-46anew.htm">listed here</a>. If you aren't sure what category the fund is in, check your
prospectus or call the annuity company. Don't look only at a single
quarter. Compare performance over five years.</p>
<p>Performance is shown after all expenses have been deducted. The returns
are "average annual" total returns, which mean that if you held the fund
for, say, five years, the return you receive would have averaged out to the
amount shown for each year, with dividends reinvested.</p>
<p>You can also compare the expenses of one variable annuity with another.
An annuity's surrender charge, for instance, is typically 7% in year one,
declining to zero over seven years or so. A few annuities have no surrender
charges, while some have stiff charges that start at 8% or more and stay
high for years. If you're not sure that you'll stay in the annuity for
years, pay close attention to the surrender charges. Annuities with high
surrender charges pay the highest commissions to brokers and insurance
agents.</p>
<p>The second expense to compare is the insurance-company expense. The
average is 1.27% annually, although most newer annuities charge 1.40% a
year. The least expensive is Vanguard, at 0.48%. This annual expense will
be applied to all your assets each year, reducing your returns. The expense
erases the advantage of the tax-deferral for a number of years, so that's
another reason to invest only for the long term.</p>
<p>Finally, compare the expenses on the individual funds within the
annuity. If you're looking at a growth fund, for instance, compare its
annual expense with the average for its category.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Administrative Fees May Hurt<br>
Returns of Closed-End Funds</h2>

<p><b>By A<font size="-1">LEJANDRO</font> B<font size="-1">ODIPO</font>-M<font size="-1">EMBA</font>

<b></b></p>
<p>Once popular, closed-end funds have lost much of their allure in recent
years, overshadowed by the dazzling performance in the stock market of the
more common open-end mutual funds.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/mfq4-96.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/MFQ-la.gif" height="66" width="160" alt="Logo for Special Report A - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>And now a fast-multiplying thicket of annual "administrative" fees
attached to many closed-end funds threatens to keeping them down in the
dumps, some industry veterans say.</p>
<p>A closed-end fund invests in an array of stocks, bonds or both. It then
issues a fixed number of shares that trade publicly on an exchange.</p>
<p>The number of new closed-end fund offerings has been falling steadily
since 1993. Investors have been wary of such vehicles, which often trade at
a lower price than the per-share value of the portfolio, at a time when
open-end mutual funds have been benefiting from a long bull market in
stocks. There were only five initial public offerings of closed-end stock
funds in 1996.</p>
<p>Another reason for the closed-ends' malaise, analysts say, may be the
aggressiveness of Wall Street underwriters in seeking continuing streams of
annual fees from such offerings. Some fund companies and their managers
complain that the underwriting firms have sought to maximize revenue from
closed-end funds by seeking, in addition to underwriting fees, long-term
contracts to collect fees for "additional administrative services."</p>
<p>The trend effectively locks the fund companies out of potential income,
estimated to be in the millions of dollars in annual fees. The situation is
hardly an incentive for fund companies to launch a lot of new closed-end
funds.</p>
<p>"My guess is that the underwriters got greedy," says Thomas J. Herzfeld,
president of a Miami investment advisory firm bearing his name, which
specializes in closed-end funds. "In most cases, with administrative fees,
the [underwriter] is getting a pretty fat fee for the services they
provide."</p>
<p>Unlike open-end funds, closed-ends can and often do trade at a discount
from their net asset values, or NAVs. The investor thus can't cash out at
the NAV, as an open-end investor can do, but instead must rely instead on
the vagaries of the stock market to set the share price.</p>
<p>A big segment of the closed-end fund realm is made up of foreign funds.
Often, these are single-country stock funds that invest in securities
traded on exchanges of individual foreign countries. The single-country
funds typically are marketed as speculative vehicles, or as ways to
diversify portfolios.</p>
<p>Brokers who sell closed-end funds tend to lose interest in promoting
them after the initial offering period, when the underwriters collect
upfront sales commissions that often amount to 7% out of the investor's
pocket. This commission has been a perennial drag for investors, who can
dodge it by skipping the initial offering and not buying shares until after
a closed-end fund has begun trading.</p>
<p>Starting a few years ago, a number of fund companies that manage
closed-end funds began griping about the annual administrative fees
underwriters wanted to tack on. Securities experts and regulators describe
these fees as reflective of a trend: Big Wall Street brokerage firms have
increasing power to command new fees because they control so many outlets
where the securities are sold.</p>
<p>The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has looked into the issue of
closed-end administrative fees, people familiar with the matter say. But
the SEC came to the conclusion that, in most cases, the fees don't violate
any laws.</p>
<p>"There were several complaints that underwriters wanted to enter into
separate contracts with the issuing fund company to provide administrative
services for a fee," says Kathryn McGrath, a former director of the SEC
division that regulates mutual funds. "It's a difficult case to make, and
the SEC wasn't able to get any proof" that such fees amounted to a
violation, she says.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, closed-end fund managers continue to gnash their teeth
about fees paid to underwriters for ill-defined administrative services.
The administrative fees in question, usually about 0.20% to 0.25% a year,
look relatively small on a per-investor basis but can become substantial
when applied to all shares outstanding of the fund.</p>

<p>Get ready for less of the same in 1997.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Lower inflation, lower corporate earnings, and much smaller gains in
stock prices than seen in the past two years, will be the hallmarks of
1997, many stock analysts believe.</p>
<p>The only things investors will see more of, analysts agree, are
nervousness and volatility. Still, most argue there's little reason to fear
a stock-market meltdown, even though some caution investors that
corrections of 10% or more could buffet stock prices over the course of the
new year -- the bull market's seventh.</p>
<img border="0" src="/public/current/media/SB852175568324801000.gif" align="LEFT" hspace="4" alt="[[Market Boxscores]]" height="165" width="220">
<p>"We've taken the market to a level where the factors that drove it up,
like a perfect economy, need to stay in place to keep valuations where they
are," says Jim Craig, who runs the $16 billion Janus Fund. "At these
valuations, it's obvious that we're in a higher-risk environment."</p>
<p>Investors like Mr. Craig are still struggling to catch their breath
after the stock market's astonishing ascent in 1996. Little seemed able to
rattle the six-year-old bull market for long: Even a 7% plunge in two weeks
in July, attributed to corporate-earnings disappointments and fears that a
stronger economy might lead to higher interest rates, was reversed within
months. By early October, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had stampeded
above 6000, and set a string of new records throughout November,
culminating in its high for the year of 6547.79, set Nov. 25.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Soaring Volume</b></p>
<p>Despite a 101-point drop on the last day of trading, the Dow gained 26%
in 1996. While lagging behind the remarkable 33.5% return posted in 1995,
that still far outstripped most analysts' original expectations of a 10%
return on stocks for 1996. Trading volume soared: The average number of
shares changing hands daily on the New York Stock Exchange alone hit a
record 412 million shares, compared with the previous record of 346.1
million in 1995.</p>
<p>Throughout the year, bears beat a steady retreat to the sidelines to
lick their wounds, professing themselves bewildered by the market's gains
and its ability to shrug off potentially devastating shocks. Among them:
rapid gains in the number of people finding new jobs and an upward surge in
average hourly earnings, which in March and again in July, triggered sharp
but short-lasting stock-market sell-offs.</p>
<p>But while the level of nervousness has increased, Wall Street's bears
remain in the minority, vastly outnumbered by bulls, such as Abby Joseph
Cohen, Goldman Sachs's equity strategist, who early in 1995 was viewed by
many as reckless for projecting that the Dow could crack 6000. For 1997,
she is calling for another "millennial" move, predicting that the Dow could
break through 7000 to 7050.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Validity of Economic Data</b></p>
<p>"The fundamentals that have given us this bull market are still in
place," Ms. Cohen argues. "Even if growth in corporate profits is a little
slower than we're expecting, the inflation backdrop should be more
supportive, so I don't see any fundamental risk, just a delay in seeing
those profits arrive."</p>
<p>The cornerstone for Ms. Cohen's optimism is that global economic growth
will be strong enough to buoy corporate earnings, particularly in the
second half of 1997. Still, she is more cautious in her predictions that
she was a year ago, calling for returns on the Standard &amp; Poor's
500-stock index to reach only 10% to 12%, while profits reported by the
companies composing the index might climb only 7%.</p>
<p>That kind of cautious approach to stock prices has become increasingly
common among many of the market's longtime bulls. Economic data may no
longer be sending the same warnings of looming inflation and higher
interest rates that proliferated in mid-1996, rocking stock prices. But
stocks now seem to have fully priced in the existence of the so-called
Goldilocks economy -- neither too hot nor too cold, but just right.</p>
<p>"The economic backdrop hasn't changed as radically as stock prices have
since July," says Christine Callies, chief investment strategist at Credit
Suisse First Boston. "Some of the big move in stocks was due to an increase
in [price-earnings ratios]."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Sluggish Profit Growth</b></p>
<p>Several observers are calling for more sluggish growth in profits in
1997 and more disappointments as companies report earnings. The latter have
shown an ever-increasing ability to pummel not just the stock of the
company in question, but that of companies in its industry and even, in the
case of a "bellwether" stock, the market as a whole.</p>
<p>"I don't think anybody should be counting on higher returns from
stronger earnings, especially if the companies are relying on increasing
their prices to deliver those earnings," says Kevin Bannon, who manages $35
billion in assets for the Bank of New York.</p>
<p>Mr. Bannon anticipates what he calls "normal equity returns" in 1997,
which, coming hard on the heels of a 34% gain in the S&amp;P 500 in 1995
and the 22% jump in 1996, may catch investors offguard.</p>
<p>"A 10% or so gain for the market for the year means 1% or less per
month, and people aren't used to that kind of slow growth in stocks," he
adds.</p>
<p>Already, investors have been given a taste of the kind of uncertainty
and volatility that many analysts believe await them in 1997. Last month,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=orcl&amp;page=15">Oracle</a> Corp.'s failure to meet analysts' earnings expectations
by a mere penny a share buffeted not only that company's stock but also
those of many other technology companies.</p>
<p>And ruminations by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan on the topic
of "irrational exuberance" in financial-asset valuations, triggered fears
that the Fed might raise interest rates to prevent a Japanese-style
"bubble" from developing in stock prices. That anxiety halted the
five-week-old postelection rally in its tracks.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Cutting Stock Exposure</b></p>
<p>"I think 1997 will prove to be a year of increased volatility as people
continue to worry about valuation levels and the economy," says Gerald
Klauer, managing partner at Gerard Klauer Mattison, a New York
institutional brokerage firm.</p>
<p>Reflecting growing uncertainty about the bull market's longevity, some
high-profile strategists have already trimmed their recommended exposure to
stocks. Most recently, Barton Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan
Stanley, urges cutting stock allocations to 56% from 74% of his recommended
portfolio, while raising cash from zero to 15%. David Shulman, chief equity
strategist at Salomon Brothers, had earlier recommended a similar move,
trimming stock exposure to 45% from 50% in favor of holding more cash, some
20% of the model portfolio.</p>
<p>Some bulls argue that continued inflows of cash into stock mutual funds
will continue to buoy prices in 1997. Given the perceived need by many
mutual-fund managers to be fully invested, this means more cash available
to plow into stocks. As of the end of 1996, the chief beneficiaries
continued to be large-cap and blue-chip stocks with substantial liquidity.
These, traders and analysts say, offer managers some comfort that should
the market take a turn for the worse they could remove their cash as
quickly as they were able to invest it. But not everyone believes that
liquidity will continue to fuel double-digit gains in the major
indexes.</p>
<p>"It takes more and more cash at this level of the Dow to push it
higher," says Richard McCabe, chief market strategist at Merrill Lynch.
Moreover, he says, history is working against the market: Stock prices tend
to perform much more poorly the year following a presidential election, or
the year following two years of substantial outperformance. And while many
of his peers can't find any kind of trigger for a stock-market correction
in either the economic outlook or stock fundamentals, Mr. McCable isn't as
optimistic.</p>
<p>"Some important corrections had no important economic catalyst," he
says. "The risks of a market-corrective phase ... appear to be growing in
1997."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Sectors Posting the Best Results<br>
May Again Dominate in 1997</h2>

<p><b>By G<font size="-1">REG</font> I<font size="-1">P</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>That the stock market almost matched its spectacular 1995 gain in 1996
is impressive enough. What is really striking is that many of the same
sectors led the way.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Energy, banks and semiconductors -- three of 1995's best performers --
turned in shining performances again in 1996. And few analysts are ready to
bet against them in 1997. There also were similarities on the list of
losers: trucking, steel and factory equipment.</p>
<p>"The common element between the [winners] is the economics of the
business" took a turn for the better in 1996, says Joseph Battipaglia,
chief investment strategist at Gruntal &amp; Co. The common element among
the losers was a lack of pricing power, he says.</p>
<p>"In those companies there's less that distinguishes one product from the
other. In an environment that has little pricing power, the only way you
can compete is on lower prices, which is disastrous for your profit
margins."</p>
<p>But 1996 wasn't all an encore. Footwear companies and securities brokers
joined the winners, while looming deregulation condemned electrical and
telephone utilities' long-suffering shareholders to a year of subpar
performance.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Technology</b></p>
<p>The stalwarts of technology -- semiconductors, computers and software --
were among the best-performing sectors in 1996, but it was the
stock-pickers who profited.</p>
<p>Eric Miller, chief investment officer at Donaldson Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette, says, "In those groups it wasn't so much breadth of strength, but
that they contained within themselves some of the more spectacular
companies."</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=intc&amp;page=15">Intel</a> Corp. more than doubled,
pacing a 79% gain in the semiconductor index.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=msft&amp;page=15">Microsoft</a> Corp. climbed 88%, helping
software rise 36%.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ibm&amp;page=15">International Business
Machines</a> Corp. was one of the most impressive component of the Dow
Jones Industrial Average, rising 66% to $151.50 from $91.375 at the
beginning of the year; it also pushed the computer index up 41%. Other big
movers were network-equipment maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=csco&amp;page=15">Cisco Systems</a> Inc., up 71% to
$63.63, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cpq&amp;page=15">Compaq
Computer</a> Corp., up 55%.</p>
<p>All rode soaring demand for technology from businesses more obsessed
than ever with increasing productivity.</p>
<p>Lary Aasheim, technology analyst at CoreStates Investment Advisers, said
personal-computer sales beat expectations with a rise of 20% in 1996, not
far off 1995's 26% increase. PC makers benefited from an 80% plunge in the
price of dynamic random access memory chips.</p>
<p>"That benefits large portions of the tech area, except the DRAM makers,"
says Mr. Aasheim. "They have to foot the bill to everyone's benefit." He
says an 80% drop in DRAM prices cuts the cost of a computer 16%, part of
which manufacturers pocketed.</p>
<p>Other companies joining the technology boom were hard-disk makers such
as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wdc&amp;page=15">Western
Digital</a> Corp., up more than threefold; computer-printer maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=encd&amp;page=15">Encad</a> Inc., whose stock more than tripled on the Nasdaq Stock
Market; and a trio of Nasdaq-listed companies that are connected to helping
computers record the year 2000:
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tsri&amp;page=15">TSR</a> Inc.,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=zitl&amp;page=15">Zitel</a> Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=vias&amp;page=15">Viasoft</a> Inc.</p>
<p>Can technology repeat this performance in 1997? Many analysts say
yes.</p>
<p>James Weiss, deputy chief investment officer at State Street Research
&amp; Management, says: "More than 50% of capital spending is now
technology related. Our economy has been very aggressive in building
productivity and that leads to very active investment in technology. There
will be catch-up spending coming out of Europe."</p>
<p>Mr. Aasheim says more DRAM capacity remains to come on stream,
suggesting memory will remain cheap, boosting sales and profits of PC
makers and their suppliers, like Intel. For the same reason he advises
avoiding suppliers of semiconductor manufacturing equipment like
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lrcx&amp;page=15">LAM Research</a> Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=amat&amp;page=15">Applied Materials</a> Inc.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Energy</b></p>
<p>Colder weather, Middle East tensions and rising demand in the developing
world produced an inexorable -- and surprising -- rise in the price of oil,
to a five-year high in 1996.</p>
<p>It made oil drilling the single-best performing sector of the stock
market, rising more than twofold. Among the group's top performers were
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=flcn&amp;page=15">Falcon Drilling</a> Co.,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=rdc&amp;page=15">Rowan</a> Cos. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=glm&amp;page=15">Global Marine</a> Inc., all more than doubling on the
New York Stock Exchange;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cldr&amp;page=15">Cliffs Drilling</a>
Co. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mdco&amp;page=15">Marine
Drilling</a> Co. both rose about fourfold on Nasdaq; and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=uti&amp;page=15">UTI Energy</a> Corp., was up sixfold on the American
Stock Exchange.</p>
<p>Among oil companies, the closer they were to the black, sticky stuff,
the better. Among the exploration companies to benefit most from the rise
in crude prices were
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=umc&amp;page=15">United Meridian</a>
Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=chk&amp;page=15">Chesapeake
Energy</a> Corp., with more-than-twofold increases on the Big Board;
Williams Energy Inc., up fivefold on Nasdaq; and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sab&amp;page=15">Saba Petroleum</a> Co., up sixfold, and
TransMontaigne Oil Co., up threefold on Amex.</p>
<p>Tim Straus, manager of equity research sales at Jefferies &amp; Co.,
says rapid economic growth in the developing world means demand for oil
"still looks very robust for many years." As for the suppliers of
oil-drilling and oil-field services, "The capital-spending budgets of major
integrated energy companies are put in place at the end of the year and
unless something serious happens to energy prices, that money is going to
be spent."</p>
<p>However, integrated oils weren't great beneficiaries of this demand,
because their refining, marketing and petrochemical divisions were burdened
by intense competition and excess capacity, says Mr. Weiss.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tx&amp;page=15">Texaco</a> rose 25%, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=xon&amp;page=15">Exxon</a> 22%.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Banks</b></p>
<p>The 45% gain registered by money-center banks in 1996 was remarkable
enough, but even more so on top of their 57% gain in 1995. Many of their
shareholders have more than doubled their money in the past two years, not
bad considering that bad loans that crippled some banks in the early
1990s.</p>
<p>The gain also is remarkable in that it came without help from interest
rates, which ended the year about where they began in 1996. Bank stocks
generally benefit when rates fall.</p>
<p>Bank stocks "have never been just an interest-rate story in the 1990s,"
says Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers. "If
you look at the strength of balance sheets, loan losses, dividend growth,
earnings growth, this is the best set of fundamentals for three
decades."</p>
<p>Citicorp soared 53%,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bac&amp;page=15">BankAmerica</a> Corp.
rose 54% and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cmb&amp;page=15">Chase Manhattan</a>
Corp.--actually, the merged Chase and Chemical Banking Corp.--increased
52%.</p>
<p>Major regional banks were also big winners.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nb&amp;page=15">NationsBank</a> Corp. rose 40%,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ftu&amp;page=15">First Union</a> Corp. increased 33% and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wfc&amp;page=15">Wells Fargo</a> &amp; Co. gained 25%.</p>
<p>Mr. Applegate remains positive on bank stocks, saying that relative to
expected earnings they still trade at 10% to 15% less than the market
average.</p>
<p>"The worry about the banks is people are always waiting for them to find
the next bad customer. They did in the 1970s and 1980s, when it was
less-developed countries and real estate. Now they're not playing a market
share game, but a profitability game."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, brokerage firms rode the stock market to a boom of their own.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mer&amp;page=15">Merrill Lynch</a> &amp; Co. rose 60%,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sch&amp;page=15">Charles Schwab</a> Corp., 59%, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bsc&amp;page=15">Bear Stearns</a> Cos., 47%.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Footwear</b></p>
<p>One of the year's more remarkable stories was the strong showing of
footwear, which was only an average performer in 1995. The sector was up
62%, paced by
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nke&amp;page=15">Nike</a> Inc., whose
shares rose 72% as a strong brand name delivered impressive sales growth at
home and abroad.</p>
<p>But the sector was also home to some turnarounds. Sneaker-maker
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cve&amp;page=15">Converse</a> Inc. was one of the year's great comeback
stories, restructuring, returning to an operating profit and as a result
seeing its shares quadruple.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Business &amp; Consumer Cyclicals</b></p>
<p>The flip side of big capital spending going into silicon and software
was that less of it was left for steel, bricks and heavy machinery.</p>
<p>Steelmakers had another depressing year.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bs&amp;page=15">Bethlehem Steel</a> Corp. lost 36% and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=x&amp;page=15">USX-U.S. Steel</a> Group eked out a 2%
gain. Heavy construction, factory equipment and industrial technology were
three of the year's worst-performing sectors, each down about 4% to 6%.</p>
<p>Such cyclical companies suffered from the slow steady growth in the
economy, which few forecasters expect to change markedly.</p>
<p>The same concerns bedeviled consumer cyclicals, particularly home
builders, whose stocks were down 4% over the year.</p>
<p>DLJ's Mr. Miller says those stocks are unlikely to perform well until
the economy is into its next recession "whenever that is, and when the Fed
reverses gears and starts to ease. That might be the end of 1997."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Telecommunications and Broadcast</b></p>
<p>Cable and telephone companies, stock-market darlings in 1995, got a cold
shower of competition and deregulation in 1996.</p>
<p>Cable stocks were hardest hit.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tcoma&amp;page=15">Tele-Communications</a> Inc.
plunged 28%, while
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cvc&amp;page=15">Cablevision
Systems</a> Corp. tumbled 44%. Phone companies fared little better.
After beating the market with a 41% gain in 1995, they lagged far behind in
1996, ending little changed on the year.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a> fell 6% during the year,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bel&amp;page=15">Bell Atlantic</a> Corp. slid 3%,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sbc&amp;page=15">SBC Communications</a> Inc. dropped 9% and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nyn&amp;page=15">Nynex</a> lost 11%.</p>
<p>Deregulation has also preyed on electrical utilities, leaving their
shares down 5% on the year.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=so&amp;page=15">Southern</a> Co. slid
8%, as well as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=pcg&amp;page=15">Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric</a> Co. dropped 26%, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=pe&amp;page=15">Peco Energy</a> Co. fell 16%.</p>
<p>But telephone and electricity stocks could reward investors in 1997
simply because they are one of the last havens of value, says Paul Lesutis,
managing director of Brandywine Asset Management.</p>

Mark Top Stories in 1996</h2>

<p><b>By W<font size="-1">ILLIAM</font> P<font size="-1">OWER</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>In 1996, the stock market soared -- well, at least it did on days that
the latest employment data weren't released or Alan Greenspan didn't
sneeze. But as usual, there were also plenty of light-hearted moments on
the investing scene, dutifully tracked by The Wall Street Journal. Some
highlights:</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>When Is A Mutual Fund Like a Football Player?</b></p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>It was a sorry year for pro football's New York Jets -- a 1-15 record
made them the butt of jokes. That may be why big defensive end Marvin
Washington looked long and hard for a fresh way to describe his team's
woes, and wound up sounding like Peter Lynch.</p>
<p>"You have to look at it like the stock market and being in it for the
long haul -- like a mutual fund," Mr. Washington opined to New York
sportswriters one day in November. "Like, in the end, it's going to work
out for you. Hopefully that's what my career is going to be. I'm a mutual
fund and at the end it's going to work out."</p>
<p>If not, Mr. Washington might have a broker career.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Not as Bad as Novartis, But Still ...</b></p>
<p>Most Needless Renaming Award on Wall Street for '96 has to go to the
Public Securities Association. After years of going merrily along with its
name, PSA for short, the bond-market trade group decided that wasn't good
enough. It sent out an imposing "Notice to the Press" announcing the grand
new name:</p>
<p>PSA The Bond Market Trade Association. No dash, hyphen or anything. And
awkward as it may seem, that's where the "the" is supposed to be, according
to the trade group. It says it changed its name to make clear that it
includes more than just "public" securities.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Crystal Ball I: Garzarelli on A Roll</b></p>
<p>Market guru Elaine Garzarelli was the subject of a lot of hype after the
1987 stock-market crash. She turned bearish before it happened -- though
whether she actually "predicted the crash" is still a matter of debate on
Wall Street. That didn't stop her from mailing out one of the most alarming
pieces of junk mail in Street history in November.</p>
<p>"SELL NOW!" the envelope warned in red. "Get OUT of all U.S. stocks and
mutual funds now." The mailing noted that the warnings came from a guru who
had "predicted every bear market crash of the last 20 years."</p>
<p>There has been only one crash in that time, but let's not get picky. If
the market crashes any time in the next 20 years, the guru, or at least her
public-relations people, can say she was right again.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b><b>Crystal Ball II: Standard, but Not So
Poor</b></b></p>
<p>We saved the annual market prediction from Standard &amp; Poor's Outlook
newsletter that arrived a year ago. It's often a bit nasty to wait a year
and see how wrong the experts were.</p>
<p>This year, the newsletter's Arnold Kaufman spoiled the fun, to a
point.</p>
<p>A year ago Dec. 20, he wrote that while the stock market "is bound to
become far more volatile, major averages will post at least modest gains in
1996." Exactly right on point one, though much too conservative on point
two. He predicted the S&amp;P 500 would end the year up just 5% or so. It
finished four times higher than that.</p>
<p>This is the second straight year that Mr. Kaufman was right, but far too
conservative, about the market's direction.</p>
<p>Says Mr. Kaufman now: "Just about every 20 years, the market has
outstanding back-to-back gains," and the size of the gains caught him and
many others by surprise. "Unfortunately, such patterns don't bode well for
1997," he adds. He's looking for a 4% gain in 1997.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Don't Watch This With Breakfast</b></p>
<p>OK, OK. It was a decent movie, but the puns and clever variations can
stop now.</p>
<p>The last straw came in 1996, when the Chicago Mercantile Exchange put
out a video on livestock-futures trading and announced in its advertisement
(get ready): "Cows, Pigs and Videotape."</p>
<p>Please, make them stop!</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Fedspeak: When a Crash Isn't a Crash</b></p>
<p>Stock markets went into a tizzy in December after a speech by Fed
Chairman Alan Greenspan included a reference to "irrational exuberance" in
markets.</p>
<p>Less-noticed in the speech was that Mr. Greenspan referred to the 1987
stock-market crash as "the sharp stock-market break of 1987."</p>
<p>Really, should investors hang on the every word of someone who, like
other Wall Street institutions, has shied away from calling a crash a
crash?</p>
<p>From now on, it's the 508-point, 22.61% little hiccup.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Whooshful Thinking?</b></p>
<p>After Monarchy/Regency Enterprises, an independent film company,
purchased a 12.5% stake in Puma, the athletic-shoe maker, for $75 million,
the founding chairman of Monarchy/Regency waxed poetic.</p>
<p>Said Arnon Milchan, producer of such films as "Pretty Woman" and "A Time
to Kill": "I hope to transform Puma into the Julia Roberts of the
athletic-footwear industry. I believe Puma is my new 'Pretty Woman.' " What
does that make Nike and Reebok?</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>They Don't Sell Raptors, Either</b></p>
<p>With the spectacular collapse of British bank Barings PLC still fresh on
everyone's minds, a much-smaller Cleveland company with the same-sounding
name suddenly changed its name.</p>
<p>Thus,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ber&amp;page=15">Bearings</a>
Inc. -- that's Bearings in print -- announced over the summer that it was
becoming Applied Industrial Technologies Inc. No longer will investors
think their brokers have lost their minds and are saying, "Buy stock in
Barings!"</p>
<p>Was the Cleveland company just sick of Barings jokes? No, says
spokeswoman Darlene Scarpaci. Bearings, she says, just wants to emphasize
that it's involved in much more than just bearings now -- a whole range of
"replacement components" for industry.</p>
<p>Not that the company is immune from wisecracks. It also changed its
colors from red and black to what Ms. Scarpaci calls "a real lovely purple
and teal." The result: "We did get some Barney jokes," admits Ms.
Scarpaci.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Other Than That, Morale Is Sky-High</b></p>
<p>How difficult is it to merge two financial firms from different
countries?</p>
<p>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell continues to find out, years after the German
firm (Deutsche Bank) bought the British one (Morgan Grenfell).</p>
<p>London traders last year marveled about the meeting that Michael Dobson,
group chief executive of Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, had with executives, in
which, according to people at the meeting, one British unit head at the
German-Anglo firm said, "As I see it, Morgan Grenfell has all the brains
and Deutsche Bank has all the dumbbells. What is Morgan Grenfell doing to
ensure that the skill pool isn't diluted?"</p>
<p>A Deutsche Morgan Grenfell spokesman declined to comment.</p>
<p>By the way, Peter Young, the Morgan Grenfell fund manager who became the
center of a mutual-fund scandal that cost Deutsche Bank several hundred
million dollars and was fired in September, is English. Oh, well.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Wall Street's Priorities: An Update</b></p>
<p>No, Wall Streeters aren't all money-grubbers. Really. And here is the
proof -- not.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=cpq&amp;page=15">Compaq Computer</a> Corp. ran a
publicity gimmick in December outside the New York Stock Exchange: It set
up a bank of Presario 3020 PCs and asked 500 traders and others to type in
their "wish list" for Christmas. The top-three wishes:</p>
<p>1. $1 million</p>
<p>2. A new car</p>
<p>3. A home computer</p>
<p>Great. What about, uh, world peace? That made No. 4, at least, followed
by "a vacation."</p>
<p>Among the also-ran picks were "a baby girl," contact lenses, Tickle Me
Elmo, Wonderbra, tuba lessons and "Dow 8000 in '97."</p>
<p>Perhaps the most realistic answer the computers registered: "My job
back."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>This Just In</b></p>
<p>The annual Securities Industry Association poll of what investors think
about Wall Street came up with a predictable result: About half the
investing public continues to see "greed and self-interest" as big problems
in the brokerage industry. Gordon Gekko wouldn't have minded.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Investors' IPO Fever Cooled<br>
With the Summer Correction</h2>

<p><b>By D<font size="-1">EBORAH</font> L<font size="-1">OHSE</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>For initial public offerings, 1996 held the good, the bad and the
ugly.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Investors and analysts will remember 1996 as a microcosm of almost every
possible IPO environment. First there was the spring's reckless buying
frenzy. Investors snapped up shares of virtually any small, speculative
company -- especially those with the word "Internet" in their prospectus --
without regard to the price they were paying for companies that might not
turn a profit for years. In those heady days, IPOs routinely ran up 50% or
more in their first day of post-IPO trading.</p>
<p>Then came the summer's brutal IPO correction that brought many freshly
minted stocks down 30% or more, even as the overall market declined much
less than that. It was followed by the second half of 1996's sobering
retreat, when investors rediscovered the notion of stock valuation, and
began imposing tough-minded pricing on underwriters.</p>
<p>Even with that new conservatism, however, the IPO calendar continued to
spit out new companies at a record-setting pace.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Record Deals, But Not Returns</b></p>
<p>The year will also be remembered for completion of the largest single
deal ever,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a>
Corp.'s spinoff of its telecommunications equipment unit
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lu&amp;page=15">Lucent Technologies</a> Inc., brought public by
underwriters led by Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. It was also the year of the
largest foreign IPO, by some estimates, as <a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dt &amp;page=15">Deutsche Telekom</a> AG, the German telecommunications company, was
brought public by underwriters led by Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co.</p>
<p>But while 1996 was a record year in many respects, investors didn't wind
up with record returns. Despite raising $46 billion from 692 new offerings
-- the most ever -- the IPO Class of 1996 wound up turning in below-market
returns of 12.1% on average. That was a far cry from 1995's record-setting
33.9% average return on IPOs, and below 1996's 26% increase in the Dow
Jones Industrial Average.</p>
<p>To be sure, some of the performance lag resulted from investors' move to
safe, liquid blue chips after the summer, putting further price and
performance pressure on IPOs. And many IPOs were priced so steeply in the
spring that they just couldn't churn out positive returns after their
sell-off.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, analysts say that assuming the broader market stays
intact, they expect the IPO market in 1997 to resemble the more-sober
second half of 1996. They expect investors to continue to keep the pricing
reins well in hand, rejecting speculative issues as they recall 1996 deals
that burned out.</p>
<p>"People are not going to invest in companies that don't have substantive
earnings," says Thomas Weisel, chairman of Montgomery Securities.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Quest for the Next Hot Deal</b></p>
<p>That wasn't always the case in 1996. February through June, especially,
resembled a sort of drunken investors convention. Money managers ignored
the high prices they were paying for new companies in a single-minded quest
for the next hot deal. It was hard to fault them. They were flush with cash
from baby boomers using their 401(k) plans to shovel money into scores of
aggressive-growth funds and the newest crop of microcap funds, both of
which are among the biggest buyers of IPOs.</p>
<p>For a while, they were rewarded handsomely. In the heat of the frenzy
around May and early June, virtually every deal was priced higher than its
originally targeted price. Deals ran up an average of 28% just in May.</p>
<p>"The first five months, it was a delight," says Robert Cooney, head of
the syndicate desk at Credit Suisse First Boston Corp. "You marked
everything up and it went up even more" in post-IPO trading.</p>
<p>Most of the market's hottest one-day deals priced in this frothy mix.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=xyln&amp;page=15">Xylan</a> Corp., a network-switching company went public in March at
$26 and immediately doubled, ending the day at $58.375.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=yhoo&amp;page=15">Yahoo!</a> Inc., the Internet directory and search
company, went public in April at $13 and quickly shot into the low 30s,
despite having limited revenue and an uncertain path to profitability.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'Diamonds in the Rough'</b></p>
<p>Even the most speculative issues found willing buyers. There were stocks
like
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=aksy&amp;page=15">Aksys</a>
Ltd., a provider of products and services for patients with chronic kidney
failure. Although it hadn't yet reported any revenue, the company was
priced above its targeted range, at $16, in May, and closed at $20.50 on
its first day of trading. (It now trades around $8.)</p>
<p>Stocks like these "could be diamonds in the rough, but they were being
priced like a diamond at Tiffany's," says Linda Killian, portfolio manager
at Renaissance Capital Corp. in Greenwich, Conn.</p>
<p>IPOs suffered a reversal after investors began having doubts about
technology stocks in June, on the heels of lackluster earnings outlooks
from such bellwether stocks as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mot&amp;page=15">Motorola</a> Inc. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=hwp&amp;page=15">Hewlett-Packard</a> Co. The Nasdaq Stock Market, laden
with tech stocks, ultimately fell some 20%, peak to trough.</p>
<p>As a result, IPOs that likely would have soared only weeks before --
such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ozemy&amp;page=15">OzEmail</a>
Ltd., which provides Internet access in Australia and New Zealand, and
Internet search engine
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=seek&amp;page=15">Infoseek</a> Corp.
-- priced below their ranges and faltered in early trading. OzEmail priced
at $14 and quickly faltered, trading recently at $9.625. Infoseek priced at
$12 on June 11, recently traded at $8.50.</p>
<p>Before long, underwriters were delaying deals in the hope that the
small-cap market, as well as the IPO environment, would rev back up
again.</p>
<p>The market did reverse course, but by then investors had started paying
attention to how much they were paying for companies with little to show
for themselves. As a result, in the second half of the year, a greater
percentage of deals were priced within or below their originally targeted
range, a concept unimaginable only months before.</p>
<p>The new pricing ethic seemed to work. The deals priced in the second
half have turned in 15.6% gains by year end,  according to Securities Data
Co., while those priced in the first half returned only 11.6% when all was
said and done for 1996.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Strong Sectors</b></p>
<p>Business software, mortgage finance and telecommunications service were
generally among the strongest sectors in 1996 and some analysts expect
business-software companies to continue to be a strong sector for 1997. Mr.
Weisel of Montgomery Securities also believes that the biotech IPO market
may open up, with 100 new drugs possibly being approved this year.
Montgomery expects the biotech market to go to $25 billion from $5 billion
in two years.</p>
<p>Other industries that were up fairly strongly in 1996 and could be good
candidates for 1997, Mr. Weisel notes, are semiconductor capital-equipment
issues, consumer, education, employment services, specialty lenders and
specialty retailers, application software, and finance companies. Robert
Natale, vice president of equity research at Standard &amp; Poor's, expects
biotechs, health-care technology and restaurant stocks to succeed this
year. "Those are the few industries that have valuations that are
reasonable from a historical perspective," says Mr. Natale.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Merger Records Shatter as Firms<br>
Capitalize on Favorable Climate</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>It was a year for the history books.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Merger-and-acquisition activity in 1996 smashed records set domestically
and internationally in 1995 as companies nourished their hunger for growth
spurred through takeovers. Megamergers in the telecommunications and
defense industries helped balloon the totals to unprecedented amounts.</p>
<p>In the U.S., $659 billion in mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs were
announced, up 27% from $519 billion in 1995, according to Securities Data
Co., a Newark, N.J., research company. Globally, a stunning $1.14 trillion
of deals were announced, thanks in part to the second-biggest merger ever
-- the union of Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG, two Swiss pharmaceutical
giants, valued in excess of $30 billion. The global total was up slightly
from the prior record, in 1995, of $950 billion.</p>
<div class="inset"><hr><p>See a list of the
<a class="article" href="/public/current/articles/SB852156998823463500.htm">50 largest deals</a> of 1996.</p>
<hr></div>
<p>The climate was as good as it gets. Looser regulation is changing the
competitive landscapes in telecommunications, utilities and broadcast,
among other industries. The "Goldilocks" economy -- not too hot and not too
cold -- helped quicken "M&amp;A" activity by encouraging companies to find
ways to boost earnings growth.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Strong Year Expected</b></p>
<p>Because these conditions aren't expected to change, 1997 is shaping up
to be another strong year, M&amp;A experts say.</p>
<p>"As long as the markets are favorable, I would think the underlying
imperatives will continue," says Felix Rohatyn, managing director at Lazard
Freres &amp; Co. and one of Wall Street's senior dealmakers. "The thing to
watch out for is the markets getting less buoyant, or the regulatory
climate reversing itself." In the meantime, he adds, "we've had a year
that's hard to believe."</p>
<p>Indeed, with double-digit returns for the past two years, the stock
market rewarded many companies with rich share prices with which to acquire
targets. "So much of this cycle has been driven by supportive equity
markets," says Bruce Fiedorek, head of mergers at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
"Different sectors may wax and wane, but many of the factors driving
activity are still present."</p>
<p>Given such favorable conditions, companies are stepping up to the plate
for surprisingly big "dream deals" that offer the potential for market
dominance, once believed to be unthinkable. "CEO confidence is high," says
Jack Levy, co-head of mergers at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "More and more
CEOs and boards are prepared to undertake a checkmate transaction, which
can radically transform their competitive position."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Eagerness for Stock Deals</b></p>
<p>One attribute that set 1996 apart is that "there were so many large
transactions," says Frederic Escherich, managing director at J.P. Morgan
&amp; Co. Because buyers and sellers both were eager to do tax-free stock
mergers rather than cash deals, such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ba&amp;page=15">Boeing</a> Co.'s $14 billion
purchase of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=md&amp;page=15">McDonnell
Douglas</a> Corp., "the willingness of the stock market to take stock
in big quantities has made it much easier to do transactions," Mr.
Escherich says.</p>
<p>And the stock market rewards deals perceived as sound:
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=g&amp;page=15">Gillette</a> Co.'s $7.3 billion acquisition of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dur&amp;page=15">Duracell International</a> Inc. rose in value to nearly $8
billion because of the rise in Gillette's stock, the currency used to pay
Duracell shareholders.</p>
<p>Deregulation and the increased competition for phone service spawned
some of the biggest-ever U.S. mergers, such as the $21.3 billion
combination of local phone giants
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bel&amp;page=15">Bell Atlantic</a> Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nyn&amp;page=15">Nynex</a> Corp., a transaction creating a behemoth in the
Eastern U.S.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=sbc&amp;page=15">SBC Communications</a> Inc. became
the Western giant with its $16.5 billion pact to acquire
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=pac&amp;page=15">Pacific Telesis Group</a>, the San Francisco Baby Bell.
By the end of the summer,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wcom&amp;page=15">WorldCom</a> Inc.,
the fast-growing long-distance provider, agreed to link up with
business-phone operator
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mfst&amp;page=15">MFS
Communications</a> Co. for $13.4 billion. Then
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bty&amp;page=15">British Telecommunications</a> PLC stunned
both sides of the Atlantic by announcing its $21.3 billion acquisition of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mcic&amp;page=15">MCI Communications</a> Corp.</p>
<p>"While [1995] was characterized by media and entertainment megadeals,
[the 1996] M&amp;A market has been distinguished by huge telecom deals as
consolidation accelerated in the wake of last year's telecom legislation,"
says John Finley, a partner at Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett.</p>
<p>While most industries saw a pickup in merger activity, other strong
sectors include defense and energy. The year started with
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lmt&amp;page=15">Lockheed Martin</a> Corp.'s $8.8 billion acquisition of
most of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lor&amp;page=15">Loral</a>
Corp. and ended with the Boeing-McDonnell transaction. Companies that had
defense businesses, but not enough critical mass to survive in a shrinking
industry, are shedding their defense holdings. Two examples were the $3
billion sale of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wx&amp;page=15">Westinghouse
Electric</a> Corp.'s defense unit to
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=noc&amp;page=15">Northrop Grumman</a> Corp., and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=rok&amp;page=15">Rockwell International</a>'s $3.2 billion sale of its defense arm to
Boeing.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Energy Hot Spots</b></p>
<p>Besides defense, the energy industries -- ranging from utilities to
pipeline companies to major oil giants and off-shore drillers -- were hot
spots. In addition to a spate of intraindustry transactions, utilities
began acquiring oil and gas-pipeline companies as the two industries
"converge"' into an emerging power industry.</p>
<p>So
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=duk&amp;page=15">Duke
Power</a> Co. agreed to acquire pipeline giant PanEnergy Corp. for
$7.7 billion, and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=hou&amp;page=15">Houston
Industries</a> Inc. announced a $2.4 billion pact to buy
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nae&amp;page=15">NorAm Energy</a> Corp. A pipeline company turned
broad-based energy company,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ene&amp;page=15">Enron</a> Corp. agreed
to purchase for $2.1 billion Portland General Corp., a low-cost
utility.</p>
<p>Banking consolidation slowed in 1996 after an unprecedented year in
1995. But the thrift industry saw a flurry of deals, such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wamu&amp;page=15">Washington Mutual</a> Inc.'s $1.6 billion purchase of
American Savings Bank and First Nationwide Holdings Inc.'s acquisition of
Cal Fed Bancorp Inc. for $1.2 billion.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Less Successful Hostile Bids</b></p>
<p>Hostile takeover bids slowed, in part because it's tough to pay high
prices for takeovers when the stock market is so lofty.</p>
<p>In 1996, companies such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=wcs&amp;page=15">Wallace Computer Services</a> Inc.
and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tec&amp;page=15">Commercial
Intertech</a> Corp. successfully spurned bids. Numerous "bear hugs"
such as
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mat&amp;page=15">Mattel</a>
Inc.'s $5.2 billion bid for
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=has&amp;page=15">Hasbro</a> Inc. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=klu&amp;page=15">Kaiser Aluminum</a> Corp.'s bid for
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=amx&amp;page=15">Alumax</a> Inc., were fought off by
recalcitrant targets.</p>
<p>While the deals of 1996 were mostly corporations acquiring other
companies or divisions, leveraged buyouts also picked up. Financial buyers
acquired at least $22 billion in companies in 1996, the busiest year since
1989, according to J.P. Morgan. Still, buyouts accounted for only about 5%
of deals, excluding spinoffs, compared with about 33% in 1988, according to
J.P. Morgan.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Bigger Firms and Fatter Assets<br>
Dominate Money Management</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>For money managers, it's hard to dislike a year in which the Dow Jones
Industrial Average rose 26%.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Managers are paid a fee that is a percentage of the assets managed --
usually 0.5% to 1% for stock portfolios and somewhat less for bonds. When a
bull market fattens the asset total, clients are happy and the fees roll
in.</p>
<p>In 1996, three trends dominated the money-management arena. One was the
emergence of huge firms. Another was a resurgence in the popularity of
indexing, an investment technique that seeks only to match the market, not
to beat it. A third was the increasing importance of mutual funds.</p>
<p>The trend toward Goliath-sized firms was accelerated by mergers and
acquisitions, many of them across international borders. On the last day of
1995, the money-management arm of London banking giant Barclays PLC
acquired the largest U.S. money manager, Wells Fargo Nikko Investment
Advisers. During 1996, the pieces were reorganized into a single firm,
Barclays Global Investors, with headquarters in San Francisco and assets
(as of Sept. 30) of $371 billion.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Merger Action</b></p>
<p>In the summer, Chancellor Asset Management of New York was acquired by
LGT Asset Management of Liechtenstein. And Invesco PLC of Britain is
merging with AIM Management Group of Houston.</p>
<p>The domestic front also saw plenty of merger action. Merrill Lynch
snatched up Hotchkis &amp; Wiley of Los Angeles. New England Investment
Cos. paid $110 million for Jurika &amp; Voyles in San Francisco. And
Franklin Resources is in the process of swallowing Heine Securities, which
runs the popular Mutual Series funds.</p>
<p>Are the days of the small money manager numbered? Many people think so.
"The amount of capital needed to market your products is so large" that
it's hard for the little guys of the business to compete, says Jim Floyd of
Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.</p>
<p>"If you're an individual investor and you're searching for a [mutual]
fund, you go with names that you know, just as when you're buying a stereo
or computer," says Scott Lummer of Ibbotson Associates in Chicago.</p>
<p>Of course, not everyone believes that bigger is better. "The perverse
thing is that some firms build for the sake of building," says Tom Monroe,
director of equity research at Frank Russell Co., an investment-consulting
firm in Tacoma, Wash. "There's a lot of talk about mega-managers, global
presence, and one-stop shopping. Our clients are not saying they want to
shop for all their money management in one place."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Growth in Number of Managers</b></p>
<p>According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the total number of
money managers is still growing, but slowly. There are currently 22,400
registered investment advisers, up from about 22,000 in 1995. That's 2%
growth, the same as in 1995. By contrast, the number of advisers grew 8% in
1994 and 11% in 1993.</p>
<p>In addition to registered advisers, there are private investment pools
called hedge funds. Most take a high-risk, high-return approach, and their
managers typically are compensated with 20% of the investment profits.
Michael Stolper, a San Diego investment consultant, estimates that there
are close to 4,000 hedge funds in the U.S., and says they are pulling away
some of the brightest young talent from traditional firms.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the battle continues between active managers, who try to pick
the best stocks and bonds, and passive managers, who try to emulate an
index, such as Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Active vs. Passive Management</b></p>
<p>A layperson would assume that active management is superior. But it's
far from clear. Passive managers have lower costs for research and trading,
and can pass the savings on to clients. And lately, it has been very hard
for active managers to beat the indexes. One reason: Large stocks, such as
those that make up the S&amp;P index, have generally outperformed small
stocks.</p>
<p>As a result, money flowed into indexed investments in 1996. According to
Greenwich Associates, corporate pension plans now have about 28% of their
stock portfolios in a passive mode, compared with about 25.3% a year
earlier.</p>
<p>For most managers, the success of indexing is more than an
embarrassment, it is a threat to profits. Index funds undermine the
prevailing fee structure because they charge less than half of what active
managers charge.</p>
<p>Another major trend is the growth of mutual funds, which have taken the
public by storm and continue to pile up assets. Despite some faltering
during the last quarter of the year, stock funds experienced record inflows
during 1996, eclipsing the record set in 1993. As of Nov. 30, mutual funds
controlled assets of $3.5 trillion, more than five times the total of a
decade ago.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Getting into Mutual Funds</b></p>
<p>The mutual-fund total is now roughly the same as that for corporate
pension plans, which once dwarfed mutual funds in size. As a result,
money-management organizations that for years served only pension funds,
endowments and foundations are suddenly sprouting mutual-fund arms, or
acquiring mutual-fund companies.</p>
<p>The biggest player on the mutual-fund scene is Fidelity Investments,
based in Boston. For Fidelity, 1996 brought more than its share of
turmoil.</p>
<p>Jeff Vinik, manager of Fidelity's flagship Magellan Fund, the largest
mutual fund in the country, decided -- wrongly in retrospect -- to lighten
up on stocks because he saw the market as overvalued. Earlier, he had
incurred criticism for selling some stocks around the time he was praising
them in media interviews. In May, Mr. Vinik announced that he was leaving
Fidelity to run his own money-management firm. A few other well-known
managers have also left, and in November, Fidelity experienced $1 billion
in outflow as investors withdrew funds.</p>
<p>By all reports, Mr. Vinik is doing fine in raising money for his new
firm. But many people saw his departure as a sign that it can be hazardous
to one's career to be less than fully invested during a rampaging bull
market.</p>
<p>"When I got into this business, I had to persuade people to buy and
hold," says Steven L. Eber, head of Eber Capital Management in Coral
Gables, Fla. "Now there is such unanimity by the public: Buy the dips, buy
and hold."</p>
<p>Believing that stock prices are too high, Mr. Eber is now only about 40%
invested in stocks. But he says he can do so only because he runs his own
firm. "It's heresy," he says. "Guys three years into the business can't
afford that luxury."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Treasurys' Wide Price Swings<br>
Didn't Help Mediocre Returns</h2>

<p><b>By G<font size="-1">REGORY</font> Z<font size="-1">UCKERMAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>When the Federal Reserve Board cut the federal-funds rate by a quarter
point last Jan. 31, bond traders girded themselves for a volatile year --
full of wide price moves and significant central bank interest-rate
adjustments. As it turns out, they got the former, not the latter.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>In fact, the January cut would be the only move made by the Fed during
the entire year, frustrating Wall Street's soothsayers, many of whom first
predicted rate cuts, then increases.</p>
<p>Despite the inaction, bond prices were anything but stable, with yields
on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond starting the year at 5.95%, and
moving as high as 7.2% in July before finishing the year at 6.64%.</p>
<p>In all, 1996 will go down as a fairly disappointing year for bond
investors. The Lehman Brothers aggregate bond index, a benchmark used by
most investment managers, scored an insipid 4.16% total return, as of Dec.
30, down from 1995's stellar 18.47% performance.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>High Volume for Corporate Issuance</b></p>
<p>"Unlike our friends in the equity markets, 1996 [was] a mediocre year
for bonds," says William Lloyd, director of portfolio strategies for Credit
Suisse First Boston Corp.</p>
<p>But corporate treasurers relished the bond market's historically low
yields. In fact, the volume of corporate-bond issuance neared a whopping
$405 billion for the year, according to the PSA The Bond Market Trade
Association, close to 1993's record $416 billion mark. Corporate-bond
issuance was especially strong in November and December, to take advantage
of lower bond yields as prices rose.</p>
<p>Investors couldn't have been blamed for seeing January's interest-rate
cut as an indication that they were in for another year of wild
interest-rate swings and corresponding bond volatility. Bonds were hurt in
1994 and early 1995, when the Fed boosted rates to slow a runaway economy,
but optimism was sky-high as 1996 began.</p>
<p>The economy seemed poised to head into a recession, and central bankers
seemed intent on reviving growth through interest-rate cuts, after failing
to inspire the economy with rate reductions in both July and December of
1995. Some also suspected election year-rate cuts might be in the offing,
which inspired more enthusiasm among bond investors.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'A Round-Trip Year'</b></p>
<p>When it soon became apparent that inflation wasn't going to fall any
further and the economy was stronger than expected, wage pressures emerged
as a new concern and bond prices began falling, with corresponding yields
climbing. The yield on the benchmark 30-year bond began to rise almost
immediately to peak in July. It stayed high throughout the summer, nearing
the 7.2% peak, before a fall rally brought rates back down again.</p>
<p>Although the Treasury-bond market performed well in the fall, especially
in October and November, as yields on the 30-year bond fell back to the
6.3% region, year-end nervousness limited the market's gains.</p>
<p>It was "a strange year," says Mitchell Held, Smith Barney Inc.'s chief
economist. "The market was beset by changes in expectations -- early on,
many thought we'd get lower short-term interest rates, and then pretty
sharp shifts in respect to economic activity led many to expect higher
rates. The outlook for Fed policy greatly affected the markets."</p>
<p>"It was a round-trip year," quips Jack Malvey, chief global fixed-income
strategist at Lehman Brothers Inc. "We hit a peak at about July 5 and
embarked during the remainder of 1996 on a slow, steady descent [in bond
yields], and basically retraced a good deal of the territory, which we gave
up."</p>
<p>Full employment with low inflation and steady growth buoyed bond
investors, as did the shrinking budget deficit. Indeed, the deficit, which
had ballooned in the 1980s, has fallen during the past four years to below
1.5% of gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Spotlight on Foreign Buyers</b></p>
<p>A major theme of 1996, and a point of both relief and consternation
among market participants, was the growing role that foreign buyers play in
the U.S. market. Foreigners have long been significant players in the U.S.
market. But the flow of funds from overseas picked up in 1996 as the dollar
strengthened. Foreign investment also rose because overseas bond markets
continued to offer paltry yields and the U.S. trade deficit provided
foreign central banks with dollars they were forced to invest.</p>
<p>Foreign governments are estimated to have purchased the bulk of all new
Treasury bonds in 1996. Further, foreigners now hold 30% of total
outstanding Treasurys, according to McCarthy, Crisanti &amp; Maffei Inc.,
up from only 20.4% at the end of 1993, as U.S. investors shifted their
focus to stocks and riskier bonds. By the end of the year, concern set in
that this source of support may be drying up. But with interest rates in
Japan still low -- 10-year government securities are yielding less than 3%
-- it is doubtful Japanese investors will suddenly leave the U.S. market en
masse.</p>
<p>In many ways, the Treasury-bond market was overshadowed by the
head-turning successes of emerging markets, high-yield and
nondollar-denominated bonds. The J.P. Morgan Emerging Markets Bond Index
Plus jumped almost 40% for the year, making emerging-markets bonds one of
the few investments that can claim to beat the performance of stocks in
1996. Bond markets in Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina showed especially
stellar returns.</p>
<p>Investors in the U.S. also flocked to the junk-bond market, eager to
capture the high yields of a market that returned approximately 13.5% for
the year. Issuers took advantage of the market's performance to issue a
record number of new bonds.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'Great Year for Taking Risk'</b></p>
<p>Elsewhere, many nondollar markets rallied sharply, with Italy, Spain and
Sweden leading the way. Indeed, all G-7 economies experienced growth
without inflationary pressures, aiding the performance of bonds.
Asset-backed securities in the U.S. also turned in an impressive
performance, with volume of asset-backed sales setting an all-time record
of $154 billion, according to PSA.</p>
<p>In all, "it was a great year for taking credit risk," concludes Mr.
Lloyd. Even within the investment-grade class, lower rated bonds scored a
higher performance than higher-quality issues.</p>
<p>Innovative products, such as capital securities and 100-year bonds, also
left their mark on the capital markets in 1996. "We're just beginning in
terms of different structures," says Arthur Hyde, Salomon Brothers' head of
debt syndication. "People are searching for yield and are a lot more open
to new ideas."</p>
<p>Looking ahead, although most Wall Street economists don't envision a
full-fledged U.S. recession until 1999, the economy's expansion is starting
to show signs of age. Growing household-financial burdens concern some
economists, while others worry that high employment levels will lead to
higher pay, and in turn inflation. As a result, few predict a bull market
for bonds, because fixed-income assets lose value when inflation rears its
ugly head or interest rates rise.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Strong Japanese Demand</b></p>
<p>Still, there are as many reasons for the Fed to cut rates to spur a
lethargic economy as there are for higher interest rates to prevent
inflation, and strong positives for bonds do exist. High employment levels
have yet to create inflationary pressures of serious concern and many see a
slow-growth, low-inflationary environment continuing. At the same time,
politicians of all political persuasions are speaking of their intent to
reduce the budget deficit still further, perhaps through a balanced-budget
amendment. Such a move would help bonds, especially those of longer
durations, by promising less bond issuance from the government.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, foreigners have yet to show any intentions of reducing their
spending on U.S. bonds. "We think the degree of foreign buying will
continue," says Mr. Held of Smith Barney. "They still have a lot of dollars
that they have to dispense."</p>
<p>Indeed, as long as interest rates remain low in Japan, demand for U.S.
Treasurys by Japanese investors should remain strong. As a result, most
Wall Street strategists predict bonds will remain in a narrow range during
the coming year, with the yield on the 30-year bond staying in a tight
6%-to-7% range. Investors will likely continue their search for yield, both
in the U.S. and abroad.</p>
<p>In a stable interest-rate environment, some economists believe that
bonds may very well outperform stocks. "I think more money will be made in
bonds" than stocks in 1997, says Irwin Kellner, chief economist at Chase
Manhattan Corp.'s regional bank. "The coupon and capital gains could mean
15% to 20% in total return while stocks will do well to go up 1% to
2%."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Municipal Issues Survived Talk<br>
Of Flat Tax, but Risks Still Loom</h2>

<p><b>By C<font size="-1">HARLES</font> G<font size="-1">ASPARINO</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>The good news is that life in the municipal-bond market returned to
normal in 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Investors have shaken off fears that the federal government will impose
a flat tax, and wipe out the advantage of buying tax-exempt securities.
Municipal-bond issuance has bounced back, surpassing 1995 levels. Even the
usually staid municipal-bond mutual funds have done well, outperforming
other fixed-income investments even before their tax advantage is figured
in.</p>
<p>Muni funds posted average gains of 3.12% through Dec. 26, according to
Lipper Analytical Services Inc., compared with 2.76% for taxable
corporate-bond funds.</p>
<p>Now the bad news: As any seasoned municipal-bond professional will tell
you, danger lurks around every corner in the muni market. Fiscal disasters,
tax-law changes and the fickle nature of bond sales are systemic to the
$1.3 trillion municipal-bond market.</p>
<p>"This is a market that's always nervous about something," says Michael
Shamosh, a fixed-income strategist at Tucker Anthony Inc. in New York. "If
it's not credit problems, it's Congress doing away with the tax exemption,
general interest rates, or Miami defaulting on its debt."</p>
<p>So, if you're a muni-bond investor, either through mutual funds or
buying securities directly, here are a few things to watch for in the new
year:</p>
<p><b>Tax-code overhaul.</b> Congress may not
be talking flat tax now, but no one believes the topic to be dead.
Investors should be heartened by the re-election of President Clinton, a
former governor who may be the market's biggest advocate in Washington. But
Mr. Clinton has been known to change his mind, particularly if he can win
some political points, and Republicans have regained control of both houses
of Congress. Investors can expect more talk about making the tax code
"flatter and fairer." And there could be discussions about eliminating the
tax-exempt advantage of municipal issues altogether.</p>
<p><b>Fiscal disasters.</b> It seems like
there's always another Orange County, Calif., waiting to take muni
investors by surprise. The latest example comes from Miami, where city
officials recently shocked the municipal-bond market by revealing a $68
million gap in its $300 million budget. City officials now say the deficit
could be larger, and the city may need to file for bankruptcy.</p>
<p>All this occurred under the noses of the big bond-rating agencies --
Moody's Investors Service Inc. and Standard &amp; Poor's Corp. both failed
to inform investors about Miami's fiscal woes before it was too late. Only
after the problems were made public did the bond raters downgrade Miami's
debt to below-investment grade from relatively high ratings, as the value
of the securities began to slide.</p>
<p><b>Regulatory crackdowns.</b> The Securities
and Exchange Commission has launched an unprecedented crackdown on fraud
and abuse in the municipal-bond market. Federal regulators say the
investigations of muni practices are needed to restore order and confidence
to a market where political connections have often meant more than
financial expertise in winning bond deals. Nearly every major firm that
underwrites municipal bonds has come under the spotlight.</p>
<p>Several major firms, including Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and Lazard Freres
&amp; Co., have settled with the SEC without being formally charged and
paid millions of dollars in fines. At least one major banker has been
sentenced following a conviction on numerous counts of violating securities
laws.</p>
<p>Even less formal scrutiny has affected investors, as bonds that become
the focus of any kind of probe often fall dramatically in value. Some bonds
sold by the Camden County, N.J., Municipal Utilities Authority, for
example, lost an estimated $25 per $1,000 in face value after it was
disclosed that the Internal Revenue Service is conducting a "routine audit"
of the securities.</p>
<p><b>Lean times.</b> People who make their
living selling municipal bonds will continue to face lean times in the
years ahead, as state and local governments look to cut costs by scaling
back on their borrowing. Underwriting margins are tight because of
increased competition for less business, and there's nothing to change the
profit squeeze unless more firms pull out. A number of firms have withdrawn
from the municipal bond underwriting business in recent years, including
Lazard Freres, Credit Suisse First Boston and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp;
Jenrette.</p>
<p>In terms of new municipal-bond issuance, the Public Securities
Association, a Washington trade group, says state and local governments
sold about $183.4 billion of securities by the end of the year, and will
sell about the same amount in 1997. Although that's up from about $160
billion in 1995, it's significantly less than what municipalities were
issuing as recently as 1993.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Yields on CDs, Money Funds<br>
Left Investors Wanting More</h2>

<p><b>By E<font size="-1">ILEEN</font> K<font size="-1">INSELLA</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>No news may be good news, but for yield-hungry investors, the returns of
the past year had to be downright disappointing when compared with the
feast that equity investors enjoyed.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>For the most part, 1996 was a nonevent for short-term interest rates,
and for yields. With the exception of a dip in mid-February following the
Federal Reserve Board's rate cut, and an anemic rebound, yields on bank
certificates of deposit at year end seemed to mirror the numbers of a year
earlier. A one-year certificate of deposit, for instance, was yielding an
average 4.95% at year end, almost exactly where it was in late 1995,
according to Banxquote Money Markets Inc., a Fairfield, N.J., information
service.</p>
<p>Money-market mutual funds may have been a bright spot in 1995, but there
was no encore performance in 1996. The average seven-day compound yield on
a taxable money fund hovered around 4.85% for most of the year, after
tumbling from an average 5.28% in the first quarter, according to IBC's
Money Fund Report, an Ashland, Mass., newsletter. The average seven-day
compound yield on tax-free funds also fell, to 2.98% from 4.03% at the
start of the year. Compound yields assume the reinvestment of
dividends.</p>
<p>Long-term securities fared somewhat better. The benchmark 30-year
Treasury bond ended 1996 yielding 6.64%, compared with 5.9% the previous
December.</p>
<p>But there has been a noticeable reversal of the pattern for long-term
CDs, which typically offer higher yields than short-term instruments, says
Robert K. Heady, publisher of Bank Rate Monitor, a North Palm Beach, Fla.,
newsletter. "When you see a number of banks begin bringing down long-term
yields faster than short-term [yields], that's a tip that institutions
anticipate lower numbers ahead," says Mr. Heady.</p>
<p>Another bit of bad news to add to cash investors' woes is the strong
increase in bank fees and charges on deposit accounts in 1996, which only
further eat away at already modest yields.</p>
<p>Although no cash investments escaped the overall damping effect of the
low-interest-rate environment, some financial planners stress the value of
the greater liquidity that money-market mutual funds and short-term
Treasurys offer, even if they can't boast higher yields.</p>
<p>"You're always better off buying a five-year Treasury than a five-year
CD," says Ronald W. Roge, a financial planner in Centereach, N.Y., "since
there is much more flexibility and generally more return than a bank
CD."</p>
<p>Investors still like money funds, despite their lackluster yield
performance. As of mid-December, combined assets in taxable and tax-free
money funds had grown $156 billion to more than $900 billion, a 20.5%
increase for the year, to surpass bond funds, says Peter Crane, managing
editor of IBC's Money Fund Report.</p>
<p>Because money funds pass through directly to investors the return on the
funds' investments, they typically have higher yields than short-term CDs.
They also are liquid and offer relatively low risk, although unlike CDs
they aren't federally insured. "They are a better deal for the depositor
and we're of the opinion that the risk is negligible," says Mr. Crane,
noting tighter Securities and Exchange Commission regulation of the funds.
Money funds also have been helped by the overall popularity of mutual
funds, he adds.</p>
<p>An increasing number of banks now offer their own mutual funds, which
has shifted some of the focus away from a hard sell of CDs. Still, CDs
remain attractive to certain investors. John B. Ward, president of First
American Bank  in Chicago, says First American hasn't seen significant
outflows. Although he concedes that the bank has adjusted rates upward to
attract money, he says that overall the yields have performed well
considering the interest-rate environment.</p>
<p>Mr. Heady of Bank Rate Monitor also says CDs stood their ground, based
on his own return analysis. Based on a $10,000 investment made at the start
of the year, and assuming reinvested dividends, a one-year CD would have
returned $493, a sliver above the $490 return yielded on a one-year
Treasury bill, through mid-December.</p>
<p>The best hope for yields in 1997 is that the Federal Reserve deems it
necessary to step in and tighten interest rates, a move some economists
think may be likely by mid-1997. Yields on cash investments would quickly
follow such a jump. "Obviously the Fed will become worried if what is
driving the market is not rational. If that bubble breaks it will cause a
lot of damage, says Jim Glassman, a senior economist with Chase Securities
Inc.</p>
<p>Recently, Barton Biggs, chief global strategist at Morgan Stanley &amp;
Co., has warned of an imminent correction in the stock market and boosted
his recommended cash levels from zero to 15%.</p>
<p>Mr. Ward of First American Bank believes people will quickly see the
appeal of certificates of deposit when such an event occurs. "If a lot of
money comes out of the stock market in a hurry, investors are going to be
looking for a safe place to park it," says Mr. Ward.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">In Shadow of the Rally in Stocks,<br>
Some Commodity Sectors Soared</h2>

<p><b>By A<font size="-1">ARON</font> L<font size="-1">UCCHETTI</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>Despite a roller-coaster year in several commodities markets, with
plenty of opportunities for profit, the overall picture was overshadowed by
the glimmering performance of stocks.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>"With the stock market going up on a sustained basis, it's hard to take
notice of a lot of the opportunities in the commodities markets," says
David Rinehimer, director of futures research at Smith Barney.</p>
<p>But some select opportunities stood out in 1996, with several
commodities setting records and experiencing unprecedented price moves.</p>
<p>In grains, for example, the expectations of a drought in the spring
prompted an enormous price increase, taking corn and wheat prices to record
levels this summer. Energy futures prices also set records, with natural
gas posting an all-time-high price last month, more than $1 per million
British thermal units higher than last winter's peak. And crude-oil futures
prices also spiked in the last three months of the year, flirting with the
$27-a-barrel mark for the first time since the Persian Gulf War.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Sumitomo's Trading Losses</b></p>
<p>"On a price-action basis, you couldn't ask for a better year," says Neal
Shear, managing director for Morgan Stanley in New York. "The trend was
very rewarding for those who were long."</p>
<p>Despite notable upswings in some commodity prices however, the most
striking price move of the year was downward -- in copper. This summer,
copper-futures prices tumbled 35% over a little more than two months when
Sumitomo Corp. revealed huge trading losses blamed on head metals trader
Yasuo Hamanaka.</p>
<p>Since then, regulators and exchanges have been looking to improve
safeguards, copper prices have struggled to recover and many banks and
dealers have felt the repercussions of Sumitomo's $2.6 billion loss.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Flat Trading Volume</b></p>
<p>Overall, U.S. trading volume for commodities futures flattened, rising
only 0.24% over the first 11 months of 1996, according to the Futures
Industry Association. Those numbers disappointed some market participants
who expected the market to bounce back after 1995's declines of about 6.6%.
"The economic atmosphere wasn't conducive to strong commodity markets in
1996," says William O'Neill, chief futures strategist for Merrill Lynch.
"We can't get too much worse."</p>
<p>Specifically, commodities bears say that the current stock-market boom
and low inflation growth doesn't encourage general investment in hard
assets. They say once a correction in the stock market comes, a rise in
general commodities prices will follow.</p>
<p>But other commodity-fund managers say opportunities exist in commodities
right now. In fact, while the Knight-Ridder-Commodity Research Bureau Index
reflected little movement in commodities prices when compared with January
1996, the energy-weighted Goldman Sachs Commodity Index increased about
5%.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Good Year for GSCI</b></p>
<p>The return on a long GSCI investment was about 32% in 1996, the best
year for the index since 1989. Most of the returns didn't come from
long-term price increases, but sudden jumps accentuated by short-term
supply crunches. "The tight inventories turned small events into large
events," says Steven Strongin, chief commodities strategist at Goldman
Sachs.</p>
<p>Some analysts say the GSCI investment in spot-month contracts got lucky
in a year when oil prices showed the only significant, sustained growth.
Further, the index was helped by the growth of just-in-time inventory
strategies, a trend that strengthens demand for short-term futures
contracts. Even Mr. Strongin expects 1997 to be potentially less
price-friendly for commodities investors, predicting declines in returns
from agricultural commodity and metals investments.</p>
<p>Here's a look at some markets:</p>
<p><b>PRECIOUS METALS:</b> At the beginning of
1996, traders asked, "Can the price of gold hit $400?" Now, 1997 beckons
with a new question: "How low can it go?"</p>
<p>Excluding last January's $20 a troy ounce upward run for the precious
metal, gold prices have been in the doldrums, dropping about 11% since the
beginning of February.</p>
<p>"At the beginning of the year, concern about global markets" pushed the
price of gold higher, says Mr. O'Neill of Merrill Lynch. But then the bond
market and the stock market persevered, "and it's been like Chinese water
torture [for gold] -- losing 10 cents here, 10 cents there."</p>
<p>Analysts say the fundamentals affecting gold prices are shifting. The
growth of financial instruments for investing in foreign currencies and
interest rates has partially eclipsed gold's traditional role as a hedge to
economic hard times.</p>
<p>But with stocks and bonds posting healthy returns in 1996, it was hardly
a time to test that theory. "There was almost a universe of gloom in the
gold market," says Andy Smith, precious-metals analyst for UBS Ltd. in
London. "There's hardly a fundamental argument to buy it."</p>
<p>Indeed, producers, banks and investors all had reason to sell in 1996.
Producers sold forward, or locked in prices for future sales, thereby
driving prices down.</p>
<p>In Europe, some central banks, feeling pressure to meet European
Monetary Union financial requirements to reduce debt, have considered
selling gold. Debate has raged recently in the gold community on whether or
not the potential selling will actually occur, but for many market
participants, the rumors have been enough to keep a steady downward
pressure on prices.</p>
<p>Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group in New York, says
producers and central banks have had less impact when compared with daily
traders who kept gold in a narrow trading range since the middle of 1996.
"When the price gets to $380 [a troy ounce], they sell, and when it gets to
$370, they buy," says Mr. Christian. "The volatility has been largely
absent."</p>
<p>Silver and platinum prices also declined in 1996. For silver, demand is
increasing world-wide, especially in photography. But total mining
production also is increasing and is projected to shoot up an additional
10% in 1997. For platinum, increasing reliance on cheaper alternatives such
as palladium and aluminum are hurting demand somewhat, especially in
industrial sectors.</p>
<p>For 1997, analysts predict little change in precious metals' trading
range unless the stock market experiences a significant correction of 10%
or more.</p>
<p><b>COPPER:</b> Six months after the
announcement of billion-dollar trading losses at Sumitomo, the copper
futures market is still trying to recover.</p>
<p>Copper-futures prices gained back about half the losses from a plunge
last summer that took prices to 85 cents from about $1.30 a pound. Now,
analysts and traders looking toward 1997 differ on whether or not the
market can fully recover to pre-Sumitomo prices.</p>
<p>In fact, there is now a heightened degree of skepticism in this market,
reflecting the possibility that other hidden stockpiles will turn up on the
market. "There are still several issues with Sumitomo," says Richard
Hirsch, vice president of metals trading for Deutsche Morgan Grenfell in
New York. "First, has the position been completely closed or
transferred?"</p>
<p>Such skepticism restrained price increases the last two months of 1996,
despite the six-year record-low inventory stockpiles at the London Metal
Exchange. Although the price moved up to modest post-Sumitomo highs of
about $1.10 a pound on Comex, analysts say a similar price increase in 1995
would have sent the market near $1.50 or above. "The price didn't move
higher because of the fallout of Sumitomo and the constant rumors about
stocks," says Bette Raptopoulos,  copper analyst for Prudential Securities
in New York. The Sumitomo trading losses "demoralized the market and
destabilized it."</p>
<p>Indeed, the Sumitomo incident also put the copper market on edge for any
sign of new supplies. When a report emerged in November that 500,000 metric
tons of copper were being stored in Rotterdam warehouses, copper futures
prices fell several cents before discounting the rumor as a statistical
error.</p>
<p>Some analysts expect a bumpy return to pre-Sumitomo prices. James Steel
of Refco Inc. in New York, for instance, predicts the supply of copper will
outpace demand, keeping prices on a downward trend in 1997. "The market
will be close to deluged with supply," says Mr. Steel. "Latin America is
coming on like a storm, and there's a chance for double-digit production
increases in Chile and Peru."</p>
<p>Ms. Raptopoulos is much more bullish for 1997, forecasting a return to
pre-Sumitomo prices of about $1.30 to $1.40 a pound. "Because I believe
that the economy will fare well, my perception is quite constructive," says
Ms. Raptopoulos.</p>
<p><b>CRUDE OIL:</b> A funny thing happened
while Iraq was getting ready to get back into the crude-exporting business:
Oil prices climbed. And a funnier thing happened after Baghdad and the
United Nations finally came to terms on implementing the long-awaited
oil-for-food accord: Prices continued to move up.</p>
<p>But 1996 was just that kind of year. With exceptionally lean
inventories, very strong demand and a long, chilly 1995-96 winter, futures
trading could hardly be expected to be placid. It wasn't, and Iraq added
more volatility to a mercurial mix that produced a better than 50% increase
in the value of the near-month crude contract on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.</p>
<p>The contract hit its low mark of $17.45 a barrel early in 1996, on Jan.
29. By that time, Baghdad had sent signals that it was, finally, serious
about negotiating with the U.N. over Resolution 986, which the Security
Council passed in 1995 to let Iraq sell as much as $1 billion of crude
every 90 days for the purchase of humanitarian goods and services. The
specter of the unleashing of more than 500,000 barrels of new oil onto the
market each day pushed prices down, though not for long.</p>
<p>It turned out that the world actually needed Iraqi oil, and when
implementation of the accord was abruptly called off in the summer, the
industry, which had for several months been counting on the extra supplies,
was disappointed. Then, in December, when the first barrels began to leave
Iraq, the contract reached its year's high of $26.75 a barrel  as cold
weather settled across the Northern Hemisphere.</p>
<p>Is there an end to the rally in sight in 1997? "That depends a lot on
inventories, and the weather," says Andrew Dickson with GSC Energy Corp.
Another long and cold winter could put enough stress on the system to keep
the pressure on prices, and skimpy inventories of both crude and petroleum
products will make traders nervous, often a prescription for a bull
market.</p>
<p><b>NATURAL GAS:</b> Cold-winter spurts
pushed natural-gas prices up to record prices in 1996, a volatile year. A
colder-than-normal January and February combined with a chilly November to
keep storage levels low and prices high.</p>
<p>In fact, the price of natural gas beat its old record price from 1995 by
a dollar, hitting $4.60 per million British thermal units Dec. 16 before
losing nearly $2 in the last two weeks of the year. "Weather came into
play, and we had a pretty dynamic market," says John Saucer, energy analyst
at Smith Barney in Houston.</p>
<p>Commercial firms and speculators drove up prices from the year's low in
September of about $1.80, to more than double in less than three months. In
1995, "we had different weather patterns," says Michael Barbis, natural-gas
analyst for UBS Securities in New York. "Then, the cold was focused to the
east;" [in 1996], the cold really spread everywhere."</p>
<p>The increase in prices was accentuated in November, when below-normal
temperatures blanketed high-consuming regions in the Midwest and Northeast.
Meanwhile, supplies were low, analysts say, partially because of a slowing
of imports from Canada. Storage levels also were depleted because of the
cold winter in 1995-96, which kept levels behind all year. "We entered
[1996] with storage well below [1995], and then had one of the coldest
Novembers on record," says Gerry Saccente,  a natural-gas trader for
Chicago Corp. in New York.</p>
<p>In the last two weeks of the year, however, the weather turned warmer
and prices shifted down below $3 a million BTUs. The price this year could
fall into a lower range than 1996 because of an expected 2% increase in
U.S. production, analysts say.</p>
<p><b>GRAINS:</b> Futures markets for corn,
wheat and soybeans have a tough act to follow in 1997.</p>
<p>The past 12 months featured some of the most volatile grain prices in
recent history, as weather moved the market dramatically. Records were set
for both price and volume.</p>
<p>The moves were considerable to say the least. Corn-futures prices
marched up 57% from the beginning of the year to a record-setting $5.48 a
bushel in July. But then, prices plunged 51% to year lows in December to
below $2.60 a bushel. Wheat-futures prices also skyrocketed to an all-time
high to about $7 a bushel, doubling in prices since early 1995. But
better-than-expected weather and a significant increase in world-wide
supply popped the overblown market in a matter of weeks, bringing prices
down below $4 a bushel.</p>
<p>Agricultural trading volume at the Chicago Board of Trade increased
dramatically in 1996 to record levels, up 40% on soybeans, 35% on corn, and
13% on wheat. On the Tokyo Grain Exchange, corn futures volume more than
doubled and soybean volume more than tripled.</p>
<p>Increasing world-wide demand and an expectation of record-low crop
production because of unfavorable weather led to high prices early in 1996.
For wheat, conditions stayed dry through May, while for corn and soybeans,
weather remained dry in key producing regions into June. Because of the
weather early in the year, the nation's granaries held a precariously low
amount, just 426 million bushels of corn at one point in September, the
lowest level since the '70s.</p>
<p>But just when supply concerns pushed prices into the record-breaking
range, rains and international supply spoiled the bullish party. Analysts
say farmers planted eight million more acres of corn alone in 1996, and
large crops also came from Europe, Australia and South America. "The high
prices encouraged shifts in planting -- area and yield went up," explains
Dale Gustafson, grains analyst for Smith Barney.</p>
<p>Weather also influenced supply and a crop that far-exceeded original
expectations. Timely summer rains and warm temperatures late into the
season boosted the 1996 U.S. corn and soybean crop to near record
levels.</p>
<p>Several factors will add to further rebuilding of supplies in coming
years, analysts say. First, genetically enhanced crops could increase
yields as the acceptance of the concept grows gradually. Also,
freedom-to-farm legislation passed in the U.S. in 1996, and gaining
momentum world-wide, will allow farmers to build up supplies when market
conditions warrant.</p>
<p>Analysts expect 1997 prices to stay in ranges well below last year's
unprecedented postings. Wheat is expected to average about $4 a bushel and
corn about $2.60, on strong harvests and weaker export demand. On the
upside, analysts say a growing livestock sector could increase demand for
grains in the coming year.</p>
<p>Soybean demand could outpace its grain cousins because of the rapid
growth in China, which recently switched from being an exporter to an
importer of soybean products. "If there are any problems with production,
the market is liable to have a large price advance. There's no cushion in
supply," says Anne Frick, analyst for Prudential Securities in New
York.</p>
<p>More bearish analysts say the price will generally stay below $7 a
bushel on the likelihood that many U.S. farmers will shift production from
corn to soybeans in 1997. Also, they say moist growing conditions in South
America will lead to record crops there.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Dollar Poised to Rise Further,<br>
But the Rally May Fade Later</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>If you want to bet on the dollar in 1997, move fast.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>That's the view of the gurus who get paid big bucks for advising
multinational corporations, institutional investors and governments on
which way the fickle foreign-exchange market is headed. Nearly all see the
greenback continuing to climb early on, only to fade as the year
progresses. Where they differ is in the timing and degree of the
decline.</p>
<p>"We may see 1.60 marks and maybe" a higher dollar against the yen in the
first half of 1997, says James O'Neill, chief currency economist at
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. in London. "The U.S. economy is in pretty
reasonable shape by most standards, and [Federal Reserve Chairman] Alan
Greenspan is doing a spectacular job." Additional dollar props, he says,
include "the dreadful gloom in Japan and the great uncertainty in Europe
about EMU" -- European economic and monetary union, slated for 1999.</p>
<p>Then comes the bad news. Mr. O'Neill is among those who believe that as
the year progresses, financing a growing U.S. trade deficit will become
increasingly difficult. "And in the second half of the year, people are
going to worry about a turnaround in both European and Japanese interest
rates as their economies gather further steam."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>No Interest in a Rising Dollar</b></p>
<p>In 12 months, Mr. O'Neill sees the dollar falling back to 1.45 marks and
105 yen.</p>
<p>Michael Burke, a Citibank economist, is even more pessimistic. His
six-month forecast roughly matches Mr. O'Neill's year-end projection. By
December 1997, Mr. Burke figures the dollar will be at 1.40 marks and 95
yen, respectively 9% and 18% weaker than now.</p>
<p>"The yen will be the strongest of the three major currencies" this year,
says Mr. Burke. Like Mr. O'Neill, he sees the dollar being unhinged by a
pickup in Japan's economy and a rising Japanese bilateral trade surplus
with the U.S.</p>
<p>What's more, he says, Washington and Tokyo have no interest in a
steadily rising dollar. "In the U.S., industry and labor could renew their
complaints about international competitiveness," says Mr. Burke.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he argues that Japanese corporations have already adjusted to
a stronger yen by shifting production capacity to less-expensive regions.
"Any further weakness for the yen makes that shift unprofitable," says Mr.
Burke.</p>
<p>That's a different story from 1996, when foreign central banks cut
interest rates and purchased record amounts of U.S. Treasurys in an attempt
to push the dollar higher, boost exports, quicken growth and lower
unemployment.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'The Comeback Kid'</b></p>
<p>For the dollar, 1996 was the year of "the comeback kid." At year end,
the dollar stood at 1.54 marks and 115.85 yen,  compared with 1.4360 marks
and 103.50 when it began. "The dominant theme in all financial markets was
the willingness of the Japanese and Germans to devote monetary policy
almost entirely to undermining their currencies," says Kit Juckes, a
currency strategist at NatWest Markets in London.</p>
<p>A second, related, major theme in 1996 was "the pursuit of yield," says
Ravi Bulchandani, an international economist at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. in
London. "Currencies with high yields did well; that can be seen especially
in sterling, where interest-rate increases and the prospect for more to
come turbocharged the currency 10% against the dollar and nearly 19%
against the mark." At the same time, low-yielding currencies such as the
yen and Swiss franc sank, 11% and more than 14%, respectively against the
dollar.</p>
<p>Not expecting much change in those twin dollar supports in 1997, Mr.
Bulchandani predicts the U.S. currency will rise to as high as 1.65 marks
and 120 yen by late June before retreating to 1.60 marks and 114 yen in
December. He sees the dollar buoyed by "higher [U.S.] rates based on strong
economic growth and official preference for a stronger dollar."</p>
<p>The greenback's biggest threat, he says, would be recession, which
Morgan Stanley economists don't expect. Unlike Messrs. O'Neill and Burke,
he doubts the U.S. trade deficit will be a big "dollar negative" unless it
worsens significantly. "The trade account is a known problem," he says. The
EMU is a wild card. But Mr. Bulchandani says it won't be a big "dollar
negative/Deutsche mark positive" unless Europe abandons the single-currency
project altogether, which he doubts.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>A Different Angle</b></p>
<p>Paul Chertkow, head of global currency research at Union Bank of
Switzerland in London comes to similar conclusions, but from a different
angle. Based on the 66% correlation between Japan's current account surplus
as a percentage of overall economic growth and the yen's trade-weighted
index, albeit with a 12 to 14 quarter lag, he says that "even if the
surplus begins to rise, there would be a considerable lag before that trend
adversely impacted the dollar."</p>
<p>Other dollar supports, says Mr. Chertkow, are Japan's low-interest-rate
policy, "encouraging Japanese life-insurance companies to search for higher
yields in overseas markets, particularly the U.S. Treasury market," and the
Bank of Japan's determination to prevent the dollar from sliding below the
100-yen level.</p>
<p>As for Europe, he argues that Germany and France need a strengthening
dollar "to facilitate entry into the brave new world on Jan. 1, 1999," when
the single currency is to take effect.</p>
<p>Messrs. O'Neill and Burke regard such forecasts as too rosy. "To break
out of its long-term downtrend -- dating back to 1973 when the U.S. went
off the gold standard -- the dollar will need to get above 1.60 marks and
stay there," says Mr. Burke. He also contends the Bundesbank can't "devalue
its way out of a weak economy" by letting the mark weaken beyond 1.60
"because foreigners, who already own over one trillion Deutsche marks,
could flee."</p>
<p>Goldman's Mr. O'Neill cautions, "At some stage [this] year, the
liquidity boom [that has fueled a stronger dollar and global stock and
bond-market rallies] will come to an end."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Stocks Fuel 80's-Style Art Rally,<br>
With Help of Celebrity Auctions</h2>

<p><b>By A<font size="-1">LEXANDRA</font> P<font size="-1">EERS</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>Spurred on by a climbing stock market, in 1996, collectors of art and
antiques lifted some prices back to the levels of the roaring 1980s.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>But the art-market rally wasn't really about paintings. While there were
some strong sales in the core fields of contemporary and Impressionist art,
the eyebrow-raising prices were paid for celebrity collectibles (the
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis estate sale brought $34.4 million), for Asian
art and for American paintings (a record of $11.1 million was set for a
John Singer Sargent). Perhaps most surprisingly, a spectacular sterling
silver soup tureen sold for $10.3 million.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was a strong year for the decorative arts, normally
considered second-tier to the paintings market. Museum exhibitions such as
the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Charles Rennie Mackintosh show and the
traveling exhibition of the craftsmanship of Faberge were among the most
successful of the year.</p>
<p>But the market's general resurgence came too late for many galleries,
some of which took on so much debt in the 1980s that even a pickup in sales
wasn't sufficient to handle the load. Among the closing galleries was
veteran Old Masters dealership Colnaghi, which closed its Madison Avenue
operations, and Peter Joseph, a leader in the furniture field.</p>
<p>In some cases, the market's recovery was overstated. While
contemporary-art sales improved -- the top-selling artwork of the year was
a Willem de Kooning that brought $15.6 million at Christie's International
PLC -- the demand was limited to older, established contemporary
artists.</p>
<p>There were a few "staggeringly obscene" auction prices, but the middle
market was "sluggish with occasional bursts of enthusiasm," says New York
art dealer David Killen.</p>
<p>Among younger artists, those working in video or other untraditional
media captured much of the attention. Matthew Barney, who has done
avant-garde films and performance art, won the prestigious Hugo Boss prize,
a new hotly contested grant from the German clothing firm.</p>
<p>In the nonprofit sector, competition for donor dollars was never
fiercer. The Shelburne Museum of Art in Vermont took the controversial step
of selling several works of art to raise operating funds; a series of
auctions in November raised $32.8 million. The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum
in New York also is strapped for cash.</p>
<p>The London art market lost much business to New York, especially late in
the year when the pound strengthened, prompting Christie's Chief Executive
Christopher Davidge to relocate to the U.S., at least temporarily.</p>
<p>This year look for both major auction houses to move their U.S.
headquarters: Sotheby's Holdings Inc. to New York's Columbus Circle, a more
central location than its current site on the East Side; and Christie's to
a retrofitted garage in Rockefeller Center that offers more space than its
current quarters. Expect the two major museum openings scheduled for this
year to be postponed because of construction delays: the Richard
Meier-designed complex that is the new Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the
Guggenheim's new satellite museum in Bilboa, Spain.</p>
<p>Competition between the auction houses will heat up in the fields of
jewelry, American furniture and contemporary art. And there is likely to be
an announcement from Sotheby's that the personal effects of the Duke and
Duchess of Windsor will be going on the auction block.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Bets on China and Hong Kong<br>
Paid Off for Investors in Asia</h2>

<p>China and its neighbors -- Hong Kong and Taiwan -- were the right Asian
bets for investors in 1996. Japan's stock market again proved disappointing
as an economic recovery there sputtered.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>In Hong Kong, which many American investors treat as a proxy for China,
the Hang Seng Index surged 34% in 1996. The property market, which plays a
huge role in the land-short colony's economy, perked up amid growing
confidence in a smooth transition from British to Chinese rule  July 1 --
and hopes that wealthy mainland Chinese would snap up luxury apartments and
office space.</p>
<p>China's own stock markets in Shanghai and Shenzhen lived up to their
reputation for giving investors a wild ride. After a long period of steep
decline, they skyrocketed in 1996.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Asia, results were mixed last year. The Taipei market,
whose results often reflect events in Hong Kong and China, soared. Stocks
slipped in Singapore, but rose in neighboring Malaysia. Markets in
Australia and New Zealand rose about 10%.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">European Stocks, Hot Last Year,<br>
Could Lose Some Steam in 1997</h2>

<p>The word in Europe is that the party can't last forever.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>While investors are toasting high double-digit gains from most European
markets in 1996, analysts already are starting to warn that 1997 might be a
bit more sober. "The year was characterized by a universal bull market in
equities," says Andrew Bell, European strategist at BZW Ltd. in London.
"But 1997 is going to be a bit patchy. We are going to get a much more
subdued performance next year."</p>
<p>On average, European stocks rose 20% last year, according to the Eurotop
100 index, below the performance of U.S. stocks but far better than
slumping Japanese stocks. Returns in individual European countries ranged
as high as 52% in Helsinki and 28% in Frankfurt to as low as 12% in
Britain. The sectors that have performed well include chemicals, metals,
oils, telecommunications and some consumer stocks, such as home furnishings
and retailers.</p>
<p>Low inflation, low interest rates, slow growth and strong bond markets
fueled stock gains in 1996. But analysts say the current environment can't
get much better, so the chance for disappointment is becoming more likely.
Although interest rates are expected to stay low until the end of 1997,
there is greater pressure on earnings to grow enough to justify high stock
prices.</p>
<p>And the fuel bonds received from countries working to meet
budget-deficit requirements in the beginning stages of European Monetary
Union has run its course beyond realistic expectations, analysts say.</p>
<p>"Far too much weight has been placed on EMU, which has created a bit of
a bubble, and the markets are looking ready for a correction," Mr. Bell
says.</p>
<p>Mr. Bell says investors who are looking for big double-digit returns
will have to turn to Asia, excluding Japan. But in Europe, he says there is
a chance that the U.K. could be a "dark horse" and end up a strong
performer because its economy is growing faster compared with Continental
countries. Overall, he predicts European shares will have about a 9% return
in 1997.</p>
<p>Mike Young, European strategist at Goldman Sachs in London, paints a bit
more positive picture of Europe in 1997. He says Europe still has a strong
economic-recovery story that could generate better-than-expected earnings
in areas such as Germany, Scandinavia and Spain, which could be among the
best performers in 1997.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Americas Markets Follow<br>
Wildly Different Courses</h2>

<p>Markets in the Americas set wildly different courses in 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Some surged ahead of strong returns in the U.S. -- the Venezuelan market
was one of the best performers in the world. Canada to the north and Mexico
to the south posted returns more or less in line with the U.S., while a few
smaller markets posted losses for the year.</p>
<p>As the new year begins, conventional wisdom is that Canada, Venezuela,
Brazil and Argentina already have enjoyed their better runs, while Mexico
and Colombia are expected to move higher. Chile and Peru appear to be ready
to emerge, modestly, from their 1996 doldrums.</p>
<p>Looking forward, economic factors are expected to be more meaningful to
market watchers than political ones. Inflation, the scourge of the region
for most of the past two decades, has been largely tamed. The
French-English controversy has been settled (momentarily) in Canada, while
coups and revolutions seem relegated to Latin America's stormy past.</p>
<p>Not that political tremors have disappeared. The end of 1996 saw a
resurgence of terrorism in Peru and Colombia, while throughout the past
year, political scandal roiled markets from Mexico to Argentina.</p>
<p>However, in most markets the closely watched indicators for coming
months will be things such as trade figures, oil prices, and
government-spending deficits. While Canada continues to be our most
dependable trading partner, Latin America is beginning to emerge as a
"mature" emerging market.</p>
<p>For investors, that means the roller-coaster days may be behind them.
But so are the easy profits and spectacular losses.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">New Company Stock Listings<br>
Rise on Big Board and Nasdaq</h2>

<p><b>By D<font size="-1">EBORAH</font> L<font size="-1">OHSE</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>The two largest markets in the U.S. had a bumper crop of new companies
listing with them for the first time during 1996 -- a year in which record
numbers of companies came public for the first time and a roaring bull
market enticed scores of foreign companies to U.S. markets.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The New York Stock Exchange, the nation's largest market, added 279
companies' names to its listings, while the No. 2 Nasdaq Stock Market added
1,009 new companies.</p>
<p>Of course, both lost companies as well. On Nasdaq, hundreds of companies
were delisted, and a record 97 defected to the Big Board during the year,
leaving Nasdaq with 5,576 companies listed on its market at year end, 454
more than the previous year. That fell short of 1993's record of 498 net
Nasdaq additions. The Big Board, which has a rule effectively barring most
companies from defecting to other markets, ended 1996 with 2,907 listed
companies, a net gain of 232 companies.</p>
<p>Nasdaq, true to its reputation as the main home for smaller, start-up
companies, attracted the lion's share of newly public small-capitalization
companies. A total of 687 newly public U.S. companies listed on Nasdaq,
compared with 117 on the Big Board, which has more-stringent listing
standards that may prohibit listing by many less-mature companies. The IPOs
listing on Nasdaq had market caps averaging $174 million. The average
market cap of all the new companies listing on the Big Board, meanwhile,
was around $350 million.</p>
<p>The American Stock Exchange, which has had trouble competing in recent
years with the Big Board's global stature for larger stocks and Nasdaq's
record in signing up start-up companies, listed only 73 new companies, with
an average market cap of $146.3 million. And factoring in companies that
left, merged with another company or were delisted, the Amex ended the year
with 18 fewer companies than it started with -- although the Amex points
out that it lost fewer companies in 1996 than in the year before.</p>
<p>"Nasdaq's growth was heavily in smaller IPOs, while New York saw a mix
of very large IPOs and major switches from Nasdaq," says Patrick Healy,
president of the Issuer Network, which advises companies on listing issues.
At the same time, he says, while the Amex had an increase in new companies
listing on its exchange, it "had no real large-trading-volume stocks
listing."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, volume surged on the major markets in 1996, although
comparing Nasdaq's volume with that of the Big Board is a tricky matter.
That's because on Nasdaq's dealer market, a single trade is frequently
counted as one purchase and one sale, while on the Big Board's auction
market, the majority of trades are counted as a single transaction. The
different methods result in what some consider double-counting of Nasdaq's
true trading volume.</p>
<p>Still, both Nasdaq and the Big Board reported record years for trading
volume. The average daily volume reported by Nasdaq rose to 543.3 million
shares, up from 401.4 million in 1995, while on the Big Board, daily volume
averaged 411.7 million shares, up from 346.1 million.</p>
<p>The Amex reported daily share volume of only 22.1 million shares on
average in 1996, up from 20 million in 1995.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Big Board Program-Trading<br>
Reached Record Pace in 1996</h2>

<p>NEW YORK -- Program trading on the New York Stock Exchange accounted for
13.3% of overall volume, or an average of 53.5 million daily shares,
through Dec. 20, 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>It was the most active year to date for program trading, in both volume
and percentage, surpassing the previous record of 11.9% in 1993. Program
trading involves the purchase or sale of a basket of at least 15 stocks
with a total value of $1 million or more.</p>
<p>Some critics contend that program trading has contributed to sudden,
sharp swings in the market, and many believe it played a significant role
in the stock-market crash of 1987. Soon after the crash, the Big Board
began releasing program-trading data on a weekly basis in response to
investor concern.</p>
<p>The best-known form of program trading is index arbitrage, in which
traders buy and sell groups of stocks with offsetting trades of futures and
options. Through December, index arbitrage accounted for 30.3% of overall
program trading, unchanged from the total through December of the preceding
year.</p>
<p>The two most active program-trading firms through the end of September,
the latest month for which figures were available, were Morgan Stanley
&amp; Co., and First Options of Chicago Inc.</p>
<p>The Big Board's "collar," which is invoked whenever the Dow Jones
Industrial Average moves 50 points or more in a single direction during any
one-hour period, was triggered a record 119 times, sometimes more than once
on a single trading day. The collar forces index arbitrage trades to go
against the trend of the market, in effect slowing down program trades
during a rally or decline.</p>

<p>Tighter and tighter and tighter.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>That's how the New York Stock Exchange's 50-point "collar" feels -- and
likely will continue to feel -- to program traders. The collar, which
restricts their ability to engage in a certain type of computer-guided
trading whenever the Dow Jones Industrial Average is up or down 50 points
on the day, was almost an every-other-day occurrence in 1996.</p>
<p>All told, the collar was triggered a record 119 times last year, or more
than twice a week. The collar had not been used that many times in the
previous five and a half years, since it was implemented in mid-1990.</p>
<p>Market watchers see frequent triggering of the collar, which was
designed to prevent program traders from aggravating big swings in stock
prices, as a sign of market volatility. But the amount of volatility it
signifies has shrunk considerably: 50 points currently represents only
about 0.75% of the Dow.</p>
<p>Most traders consider a daily gain or loss of less than 1% unremarkable.
But officials of the Big Board aren't persuaded. Though they gave ground
and agreed in 1996 to the first changes in other stock market
"circuit-breakers," they aren't budging on the 50-point collar, officially
known as Rule 80A.</p>
<p>Under pressure from securities regulators, market participants and
officials of other stock markets, Big Board officials proposed increasing
the size of a market drop that would trigger a halt in stock trading. That
proposal calls for markets to shut for 30 minutes whenever the Dow plunges
350 points in a day and for another hour if, after that break, the Dow's
one-day loss grows to 550 points. Those levels currently are set at 250
points and 400 points. The SEC is expected to approve the changes within
several weeks.</p>
<p>Around midyear, the SEC approved the first-ever change in those trading
halt rules, known as Rule 80B. It allowed the Big Board to cut the length
of the halts from their original durations of one hour at 250 points and
two hours at 400 points.</p>
<p>The trading-halt rules have never been used since they were put in place
in 1988 to prevent a repeat of the panic-driven selling that exacerbated
the market crash of October 1987. But a close call in March, when the Dow
plunged nearly 218 points before recovering, led many traders and market
officials to fear that the trigger points were too low, given the Dow's
steady rise in recent years.</p>
<p>While the reasoning that led to the changes in other circuit-breakers
could be applied to the 50-point collar, Big Board officials have
repeatedly vowed that they won't change the collar rule. But if the Dow
rises more than 25% a year for two more years, as it did in the last two,
they may have to eat those words.</p>

<p>NEW YORK --
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mo&amp;page=15">Philip Morris</a> Cos.
ended 1996 as the highest-yielding stock in the Dow Jones Industrial
Average, with its $4.80 annual dividend resulting in a yield of about
4.2%.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Investment bank
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=jpm&amp;page=15">J.P. Morgan</a> &amp;
Co. was second in terms of yield, at 3.5%, followed by three energy
companies:
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tx&amp;page=15">Texaco</a>
Inc., 3.4%;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=chv&amp;page=15">Chevron</a>
Corp., 3.25%; and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=xon&amp;page=15">Exxon</a> Corp.,
3.18%.</p>
<p>The next five in order of yield were:
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a> Corp., 3%;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=gm&amp;page=15">General Motors</a> Corp., 2.9%;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ip&amp;page=15">International Paper</a> Co., 2.5%;
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dd&amp;page=15">DuPont</a> Co., 2.4%; and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mmm&amp;page=15">Minnesota Mining &amp;
Manufacturing</a> Co., 2.3%.</p>
<p>The lowest yielding dividend paying stock in the average was
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dis&amp;page=15">Walt Disney</a> Co., 0.6%. Two components,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=bs&amp;page=15">Bethlehem Steel</a> Corp. and
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=z&amp;page=15">Woolworth</a> Corp., pay no dividend.</p>
<p>Many investors follow a strategy of buying the highest-yielding
constituents of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the so-called Dogs of the
Dow, at the start of the year, and holding them for a year. Several
brokerage houses offer unit trusts based on the strategy.</p>

<H1>Audio Round Table</H1>
<h2>Peering Into the Future</h2>
What next?
<P>
Will 1997 bring more of the same for stock investors: moderate economic growth accompanied by a seemingly unstoppable advance on Wall Street? Or has the bull market run its course? Where will the growth sectors be in the year to come, and what areas should investors avoid? Is the Dow Jones Industrial Average headed for new highs, or is the much-feared correction near?
<P>
To get a closer look at these and other issues, The Wall Street Journal Interactive Edition asked eight of Wall Street's investment strategists to peer into the future. Although each individual's assessment of the market's outlook varied widely, one consensus emerged: stock investors in 1997 will be in for a bumpy ride.

Most Profitable Year Ever</h2>

<b></b></p>
<p>Is there a record for setting records?</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>If there is, Wall Street probably snagged that one too in 1996. By most
measures, last year was the biggest, busiest, most profitable year ever for
U.S. financial markets. It had the biggest initial public offering, the
biggest initial public offering by a foreign company and the biggest sale
of 100-year bonds by a U.S. company.</p>
<p>Just about the only front on which it didn't break new ground was in
total sales of new stocks and bonds. Despite a 34% leap from the previous
year, the $953.4 billion raised in 1996 fell short of the $1.05 trillion
raised in 1993, the peak year for sales of mortgage securities, according
to Securities Data Co. of Newark, N.J.</p>
<p>Still, the same near-ideal conditions that drove the stock market to
record after record for the second straight year fueled an impressive
amount of underwriting activity. "Nobody expected this year to be a great
year in the stock market, so everybody was quite surprised," says Richard
Kauffman, head of equity capital markets at Morgan Stanley &amp; Co., a
unit of Morgan Stanley Group Inc.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Backlog of Stock Offerings</b></p>
<p>After a midyear lull, the financial markets came roaring back in the
fourth quarter and appeared to have strong momentum heading into the new
year. Entering January, there is a backlog of almost 200 stock offerings
seeking to raise more than $5 billion, says Securities Data.</p>
<p>In the last three months of 1996, sales of new stocks and bonds totaled
$251.6 billion, up 29% from the fourth quarter of 1995. That surge of
activity added to the windfall on Wall Street: Disclosed fees reaped by
securities firms jumped to a record $9.19 billion for the year.</p>
<p>"This was the busiest fourth quarter I can remember, without question,"
says Arthur Hyde III, head of debt capital markets at Salomon Brothers
Inc.</p>
<p>Low interest rates, steady growth in corporate profits and seemingly
unquenchable investor demand for shares of mutual funds combined to
obliterate the stock underwriting records set in 1993, the previous best
year for stock deals.</p>
<p>A calendar chock-full of initial and follow-on public offerings of stock
in companies young and old, foreign and domestic, churned out $114.9
billion in sales of new stock, according to Securities Data. That surpassed
the $102.4 billion in stock sold in 1993 and marked the fifth time in the
last six years that stock issuance rose from year to year.</p>
<p>A record $49 billion was raised through IPOs, including huge offerings
of stock in units of major companies and the privatization of foreign
businesses that had been state-owned. Some sectors of the fixed-income
market, including high-yield and asset-backed bonds, hit highs in 1996. The
notable exception was the mortgage-backed securities market, which hasn't
recovered since it collapsed in 1994.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mer&amp;page=15">Merrill Lynch</a> &amp; Co., the
largest securities firm, again was the leading underwriter of all stock and
bond issues, though the next three firms -- in order: Lehman Brothers,
Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. and Salomon -- all closed the gap in market share.
As it did in 1995, Lehman edged out Goldman for second place in total money
raised for issuers, but Goldman did more deals and earned more than twice
as much in disclosed fees.</p>
<p>"It was truly a terrific year, and we surely would take another one like
it," says Brian Hehir, a managing director in Merrill's global equity
capital markets group.</p>
<p>But for the second consecutive year end, even the most optimistic on
Wall Street are asking, How long can this keep going on? For the answer,
some on Wall Street are watching mutual funds and interest rates.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Astounding Inflow of Cash</b></p>
<p>"The key driver of demand has been cash coming into equity mutual
funds," says Morgan Stanley's Mr. Kauffman. An astounding $210 billion
flowed into stock funds in the first 11 months of the year, almost $100
billion more than a year earlier, according to the Investment Company
Institute, a mutual-fund industry group.</p>
<p>The biggest threat to that flow, Mr. Kauffman says, is an abrupt rise in
interest rates. "If interest rates start looking more attractive, there is
a risk that people would decide to switch from stock funds to bond
funds."</p>
<p>Investment pros fear that such a shift could have a more lasting impact
than the early summer sell-off of technology stocks that shook the markets
last year.</p>
<p>But Mr. Kauffman is sanguine about the market for follow-on offerings in
1997. Historically, the year after a large number of companies go public,
many of them return to tap the market again with another stock
offering.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Mergers and Privatizations</b></p>
<p>Absent a sharp rise in interest rates or an external shock to the
markets, investment bankers see continued underwriting activity fueled by
two continuing trends: corporate mergers and restructurings and the
privatization of foreign business, especially telephone companies.</p>
<p>Merger and acquisition activity hit a high in 1996, helping to power the
stock market's gains. But the breaking up of major corporations resulted in
some of the year's biggest new issues.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a> Corp.'s public sale of
stock in its equipment division, now named
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lu&amp;page=15">Lucent Technologies</a> Inc., was the
biggest U.S. IPO and the most lucrative transaction. Underwriters reaped
more than $100 million in fees for selling 112 million shares for $3.03
billion in April.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>King Telekom</b></p>
<p>Far and away the biggest new issue of the year world-wide was the $11.3
billion public sale of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dt&amp;page=15">Deutsche Telekom</a>
AG, formerly Germany's state-owned telecommunications company. Goldman
Sachs, the top underwriter of IPOs, managed the sale of $1.6 billion of
Deutsche Telekom's stock in the U.S.</p>
<p>Lehman Brothers led the underwriting in November of the U.S. portion of
a $1.03 billion sale of American depositary receipts of Cia Anonima
Nacional Telefonos de Venezuela. That deal was done as a standard public
offering because the company "wanted the prestige and stature of a New York
Stock Exchange listing," says Gregory Sacco, managing director in Lehman's
equity syndicate department.</p>
<p>But about one-third of the equity sales Lehman managed in 1996 were a
type of private placement known as 144A that aren't included in Securities
Data's rankings, Mr. Sacco says. Without them, Lehman ranked ninth among
stock underwriters with almost half of its volume of $4.56 billion coming
in the fourth quarter. "We haven't started fast but we've finished fast,"
Mr. Sacco says.</p>
<p>In the bond market, 1996 was a year of megadeals to pay for
megamergers.</p>
<p>To finance its acquisition of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lor&amp;page=15">Loral</a> Corp.,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lmt&amp;page=15">Lockheed Martin</a> Corp. sold $3.5 billion of
investment-grade bonds in six separate pieces on a single day in May.
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dis&amp;page=15">Walt Disney</a> Co. sold $2.6 billion of bonds in March to help pay
for its acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.</p>
<p>A clear sign of the confidence investors had about lending money to U.S.
corporations was the record issuance of so-called century bonds, which pay
a set rate of interest for 100 years. In December, in the biggest century
bond offering on record,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ibm&amp;page=15">International Business
Machines</a> Corp. sold $850 million of 100-year bonds. Demand for the
bonds, which were priced to yield 7.22%, was so high the offering was
increased from $600 million.</p>
<p>Until recently, investors would buy 100-year bonds only from the bluest
of blue-chip companies. But several less established borrowers, including a
casino operator and the government of China, sold century bonds in
1996.</p>
<p>Another powerful force in the bond market was the continued growth in
borrowing by foreign entities issuing so-called Yankee bonds. Total sales
of Yankee bonds soared to $89 billion in 1996, almost double the $46.6
billion issued in 1995.</p>
<p>As it did in 1995, Merrill led all underwriters of Yankee bonds with
about 20% of the market. In all, bond sales for foreign issuers is a
growing segment of total debt underwriting for Merrill, rising toward 30%
from about 10% a few years ago, says John Qua, co-head of global debt
capital markets at Merrill.</p>
<p>Mr. Qua says he is "guardedly optimistic" about the outlook for the
corporate bond market in the first half of 1997.</p>
<p>"We're generally optimistic rates will stay where they are or go
slightly lower. So, as long as the market stays calm. ...," Mr. Qua
says.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Underwriting Fees Soared<br>
To a Record $9.19 Billion</h2>

<p><b>By A<font size="-1">NITA</font> R<font size="-1">AGHAVAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>It was raining fees on Wall Street last year. Disclosed fees for
underwriting stocks and bonds surged 38% to $9.19 billion, breaking Wall
Street's 1993 record of $9.16 billion in underwriting fees, according to
Securities Data Co., a Newark, N.J., firm that tracks corporate-finance
activity.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The full-year fee totals were helped by a robust fourth quarter, when
fees climbed 14% to $2.46 billion from $2.15 billion in the same period in
1995.</p>
<p>But despite a blockbuster pipeline of new stock and bond issues, few
analysts expect the shower of fees to continue into 1997.</p>
<p>"It was a banner year for Wall Street," said Dean Eberling, a securities
analyst at Prudential Securities Inc. "But it creates hurdles in terms of
expectations that are hard to surpass."</p>
<p>Mr. Eberling said that if new cash flowing into mutual funds,
particularly stock funds, continues at the slower pace evident in the
second half of last year, it will be hard for Wall Street firms to
replicate 1996's showing in underwriting.</p>
<p>Behind last year's record fees was a red-hot market for underwriting new
stock issues. Fees for stock underwriting topped $5.8 billion, and
accounted for about two-thirds of total fees, according to Securities
Data.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=mer&amp;page=15">Merrill Lynch</a> &amp; Co., the
top-ranked underwriter of stocks and bonds, was the leading fee-earner,
netting $1.34 billion in disclosed fees last year, mainly on the back of
its bond-underwriting prowess.</p>
<p>Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. finished second, with $1.2 billion in fees to
its credit for lead-managing domestic stocks and bonds. Goldman's
impressive showing was largely because of its stock-underwriting clout.</p>
<p>Goldman's biggest coup last year was its role in the mammoth offering of
shares in
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=dt&amp;page=15">Deutsche
Telekom</a> AG, Germany's national telephone monopoly. According to
Securities Data, the deal produced a total of $40.1 million in disclosed
fees.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the biggest fee-generating deal last year was
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=t&amp;page=15">AT&amp;T</a> Corp.'s spinoff of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=lu&amp;page=15">Lucent Technologies</a> -- the largest initial
public offering in U.S. history -- which generated a huge $102.9 million in
fees for Wall Street underwriters. The largest beneficiaries of that were
its joint managers,
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ms&amp;page=15">Morgan Stanley</a>
&amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Asset-Backed Securities<br>
Flourish in a Hot Market</h2>

<p><b>By P<font size="-1">ATRICK</font> M<font size="-1">C</font>G<font size="-1">EEHAN</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>One true gauge of how hot the market is for certain types of securities
is the amount of debate among investment bankers.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>When the disputes grow so numerous and nasty that a summit must be
called to resolve them, the market in question usually is on fire. That was
the case with the market for asset-backed securities in 1996.</p>
<p>Driven by a big run-up in credit-card borrowings, the volume of new
asset-backed issues has nearly tripled in the past four years. Last year,
issuers of asset-backed securities raised $154 billion, a jump of 43% from
the $107.5 billion raised in 1995, according to Securities Data Co. of
Newark, N.J. The number of offerings soared 46% in 1996, rising to 569
issues from 389 in 1995, Securities Data said.</p>
<p>Asset-backed securities are created when banks and other lenders pool
loans they have made and sell pieces of the pool of scheduled repayments to
investors. Lenders use proceeds from the sale of the resulting securities,
which tend to offer slightly higher yields than government bonds, to make
more loans.</p>
<p>Investment banks are rushing to underwrite these deals because the fees
they produce are proportionally bigger than those received from standard
bond offerings, though smaller than the fees from new stock issues.</p>
<p>As usually happens in financial markets, success attracts competition.
For the first time, the top three underwriters controlled less than 45% of
the asset-backed market. And the number of firms that grabbed at least 5%
of the market grew to nine, from six in 1995.</p>
<p>"There is a lot of focus on the asset-backed market," says Jack Ross,
group head of asset-backed finance at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. "It's a very
fast-growing market, so there are a lot of people who want to be in it and
be in it in a big way."</p>
<p>But not all firms see the market the same way. There were so many
disagreements about how to define and measure the market that Securities
Data's president, Mark Lerch, called a summit in late November.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Heating Disputes</b></p>
<p>Around a conference table in midtown Manhattan, Mr. Lerch brought
together executives from most of the big firms. Each, it seemed, had his
own ideas about what should or should not count as an asset- backed deal in
the "league tables," the annual rankings of firms by the number and size of
the various stock and bond offerings they underwrite.</p>
<p>Not surprisingly, the most heated disputes pitted Merrill Lynch against
Lehman Brothers. The two firms vied all year for the top spot in the
asset-backed rankings. Lehman argued that Merrill was mislabeling deals
that belonged in the mortgage-backed category. Merrill fired back that
Lehman had a habit of conjuring up 11th-hour deals by buying up securities
in the open market and repackaging them as new asset-backed issues.</p>
<p>In fact, Lehman pulled off Tuesday just the sort of last-minute maneuver
Merrill feared: It announced the sale of $2.08 billion of repackaged bonds
backed by credit-card debt. That deal pushed Lehman past Merrill into first
place in underwriting asset-backed securities of every imaginable stripe,
with total sales of $24.48 billion, or 15.9% of the market, according to
Securities Data. Merrill wound up with sales of $23.26 billion, or
15.1%.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Playing Referee</b></p>
<p>Despite its best efforts to achieve consensus on what is and isn't an
asset-backed security, Securities Data decided not to decide. To appease
Merrill after Lehman's maneuver, Securities Data also published a ranking
of underwriters of securities that indisputably qualified as asset-backed.
Of course, in that ranking, Merrill was No. 1 with 16% market share, well
ahead of Lehman with 12.5%.</p>
<p>Mr. Lerch refused to try to determine a firm's motivation for doing a
deal. Over the years, "every firm on the Street has accused every other
firm of doing a deal only for league-table credit," says Mr. Lerch, who has
played the role of referee in similarly contentious meetings to hash out
how to measure the markets for other securities that defy easy
categorization.</p>
<p>Wall Street's propensity to invent and reinvent products is one of the
main factors at work in the asset-backed market. The market grew out of
banks' need to pass along the risks they were taking on by lending to
customers.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Securitizing Home Mortgages</b></p>
<p>In the 1970s, banks started securitizing pools of home mortgages,
pooling loans from around the country to reduce the chances that a downturn
in one region's economy would lead to a default. The success of
mortgage-backed securities led the financial engineers on Wall Street to
experiment with shorter-term loans, such as car and student loans and
credit-card borrowings.</p>
<p>Today, bankers say that just about any predictable stream of revenues
can be securitized and sold in pieces to investors. Lehman Brothers, one of
the more creative underwriters, has put together bond deals backed by
everything from royalty payments on oil in South American wells to loans to
Taco Bell restaurant franchisees.</p>
<p>William Lighten, co-head of asset-backed finance at Lehman, says there
are more than 50 types of assets underlying bonds outstanding. The market,
he adds, gives smaller companies better access to the capital they need to
grow, and gives investors opportunities to buy highly rated securities that
offer higher yields than Treasury bonds.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the fastest-growing U.S. companies in recent years has
been Green Tree Financial Corp., which finances manufactured-home purchases
and has been one of the biggest issuers of asset-backed securities. Wall
Street firms reaped more than $30 million in fees from underwriting Green
Tree offerings in 1996.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Sliding Rates Fuel Stock Gains</h2>

<p>Call it the Euro effect: As Europe's single-currency plan gained
political momentum throughout the year, the yield premium on Belgian
government bonds against German bunds nearly vanished. The fall in interest
rates helped propel Belgian equities to records.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The Bel-20 Index rose 21.5% to 1895.49. Smaller stocks helped lift the
market. Also boosting the market was the reappraisal of several companies
such as chemicals maker UCB SA, whose shares nearly doubled in value during
the year, or car-distribution and leasing company D'Ieteren, whose shares
rose more than 100%.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">U.K. Gains Lag Other Markets</h2>

<p>British stocks were a bit of bummer in 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Weighed down by political worries, a strong currency, a small
interest-rate increase and being out of the European Monetary Union,
British stocks lagged behind much of Europe. The Financial Times-Stock
Exchange 100 Share Index climbed only 11.6% to 4118.5.</p>
<p>The trend toward higher interest rates in the United Kingdom is one of
the major reasons British stocks didn't enjoy as strong a performance as
some other markets in 1996. In the fourth quarter, U.K. regulators raised
base rates by a quarter percentage point to 6%, and analysts estimate that
there will be another quarter-point rate rise in the first quarter of
1997.</p>
<p>"Britain is the only country that raised interest rates in 1996," says
Robert Buckland, a U.K. strategist at HSBC James Capel in London. "The U.K.
economy is growing twice as fast as many other economies and we are also
looking at U.K. rates going up in the New Year." Indeed, throughout 1996
other European countries continued to lower their base rates.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Markets May Suffer Downturn</h2>

<p>Scandinavian stock markets sizzled during 1996, but analysts caution
that prospects this year look less spectacular, with Stockholm, Helsinki,
Finland and Oslo likely to be drawn into a world-wide correction of
sky-high stock valuations.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Helsinki's HEX general index has surged 52% to 2595.9%, the best
performing bourse in Europe. Stockholm's Affarsvarlden Index was up 38% to
2402.94. Stockholm and Oslo's All-Share Index was up 32% to 968.37 during
the same period.</p>
<p>In the coming year, analysts see scant prospects for a repeat of the
plunge in interest rates that spurred big institutional investors to shift
from bonds into equities.</p>
<p>The Danish KFX share index pushed 29.9, or 28%, higher to end 1996 at
136.13, helped by Denmark's continued low-inflation growth and underpinned
by solid earnings among blue chips and banks.</p>
<p>Analysts say Copenhagen should continue to match gains by neighboring
equities markets in early 1997, though the country's opt-out from European
economic and monetary union could start weighing on shares in the longer
term.</p>

<p>The French stock market was slower than most to respond to the
high-octane mix of lower interest rates and corporate restructuring that
propelled other European markets higher through 1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>However, after an erratic start to the year, when the main French CAC-40
Index lurched forward some 10% before falling back to its starting point,
the market really took off in late summer. Since then it has climbed
strongly, ending the year 24% higher at 2315.73, close to its all-time high
of 2360.98, reached on Feb. 2, 1994.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Stocks Post Solid Returns</h2>

<p>German stocks were among the best-performing shares in Europe in
1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The DAX Index, the key gauge of 30 stocks traded at the Frankfurt Stock
Exchange, rose 28.2% to 2888.7 in 1996. But analysts caution that 1997 is
likely to have more moderate gains.</p>
<p>The DAX started the year with a bang, climbing nearly 2% on the first
day of trading, and moved gradually higher. It hit a string of all-time
highs, peaking at 2910 Dec. 5. The main reasons for Germany's banner year
were positive earnings expectations for most of Germany's industrial sector
(sparked in part by a weakening mark and signs of a late-year pickup in
growth), falling interest rates, corporate-restructuring plans and an
increased focus on shareholder value. German shares also received a big
boost from Wall Street's highflying performance.</p>
<p>Hot sectors were chemicals and autos, both of which are extremely
sensitive to the dollar's gyrations. The big loser was electronics,
particularly after both SAP AG and Siemens AG issued warnings of earnings
disappointments late in the year. Commerzbank is recommending cyclical
shares such as steel and energy as well as electronics in 1997.</p>
<p>Deutsche Telekom shared the spotlight with Europe's largest-ever initial
public offering. But without such a megaoffering in 1997, new issuance is
expected to slow dramatically.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Strong Economy Drives Market</h2>

<p>While the rest of Europe might be in the midst of trying to pick up its
economic growth, Ireland is enjoying a strong economy. New jobs created by
U.S. companies settling in Ireland, low interest rates and low inflation
are fueling the growth.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The Irish stock market performed better than many other European
markets, with the ISEQ Index of 64 shares traded in Dublin soaring 23% to
2725.63.</p>
<p>Domestic stocks were among the best performers on the Dublin exchange.
Shares of two major banks, Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland, make up
about one-third of the index. Another stock that performed well is CRH PLC,
a manufacturer of building materials that benefited from the economic
growth.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Market Stays Near 1995 Level</h2>

<p>The Italian stock market was among the worst performers in Europe, with
all its indexes swinging around the same levels as the end of 1995. The
Milan stock exchange BCI Index rose 13% to 666.4.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>And for 1997, the mood isn't bullish among analysts. Slow economic
growth and uncertainty last spring around election time weighed heavily on
the stock market. Also the reinforcement of the lira penalized corporate
earnings.</p>
<p>However, the stock market moved ahead thanks to a quick fall in the
inflation rate and consequent drop in interest rates as well as more
political stability in the second half of the year.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Dutch Market: Star Performer</h2>

<p>The Amsterdam Stock Exchange was one of the star performers among
European bourses, with the AEX Index surging 33.6% to 648.24.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Banking and insurance stocks played a big role in the rise, as they
account for more than a quarter of the index's weighting. But the overall
market was also helped by a reappraisal of Dutch equities, which have all
but lost their traditional discount against other European bourses.</p>

the Madrid General Index rose 39% to 444.77. With Spanish price-earnings
ratios low in comparison with other European markets, analysts say there's
still room for prices to rise a further 10% this year.</p>

<p>Corporate restructuring bolstered the Swiss stock market in 1996 and
rapid corporate change is expected to continue in 1997, contributing to
further market gains in the next 12 months.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The surprise announcement in March by Ciba-Geigy AG and Sandoz AG that
they would merge to form Novartis AG, the world's second-largest

two companies shot up, helping to boost the Swiss Market Index of blue-chip
stocks 20% to 3942.2.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Argentina's Policy Mirrors Fed</h2>

<p>Argentina's innovative convertibility system links the Argentine peso
one-to-one to the U.S. dollar and mandates that money supply not exceed
hard-currency reserves, leaving Argentine economic policy to be largely
determined by the Federal Reserve Board in the U.S.</p>

States," says Tim Love, head of emerging-markets strategy and research at
ING-Baring Securities Ltd. in London. "That's been very positive," he says,
in 1996, when the market has risen about 25%, in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Mr. Love is girding for a possible correction during the first half of
1997. But he expects the market to grow stronger as the year progresses,
with a total gain exceeding 20%, according to his preliminary
estimates.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Brazil Focuses on Politics</h2>

<p>As usual, market activity in Brazil will be dominated by the political
calendar. During the first quarter of 1997, the fractious Brazilian
Congress is expected to decide whether to approve a constitutional change
allowing President Fernando Henrique Cardoso to run for re-election when
his term ends at the end of next year.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The market is counting heavily on Mr. Cardoso getting the chance for a
reprise. He is the architect of the Real Plan, which has lowered chronic
Brazilian inflation to 1% a month from 50% a month in 1994. The market
ended more than 50% higher in 1996.</p>
<p>If re-election is approved, as expected, it would strengthen Mr.
Cardoso's hand to approve some badly needed constitutional measures
designed to rein in the Brazilian budget.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Rate Cuts Stimulate Economy</h2>

<p>Canadian equity markets took off like a shot in 1996, aided by interest
rates that declined faster than a falling safe.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The Bank of Canada cut rates 19 times between May 1995 and December
1996, responding to lower rates in the U.S. and seeking to stimulate the
Canadian economy. In December, three-month Treasury bills in Canada were
yielding 2.89%, compared with 4.97% in the U.S.</p>
<p>In addition, federal and many provincial governments lowered deficits,
and Quebec separatism was put on the back burner after a referendum in
October 1995 narrowly defeated secession.</p>
<p>The Toronto Stock Exchange's 300-stock index ended 1996 at 5927.03, up
25.7% from its 1995 close of 4713.54. Canadian bank stocks were the
standout performers, followed by conglomerates and energy companies. The
oil and gas sector benefited from higher crude prices.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Political Crisis Roils Market</h2>

<p>A political crisis continues to wrack Colombia's economy and stock
markets, which were among the worst performing in Latin America last year.
Most analysts are looking for a modest bounce back in the Colombian economy
and modest returns of around 10% to 12% this year as the crisis starts to
fade, but not completely disappear.</p>

resignation because of allegations that he knowingly received money from
drug traffickers during his election campaign in 1994. Most analysts
believe Mr. Samper will be able to finish his term, which ends in 1998.</p>

year investors could feel satisfied with.</p>

ending with a rally that pushed the benchmark over the 3360 mark -- up 21%
in pesos and 17% in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Conglomerates made a strong comeback, although most Mexican share prices
still lag behind 1994 predevaluation highs in dollar terms. Shares of Grupo
Carso, a conglomerate with vast holdings that span just about every
important sector of the economy, more than doubled  in dollar terms.</p>
<p>Shares of Grupo Desc, a leading exporter of auto parts, ended 1996 up
more than 75%; shares of steel-pipe fabricator Tubos de Acero Mexico,
another export power, were up more than twofold.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Fujimori Struggles With Crises</h2>

<p>Peru was another slow market in Latin America in 1996. It was a year
marked by one crisis after another, all of which seemed to damage President
Alberto Fujimori.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Mr. Fujimori's popularity among Peruvians is key to economic and
stock-market success in Peru. He is credited with bringing Peru back from
the precipice of economic, social and political chaos when he took office
in 1990.</p>
<p>The crises, including the December hostage drama and a slowdown in
economic growth from the start of the year, have sharply cut his popular
support from 75% in 1995 to less than 50% at the end of 1996. By the fall
of last year, economic growth had slowed to the low single digits after two
years of double-digit expansion.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Venezuela Bounces Back</h2>

<p>Venezuela went from basket case to favored nation on the lists of many
investors last year because of the start of a program of modest economic
changes. Its stock market more than doubled last year -- the best in Latin
America, and in dollar terms, one of the top performers in the world.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96us.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96us-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Analysts expect 1997 to be a good one for Venezuelan stocks as long as
the economic program stays on track, but don't expect a repeat of last
year's eye-popping returns. Something along the lines of 20% returns, in
dollars, is more likely, says Tim Love, head of emerging-markets strategy
and research at ING-Baring Securities Ltd. in London.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Investors in Asia Weigh<br>
Where to Invest in 1997</h2>

<p>The key question for many investors in Asia this year is whether to
stick with the region's stellar performers -- such as Hong Kong, where the
Hang Seng Index leaped 34% in 1996 -- or to switch to some of the laggards,
such as South Korea and Thailand.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>"If you don't make the right decisions on which markets to invest in,
your stock decisions will be insignificant," warns Michael Unsworth,
regional head of research at Merrill Lynch (Asia Pacific).</p>
<p>As they weigh those decisions, many strategists and fund managers are
still tempted by Hong Kong.</p>
<p>For Hisao Otera, director and general manager of Tokio Marine Investment
Services in Hong Kong, the colony remains the core of his Asian portfolio.
But his exposure won't be quite so large as in 1996, when he parked about
60% of his funds in Hong Kong. That will be moderated to about 50% for the
first half of 1997, he says.</p>
<p>Although the Hong Kong market could suffer a short-term correction, Mr.
Otera is confident that the territory's July 1 handover to China will be
positive for stocks. He thinks the market is likely to be swept up in a
celebratory rally. But many stocks are no longer cheap and earnings growth
in the territory isn't as compelling as before, so Tokio Marine will be
poised to trim its holdings during the second half, he says.</p>
<p>Tokio Marine will have a neutral weighting of 15% to 20% in Malaysia and
15% in Singapore. The rest will be sprinkled throughout the region. Of the
markets that suffered the worst declines in 1996, Mr. Otera reckons that
Thailand has the best chance of rebounding during the coming year, and may
attract more of his funds as the year progresses. The structural problems
of South Korea show fewer signs of a quick turnaround, he argues.</p>
<p>Overall, Mr. Otera says Tokio Marine will continue to favor the most
liquid markets in the region, while generally avoiding markets where it is
difficult to enter or exit quickly.</p>
<p>Pauline Gately, regional strategist for Asia excluding Japan at Merrill
Lynch (Asia Pacific) in Hong Kong, is another big fan of the Hong Kong
stock market. Overall, she recommends an overweight position in the
Asia-Pacific region (excluding Japan) for global investors because she
reckons that declining U.S. bond yields in the first half will spark
greater international interest in the region's equity markets.</p>
<p>Her favorite markets are last year's star performer Hong Kong and two of
the region's laggards -- South Korea and Thailand.</p>
<p>Despite its huge gain in 1996, Hong Kong will continue to be "one of the
biggest regional beneficiaries of positive U.S. interest-rate trends," she
says, thanks to the Hong Kong dollar's link to the U.S. greenback. Hong
Kong also stands to benefit from China's faster growth. Meanwhile, she
says, the Hang Seng Index's prospective P/E ratio of around 14 is well
below the high of 20 that the market hit in January 1994. Fair value for
the Hang Seng would be around 15400, with a potential for rising to 16500,
she believes. That compares with 13451.45 at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Thailand, where the SET Index fell 35% last year, deserves a weighting
of 9% compared with a neutral weighting of 7%, Ms. Gately says. "We view
Thailand as a strong contender in the second-half regional-performance
stakes," she says. What might help to inspire the market? In her view, the
possible catalysts include a shrinkage of the current-account deficit, an
easing of monetary policy, and relatively low P/E ratios, except for the
financial sector.</p>
<p>South Korea, where the Composite Index dropped 26% last year, deserves
an overweight position of 8%, versus 7%, given that its stock-market cycle
is "heavily influenced by global economic conditions," she says. The
prospect of a stronger global economy will translate into export growth, an
improving current account, and higher earnings, she adds.</p>
<p>Ms. Gately suggests that investors adopt neutral weightings for both
Malaysia and Taiwan because of concerns "that the liquidity-driven rallies
in those two countries risk running out of steam in the absence of a strong
earnings kicker."</p>
<p>Hong Kong and Indonesia are the two Asian markets that should be
over-represented in a portfolio, says Ian Burden, chief investment officer
for the Asia-Pacific region at HSBC Asset Management Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Over the past few months, he says, the evidence has increased that China
and Hong Kong are at the start of a new business cycle. He has about 37% of
his portfolio in Hong Kong (which also gives him exposure to China) and he
sees the credit easing in China and the renewed strength of the Hong Kong
property market boosting Hong Kong stocks.</p>
<p>Despite the political risks associated with Indonesia, Mr. Burden
recommends going overweight in this market because of its buoyant economy,
the prospect of falling interest rates, and continued strong earnings
growth.</p>
<p>His funds are neutral on Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand, but he
adds that Thailand has fallen to levels that look "tempting." Meanwhile,
he's underweight in Singapore, Taiwan and South Korea.</p>
<p>For the next six months, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Indonesia and the
Philippines are the top markets, in that order, for Robert Howe, chief
executive officer at Geomatrix (H.K.).</p>
<p>He says Malaysia has some of the region's best improvements in profit
expectations for 1997, and while the market's P/E ratio of 18 times 1997
earnings isn't very low, "it is reasonable for Malaysia historically, and
it is reasonable given the good profit growth."</p>
<p>Mr. Howe adds that for Hong Kong, profit expectations fell slightly in
October and November, but the market overall isn't too expensive, apart
from some of the leading blue chips.</p>
<p>"The conspiracy theory rules for the Hong Kong market in 1997," he says.
"Beijing wants a bull market to convince the world and especially Taiwan
that the marriage will be prosperous and Hong Kong's dowry is safe."</p>
<p>Mr. Howe likes Indonesia because he thinks it is cheap at 14 times
forecast 1997 earnings per share. He has recently added the Philippines to
his buy list because the property stocks have slipped back to reasonable
levels. In addition, the economic and corporate-profit cycles haven't
reached their peak yet and the market is still moderately priced at 15
times forecast 1997 earnings per share, he says.</p>
<p>"We might put a little money into the Indian subcontinent, purely on
valuation grounds," Mr. Howe adds. "But profit-growth expectations for 1997
are deteriorating, so those low P/E ratios are suspect."</p>
<p>Three markets to short are, in order, Taiwan, Thailand and Japan, given
that "all three show very bad deterioration in profit expectations," he
says. He notes that Thailand is the most controversial call -- many
supposedly savvy regional investors are rushing to buy value in Thailand,
he says. But until the profit collapse slows there, "you don't know what
the value is you are buying . . . The property and banking downward spiral
could well continue."</p>
<p>He believes that investors who buy last year's worst Asian market in the
expectation that it will be this year's best market have no precedent on
their side.</p>
<p>Marc Faber, managing director of fund-management firm Marc Faber Ltd. in
Hong Kong, suggests that for 1997 investors take their profits in the U.S.
and move them to some of last year's losers, focusing on funds that invest
in Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, South Korea and Thailand.</p>
<p>For "super-bears" such as himself, who believe that the end is nigh for
the U.S. bull market, this year's strategy will focus on short-selling U.S.
stocks with high price-earnings ratios. (Short-selling is a bearish bet in
which the investor sells borrowed shares, hoping to profit by replacing
them with cheaper ones later.)</p>
<p>Mr. Faber singles out shares in the software and
telecommunication-equipment industries, "where increased capacity and rapid
technological changes will bring cut-throat competition and disappointing
earnings growth."</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Analysts Puzzle Over Economy<br>
As They Gauge Tokyo Market</h2>

<p><b>By R<font size="-1">OBERT</font> S<font size="-1">TEINER</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>Normally, Haruyoshi Mabuchi feels comfortable forecasting the way Tokyo
stocks will start a new year based on how they ended the old one. But this
year the strategist at Nikko Research Center Ltd. is having problems. "Many
institutional investors in Japan are neither bullish nor bearish," he
complains. "They say they don't know."</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The problem is that investors are torn between relief that Japan's
economy is growing steadily -- albeit still slowly -- after a five-year
slump, and fear that Japan's government could end that growth by cutting
back on economic stimulus. In April the government is to raise Japan's
consumption tax and end a cut in income taxes that has been in place for
two years. Analysts also expect it to spend only one trillion yen ($8.62
billion) on public works and other measures outside of the normal budget,
compared with 11 trillion yen of spending and tax cuts last year.</p>
<p>Japan's investors are so skeptical about the economy's health that they
pushed stock prices down to close 1996 below where the year began, even
though corporate earnings are rising and Japan's financial system is making
strides toward clearing its mountains of bad debt. The Nikkei 225 average
of blue chip stocks ended at 19361.35, 2.6% below 1995's finish.</p>
<p>Of course, 1996 was far more turbulent than its opening and closing
numbers suggest. The Nikkei soared 14% to 22666.80 in the first six months,
as foreign investors jumped into a market that they figured had more
potential to keep rising than Wall Street. Japan's institutional investors
also added to their stock portfolios, largely because interest rates were
far too low to provide decent returns in bonds. Japan's business conditions
were improving too: Record-low interest rates allowed banks to borrow money
cheaply, raise their profits and thus write down bad loans more easily.
What's more, the yen, whose strength had so ravaged Japan's economy in
early 1995, was sliding slowly. A weak yen helps Japanese exporters sell
their products at competitive prices overseas.</p>
<p>Then, in the second half, Tokyo stocks got whacked. Many foreigners
figured they had put enough into Japan and turned their attention back to
the U.S. market, which was still soaring. Japanese investors began worrying
about what is now their obsession: the government getting tight with its
cash.</p>
<p>Now "there is really no doubt that the decline in fiscal stimulus will
be a drag on growth (in 1997)," says John Rogers, president of Invesco
Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. The Finance Ministry is serious about cutting
Japan's rising central-government debt, which some economists calculate at
77% of gross domestic product. As the government slows its spending,
though, "the only real stimulus is very low interest rates," says Clifford
Shaw, president of Mercury Asset Management Japan Ltd.</p>
<p>But there are other signs of good economic news to cheer on stocks in
1997. Japanese companies are benefiting from low interest rates and from a
government that's pushing deregulation more forcefully than its recent
predecessors. Exports are rising, and many analysts expect them to get a
further boost if the yen remains at current levels. And Japan's economy
could get a hand from "a re-acceleration of U.S. growth" that should draw
in more Japanese exports in the second half of 1997, says Cameron Umetsu, a
Tokyo economist at UBS Securities Ltd.</p>
<p>The net result is likely to be GDP growth of around 2% in the fiscal
year ending March 31, 1998, compared with between 2.5% and 3% growth in the
current fiscal year, analysts say. "The story will be that companies are
underestimating their profits," says Paul Sheard, an investment strategist
at Baring Asset Management (Japan) Ltd. Profits will rise strongly during
1997 as Japanese companies boost their output to levels that match Japan's
industrial capacity, he says. Mr. Sheard thus expects the Nikkei 225 to
rise to between 23000 and 23500 by year end.</p>
<p>In fact, because stock prices have been falling while earnings
expectations are rising, Japanese shares stand at "better than fair value,"
Mr. Rogers says. "The Japanese market is back to a level where foreigners
want to have a good look." Still, he expects the Nikkei to spend a few more
months stuck below 22000. Mr. Mabuchi, at Nikko, figures it could slip to
18000 this month.</p>
<p>Japanese interest rates, meanwhile, may head back up a bit, Mr. Umetsu
says -- though not enough to crimp the economy. The benchmark 10-year
Japanese government bond will probably yield "over 3.5% in next nine to 12
months," he figures. It ended 1996 at a yield of about 2.57%.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Analysts Say Index Will Rise,<br>
Supported by Banks, Economy</h2>

<p>The Australian stock market appears to be headed higher, but market
watchers say investors could get a nasty jolt or two along the way.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Peter Morgan, Australian equities manager at Perpetual Funds Management,
thinks a dip on Wall Street in the first quarter of the year "will cause
some volatility in Australia." But he's forecasting that the All Ordinaries
Index, a main indicator, will reach 2580 by year's end. The All Ordinaries
ended 1996 at 2424.6.</p>
<p>Underlying Mr. Morgan's bullishness are banks, whose handsome dividend
yields he thinks will lure investors. Currently, he says, major banks are
trading at nine or 10 times estimated fiscal 1997 earnings, a hefty
discount to a basket of nonresources Australian stocks.</p>
<p>He also thinks there are some positive earnings surprises in store at
other companies. For instance, he says companies whose profits were hit
hard last year, such as building-materials concerns "are showing signs of
turning around."</p>
<p>Resources stocks also are likely to prop up the overall market. But the
property-trust sector, he says, is likely to be "flat to down," hurt partly
by rising interest rates during 1997.</p>
<p>After a "challenging year" in 1996, Helmut Engelhard, an analyst at
Hartley Poynton Ltd., is bracing for a year that "won't be outrageously
good." The prices of minerals that Australia exports have been
"disappointing in the past year," he adds. And while there are signs that
world demand is accelerating, he says, "any real gains won't come before
1998."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mr. Engelhard thinks the All Ordinaries Index is likely to
climb 10% to 12% to around 2700 by the end of the year, underpinned by an
economy growing around 3% to 3.5% and a "fairly benign" interest-rate
environment. Moreover, he figures that with inflation set to remain low,
investors will favor the stock market with its annual pretax yield of 5.5%
to 6% over government 10-year bonds, which are likely to yield around
7.5%.</p>
<p>He likes Wesfarmers Ltd., a chemical maker and provider of agricultural
services, and G.E. Crane Holdings Ltd., a building-materials maker that
will benefit from an expected recovery in the housing industry.</p>
<p>Russell Skirrow, research director at ABN Amro Australia Hoare Govett
(Securities) Ltd., is less confident. He thinks the All Ordinaries might
edge up to around 2450 by the end of 1997. "Our expectations for the market
as a whole are fairly subdued," he says. In September, he forecast that
companies other than resources firms and banks would post average profit
increases in fiscal 1997 of about 10%. He recently slashed that forecast by
half. Given the weak corporate-profit outlook, he adds, the Australian
market isn't likely to exceed the growth of other Asian markets, which
might discourage international investors.</p>
<p>Last year "was more a year of disappointments" than anything else, as a
slower economy triggered earnings downgrades from some of the country's
biggest companies, Perpetual's Mr. Morgan says. The All Ordinaries climbed
10% in 1996.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Barring Regulatory Confusion,<br>
Markets Will Continue to Gain</h2>

<p>In 1996, China's stock markets recovered, in a turbulent way, from the
doldrums of a long government-imposed austerity campaign. A loosening of
monetary policy and the advent of large-scale involvement by individual
investors bodes well for the market in 1997. Only regulatory confusion
stands in the way.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The Shenzhen and Shanghai stock exchanges both turned in strong
performances for the year. Much of that was due to interest-rate cuts by
the country's monetary authorities, who were opening the credit spigots
after a three-year austerity campaign aimed at curbing inflation. With
inflation now well below 10%, on an annualized basis, and deposit rates at
banks sliding, investors have returned to the stock markets.</p>
<p>"All the elements are in place for a sustained recovery in the market,"
says Bruce Richardson, chief representative in Shanghai for HG Asia. "And
investors are showing increasing maturity."</p>
<p>With more than 21 million retail investors now connected to the
exchanges by tens of thousands of computer terminals around the country,
that's been a vital boost. Individual investors drove indices sharply
higher before December, then the market hit a major crisis.</p>
<p>Prices for A shares -- available only to domestic investors in yuan --
surged far ahead of prices for B shares, which are earmarked for foreigners
in foreign currency. Foreign interest in China's still-thin markets remains
limited. But domestic investors saw the widening gap as an arbitrage
opportunity and began buying B shares, aided by local brokerage firms that
relaxed the rules. In December the market took off -- doubling in a bit
more than a week.</p>
<p>Alarmed by the speculation, China's regulators warned that the market
was rising too fast -- sparking a sudden selloff. Some investors feared a
crackdown on illegal B-share buying might be in store. Trying to control
the volatility, regulators imposed a 10% limit on daily price movements of
shares. The result: two days of both the Shenzhen and Shanghai markets
dropping 10%, and angry investors demanding the government step out of the
way.</p>
<p>That sets the scene for 1997, analysts say. The government has said it
wants to raise 10 billion yuan in new share issues, up from only 5.5
billion in 1996. But it must have investors' confidence to absorb that
amount. "I don't think the Chinese government will do anything too
aggressive" to further interfere with stock trading, says Fanton Chuck,
head of China research at Morgan Grenfell Asia Securities (HK) Ltd.</p>
<p>With economic growth in the coming year expected to top 10%, slightly
above estimates of about 9% growth for 1996, the macroeconomic situation
favors the market. Economists even expect another interest-rate cut early
next year. So sure are some regulators, in fact, that they are talking
about supplementing the handful of nationwide mutual funds that now exist
with a broad, retail mutual-fund industry. In order for those plans to
succeed, they will need to stay out of investors' way.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Return to Chinese Rule in July<br>
Could Fuel Stock Market Rise</h2>

<p>The future is red, and that's being taken as good news for Hong Kong's
stock market.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Local and international investors are bullish that China's takeover of
Hong Kong will help propel the Hang Seng Index to new heights.</p>
<p>The index soared 34% last year, thanks to rebounding property prices and
improved sentiment regarding Hong Kong's return to Chinese rule on July 1.
Barring any major gaffes by Beijing as it works for a smooth transition to
Chinese rule in Hong Kong, some analysts expect 1997 to be almost as good
as 1996.</p>
<p>"After the handover, China will support the [Hong Kong] economy," says
Percy Au-Young, research director of DBS Securities Hong Kong Ltd. "They
will increase the number of Chinese companies coming to Hong Kong and
capital flows." He reflects the view of many locals that Beijing wants to
make its rule a success by helping to pump up the colony's two most closely
watched indicators of economic well-being -- the stock market and property
prices. The analyst predicts that the Hang Seng index will reach 15000 to
15500 by the end of the year, up from 13451.45 at the end of 1996.</p>
<p>Janice Wallace, head of Hong Kong research at Goldman Sachs (Asia) LLC,
predicts that the index will hit 15800 by year-end. Ms. Wallace expects
strong inflows of cash from China as Beijing eases its tight credit
controls to buoy the market. She estimates that mainland buyers accounted
for one quarter of the HK$29 billion (US$3.75 billion) in office and
residential property purchases in the first nine months of 1996.</p>
<p>Aside from positive sentiment, two other factors likely to drive the
market next year are China's gradually improving economy and low U.S.
interest rates.</p>
<p>Beijing's gradual easing of its tight monetary policy is giving a lift
to Hong Kong's economy. Mr. Au-Young of DBS predicts that the territory's
gross domestic product will expand 5.3% in 1997, up from about 4.7% last
year, reversing a trend of more than four years of slowing GDP growth.</p>
<p>U.S. interest will also drive the market because interest rates in the
colony track those in the U.S. Most analysts expect that U.S. Federal
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan will hold rates low.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Political and Economic Woes<br>
Have Local Investors Sidelined</h2>

<p>After a disappointing year for Indian stocks, fund managers and analysts
still see reason for caution.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>They expect that a resurgent Congress Party under a new leader will
demand a greater say in the country's government at some stage in 1997.
That's likely to mean an unsettled political climate. Adding to the anxiety
are concerns about a widening government budget deficit, higher prices for
petroleum products and slower corporate earnings growth.</p>
<p>"The market hasn't factored in the grim realities of the political and
economic front," says Praween Napate, a director and head of broking at ING
Baring Securities (India) Pvt. Ltd. in Bombay. "The bear phase has still
not run its full course."</p>
<p>After hitting a 1996 high of 4069.26 points on June 18, the Bombay
Sensitive Index, or Sensex, went into a swoon. Investors were upset by a
new tax on companies and rising petroleum-product prices. The benchmark
index fell to a year low of 2745.06 on Dec. 4, then recovered to end 1996
at 3085.20 on Dec. 24, down 1.4% on the year.</p>
<p>"The Sensex may rise by about 500 to 700 points at some point of time
but the question is whether it can be sustained," says Samir Arora, chief
investment officer of Alliance Capital Asset Management (India) Pvt. Ltd.
in Bombay.</p>
<p>Many local investors remain wary of the stock market after suffering
heavy losses in recent years. But foreign institutional investors will
increase their weightings in Indian stocks in 1997, predicts Barry Hall,
president of Morgan Stanley India in Bombay. He thinks investors will look
for bargains in India partly because U.S. and European stocks "have moved
up so much."</p>
<p>Some fund managers say stock prices could rise in the first quarter on
expectations of market-friendly policies in the government's upcoming
budget for the fiscal year ending March 31, 1998. In addition, the two main
stock exchanges are creating share-depository facilities that will make it
easier for investors to buy and sell shares without physically transferring
share certificates, which has created a nightmare of paperwork in the
past.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Uncertainty Ahead of Elections<br>
May Cap Market's Advance</h2>

<p>If economic indicators were all that counted, Indonesia's stock market
would be set to sail at a good clip this year. But the pace may be held
back a notch by politics as the country enters a two-year period of
elections amid the ever-present uncertainty over who will follow President
Suharto.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Economists predict that the economy will match or beat 1996's growth of
about 7.5%. Inflation may slow and interest rates should fall slightly,
improving the prospects for companies to boost earnings. "From a top-down
approach, looking at the economy, everything looks good," says Rizal
Prasetijo, strategist for PT Jardine Fleming Nusantara.</p>
<p>But he and many other analysts expect a sluggish first half for the
market as investors keep an eye on May 29 parliamentary elections. The
winner isn't in doubt -- Mr. Suharto's Golkar is assured of victory -- but
Indonesian elections traditionally make businesspeople a bit fearful that
tensions could flare up.</p>
<p>Moreover, this election comes only 10 days before Mr. Suharto turns 76.
His wife's unexpected death last April and a July trip he made to Germany
for medical checks reminded Indonesians of his mortality -- and of the
issue of political succession. Assuming his health remains good, Mr.
Suharto is virtually certain to take a seventh five-year term when a
special 1,000-member assembly meets in March 1998, but it's an open
question who will be the next vice president, and possible successor.</p>
<p>Mr. Prasetijo predicts a second-half rally that leaves the Jakarta
Composite Index at between 700 and 725 by year end, up from 637.43 at the
end of 1996. Tom Inglis, head of research at PT ING Baring Securities
Indonesia, is more bullish, seeing the index at 750 at year end, though he
adds that 1997 "won't be without its pitfalls."</p>
<p>In 1996, the market's solid early-year rally began to fizzle in May. The
government-backed ouster of Megawati Sukarnoputri as head of a small party
and the consequent July 27 riot helped push down share prices. Smart
investors, as it turns out, bought depressed shares soon after the riot.
Boosting the market in the fourth quarter was the popularly priced initial
public offering by PT Bank Negara Indonesia. For 1996 as a whole, the index
climbed 24%.</p>
<p>This year, investors hope for more offerings by state companies and
fewer political jolts. Frans van der Horst, research director of PT
Schroders Indonesia, says there is "no reason to expect the market to
perform badly." But, he adds, he is "not fully comfortable yet" with the
political situation.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Market Could Revisit 1994 Highs<br>
As Sizzling Economy Eases a Bit</h2>

<p>Malaysia's stock market is expected this year to test the super bull-run
levels of 1993 and early 1994 as foreign investors finally are convinced
that the sizzling economy is easing to a less-breathtaking pace.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>With projections for corporate-earnings growth averaging about 15% and
signs of renewed interest from overseas funds, analysts say 1997 looks
rosier after a sluggish 1995 for the market and the start of a recovery in
1996.</p>
<p>"We think there could be a retest of the all-time high of 1332 seen in
January 1994," says Patrick Zecha, head of research at South Johor
Securities Sdn. Bhd., referring to the Composite Index, which tracks 100
blue chip stocks.</p>
<p>Others agree. "The general upward trend is still intact," says a senior
analyst with a local brokerage. He sees the main index flirting with record
levels as early as next month.</p>
<p>With buoyant growth in earnings expected, the market should be able to
rise without the dizzying price/earnings ratios -- averaging 30 -- seen in
the last bull market. Even if the Composite Index rises above 1300 this
year, average P/E ratios should remain realistic, in the low 20s, Mr. Zecha
said.</p>
<p>The index ended 1996 with a gain of 24%, performing much better than in
1995, when it edged up just 2.5% amid fears of an overheating economy that
would boost inflation and widen the current account deficit. Then local
bargain hunters soon moved in and the market started moving up in the first
quarter of 1996.</p>
<p>Monthly economic figures, which indicated that Malaysia's large current
account deficit was narrowing, helped fuel the recovery. In October, the
government forecast that economic growth would slow to 8.2% in 1996 and 8%
in 1997 after a record 9.5% in 1995, further strengthening the market as
investor fears of overheating subsided.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Stocks Are Likely to Be Buoyed<br>
By Economic Growth in 1997</h2>

<p>The prospect of lower interest rates coupled with faster economic growth
is likely to buoy the New Zealand stock market this year, analysts and fund
managers say.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>"We're reasonably optimistic" that the stock market is in for a
"relatively broad-based" boost, says Greg Whitten, managing director of
fund manager Prudential Portfolio Management New Zealand Ltd.</p>
<p>He thinks the economy is set to expand by about 3% this year, up from
1.25% in 1996. That is likely to send the NZSE-40 Capital Index 10% to 15%
higher in 1997, he adds. The index advanced 9.8% in 1996.</p>
<p>A brighter economic outlook is going to put a particular shine on
consumer-oriented stocks, Mr. Whitten says. Among his picks is retailing
concern Hallenstein Glasson Holdings Ltd. Shares in local property
developers, too, will be attractive, he says. Shares in forestry companies,
which have weathered a cyclical downturn, should look better in 1997. He
also likes utilities. "Picking winners is difficult," he adds, but "we'd
want to make sure we had a good exposure" to that sector in 1997.</p>
<p>Raymond Webb, who tracks the market for ANZ McCaughan Securities (NZ)
Ltd., also is looking for the NZSE-40 Capital Index to gain about 10% to
around 2600 by year end.</p>
<p>Driving the market, he says, will be a further decline in domestic
interest rates. Since New Zealanders went to the polls on Oct. 12, yields
on 90-day bank bills have tumbled from around 10% to below 8%. Mr. Webb
thinks they could slip another half percentage point or so during 1997,
helping to underpin the stock market. Likewise, he thinks the New Zealand
dollar is likely to weaken, which would aid New Zealand's exporters.</p>
<p>He expects the economy to expand 2.5% this year. But the overall
outlook, he warns, is "uneven across sectors." For investors, he adds,
"it's going to be a market of stocks rather than a stock market" in the
year ahead.</p>
<p>His choices include Air New Zealand, which is likely to benefit from its
acquisition of 50% of Australia-based international carrier Ansett
Australia, and Guinness Peat Group PLC, an investment company controlled by
New Zealand entrepreneur Sir Ronald Brierley. Mr. Webb also thinks Brierley
Investments Ltd., which announced last month that it would acquire up to
25% of John Fairfax Holdings Ltd., Australia's second largest newspaper
publisher, "finally appears to be getting its act together" following a
"very mediocre performance" on the stock market over the past six
years.</p>
<p><a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=nzt&amp;page=15">Telecom Corp. of New Zealand</a>
Ltd., which had a good run in 1996, is also among Mr. Webb's favorites. The
company is "a high-quality" concern offering a pure domestic play on the
New Zealand economy that attracts foreign investors, he says.</p>
<p>Early in 1996, political uncertainty, high short-term interest rates and
a lackluster economic outlook combined to keep a lid on the market. But the
election "marked a change in investor sentiment," Mr. Webb says. The
election left a small populist party, New Zealand First Party, holding the
balance of power. It took New Zealand First two months to decide to rule in
a coalition with the conservative National Party, a partnership that is
supposed to last three years.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Consumer-Related Stocks<br>
May Lead a Rally in 1997</h2>

<p>This will be another good year for the Philippine equities market, some
analysts predict. They say that once again, the market will reward
investors with a 20%-to-25% return, but that consumer-related stocks will
most likely lead the charge this time.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Consumer-related stocks -- mostly food manufacturers -- performed poorly
last year as higher raw-material costs ate into earnings. Blue chip San
Miguel Corp. was the hardest hit because it also had to deal with other
problems such as high financing charges on loans to expand in the
Philippines and elsewhere in Asia, and falling beer consumption. It hit its
lowest point two months ago when the price of its Class B shares --
available to both foreigners and locals -- fell to 70.50 pesos ($2.70)
after the company posted a 19% drop in profit for the first nine months of
the year.</p>
<p>Since late November, San Miguel has gotten a second wind as investors
focused on 1997's considerably better prospects. The B shares finished 1996
at 116 pesos. SBC Warburg Philippines Inc., in a report, predicts a banner
year for the conglomerate in 1998, with profit climbing to 10.1 billion
pesos from 7.1 billion pesos in 1997. For 1996, SBC puts profit at 5.1
billion pesos, down from 1995's 5.8 billion pesos.</p>
<p>With food companies gaining strength, and bank stocks likely to maintain
their solid performance as the economy continues to grow, the Philippine
stock index is expected to hit 3600 points by year end, some analysts say.
That would be a 14% rise from the 1996 close of 3170.56. In 1996, the index
added 22%.</p>
<p>"Food issues will lead the rally," says Conrad Andres, research head at
DBP-Daiwa Securities Inc. "They were the underperformers last year, but
with better sales volume coming in 1997, it will be their turn to grab the
limelight from property issues, which were last year's top performers."</p>
<p>Property companies are still favored, but analysts say investors should
choose outfits involved in low-cost housing, where the demand is still
largely unmet. Companies specializing in office and residential
condominiums are likely to be hit by the anticipated glut in the market,
they add. The once-highflying sector started to lose steam in October when
investors, scared that the bubble was about to burst, unloaded most of
their holdings.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Foreign Investors May Return<br>
Following Drop in Stock Prices</h2>

<p>After a thoroughly miserable 1996, Singapore share prices have hit
bottom, market players say. The question is how many stock brokers will
lose their jobs before prices start climbing and interest revives; some
firms already have started laying off staff.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The first signs of a recovery in Singapore's crucial electronics
industry have raised hopes that economic growth, after falling from its
torrid pace of recent years to a measly 3.2% in the third quarter of 1996,
should start to pick up midway through 1997. Electronics companies are
poorly represented in the stock market, but the sector is a key component
of Singapore's industrial output and exports, both major drivers of the
republic's economy. Several major brokerage firms in recent weeks have
switched their electronics-sector recommendations from sell to buy.</p>
<p>With economists now looking for gross-domestic-product growth of around
8% for 1997, some are anticipating that healthier economic growth and
corporate profits -- combined with the relatively cheap prices many stocks
have fallen to -- should attract some of the foreign money that went to
Hong Kong and Malaysia in 1996. Singapore has drastically underperformed
both of those markets since June.</p>
<p>Price/earnings ratios of Singapore's foreign shares have fallen to about
18 times forecast 1997 earnings -- a three-year low and "an attractive
level" to buy, UBS Securities says in a recent report. (Due to
foreign-ownership limits, many Singapore blue chips have "foreign" and
"local" classes of stock. Stock available to foreigners typically trades at
a premium to the local shares and the foreign price is often used as a
valuation yardstick.)</p>
<p>Global funds have been riding the Wall Street surge, but are likely to
shift funds to Asia if the U.S. stock market grows more uncertain, says Tan
Min Lan, a strategist at Merrill Lynch in Singapore. She expects the
Straits Times Industrials Index to reach 2450 points by mid-1997, but to
slow its gains in the second half as monetary policy tightens up in
response to resurgent growth. The index should finish the year at around
2500, up about 13% from 2216.79 at the end of 1996, she forecasts.</p>
<p>Even that modest performance would beat 1996, when the index fell
2.2%.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Exports and Banks May Lead<br>
Mild Recovery in Share Prices</h2>

<p>A slowing economy and labor unrest pushed the South Korean market
benchmark to its lowest point in three years at the end of 1996, but
analysts and fund managers are neutral to positive on the stock market's
1997 prospects.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Keith Nam, branch manager of HG Asia Ltd. in Seoul forecasts that the
Korea Composite Stock Index will trade in a range of 500 to 750 in 1997.
The index ended 1996 at 651.22. Mr. Nam doesn't see a dramatic recovery,
but says global prices of major South Korean exports such as semiconductors
and steel should rebound slightly by the second half of the year. Daewoo
Securities forecasts that the composite index will dip below 600 in the
first half of the 1997 but rise to 1000 by the fourth quarter, largely due
to a cyclical economic recovery.</p>
<p>Analysts say another factor expected to drive the market in 1997 is the
presidential election scheduled for December. "The elections are a definite
plus for the market," says Park Jae Won, head of research at Hannuri
Salomon Securities in Seoul. "By the second half of next year, the
government will probably pay attention to the sluggish [stock] market."</p>
<p>Analysts say the government could, for example, shrink the number of new
listings, or further raise the foreign-ownership limit, which currently
stands at 20% of a company's stock.</p>
<p>In 1996, the composite index peaked on May 7 at 986.8 points in the wake
of legislative elections in April, and rose again in October after the
foreign-ownership limit on stocks was lifted by two percentage points.</p>
<p>The South Korean economy suffered its widest annual current-account
deficit ever in 1996, an estimated $22 billion, compared with an $8.4
billion deficit in 1995.</p>
<p>Growth of real gross domestic product in 1996 was at least two
percentage points below 1995's 9%, analysts estimate.</p>
<p>The rapid drop in prices of memory chips battered foreign investors'
favorite blue-chip stock, Samsung Electronics Co., which declined 68% in
1996.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, analysts say the current round of strikes isn't expected to
last long enough to dramatically affect the stock market. Analysts say that
once the strikes subside, the newly passed labor bill, which will allow
companies to lay off workers more easily, could make sectors such as banks
more attractive. Analysts say an expected consolidation of the banking
industry, which the government is trying to encourage, could also boost
bank stocks.</p>
<p>"If banks take on the mergers and acquisitions wave as predicted, I
believe they'll outperform the market by the second half of next year,"
says Hannuri's Mr. Park.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Hong Kong's Return to China<br>
Will Affect Taiwan's Shares</h2>

<p>This could be a bad year for human rights in Hong Kong. So James Hsu is
worried about the Taiwan stock market.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>The new year "will be full of surprises on the political front," says
Mr. Hsu, president of Taipei's Fubon Securities Investment Trust, citing
the uncertainty surrounding Hong Kong's return to China in July. "So it's
really hard to make any predictions."</p>
<p>Politics is a major and erratic player in Taiwan's stock market. The
bulk of shares are held by retail investors, who scatter like scared
rabbits on bad political news -- even if the news is old, or wrong. And
many in Taiwan worry that Beijing will use its control of Hong Kong to
pressure Taipei, which conducts most of its huge mainland trade and
investment through the British entrepot.</p>
<p>Even beyond politics, Mr. Hsu doesn't see much cause for cheer. "The
fundamentals haven't really improved," he says; the global semiconductor
market -- one of Taiwan's key industries and a big draw for institutional
investors -- will remain in the doldrums until 1998, he says, stating a
widely held view. The island's Weighted Price Index could close out the
year at 7500, although Mr. Hsu cautions it could go as low as 6000. The
index finished 1996 at 6933.64, for a gain of 34% on the year.</p>
<p>Other professionals are more upbeat, citing the twin factors of lower
interest rates and a continuing influx of foreign money, which together fed
the market's rise in 1996. Ample liquidity will fuel the market through the
first half of 1997, predicts Ellen Miao, who manages the $800 million
London-listed Taipei Fund.</p>
<p>On other fronts, a buoyant global economy should help Taiwan's
exporters, she says. And loosening monetary controls in China -- one of the
island's biggest export markets -- will favor companies that supply raw
materials, such as polyester and other petrochemical products, to mainland
factories.</p>
<p>Also promising: the real-estate sector, which many analysts say is
emerging from a six-year slump. Ms. Miao foresees the index ending the year
close to 8000.</p>
<p>The past year was one full of unpleasant surprises, yet the market put
in a stellar performance. The index bombed in the first quarter -- thanks
to offshore Chinese missile tests and war games that marked the worst
hostilities since the shelling of Taiwan-held islands in the 1950s. But
successive cuts in interest rates and the raising of caps on foreign
holdings lured investors back in a big way.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">After a Rough Year, Analysts<br>
Are Divided About Prospects</h2>

<p>Thailand's stock market remains under a cloud after a disastrous 1996.
The economy is expected to be the dominant factor driving 1997 stock-market
performance, but analysts are split as to whether the worst is behind
Thailand or still ahead.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96as.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96as-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report K - Main" align="left" border="0"></a>Some analysts expect export growth, for example, to improve in the first
half of 1997 after a 0.1% drop in exports in 1996; an improvement could
improve market sentiment. Others remain deeply concerned about Thailand's
competitiveness, weak corporate earnings, bad loans and other factors.
Economic growth forecasts for 1997 range from 7.6% at SocGen-Crosby
Securities Pte. Ltd. down to 3.8% at Credit Lyonnais Securities (Asia)
Ltd.</p>
<p>Bad-debt levels are expected to continue rising at Thai banks and
finance companies, depressing 1997 earnings in those key stock-market
sectors. An interest-rate cut would boost the market. But it will be hard
for rates to fall as long as Thailand continues to closely tie its currency
to the U.S. dollar, while funding a gaping current-account deficit through
foreign-fund inflows.</p>
<p>Ray Jovanovich, director and senior portfolio manager at Indosuez Asset
Management Asia, sees Thailand's current-account deficit rising to over 9%
of gross domestic product in 1997, compared with an estimated 8.2% in 1996,
leaving little room for interest rates to drop. "I'm looking for a further
deterioration in the trade balance next year," he says.</p>
<p>Predicated on a bit of good news such as an expected rebound in the
securities business, HG Asia Investment Research Ltd. sees up to 11%
earnings growth in 1997 for the companies in the select SET-50 Index, after
3% earnings growth in 1996. If the market's current price/earnings ratio of
11 holds, the broad SET Index should rise to 925 points during the year
from its 1996 close of 831.57, says Neil Semple, HG Asia's assistant
director.</p>
<p>In 1996, the SET Index plunged 35% from its 1995 close of 1280.81. After
a decade of feverish growth, everything seemed to go wrong at once: Exports
fell, earnings growth plummeted, bad debt rose, the currency suffered bouts
of instability, and the country's short-term debt rating was cut, all amid
doubts about the quality of Thailand's economic governance.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">European Economies Focus<br>
On Growth in the New Year</h2>

<p><b>By N<font size="-1">ICHOLAS</font> B<font size="-1">RAY</font>

<b></b></p>
<p>As European Union governments squeeze their budget deficits in a final
bid to qualify for the first round of economic and monetary union, weak
growth and high unemployment have put a damper on New Year celebrations in
most European countries.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96eu.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96eu-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Other" align="left" border="0"></a>Only Britain, among the larger EU nations, ended 1996 on a note of
strong growth and shrinking dole lines. And ironically, Britain -- even if
it does qualify for European monetary union -- is unlikely to take part in
the first round. In much of continental Europe, the battle to cut state
budget deficits to 3% of gross domestic product in line with the Maastricht
treaty criteria for EMU has left consumers smarting under higher taxes and
public-spending cuts.</p>
<p>After a slowdown that commenced in many continental European countries
in late 1995, industry surveys showed an upturn in confidence among
manufacturers in August and September for the first time since the start of
last year. But that wasn't matched by any significant recovery in household
spending. On the threshold of 1997, the crunch year for deciding which
countries qualify for EMU, consumer confidence remained weak. And without
an improvement in consumer demand, many economists consider, economies are
unlikely to be strong enough to permit governments to cut their deficits to
the levels required by the Maastricht treaty.</p>
<p>"The key issue in 1997 is growth," says Robert McKee of Independent
Strategy in London. "Will growth be strong enough to ensure that
unemployment rates, which are stubbornly high in both Germany and France,
begin to turn down and that the targets set by European governments for EMU
are met?"</p>
<p>By most estimates, economic growth in the EU as a whole amounted to only
1.6% in 1996, significantly lower than expectations a year ago of around 2%
growth. For 1997, the outlook is a bit rosier, with the Organization for
Economic Cooperation and Development predicting 2.4% growth in the EU, and
rising to 2.7% in 1998.</p>
<p>But that's still weak compared with the 4% growth seen in the late
1980s, and well below what's needed to make any significant dent in
unemployment.</p>
<p>Philippe Ithurbide of Societe Generale in France predicts only modest
growth in consumer demand. "Consumers won't make a significant comeback" in
1997, he says. As a result, Mr. McKee says, "there's about a 40% chance
that growth will be too low to ensure the Maastricht targets are met or
nearly met."</p>
<p>On the positive side, shrinking public-sector deficits have made lower
interest rates possible in much of Europe. In many countries, real
short-term interest rates ended 1996 at their lowest levels since the early
1980s. Inflation is slowing, too. The EU's average inflation rate fell to
around 2.5% in 1996 from 3.1% in 1995, and it's set to fall to around 2%
this year.</p>
<p>On the trade front, steady growth in the U.S. and Asia and a continued
upturn in Central and Eastern Europe means good export prospects for EU
companies. Poland, the Czech Republic and Croatia are all expected to have
growth rates in 1997 of 5% or more, while Russia is expected to show
positive growth for first time since the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Companies are likely to benefit from continued inexpensive capital
costs, as consumers save more for their pensions. According to an estimate
by Morgan Stanley International, as much as $120 billion will have to be
saved each year in Europe if the Continent's future pension needs are to be
met.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, economists also predict a continued process of
deregulation and restructuring, mirroring a process already well advanced
in Britain. Lower production costs, in turn, will lead to lower prices for
products and services for consumers. In Italy, the abandonment just over
two years ago of the scala mobile system of linking wages to inflation
contributed in November to a reduction in the year-to-year inflation rate
to below 3% for the first time since the late 1960s. In Spain, a widening
of the conditions under which employers can dismiss unneeded workers has
been followed by an increase in employment levels.</p>
<p>In the short term, however, restructuring in sectors such as banking
will continue to levy big costs in terms of jobs. Analysts say banks in
countries like France, Spain and Italy are going to have to cut their
payrolls, just as they have in Britain, adding to the employment worries of
European citizens.</p>
<p>Here's how individual economies looked at the turn of the year:</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Germany</b></p>
<p>After a 0.4% fall in quarter-to-quarter economic growth in the first
quarter of 1996, the economy strengthened, with third-quarter 1996 GDP
figures rising 0.8% from the second quarter and 2.4% higher than a year
earlier. Inflation is slow, at around 1.4%, and expected to stay that way.
For all of 1996, the OECD expects Germany to show growth of 1.1%, rising to
2.2% in 1997.</p>
<p>Despite the improving outlook, much will depend on future trends in
interest rates. While some economists expect further cuts in interest rates
in 1997, others are bracing themselves for possible increases. Meanwhile,
industrial production was only 1% higher in the third quarter of 1996 than
it was a year ago, and there isn't much likelihood of any significant drop
in unemployment in Germany any time soon.</p>
<p>With around four million people out of work, Germany's unemployment rate
rose to 10.6% in October from 10.4% in September. Unemployment is highest
in the former East Germany, at 15.5%. A predicted slowdown in wage growth
in 1997 will hardly come too soon, if it prompts manufacturing companies to
reverse a trend of moving production facilities abroad. In recent years,
German companies, in addition to investing in low-wage countries in Central
Europe, such as the Czech Republic, have invested heavily in Britain and
the U.S., where labor costs are significantly cheaper than in Germany.</p>
<p>Such trends have damped consumer confidence, and ABN Amro economist
Marcel Baartman expects any recovery to be mainly export-led. He forecasts
private consumption will grow by slightly less than 1.5% in 1997, following
growth of just over 1.5% in 1996. That would reflect the twin impact of
limited wage increases and a slight improvement in overall employment
levels.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>France</b></p>
<p>The Bank of France gave a timid signal of lower interest rates in the
week before Christmas with a five basis points cut in its key intervention
rate to 3.15%. A basis point is a hundredth of a percentage point. But a
two-week strike by truck drivers in November underscored the problems
facing France's economy, with high unemployment and weak growth. French GDP
actually fell in the second quarter of 1996, although it picked up again in
the third quarter.</p>
<p>Industry's capacity utilization remains low and the construction sector
is depressed. Consumer confidence, too, is weak: Instead of spending,
people are saving, because they are worried about unemployment. In October,
industrial production fell 0.8% from September, although it rose 1.4% from
a year earlier. A survey of consumer spending in November showed a
continued gloomy outlook. The previous month, consumer spending on
manufactured goods had fallen 2.6%, after a decline of 1.6% in September.
October car sales dropped nearly 26%, after a rush in September to take
advantage of government subsidies on new car purchases.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, economists expect conditions to improve in the first half
of 1997. Industry surveys suggest that manufacturing companies could
increase their investment spending by as much as 6% in real terms in 1997.
Morgan Stanley is forecasting a growth rate in 1997 of 2.4%, which it says
could help to reduce unemployment from current levels of around 12.7%. But
growth prospects could depend in part on a strengthening of the dollar,
which would help to make French exports more competitive.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Italy</b></p>
<p>As part of its drive to be in the first round of EMU, Italy brought the
lira back into the exchange-rate mechanism of the European Monetary System
in November, but at a sharply lower rate than in 1992, when it quit the ERM
along with Britain. In the intervening four years, the lira's depreciation
has helped to fuel an Italian export boom.</p>
<p>But economic growth has been held back by the government's efforts to
cut Italy's public sector deficit. A package announced in November included
a so-called Eurotax that will cost most middle-income taxpayers the
equivalent of several hundred pounds in 1997. For 1996, economists expect a
growth rate for Italy of only around 0.8%, well below the 3% that Italy's
previous government was confidently predicting a year ago.</p>
<p>Some recovery is likely in 1997, on the back of an expected recovery in
business investment. On the positive side, year-to-year inflation is down
to around 3%, half what it was a year ago. A strong trade surplus has all
but wiped out Italy's net foreign debt. Reductions in long-term interest
rates have sharply reduced the cost of financing its colossal domestic
public-sector debt.</p>
<p>But much will depend on whether consumers dig into their savings to
finance their spending, as the government hopes they will. If they don't,
government forecasts of 2% economic growth this year are likely to prove
optimistic. Many private economists are predicting growth of between 1.1%
and 1.4%.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Britain</b></p>
<p>With the U.K. now in the fifth year of an economic recovery that started
in 1992, domestic demand is expanding at its fastest rate since the late
1980s. Consumer spending has been the main impetus, as manufacturing output
remains weak. But capital investment by companies has picked up. After an
estimated growth rate of 2.5% in 1996, the British government has forecast
3.5% growth in 1997. Unemployment has been falling since the summer, with
November's unemployment rate down to 6.9% from 7.2% in October.</p>
<p>This situation, however, isn't free of worries. In contrast with most of
Continental Europe, inflation is showing signs of upward pressure in
Britain. Rising imports are expected to widen Britain's trade deficit. And
monetary authorities are having to increase interest rates to try to damp
consumer demand and curb inflation. In late October, the Bank of England
raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point, to 6%. Economists
say more rate increases are on the way, with the first likely early next
year.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Spain</b></p>
<p>Like Italy, Spain has been hit by cutbacks in public spending and weak
industrial investment. But consumer and industry confidence have started to
improve, and its economy ended 1996 on a strengthening note. Also like
Italy, Spain benefited from reductions in interest rates because of
expectations that it may be able to participate in EMU. Inflation is likely
to fall from around 3.9% in 1996 to 2.9% in 1997.</p>
<p>Although the government has forecast economic growth of 3% for this
year, after an estimated 2.4% in 1996, private economists are less
optimistic. Henrik Lumholdt, chief economist for the Bank of America in
Madrid, predicts 2.4% growth in 1997, after only around 2.1% estimated for
1996. That's because he expects consumer demand to remain relatively
weak.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>The Netherlands</b></p>
<p>In the Netherlands, consumer demand is strong and the economy is fairly
buoyant. Unemployment is falling, and inflation is low.</p>
<p>In November, the consumer price index fell by 0.1% from October, giving
a year-to-year inflation rate of 2.3%. With wages on the increase and rents
and indirect taxes due to rise faster this year than in 1996, ABN-Amro
predicts average inflation to rise to 2.5% in 1997. But economic growth is
expected to continue on a stable path, with the OECD forecasting growth of
2.7% in both 1996 and 1997.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Belgium</b></p>
<p>The economy is recovering from a slowdown in mid-1995. After expected
growth of around 1.3% in 1996, the OECD predicts that Belgium's economy
will expand by 2.2% in 1997.</p>
<p>Unemployment, though it may decline slightly thanks to administrative
measures transferring older unemployed people to special programs, is
expected to remain high at around 12.6%. Higher indirect taxes have helped
to push up inflation, and consumers have been cutting down on savings in
order to maintain their spending levels.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Luxembourg</b></p>
<p>After suffering from a slowdown in the countries surrounding it,
Luxembourg is looking forward to better times as their economies
recover.</p>
<p>But its own economy may be hit by efforts on the part of neighboring
countries, such as Germany, to control their citizens' use of Luxembourg
bank accounts to avoid taxes.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Switzerland</b></p>
<p>The Swiss economy remained weak in 1996, with an estimated decline in
output for the year as a whole of around 0.2% to 0.3%, after minimal growth
in 1995 of only 0.1%.</p>
<p>Unemployment showed a sharp rise in November to 5.1% from 4.8% in
October. The weakness of the economy also was demonstrated by a 0.7% fall
in third-quarter GDP. Inflation also retreated, to an annual average of
around 0.8% from 1.8% in 1995. For 1997, Bank J. Vontobel &amp; Co.
economist Karl Weber expects a modest improvement in economic growth, to
around 0.9%, accompanied by a further rise in unemployment to around 4.7%
and further decreases in inflation to around 0.3%. But prospects will
depend to a large extent on developments in other European economies.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Austria</b></p>
<p>The economy in Austria has been weaker than that of most other West
European countries, partly reflecting weak exports and efforts by companies
to restructure.</p>
<p>In the first nine months of 1996, the number of enterprises going out of
business rose by 10%. For the whole of 1996, Austria's economic growth rate
is expected to have been only around 1%. Things may pick up in 1997,
however, as the country benefits from expected strong growth in neighboring
Central European countries.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Portugal</b></p>
<p>Moderate growth resumed in the second half of 1996, ending a slowdown
that began in early 1995.</p>
<p>Unemployment edged back down to 7.2% in the third quarter after rising
earlier in the year, while inflation fell to 3.3% in the 12 months to the
end of September, from an average of 5% in 1995. The OECD forecasts
economic growth of 2.9% in 1997, up from 2.6% in 1996.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Ireland</b></p>
<p>With estimated growth of 7% in 1996, more than four times the EU
average, Ireland is the success story of Western Europe's smaller
nations.</p>
<p>In 1996, it continued to benefit from substantial inward investment from
foreign multinationals, including
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=intc&amp;page=15">Intel</a> Corp., which recently
opened a factory there. Employment growth averaged 3.75% in 1994 and 1995,
helping to push down Ireland's unemployment rate.</p>
<p>The only significant worry is of a resurgence of inflation, which fell
below 2% in 1996, but may rise if the sterling remains as strong. Britain
is Ireland's biggest trading partner, and a strong British pound increases
the price of Irish imports.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Scandinavia</b></p>
<p>Sweden's economy appears set to enjoy a recovery in 1997, with growth
forecasts ranging from around 2.2%, in the case of the OECD, to Morgan
Stanley's 3.3%.</p>
<p>The level of consumer demand will be a key factor, and Morgan Stanley
economist Beshara Madi expects lower interest rates to allow consumers to
increase their spending without cutting savings rates.</p>
<p>Denmark, too, is expected to show growth of around 3% in 1997, after a
weak showing in 1996 reflecting a fall in exports.</p>
<p>Finland could do even better in 1997, with growth of as much as 3.7%
helping to lower its unemployment rate from current high levels around
16%.</p>
<p>Norway, meanwhile, looks set to continue an economic upswing that has
been under way for the past four years. Continued high consumer demand is
expected to be matched by further strong investment by businesses, with
unemployment falling below 4% in 1997.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Greece</b></p>
<p>This country remains Europe's problem economy. Though its inflation rate
is coming down, it still is the highest in Europe, at around 9% in
1996.</p>
<p>The Greek economy is thought to have grown by only around 2% in 1996,
and private economists say government hopes of 3% to 3.5% growth in 1997
are optimistic. Interest rates are still in double digits, and there's no
chance that Greece will be able to participate in the first round of EMU.
But the government is making a big effort to try and qualify for the second
round.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Europe's Outsourcing Trend<br>
Led Technology Sector in 1996</h2>

<p><b>By K<font size="-1">IMBERLEY</font> A. S<font size="-1">TRASSEL</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>Service is everything. At least that was the ultimate decision of most
market analysts as they searched for technology-boom stocks in Europe in
1996.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96eu.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96eu-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Other" align="left" border="0"></a>While 1995 saw European tech stocks soar almost across the board, 1996
winners were found mostly in specific areas, especially in the
computer-consulting and outsourcing sector. Companies such as Axime SA and
SEMA SA in France, CMG PLC, Misys PLC and Logica PLC in the U.K. all were
big performers on the stock market in 1996.</p>
<p>Several factors have increased the need for external consultation. Key
among these is the "Year 2000" issue, or the expected meltdown many
companies will face when computers can't cope with dates in the new
millennium. Also of concern is the plan for the European monetary union,
when computers will need to be reprogrammed to work with just one European
currency. Many companies, in addition, are finding it more efficient to
farm out entire technology-driven departments, such as credit-card payment
centers, to these outsourcing companies.</p>
<p>"The outsourcing trend is gathering big momentum in Europe, and will
continue to become more and more encompassing," says Brian Ashford-Russell,
head of the technology team at fund managers Henderson Investment
Management in London. "The fact that most large European companies will
need to deal with issues like a single currency and a new millennium puts a
definite icing on the cake."</p>
<p>But while outsourcing companies shone in 1996, many European tech stocks
proved sluggish, as evidenced by the Dow Jones EuroTech Index, a group of
indexes tracking technology-related stocks in Europe. Like technology
indexes in the U.S., the EuroTech Index had a volatile year, ultimately
growing only 17% in 1996, as opposed to 1995 when it grew 23%. Analysts
attribute much of the lag to overbullish estimates on what this year would
bring and a run of monumental flops in high-risk technology companies.</p>
<p>Indeed, one of the biggest disasters in 1996 tech stocks happened on a
number of new alternative markets, including the Noveau Marche in France,
the Alternative Investment Market in the U.K. and most recently EASDAQ, a
pan-European exchange. These markets, designed to attract money for
smaller, riskier companies, ended up as a haven for new technology issues.
But analysts say that overhyped prices, poor exchange regulation and a
novice technology investor pool damped expected returns. One of  the
dive-bombers was Memory Corp., which saw stocks tumble 86%.</p>
<p>"The U.S. has a sophisticated high-tech market, with investors that
really know what to watch out for, and we don't have that in Europe yet,"
says Miel Bakker, senior portfolio manager at MeesPierson Capital
Management in the Netherlands. "Ultimately the possibility of bringing
smaller companies to the market is a very good thing, but this year there
is no doubt that most investments were unmitigated disasters."</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'Shake-Up in Industry'</b></p>
<p>Investors also shied away from many European personal-computer companies
as they struggled to drain huge inventories left over from the PC boom in
1995, as lagging European economies depressed home consumer markets.
Indeed, some European PC companies were severely hit. Loss-plagued Italian
consumer electronics company
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=olivy&amp;page=15">Olivetti</a> SpA said it will try
to sell off its ailing computer business, and German PC maker Escom AG that
filed for bankruptcy in July. Analysts were instead placing their bets with
bigger conglomerates such as Siemens AG, owner of computer maker Siemens
Nixdorf.</p>
<p>"This year brought a big shake-up in the industry as European companies
found themselves too dependent on collapsing home markets," says Emmanuel
Lalloz, research manager for personal computers at Context, a
computer-consulting group in London. "The companies that make it will be
those with huge financial power -- they can leverage this to carry them
through when margins are shrinking."</p>
<p>The big loser of the year was Olivetti, which came to the decision to
sell off its computer business only after watching its stock plummet 58% in
1996 after Italian financial authorities launched an investigation into the
company's accounting practices. Also hard hit were many Scandinavian
technology companies linked to former Deutsche Morgan Grenfell fund manager
Peter Young, who was dismissed for alleged misconduct amid a scandal
involving alleged misuse of investment funds. Among the big losers of that
affair was computer-services company Sysdeco, a company in which Mr. Young
was an investor and which has seen its stock price decline 84% in 1996.</p>
<p>Other hard-hit companies were those in the on-line market. Some of the
biggest names included pan-European provider Europe Online SA, which went
bankrupt in August, and Video Online, a much-hyped Italian company
ultimately swallowed by Telecom Italia.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Privatization in Western Europe<br>
Should Beat Last Year's Record</h2>

<p><b>By S<font size="-1">ILVIA</font> A<font size="-1">SCARELLI</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>FRANKFURT -- Last year was a record-breaking year for Western European
privatizations, and investment bankers say 1997 could be about as
hectic.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96eu.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96eu-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Other" align="left" border="0"></a>"My guess is it will be as busy or even busier," says Michael Evans,
head of equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs International in
London.</p>
<p>J.P. Morgan estimates governments will sell $53 billion in equity stakes
via the stock market this year, well above 1996's $43 billion. Not all
deals that are planned get done; J.P. Morgan had expected governments to
raise $55 billion in 1996. But even so, the 78% completion rate "is much
better than in previous years," says Caroline Meroz, a European equity
strategist with the investment bank.</p>
<p>This year probably won't be as full of big deals as 1996 was, when
Deutsche Telekom AG's 20.3 billion mark ($13 billion) deal became Europe's
largest-ever initial public offering, and Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi SpA
the continent's largest-ever secondary deal, with nine trillion lire ($5.9
billion).</p>
<p>But there still will be some hefty offerings. The resounding success of
the Deutsche deal is encouraging governments to go ahead with sell-offs and
hope that they, too, can raise more money from investors than originally
believed.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>'Try to Accelerate'</b></p>
<p>"We have to test, and we are testing the markets, to see whether we can
do more," says Mario Draghi, the Italian government official heading up the
privatizations. "In the Treasury, there is a definite feeling we should try
to accelerate."</p>
<p>Among the expected mega-offerings for next year:</p>
<p>Italian telecommunications holding company Societa Finanziaria
Telefonica per Azioni, or
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ste&amp;page=15">Stet</a>, although no
one yet knows how much the offering will be worth in light of Stet's
planned merger with Telecom Italia; a 20% stake in France Telecom,
estimated at anywhere from $5 billion to $8 billion; a third tranche of
stock in Italy's Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi SpA, or ENI, one of the world's
leading energy companies, that could raise at least $6 billion.</p>
<p>The deals are likely to be concentrated in the energy, utilities and
telecommunications sectors, just as they were in 1996. As usual, politics
will play a big role in how deals get done. That's one factor behind the
recurring delays in Stet's privatization by Italy. The record is little
better in France, where the government last month suspended the sale of
electronics giant Thomson SA to Lagardere Groupe and its South Korean ally,
Daewoo Group. In 1995, France Telecom employees delayed the sale of their
company and forced officials to grant numerous concessions.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Italy's Year</b></p>
<p>Among individual countries, 1997 could be Italy's year. J.P. Morgan
predicts the government could raise close to $20 billion, or just about
double 1996's $10.3 billion. Ms. Meroz won't talk about what deals are
included in that total. But the Stet sale, which has been delayed for
years, appears to be on track for autumn.</p>
<p>Highway concessionaire Autostrade SpA, currently being evaluated jointly
by Istituto Mobiliare Italiano and Schroders, likely will be sold early in
the year. A fresh slice of ENI, now 69% government-owned, is likely to sell
this summer. Observers are less certain whether the government will succeed
in bringing electricity group ENEL SpA to the market this year. More
likely, it will be one of 1998's larger deals.</p>
<p>The French government is likely to be a distant second to the Italians.
J.P. Morgan estimates Paris will raise $11 billion. France Telecom, slated
for April and lead-managed by Banque Nationale de Paris and Banque Paribas,
will take up a large part of that.</p>
<p>Spain could be third with $9 billion. The government approved the sale
of its remaining 21% stake in telecommunications company
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=tef&amp;page=15">Telefonica de Espana</a> SA just before Christmas, and
the offering, managed by Morgan Stanley, is expected to be concluded in the
first few months of this year.</p>
<p>The government also has said it will sell its remaining 10% holding in
oil group
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=rep&amp;page=15">Repsol</a>
SA and a 20% stake in
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=ele&amp;page=15">Empresa Nactional de
Electricidad</a> SA, or Endesa. The state currently owns 67% of the
electrical group.</p>
<p>After 1996's Deutsche Telekom extravaganza, the German government will
be relatively quiet with $5 billion. Its offerings are expected to include
Rast &amp; Tank AG, the highway concessionaire, and more of national
airline Lufthansa.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Europe's Retail Investors <br>
Catch Mutual-Fund Fever</h2>

<p><b>By R<font size="-1">OBERT</font> B<font size="-1">ONTE</font>-F<font size="-1">RIEDHEIM</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>European retail investors gained confidence in 1996, as booming stock
and bond markets persuaded them to pour more of their assets into the
continent's mutual funds.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96eu.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96eu-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Other" align="left" border="0"></a>Fund-flow data provided by the national mutual-fund associations show
that it's been a particularly good year for equity funds. German and French
savers are becoming increasingly aware of the benefits of investing in
stocks. British investors' proverbial love for equities (more than 80% of
fund assets) has continued, and the Swiss have been avid buyers of
international stock funds. Only the Italians have shunned the move to
stocks.</p>
<p>Be this as it may, overall first prize for 1996 goes to Italy, where the
fund industry's assets jumped a whopping 47% in the first eleven months of
the year. That's more than twice as much as the next European market,
Switzerland, where investment funds' assets rose 23% over the same
period.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Italian Banks Pushed Funds</b></p>
<p>The truth behind the statistic is that Italian banks have been furiously
marketing bond funds and money-market funds, says Massimo Fortuzzi, chief
investment officer of Finanza &amp; Futuro, the Italian fund-management arm
of Deutsche Bank of Germany.</p>
<p>Previously, this money had mostly been invested in state debt. "The
banks convinced their clients that their investment managerial skills will
lead to higher profits," says Mr. Fortuzzi. The driving force behind this
trend was the fact that banks earn more from fund-management fees than from
sales commissions on bonds or treasuries, he adds.</p>
<p>Luckily for savers, the superior-return argument was mostly true in
1996, as retail investors sold short-dated issues in order to invest in
funds holding longer-dated bonds, which benefited from sharply declining
bond yields. The fortunes of Italian fixed-income funds contrasted sharply
with equity funds, which have been hit by redemptions. Italians still don't
trust their domestic stock exchange, and international stock funds were
hurt by currency losses as the lira appreciated 12% against the mark this
year.</p>
<p>In order to capitalize on the mass sale of Italian funds, the next step
will be for banks to persuade their customers to move their money from bond
and money-market funds into stock funds, argues Mr. Fortuzzi.</p>
<p>The coming year "could witness a trend to domestic equity funds because
it will be easy to convince clients that it's not worth investing in bond
funds that will yield 6% if things go well, but that it's much better to
take some risk and have more reward by investing in domestic equity funds,"
he says.</p>
<p>In the U.K., overall assets of the unit-trust and investment-fund
industry rose by almost 16%, the strongest growth coming in the
fixed-income segment.</p>
<p>Though much smaller than equity funds, domestic bond funds grew by a
staggering 83% in the first eleven months of the year. "Thanks to new
legislation, it is for the first time possible to invest in income products
for their tax-efficient savings schemes," or PEPs, says Richard Wastcoat,
European retail director for Fidelity Investments.</p>
<p>Fidelity's top-selling funds in the U.K. have been the corporate bond
fund and its cash unit trust, partly thanks to the low interest-rate
environment. "Interest rates are at historically low levels on
building-society deposits, therefore consumers are trying new alternatives
to make their money work harder," says Mr. Wastcoat.</p>
<p>In Germany's mutual-fund industry, 1996 will be remembered as the year
in which equity investing received a shot in the arm. The Frankfurt
exchange's DAX stock index soared through one high after another, closing
up 28.20% for the year.</p>
<p>Investor confidence was boosted by the spread of guaranteed equity
funds. By guaranteeing customers they would lose little or none of their
original investment within a defined period (say, five years), such funds
have drawn a lot of traditionally risk-averse German investors into the
stock market.</p>
<p>International equity funds recorded particularly strong inflows. "I see
the trend into European stocks," says Heinrich Durstewitz, spokesman of
Deutscher Investment Trust, the retail fund-management arm of Dresdner
Bank. DIT's flagship European equity fund has attracted the biggest inflows
of all, he says.</p>
<p>To top off a year of good news, the German state floated a stake in
Deutsche Telekom AG in November -- the biggest privatization ever. More
than 40% of this offering was sold to retail investors, and German fund
managers say it has kindled enthusiasm for their products.</p>
<p>Across the Rhine, it's been a maudlin year for the French fund industry.
Assets grew a mere 6.5% in the first 11 months of 1996, mostly because the
French economy is still sputtering, as is disposable income.</p>
<p>"People are at their maximum saving levels [because of] high
unemployment and salary levels that are stable or falling," says Anne-Marie
George, international marketing manager at Credit Lyonnais Asset
Management.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Most European Bonds Will See <br>
Early Gains Before Price Squeeze</h2>

<p>Slow economic growth and weakening inflation stoked gains in the bond
market in 1996, but there appears to be little hope that inflation can sink
still lower in European economies.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96eu.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96eu-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Other" align="left" border="0"></a>In the early part of 1997, most European government bond markets are
expected to continue the gains that, according to J.P. Morgan's world
government bond index, saw Spanish bond prices rise some 21% in 1996 and
Italian bond prices gain more than 23%.</p>
<p>After that, however, prices will be under pressure for the remainder of
the year, analysts said.</p>
<p>Tightening yield spreads between Germany and the higher-yielding markets
in Europe was a major feature of the European market in 1996, and Christoph
Hott, head of fixed income at DB Research, a unit of Deutsche Bank AG in
Frankfurt, argues that spreads between Germany and higher yielders in
Europe will narrow further in 1997.</p>
<p>This, however, "isn't a linear process," he says, and there is plenty of
room for them to widen from time to time in 1997 if the German government
and Bundesbank start taking a harder line on countries conforming to the
criteria necessary to join in the single European currency.</p>
<p>European Union member states' fitness for economic and monetary union
will be decided early in 1998 on the strength of economic performance in
1997. Progress toward EMU also will be conditioned by whether Germany can
force through its proposed "stability pact" aimed at protecting the single
currency from lax fiscal policy after 1999.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Eurobonds</b></p>
<p>The Eurobond market, meanwhile, is set to follow a record-breaking 1996
with even more volume next year, said investment bankers -- but change is
coming.</p>
<p>Stable underlying economic conditions and preparations for the single
European currency in 1999 are likely to prompt changes in the makeup of the
market, with a shift in emphasis away from sovereign country deals toward
corporate borrowers and higher-yielding or structured products.</p>
<p>With the volume of new issues this year up by about 30% from 1995, it
has been a bumper year for the Eurobond sector. According to figures from
Capital DATA Bondware, total issuance of international bonds (excluding
equity-linked debt) to Dec. 6 was $621 billion, compared with total
issuance of $442 billion in 1995. The pace of growth in the sector is
expected to slow next year, but an overall rise in volume is widely
forecast, with many market participants expecting total issuance to top
$700 billion for the first time.</p>
<p>"I doubt if the market can sustain the kind of growth we've seen this
year, but the outlook is very positive -- there are good fundamentals
underpinning the market," said David Tory, head of European syndicate at
Merrill Lynch International in London. "We're anticipating a gradual rise
in interest rates over the course of the year, but it should be a slow
process and won't destabilize the market."</p>
<p>As ever, the dollar will continue to be the currency of choice for most
investors, despite low U.S. interest rates. Volatility in Europe and
close-to-zero interest rates in Japan mean the dollar is now the undisputed
reserve currency for bond investors, and its share of the new-issues market
is widely expected to expand from this year's 40% in 1997.</p>
<p>The Eurobond industry itself is expected to have a watershed year in
1997, at the end of which it should become apparent which group of banks is
going to seriously contend among the top ranks of the global new-issue
business.</p>
<p>Next year "will show which firms are going to be truly global players,"
said Kensey Green, head of syndicate at Commerzbank London. "That's because
managements are now becoming increasingly cautious as to how much it's
costing to become such a player. It's vital to work out how to approach
underwriting, but also important to be clear why."</p>
<p>They said it's essential for banks to establish now whether they want to
stay as regional specialists or go all out for a bulge bracket business on
a global scale.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Derivatives</b></p>
<p>In the interest-rate swap markets, market uncertainty in this pivotal
year for determining the likelihood of who will join in the single European
currency may create illiquidity in certain interest-rate swap and bond
markets.</p>
<p>As European markets converge, either naturally or through political
will, trading in markets such as Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg
may dry up in favor of buying German bonds and swaps, said Nick Burge,
director of interest rate and currency swaps at Nomura International in
London.</p>
<p>The driving force for this trend is the fact that these markets already
closely follow the German market.</p>
<p>"Money managers likely will trade currencies such as Belgium, Dutch and
Lux as a spread to Germany only," said Mr. Burge. "But for directional
views, they'll go to the German market because it sets the trend for
Europe."</p>
<p>The futures markets are already showing a trend toward
consolidation.</p>
<p>"We're already seeing some of this in the futures market because volumes
on the [French futures exchange] Matif are falling compared to volumes on
the Liffe [London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange],"
he said.</p>
<p>The Liffe, meanwhile, is considering listing short- and midterm mark
interest-rate contracts next year in preparation for a single European
currency.</p>
<p>The London exchange believes these contracts will become the benchmark
interest-rate products denominated in the single currency, the euro, after
it is introduced in 1999, according to Liffe's chief executive, Daniel
Hodson.</p>
<p>The Liffe has already started to prepare for European monetary and
economic union by listing Bund futures and options as well as one- and
three-month Euromark interest-rate contracts. These will become euro
contracts when the mark is converted to the euro.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Germany</b></p>
<p>A shakeout in the first quarter, followed by an erratic upward drift in
yields under the influence of EMU, is what analysts expect for the German
bond market in 1997.</p>
<p>With growth set to accelerate to around 2.5% and inflation likely to
edge upward, analysts broadly agree that yields are more likely to be
higher in a year's time than they are now. But they disagree on how much
higher they'll be, and why. Consensus forecasts put 10-year yields toward
the top end of a 6.5% to 7% range by the end of 1997.</p>
<p>The familiar fourth-quarter rally in 1996 has left the market exposed to
a volatile first quarter, said analysts. Ros Lifton, senior international
economist with HSBC Markets in London, sees 10-year yields rising to around
6.20% in the quarter, at which point she expects revived domestic demand
for Bunds to support the market.</p>
<p>Graham McDevitt, senior bond strategist with Paribas Capital Markets in
London, said oversupply is also likely to be a problem at the start of
1997. The federal government will almost certainly issue a 10-year bond in
the first few days of the year. In addition, he notes that nongovernment
issuers like to get borrowing programs under way promptly, and the
historically low rates all along the mark curve will encourage them.</p>
<p>For the rest of 1997, the supply of Bunds threatens to be a negative
factor, even though the Bundesbank could spice up jaded investor appetite
from about the second quarter onward with the introduction of bonds where
the coupon can be stripped and traded separately. And, for the first time,
there will be regular issuance in the 30-year maturity sector.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>France</b></p>
<p>French bonds are unlikely to match this year's stunning gains in 1997,
said economists, but they could still hit historic highs early in the year
before they retreat.</p>
<p>Whatever happens in the market, though, will more than likely be in
response to developments elsewhere, as convergence toward monetary union in
Europe is expected to keep yields on French Obligations Assimilables du
Tresor on the same track as those of the core group of European countries
whose currencies will participate in the single currency's launch.</p>
<p>Eric Chaney, senior economist for Morgan Stanley SA in Paris, said
domestic institutional investors who played a key role in the 1996 rally
are still liquid and looking for paper. That demand, said economists, is
likely to increase as new cash enters the market through life insurance
premiums, which remain tax-advantaged in 1997. Life insurers, major
participants in the 1996 bond rally, are expected to have brought in around
450 billion French francs ($85.73 billion) of new cash for all of 1996 from
investors fleeing shrinking returns on money-market and passbook-savings
accounts.</p>
<p>Increasingly in 1997, attention will focus on France's ability to meet
its budget deficit goal of 3% of gross domestic product by the end of the
year.</p>
<p>Domestic investment in bonds could get an additional, if marginal, boost
in 1997 with the introduction of private pension funds. These long-term
tax-advantaged savings instruments could provide an extra 20 billion francs
or so of new cash to the long end of the market, said Philippe Brossard,
head of bond research for ABN Amro Finance SA.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Italy</b></p>
<p>Italy's bond market is expected to stabilize in the early part of 1997,
backed up by good economic fundamentals but consolidating in the second
half as discussions regarding participation in the single European currency
dominate, said economists.</p>
<p>The extreme gains of 1996 are considered to be a thing of the past.
Darren Williams, a European economist at Union Bank of Switzerland in
London, said "the Italian bond market will be supported by good
fundamentals, but it has gotten a little carried away with itself.</p>
<p>"If Italy doesn't make it into the EMU, then there is room for a
potential shock to the system," said Mr. Williams. "We see the 10-year
benchmark bond yield spread [to Bunds] widening a bit if it becomes evident
that Italy won't make the first group of countries" to be a part of the
single currency.</p>
<p>Also expected to affect the market in early 1997 is the need for a
minibudget of some 10 trillion lire ($6.55 billion) to help the government
keep to its stated 1997 deficit target of 3% of gross domestic product, one
of the most important Maastricht treaty criteria for EMU.</p>
<p>After stabilizing and dropping in the last three years, the deficit this
year threatens to show little improvement or possibly even rise from last
year's 130 trillion lire figure.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>U.K. &amp; Ireland</b></p>
<p>With economic growth gathering momentum, and interest rates expected to
rise in response, gilts are posing a striking contrast to other European
bond markets going into the new year.</p>
<p>This is prompting many analysts to take a bearish view of the market.
They predict that U.K. bonds will at best keep up with the rest of Europe
in the first half of 1997. The short-sterling interest-rate futures market
is pricing in a sharp rise in base rates to well above 7.25% by December
1997. And even if the consensus of market observers now see a peak of
around 6.75% to 7% by the end of the third quarter, the market isn't likely
to adopt such a scenario until "the bad news is out of the way," analysts
say.</p>
<p>"The markets, like the Bank of England, need to be convinced that the
rebound in growth won't trigger inflation," says Gerard Lyons, chief
economist with DKB International.</p>
<p>Another uncertainty weighing on the market will be the U.K. general
election and the possibility of a new party in power by the second quarter.
The opposition Labour Party retains a significant lead over the ruling
Conservative Party in the polls and the markets are worried it will bring
back the spendthrift practices of past Labour governments once in
power.</p>
<p>The election must be held before May 22 and the favored date among
commentators is May 1.</p>
<p>The coming election also will add to the uncertainty about the timing of
the next interest-rate rise. Some analysts argue that Chancellor of the
Exchequer Kenneth Clarke will be unwilling to raise rates further ahead of
the election and risk upsetting potential voters.</p>
<p>In Ireland, meanwhile, bond yields will move a step closer toward
matching German bond yields in 1997, but the convergence road leading to
European economic and monetary union is going to be bumpy.</p>
<p>Analysts said Irish bonds are benefiting from the market's growing
confidence that a European single currency will go ahead as scheduled on
Jan. 1, 1999. Any further progress made by EU members on the structure for
a single currency, the euro, will spur convergence buying of Irish bonds in
1997, bond market participants said.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Sweden &amp; Denmark</b></p>
<p>Swedish government bonds should thrive in 1997, nurtured by low
inflation and further cuts in the securities repurchase rate. In such a
climate, the market should have enough thrust to squeeze the yield spread
over Germany below one percentage point.</p>
<p>But rising international bond yields and the risk that the Riksbank,
Sweden's central bank, will be forced to raise its key rate at the end of
1997, will probably leave bond yields higher as the year progresses.</p>
<p>"Swedish long bond yields will reach their trough in 1997 at around
6.75% or lower, but then rise in line with the rest of Europe," said Nils
Lundgren, chief economist at Nordbanken.</p>
<p>The dramatic development in 1996, when the 10-year yield spread over
Germany dropped by over one percentage point, will not be repeated this
year, most economists believe, but a significant tightening of the spread
is achievable, most economists believe.</p>
<p>The fact that Sweden enjoys the world's lowest inflation rate at the
moment even though economic activity is rising -- economists expect the
growth rate this year to almost double from 1996's pace -- provides an
attractive backdrop for investors looking at Sweden for investment
opportunities.</p>
<p>The repo rate is currently 4.1%, following the latest reduction on Dec.
17. The cut came in connection with a favorable outlook for inflation in a
report by the Riksbank. The central bank predicted an average inflation
rate of 1.5% this year.</p>
<p>In Denmark, politics, both of the domestic and European variety, are set
to play an increasingly central role in the local bond market. And this,
say analysts, creates a mixed bag of opportunities and threats.</p>
<p>On the home front, the most commonly held view is that Prime Minister
Poul Nyrup Rasmussen's minority government hasn't much chance of completing
its full term of office until autumn 1998.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, another big European issue market players will watch closely
is a constitutional test case being brought by a group of 11 citizens in
the Danish Supreme Court. The group is challenging the Danish government's
accession to the European Union as a breach of the Danish constitution.</p>
<p>The issue raises the sticky question of whether Denmark will be able to
sign any new European Union treaties in 1997 if the case drags on.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Benelux</b></p>
<p>As long as plans for the start-up of a single European currency stay on
track in 1997, there will be no surprises on the Belgian government bond
market, analysts say.</p>
<p>As required by the Maastricht treaty, the coalition government of Prime
Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene put together a 1997 budget that targets a budget
deficit of roughly 3% of next year's estimated gross domestic product. With
a lower deficit, the government has less need to issue debt, notes J.P.
Morgan analyst Laurent Fransolet.</p>
<p>"The government deficit is relatively small compared to previous years,
and refunding needs are also small thanks to exchange auctions," he said.
"So the total amount of debt it will have to issue will be relatively small
in 1997."</p>
<p>Indeed, the Belgian National Bank expects to issue roughly 550 billion
francs ($17.1 billion) of bonds at its monthly auctions next year, "a
little less than this year," a spokesman said.</p>
<p>Dutch bond yields, also at historic lows, are expected to rise in 1997.
By the end of 1997, analysts forecast the yield on the 10-year government
benchmark at between 5.75% and 6.75%.</p>
<p>But Gerlof de Vrij, senior bond strategist at ABN Amro Bank,
nevertheless believes Dutch bonds will outperform their neighbors. He
thinks the yield spread with Germany is likely to widen to a discount of 10
basis points by the end of 1997, basing his prognosis largely on the Dutch
government's low borrowing needs next year.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Switzerland &amp; Austria</b></p>
<p>The Swiss bond market currently envisages a stable EMU and a single
European currency that will start as planned in 1999. But should this
Euro-euphoria die down, capital might come flooding back into Swiss
bonds.</p>
<p>Switzerland, having opted to stay clear of EMU, is regarded as a safe
haven for investments when an EMU crisis occurs. Such an event would lead
to a strengthening Swiss franc and spur bond yields below their current
levels.</p>
<p>However, this isn't analysts' most-likely scenario.</p>
<p>Daniel Witschi, financial market analyst at Swiss Bank Corp., says
accelerating growth in Switzerland and in Germany should lead to bond
yields moving slightly higher. However, he doesn't expect this to happen
until the second half of 1997.</p>
<p>Once the economy starts picking up, the Swiss National Bank is expected
to put the brakes on its currently generous supply of liquidity.</p>
<p>The yield on Austria's 10-year benchmark bond is expected to rise in the
second half of 1997 as the approach of the single European currency and
moderate domestic economic growth begin taking their toll.</p>
<p>The higher yield expectations come after a relatively calm year on the
Austrian bond market, which stabilized in 1996 after being shaken up in
October 1995 by the collapse of the country's coalition government.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Spain &amp; Portugal</b></p>
<p>There's no secret to what will be the Spanish bond market's principal
driving force throughout 1997: Spain's ability to meet the criteria
necessary to be among the countries accepted into the first round of
Europe's single currency plan.</p>
<p>The offshoot will be the Bank of Spain's need to fight inflation, while
simultaneously jump-starting the economy through a continued easing of its
monetary policy, according to analysts.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, 1996 may be an indication of the Spanish bond market's
capability. Yields plummeted during the year, with the 10-year benchmark
spread tightening to around 1.05 over Germany late in the year from around
2.60 over in January 1996.</p>
<p>But, like a high-risk poker game, investors in 1997 will be forced to
place bets and decide whether the single currency will indeed occur with
Spain, one of the chosen few.</p>
<p>Spain's inflation is expected to decelerate, but the degree to which it
does has some players concerned.</p>
<p>In that vein, analysts agreed the government's 1997 budget will control
the increase of overall expenditures below the rate of inflation. Moreover,
both internal spending and social spending controls are expected to not
only help control inflation, but help reduce the deficit to the 3% of gross
domestic product as outlined in the EMU criteria.</p>
<p>In addition, Spain's moderate growth prospects are expected to force the
Bank of Spain to continue lowering its key rate to inject life into the
Spanish economy.</p>
<p>The single currency issue is also expected to keep Portuguese government
bond prices buoyant in 1997, according to analysts. But they warn the pace
of gains will slow considerably from the breakneck haste that saw the yield
on the benchmark 10-year issue plummet to below 7% by late 1996 from above
10% at the start of the year.</p>
<p>And despite the fact that any major bumps on the road to a single
currency would put a spoiler on all the high-yielding bond markets,
Portugal's sustained efforts at real convergence are seen cushioning prices
from a serious blow.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Hungry Investors Find Their Feast<br>
In Eastern Europe's Debt Markets</h2>

<p><b>By D<font size="-1">ANIEL</font> M<font size="-1">ICHAELS</font>
</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>Investors will look back on 1996 as the year that East European debt
came of age.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96eu.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96eu-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Other" align="left" border="0"></a>While the region's stock markets still draw headlines with double-digit
returns, these days international investors are putting more of their money
into fixed-income instruments. Across the region, debt market
capitalization far outweighs that of local equity markets. And while
international interest in stocks from the ex-communist world remains
dominated by emerging-market specialists, the region's debt holds
increasingly broad appeal. These markets are maturing and globalizing at a
head-spinning pace.</p>
<p>Over the past year, Czech bonds graduated from emerging-market status
into the buttoned-down world of mainstream global portfolio investors.
Russia struck deals with Western sovereign and commercial creditors on
Soviet-era debt -- a success that it followed up with a rousing debut on
the Eurobond market. Polish corporates issued zloty debt fast and furious,
and three Polish banks followed the state's 1995 entry to the Eurobond
market. Tiny Slovenia and mighty Kazakstan joined the ex-communist Eurobond
club.</p>
<p>With the path now well set, 1997 is shaping up to be a year with more of
everything. While most debt issued from the region since 1989 has been
local-currency debt, ex-communist Europe's increasing respectability means
that its governments and corporate issuers will be turning to international
markets increasingly often for lower rates and greater liquidity than home
markets can offer. Global investors are hungry for East European debt --
and the varied region has something to offer almost everyone.</p>
<p>"There's going to be supply and there's going to be demand," says David
Boren, vice president for emerging-markets research at Salomon Bros. in
London. "The Eurobond market is going to be one of the most interesting
developments taking place next year," he adds.</p>
<p>Yield and diversity -- that's what investors like about East European
fixed income. For yield, Russian Treasury bills peaked at 259% at the
height of political uncertainty in the spring, but have since come down to
around 30%. But yield, of course, comes with risk. Now, investors who like
to sleep at night can also invest in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Czech and Polish Eurobonds offer investment-grade security. And for
investors already neck-deep in Latin American debt, Europe's new entrants
provide welcome diversity to a global portfolio. Increasingly, staid
Western financial institutions -- from pension funds to insurance companies
-- are also snapping up Central European international fixed-income
instruments. That new demand has helped push spreads to just a whisker
above benchmark Western rates.</p>
<p>"The collapse of spreads highlights the increased investor awareness of
these markets," says Paul Raphael, managing director of Merrill Lynch's
capital markets group for Eastern Europe, the Mideast and Africa in
London.</p>
<p>Mr. Raphael points to improved credit quality across the region as a
clear draw, with Czech, Polish, Hungarian, Slovenian and Slovakian debt all
now at investment grade. Romania and the Baltic states are 1997's hot
prospects, thanks to hopes for accelerating reforms and increased foreign
investment. Bulgaria and Ukraine remain the region's sleepers -- lands of
huge potential but little progress. To most investors, that means too much
risk, even if returns can be astronomical.</p>
<p>Among Eastern Europe's fastest-growing markets, "the dramatic number and
speed of introductions of sovereigns and corporates" has increased the
region's appeal significantly, says Mr. Raphael. Greater supply means
greater liquidity, and investors like that. Meanwhile, investors are also
starting to buy up local-currency debt instruments.</p>
<p>The bottom line from all this enthusiasm is money, and 1997 should be a
banner year.</p>
<p>"The potential capital flows into the region are significant," says Mr.
Boren at Salomon Bros. He predicts that in just Euromarket issues, the
ex-communist world could place "several billion dollars" of debt, with
Russia alone issuing up to $5 billion. The new year should also be the year
of corporate debt. With sovereign issues now well established, banks and
corporates are following quickly.</p>
<p>Here is a rundown of recent developments and prospects for 1997 in the
region's largest markets:</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Russia</b></p>
<p>Russia is the new kid on the block for fixed income, but quickly has
come to dominate. Far larger than any other country in the region, its
enormous financing needs even outweigh its relative physical size. For
investors who can stomach Russian risk, supply is at hand -- and risk even
appears to be dropping.</p>
<p>From Moscow's perspective, the bond market is Russia's success story of
1996. While the stock markets dollar-denominated Moscow Times Index
doubled, rising 123% in 1996, loose regulation, political risk and economic
uncertainty still scare off all but the heartiest emerging-market equity
players and deter many direct investors. But thanks to an improving
macroeconomic picture, investment in debt instruments blossomed.</p>
<p>"There's no question, this was the year of fixed-income investments in
Russia," says Andrei Yashchenko, a Moscow-based fixed-income analyst with
United City Bank, a foreign investment bank.</p>
<p>Why the huge interest in Russian debt? Fantastic yields on Russian
Treasury bills and a general sense among foreign investors that Russia has
become a safer place for their money. Political risk has fallen since
President Boris Yeltsin successfully underwent heart surgery. The
month-to-month inflation rate has dropped from a high of 4.1% to 1.9%.
Russia's currency is more stable than ever, and market infrastructure is
improving.</p>
<p>And Russia now also boasts respectable credit ratings of double-B and
double-B-minus from Moody's Investors Service and Standard &amp; Poor's
Ratings Group, respectively. At least $1 billion already trades daily in
just Russian Treasury bills. Richard Deitz, a managing director and head of
fixed-income trading at Moscow investment bank Renaissance Capital,
estimates foreign investment in the GKO market at up to $6 billion.</p>
<p>"This market has come a tremendous way in the last year," he says.</p>
<p>Interest in dollar debt has grown, too. Russia entered international
debt markets in November for the first time since 1917, with a $1 billion
denominated Eurobond issue reported to be oversubscribed by as much as
three times.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Poland</b></p>
<p>With trails blazed for Polish sovereign and corporate debt on both
domestic and Eurobond markets, 1997 will see more of everything. The
government expects to issue up to $500 million of debt on international
markets, and commercial lenders could match that number, analysts say.</p>
<p>Since parliamentary elections are due by autumn, equity players are
taking a wait-and-see approach to new privatizations. After 1996's healthy
rise of 59% in dollar terms on the Warsaw Stock Exchange's WIG Index, many
investors are waiting for new listings to draw capital.</p>
<p>But demand for debt grows steadily. Polish Brady bonds (restructured
communist-era international commercial-bank debt) have earned a risk-return
profile so attractive that they are being bought up by ordinary bond
investors -- not just the emerging-market speculators. It's a story
repeated throughout the fast-growing world of Polish fixed income.</p>
<p>On the domestic market, the government will continue to dominate in
volume of zloty issues. Polish Treasury bills remain attractive to
international investors because of their robust real returns. Falling rates
of inflation trimmed three-month rates to 19.5% in early December from
29.5% last January, but that's still an appealing draw.</p>
<p>Poland's big story in 1997 promises to be corporate Eurobond debt.
"There's a lot of demand out there in the market for Euro-currency issues,"
says Kyle Spicer, head of fixed income at Bank Austria's IB Austria
Securities SA in Warsaw. Indeed, 1996 saw three major Polish banks together
issue $200 million in dollar-denominated Eurobonds -- and each trumped the
last in narrowing spreads over benchmark U.S. and German issues. Expect
many more international issues in 1997 and even zloty-denominated Eurobond
issues.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Czech Republic</b></p>
<p>With a stable currency, predictable inflation and downward pressure on
interest rates, the Czech bond market has done well in 1996. That helped
make up for relatively lackluster Czech equities -- Prague's PX-50 Index
only rose 20%  in dollar terms over 1996.</p>
<p>Prague boasts Central Europe's widest-ranging bond market, with around
90 issues on the domestic market valued at about 170 billion korunas ($6.23
billion). Add to that the growing market of koruna-denominated Eurobonds
(currently 18 issues outstanding, totaling 23 billion koruna), and you get
a market quickly approaching Western standards.</p>
<p>Unlike other countries in the region, the Czech market is dominated by
corporate bonds. Because the state runs a budget surplus, government bonds
and Treasury bills play only a minor role in the market.</p>
<p>Despite the Czech market's breadth, it can still prove volatile, thanks
to poor liquidity in the secondary market -- a result of Czech National
Bank reserve requirements limiting bond trading by banks. But analysts
predict further growth in 1997, as more Czech companies turn to debt
instruments to fuel their expansion plans.</p>
<p>"It's becoming increasingly accepted for large companies to raise their
funds on the bond market, since it can be cheaper than bank loans and since
the stock market is doing so poorly," says Ota Otepka, who heads the
trading operations at the Prague office of ING Barings.</p>
<p>Most of the debt issues in 1996 were put to market by large
corporations, such as power companies CEZ AS and Jihomoravska Energetika
AS. The new feature in 1996, though, was the entry of smaller companies to
the bond market, such as the Sazka AS lottery company. While the commercial
paper market is expanding, most interest hovers around long-term bonds,
however, prompted by expectations of declining rates of inflation.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Hungary</b></p>
<p>Hungarian debt is dominated by one issuer: the government.</p>
<p>Thanks to its huge fiscal deficit, the Hungarian state accounts for
roughly 90% of the forint fixed-income market, and the country has issued
enough international debt to place it among the world's highest per-capita
debtors.</p>
<p>Last year was a banner year for the Budapest Stock Exchange, whose BUX
Index rose 125% in dollar terms. The success drew attention away from slow
progress on the corporate debt front.</p>
<p>Huge state borrowing has slowed corporate debt market development.
Corporate fixed income also has been thwarted by government restrictions on
foreign investment; by the easy access that the country's many
multinationals have to intra-company loans; and by high borrowing costs.
The government's three-month Treasury bills opened the year at 29.5%, and
although they fell significantly, to 22.4% by mid-December, corporate
issuers still need to top those formidable numbers. But analysts expect the
picture to change in 1997.</p>
<p>Investor interest is strong and growing, helped in part by Standard
&amp; Poor Ratings Group's October rating improvement to investment-grade.
Analysts predict slow, steady growth in Hungary's corporate market during
1997 and in more sophisticated instruments, such as forint Eurobonds.</p>

<h2 class="ArtHed">Market Professionals Teach<br>
Monkey a Valuable Lesson</h2>

</b><br><font size="-1">Staff Reporter of </font><font size="-1">T</font><font size="-2">HE</font><font size="-1"> W</font><font size="-2">ALL</font><font size="-1"> S</font><font size="-2">TREET</font><font size="-1"> J</font><font size="-2">OURNAL</font><font size="-1"></font><br>
<b></b></p>
<p>1996: A great year for stock markets, but no great shakes for
monkeys.</p>
<p><a href="/public/current/summaries/yer96eu.htm"><img src="/public/resources/media/yer96eu-la.gif" height="80" width="178" alt="Logo for Special Report J - Other" align="left" border="0"></a>In a long-running test to measure how "efficient" European stock markets
are, The Wall Street Journal Europe has for the past five years pitched the
forces of random selection -- epitomized by a mythical monkey tossing darts
at the newspaper -- against the assembled skills of the old continent's
stock market professionals.</p>
<p>Fortunately for their credibility, their dignity and their year-end
bonuses, the investment pros taking part in the contest in 1996 again
outpaced both the monkey's random portfolio and, by an even wider margin, a
broad European stock market index.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Nice Work If You Can Get It</b></p>
<p>The obvious conclusion to draw from the pros' 1996 victory is that
European markets still are far from efficient, meaning there is plenty of
room for astute stock pickers -- like most of those taking part in the
contest -- to put themselves ahead of the investment herd.</p>
<p>But the monkey hasn't been retired yet, and even the best of the pros
warns that as European stock markets evolve, the contest isn't going to get
any easier.</p>
<p>"The markets are getting more and more interlinked and react faster and
faster to global news. They are becoming more technical," says Frederic
Sauvegrain, a sales trader with CS First Boston in London. With four
successive victories in the competition under his belt since he joined the
contest in December 1994, the 34-year-old has established an enviable
record as a stock picker, notably in his native French market, a skill
which he attributes above all to his "nose," or intuitive sense for a good
bet.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, Mr. Sauvegrain remains optimistic that recent progress
toward European Monetary Union will allow European interest rates to
continue their downward trend, underpinning further stock market gains. He
also considers that his job still has a future because, despite the
increasingly correlated nature of world markets, a speculative element will
continue to push one or another stock out of line, albeit briefly, opening
short-term investment opportunities.</p>
<p>However, repeating the old market adage that "Trees don't grow to
heaven," Mr. Sauvegrain warns that the markets are unlikely to repeat their
impressive 1996 performance again this year. "Most markets are at historic
levels, so I'm going to be careful now," he said.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Hard to Match</b></p>
<p>Certainly, it will difficult for Mr. Sauvegrain to match his best pick
of the year. That was French retail and trading group
Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, whose stock rose 76.5% between December 1995 and
June 1996, partly in a recovery from a spate of bad news in 1995 and partly
because of the cuts in French interest rates.</p>
<p>"It's getting more and more difficult to pick undervalued stocks,"
agrees another of the best-performing contestants from 1996, Danny Geerken.
In addition to the fact that many markets are looking fully valued after
their exceptionally strong run through 1996, the markets are also growing
increasingly efficient, maintains Mr. Geerken, who runs his own small
brokerage firm, Het Haags Effektenkantoor, in the Hague, Holland.
"Information is getting into the market faster. Also, investors are tending
to look abroad more than they used to, and they are more aware that
everything is connected," he says.</p>
<p>Mr. Geerken scored an impressive 42.7% return on Dutch trading house
Hagemayer between September 1995 and March 1996. However, he has since been
knocked out of the contest after placing his next bet on Dutch electronics
giant Philips Electronics, which turned in a miserable 3.7% loss over the
following six-month period to September 1996.</p>
<p class="subhed"><b>Small Market Caps</b></p>
<p>Even though European markets certainly are changing in nature, they
still are handicapped by their relatively small market capitalizations,
especially when compared with the U.S. and U.K. markets, other investment
pros say. "European markets are becoming more efficient, with greater
transparency [of corporate reporting], and more U.S. funds investing, but
there remains a problem of liquidity, which can make stocks volatile," says
Kevin Devine, managing director of Value Management &amp; Research in
Koenigstein, Germany.</p>
<p>Florian Homm, Mr. Devine's partner, emerged as another of the contest's
best performers in 1996, thanks to his bet on French state-controlled bank
Credit National. Credit National's stock rose 42.1% in the six months to
April 1996, but Mr. Homm lost his foothold in the contest when his
subsequent choice, German holding company AGIV, dropped 17.2% in the next
six months.</p>
<p>A glance at the best and worst performances recorded in the contest
during the past 12 months underlines Mr. Devine's point that many European
stocks remain unpredictably volatile. Indeed, the contest's results buck
conventional wisdom by showing that the professionals as a group were more
erratic in their performances than the random selections. The case of
<a href="/inap-bin/bb?sym=olivy&amp;page=15">Olivetti</a>, whose stock lost no less than 42.5% between April and
October 1996 as the company was pummeled by management upheavals, massive
losses, and stock market investigations, stands out as a case in point.</p>

<center><h3>SUMMER ASSOCIATES</h3></center><p>

Faegre & Benson typically fills its needs for new associates for its Minneapolis, Denver and Des Moines offices through its summer program.  Summer associates who demonstrate the ability to do outstanding legal work receive offers to join the Firm.  Typically, a large <A HREF="rec_chrt.html"> percentage</A> of summer associates receive an offer.  We recruit the best law students from law schools throughout the United States.  In the past two years our summer associates have come from a variety of law schools including:  Berkeley, Chicago, Colorado, Duke, Emory, Georgetown, Hamline, Harvard, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, New York University, Northwestern, Oregon, Stanford, Vanderbilt, Virginia, Washington University, William Mitchell, Wisconsin and Yale.

<p>

Our summer program has consistently received high ratings in the <EM>American Lawyer</EM> S.A. survey.  In 1993 we were rated #1 in Minneapolis and amongst the top in the nation.  In 1995 we were #2 in Minneapolis by only .01%.

<p>

Summer associates perform a range of legal work in various practice areas.  Summer associates receive constructive feedback on their written projects through a formal writing program, as well as evaluations by assigning attorneys.  These evaluations are the primary bases for our hiring decisions.

<p>

Summer associates are also introduced to other aspects of the practice of law, including depositions, hearings, trials, negotiating sessions, and client meetings.  Summer associates also have the opportunity to participate in the Volunteer Lawyers Network Summer Associate Program, representing indigent persons with a variety of legal problems.

<p>

Each summer associate has an attorney sponsor who helps acquaint the summer associate to our office and the local area.  We host a variety of social functions that include outdoor activities, concerts and other cultural events to introduce some of the many reasons why the Twin Cities is a great place to live.  Follow the links to a variety of information about the Twin Cities.

<h3>Associates</h3>

When lawyers join us, they are assigned to one of our <A HREF="rec_grps.html"> eleven practice groups</A>, within their range of interests.

<P>

New associates participate in an intensive five-month training program in which our attorneys provide practical insight into the practice of law through small group discussions.  The training program includes practice group presentations designed to provide associates with basic practice skills, as well as formal training in areas such as trial advocacy, depositions, and negotiations.  We also provide ongoing training through Continuing Legal Education, interactive computer programs, and a formal mentor program.

<P>

Our associates are soon involved in all aspects of the practice, from client conferences to negotiations and decision-making.  Within their first year, virtually all associates appear in court or participate in closings of business transactions.

<P>

We greatly values our tradition of offering our attorneys both a high quality, challenging legal practice and a high quality of life.  The annual billable hours for associates typically ranges from the mid 1700s to approximately 1800.

<P>

In 1996, we ranked tenth in nation and first in the Twin Cities in associate job satisfaction by the mid-level associates survey conducted by <EM>The American Lawyer</EM>.  We received an overall score of 4.08 (on a scale of 1 to 5).  The survey, measuring the responses of approximately 3,000 associates at large firms across the country, measures overall job satisfaction and a number of other components, including interest of work, partner attitude, training guidance and pro bono commitment.

<P>

Associates are considered for partnership after seven full calendar years of practice.

<P>

<h3>Technology</h3>

We recently underwent a complete computer conversion.  Each attorney has a Pentium powered computer with desktop access to computerized research, the Firms memorandum file, and a variety of other software, including spreadsheet, calendar and document management programs.  We also have a staff of computer specialists to assist our attorneys.<P>

<h3>Pro Bono/Community Involvement
</h3>

In 1995, We met the ABA Pro Bono Challenge by committing more than 3% of our billable hours to pro bono work.  Our attorneys regularly staff the Minnesota Indian Womens Resource Center and The Housing Court--Unlawful Detainer Pro Bono Legal Clinics.

<P>

In the environmental area, our attorneys represent the Sierra Club, Audubon Society, Defenders of Wildlife, and Friends of the Boundary Waters Wilderness.  Every summer, along with the Sierra Club, we sponsor an environmental intern.

<P>

Other pro bono activities include representing death row inmates, the White Earth Land Recovery Project, Minnesota Civil Liberties Union, indigent applicants for political asylum in conjunction with the Minnesota Advocates for Human Rights, and the Minneapolis Economic Development Agency, providing pro bono legal work to minority-owned small businesses.

<P>

Our community involvement is wide-spread and includes legal representation of a number of major nonprofit arts, health care, and educational organizations and foundations.

<P>

Faegre & Benson is a long-time member of the Minnesota Keystone Program.  This program identifies and recognizes Minnesota companies that contribute 2% or more of their pre-tax earnings to address community needs.<P>
<P>

Faegre & Benson is committed to achieving diversity throughout the Firm and providing equal opportunity for women, persons of color, and disabled persons.  The Firms Legal Personnel Committee provides focus and direction to the Firms efforts to create and maintain a diverse workforce.  The Firm has also received a Certificate of Recognition from the City of Minneapolis, recognizing our efforts in this area.

<h3>Current Hiring Needs</h3>

We have completed hiring for our 1997 Summer Program.  We will have 24 summer associates in our Minneapolis office, two in Denver and one in Des Moines.  As in the past, we have filled our needs for new associates in 1997 primarily through our 1996 Summer Program.

 <H3>FORMING CONTRACTS AND LICENSES ON THE INTERNET</H3>


<H3>I.	<A NAME="intro">Introduction and Scope</A></H3>
This material is meant to give a broad overview of several concerns to be addressed when forming contracts and licenses on the Internet.  Select resources that provide in-depth coverage of this subject matter are set forth at the end of these materials.  In addition to providing an overview of contracts and licenses on the Internet, these materials focus on three major themes:  
<OL>
<LI>Ways to address some of the broad concerns of forming and enforcing contracts in an online environment, including a look at how public key encryption can respond to these issues;
<p>

<LI>How does the perennial battle of the forms play out in the electronic data interchange (EDI) environment; and
<P>

<LI>Enforceability of Webwrap agreements.
</OL>

<H3>II.	<A NAME="meeting">Meeting</A> the Goals and Requirement of Contracts</H3>

<STRONG><ol type=A><li><A NAME="perspect">Perspectives.</A></STRONG>  When entering into contracts -- online or otherwise -- as outlined in Section B below, there are a number of factors that come into play. These factors need to be assessed from a variety of perspectives:
<p>

<OL type=1>
<LI><A NAME="practic"><EM>Practical</A> Business Necessities</EM>.  Depending on the type of transaction, you will have a variety of concerns, such as knowing the identity of the person on the other end of the transaction, being confident that a purchase order for custom manufactured parts is accurate, or maintaining confidentiality.
<P>

<LI><A NAME="evident"><EM>Evidentiary</A> Purposes</EM>.  Even if you can satisfy yourself that there has been no misunderstanding as to the identity of the other party or what was ordered, you will need to meet a variety evidentiary burdens should it become necessary to enforce the contract.  Among the issues to consider are the hearsay rules and business records exception, the best evidence rule, and the parole evidence rule.
<P>

<LI><A NAME="legal"><EM>Legal</A> Requirements</EM>.  In order to be enforceable, certain transactions have minimal legal requirements, such as being in writing, being signed, or being notarized.
</OL>
<p>

<STRONG><li><A NAME="factors">Factors</A> to Consider.</STRONG>  Depending on the context of the transaction, some or all of the following factors should be addressed.  Consider the interplay of each factor and the three perspectives:  practical business necessities, evidentiary purposes, and legal requirements.
<p>

<OL>
<LI><A NAME="authent">	<EM>Authenticity</A> and Nonrepudiation</EM>.  Almost always, you want to be assured that the person with whom you believe that you are dealing is in fact that person and that the person cannot back down from the contractual commitment that she makes.  In the non-online world, we often rely on face-to-face encounters with known persons, company letterhead, and signatures to provide for authenticity and nonrepudiation.<p>
<p>

The problems of authenticity and nonrepudiation, while related, are not identical.  In particular, even if you verify authenticity, the other party might be able to repudiate the contract either because of legal requirements (such as requirement of a signature) or evidentiary problems (such as proving that you made a follow-up telephone call to verify the authenticity).
<p>

Depending on the type of online environment in which you operate, electronic forgery might be surprisingly simple to accomplish yet extremely difficult to detect.  For instance, it is relatively easy to send Internet e-mail with a forged return address.
<P>

While authenticity and nonrepudiation are often important goals, in some common online contract situations they are not as important.  For instance, consider the relative importance of authenticity and nonrepudiation in the following scenarios and how they are addressed in non-online environments:
<p>

<ol type=a>
<LI>Distribution of shareware or freeware;
<p>

<LI>Providing access to information;
<p>

<LI>Selling clothing (akin to a mail-order catalog).
</ol>
<P>

<LI><A NAME="integrity"><EM>Information</A> Integrity</EM>.  Even if you have no doubts about the authenticity of the party on the other end of the transaction, you may need to be concerned that the message or contract sent by the other party has not been altered -- either intentional or non-intentionally.  Furthermore, from an evidentiary perspective, how do you show that the document has not been altered since being received by you.
<P>

Depending on the type of contract, information integrity may or may not be an important goal. For instance, consider the relative importance of information integrity in the following scenarios and how information integrity is addressed in non-online environments:
<p>

<OL type=a>
<LI>Fulfilling a large commercial order for custom made parts;
<p>

<LI>Selling clothing (akin to a mail-order catalog).
</OL>
<P>

<LI><A NAME="confident"><EM>Confidentiality</EM>.</A>  Often, the parties want to maintain strict confidentiality regarding the terms of a contract, or even that a contract exists.  In some instances, this might be necessary in order to maintain trade secrets.  In instances where people are releasing personal information or credit card numbers, confidentiality may be necessary to provide both real security as well as psychological comfort.
<P>

<LI><A NAME="enforce"><EM>Enforceable</A> Terms</EM>.  In certain situations, you want to make sure that even if you get paid for providing certain rights or materials, the specific contractual provisions that you wrote into the contract will govern.  Such terms could include restrictions on the scope of a license, warranty limitations, or prohibitions on reverse engineering a product.  In addition, you may be concerned about a battle of the forms situation (refer to Section IV for more details).
</OL>

</ol>
<H3>III.	<A NAME="address">Addressing</A> the Concerns of Forming and Enforcing Contracts in an Online Environment</H3>

<ol type=A>
<STRONG><li><A NAME="trading">Trading</A> Partner Agreements.</STRONG>  One of the best methods of addressing the risks and concerns of online contracts is to enter into detailed trading partner agreements covering a wide range of issues and situations, and providing answers to and resolutions for the issues related to forming and enforcing contracts in an online environment.  For example, the ABA has published a model agreement along with a commentary (see ABAs Model Electronic Data Interchange Trading Partner Agreement, 45 Bus. Law. 1645, June 1990).  Some of the methods addressed below can be incorporated into a trading partner agreement.
<p>

Often, however, a company wishes to engage in electronic commerce with a large number of other parties, both known and unknown, and it is not practical to enter into trading partner agreements.
<p>

<STRONG><li>	<A NAME="acknowledge">Acknowledgments.</A></STRONG>  You can use acknowledgments, whether by e-mail, facsimile, mail or otherwise, to address the risks set forth in the preceding section.  For instance, by acknowledging the details of an order, the likelihood of detecting an unauthorized order or an incorrect order increases.  Depending on whether the parties have entered into a trading partner agreement and other details surrounding the acknowledgment and record keeping of the parties, the acknowledgment may serve as an effective evidentiary tool.
<p>

<STRONG><li>	<A NAME="value">Value</A> Added Networks.</STRONG>  Value Added Networks are private computer networks (as opposed to public networks such as the Internet).  In addition to offering heightened security and error detection, such networks can provide for things such as automatic acknowledgment, prevention of e-mail forgery, and, most importantly from an evidentiary vantage point, a neutral third party who can keep a copy of all communications along with records offering verification of who composed and read any document and the time and date thereof.
<p>

<STRONG><li>	<A NAME="standard encr">Standard</A> Encryption.</STRONG>  Standard encryption techniques rely on using a single key for both encoding and decoding messages.  In addition to providing for confidentiality, many encryption techniques also provide for information integrity because the encoded message will not be able to be decoded if any changes have been made.
<p>

Standard encryption, however, does not adequately meet many of the challenges posed by online contracts.  For standard encryption to work, both parties must possess the same key, which requires that the parties exchange this key information in a secure manner.  Once this is done, the business goals of authenticity and information integrity can be met.  The evidentiary burdens and Nonrepudiation aspects, however,  still remain as problems.  Because each party has the same key, if you were to present an encoded message as evidence, to prove the other party sent a particular message, you will face the burden of proving that it was not you -- the other party with the key -- who created the message.
<p>

<STRONG><li>	<A NAME="public encr">Public</A> Key Encryption.</STRONG>  Public key encryption is a relatively new technology that meets many, but not all, of the challenges of online contracts.
<p>

<OL>
<LI><A NAME="understand"><EM>Understanding</A> the Technology</EM>.  Public key encryption uses two keys for each message: a secret private key and a shared public key.  These two keys are related to each other, but the private key cannot be readily ascertained from the public key.  <p>

This technique is normally implemented by using very large prime numbers.  The multiple of two very large prime numbers is an extremely large number having only two factors, and, if this number is large enough, it would take even the most powerful computers years to figure out the two factors of this extremely large number.  The multiple of the two prime numbers is the public key.
<p>

The public key encryption scheme works in two directions, one for authenticity and the other for confidentiality.  As in other encryption schemes, it can further provide for information integrity and time/date stamping of when a message was composed.  
<p>

<LI><A NAME="encr authent"><EM>Authenticity</EM></A>.  To use public key encryption for authenticity purposes, the message is encoded with the senders private key.  Anyone possessing the public key (and who also knows the encryption algorithm) can decode the message.  Furthermore, if the message can be decoded using a certain public key, the public key encryption technology assures that it was encoded using the related private key.
<p>

Using public key encryption in this manner is a way of implementing digital signatures.  Several states have enacted specific statutes addressing digital signature, the first of which was Utah (see Section VII at the end of these materials).
<p>

If the parties exchange public keys, then a party receiving a message will be able to verify that the message in fact originated with a person holding the associated private key and that the information has not been altered.  Furthermore, even without a digital signature statute, the evidentiary burdens of proving the authenticity and information integrity of the message will often be easy, with the greatest challenge being showing that the public key in fact belonged to the other party.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="sharing key"><EM>Sharing</A> Your Public Key</EM>.  Because the message can be read by anyone knowing your public key, it will be confidential only if your public key is confidential.  Therefore, if you are willing to have a separate pair of public keys / private keys for each trading partner, using public key encryption in this manner will provide for confidentiality as well as authenticity and information integrity.
<p>

Often, however, you will want to have a single public key that is known to all actual and potential trading partners.  By doing so, any recipient of a message sent using your private key will be able to read it, know that it was sent by you, and be assured of the information integrity (much like a signed letter using traditional mail).  The challenge then becomes how do you publish your public key, and how do you provide for others being able to rely on knowing that they in fact have your correct and legitimate public key?
<p>

The simplest solution would be to personally give everyone your public key.  So that they can rely on this information, this would likely need to be done via a signed document.  The legitimacy and accuracy of a partys public key presumably could also be shown in many cases by an ongoing course of conduct in which a certain public key did in fact work for previous legitimate messages.

<LI><A NAME="certific"><EM>Certification</A> Authorities</EM>.  Giving your public key on an individual basis may not be practical (although a form letter to all of a companys vendors might still be practical).  The response that has developed is certification authorities.  A certification authority is an organization which keeps lists of others public keys.  Certification authorities generally enter into contracts with both the parties being listed and the users requesting verification of others public keys.  These contracts normally contain limitations surrounding the liability of the certification authority with respect to reliance on the certification authority for the authenticity of both the parties holding those keys and the accuracy of the keys themselves.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="encr confid"><EM>Confidentiality</EM></A>.  By running the public key encryption algorithm in the reverse order, you can insure that a message sent to you will be readable only by you.  To do this, a message is encoded using the recipients public key.  This message can be decoded only by someone possessing the related private key, namely you.  Therefore, anyone having your public key can send you a confidential message.  Using public key encryption technology in this manner can also provide for information integrity, namely if the message can be decoded, then it was not garbled.  However, because the message was encoded using a public key, the technology will not provide for any authenticity of the sender.
<p>

<LI><A NAME="encr achiev"><EM>Achieving</A> both Authenticity and Confidentiality</EM>.  By first encoding a message using the senders private key, and then encoding the encoded message a second time using another method which provides for confidentiality (such as a standard encryption technique or using the recipients public key), you can achieve both authenticity and confidentiality.
<p>

<li><A NAME="encr problems"><EM>Problems</A> with Public Key Encryption</EM>.  Depending on the computer environment, encryption can be difficult to use.  Until EDI, e-mail and web browsers have standard and compatible encryption functions integrated into the system, users will often resist cumbersome steps required to encode and decode messages.
<p>

A further potential problem is that while handwritten forgery is often discernible using handwriting experts, digital signature forgery might not be detectable.  Anyone knowing the unique combination of the private key can enter a perfect forgery.  The recipient obviously wants to and feels it should be able to rely on the authenticity and Nonrepudiation of a digital signature.  Therefore, the stakes are high if someone obtains a copy of your private key.
<p>

This problem is heightened because keys are very long (hundreds of digits), and therefore to prevent typing mistakes, the keys are often stored on the senders computer. Security can easily break down if the computer on which the private key is stored is not in a secure environment.  Even if the computer is password protected, how many people either leave their computers turned on after having logged in, or have their passwords written on a piece of paper taped to their computer monitors?  Finally, consider the fact the computer systems connected to the Internet can be broken into and information such as keys accessed.

<H3>IV.	<A NAME="edi">EDI</A> and the Battle of the Forms</H3>

<ol type=A>
<STRONG><li></STRONG>	Outside of the online and EDI world, sellers of goods have developed standard contractual terms and conditions (the Sellers Terms) that are printed on the backs of its forms of purchase order, invoice and customer acceptance.  The seller wants the Sellers Terms to apply to transactions initiated using EDI.  To reduce risk and uncertainty as to whose terms apply, the parties can negotiate and enter into a written trading partner agreement governing the terms and conditions of all goods sold from one to another.  The reality, however, is that companies commonly do not enter into such agreements for a variety of reasons, including resources which would have to be devoted to entering into and keeping track of such agreements, or for fear of turning off customers.  The result is the battle of the forms, which is generally governed by UCC  2-207.
<P>

<STRONG><li></STRONG>	In non-EDI and non-online transactions, which still may make up the majority of all a particular sellers transactions, the courts generally give the advantage to the party that offers to enter into a contract (the offeror), as distinguished from the party that accepts the offer (the offeree).  Thus, the sellers forms all characterize the seller as the offeror, and state that the offeree is free to accept only on the Sellers Terms.  This is the drafting technique favored by most commercial lawyers, but it is not clear that a court would treat the seller as the offeror and accept the Sellers Terms, particularly where the first document bearing on the transaction is a purchase order received by the seller which states that it is an offer to buy only on the purchasers terms.  This is the classic battle of the forms problem.
<p>

<STRONG><li></STRONG>	As there are not yet special laws governing general contract formation by EDI, it would appear appropriate to use the same contracting techniques in the EDI environment, i.e., to characterize the seller as the offeror in every case, and state that the offer may be accepted only on the Sellers Terms.
<p>

<STRONG><li></STRONG>	In the EDI environment, each sale transaction will begin with the sellers receipt of an EDI message, an electronic purchase order.  Nevertheless, consider the following steps:
<p> 
<OL type=1>
<LI>printed terms and conditions be mailed periodically to all EDI customers (see below);
<p>

<LI>the note field of the sellers standard return EDI message be drafted so as to characterize the prospective purchasers EDI message as a mere request for a quotation and the sellers return EDI message as an offer to sell. 
</OL>
<P>

Then, if a court accepts the Sellers characterization of the EDI messages and there is no further communication between the parties, the Sellers Terms will prevail.  The note field should read substantially as follows:

<blockquote>
XYZ appreciates your recent request for quotation and offers to sell the specified product on the terms and conditions in this message, as supplemented by XYZs most recent printed terms and conditions.  XYZ objects in advance to any contrary terms and conditions specified in your request for a quotation or elsewhere.
</blockquote>

<STRONG><li></STRONG>	There is no way to be sure that the Sellers Terms will be given effect, short of entering into a contract actually signed by both the seller and its customer.  In fact, knowledgeable purchasers that specify their own terms and conditions probably stand a better chance of prevailing, since their initial EDI messages have more of the characteristics of offers than of mere requests for quotes.  As a result, certain important provisions of the Sellers Terms -- such as limitations on warranties -- may not be given effect.  Other terms, however, stand a better chance of being accepted.  For example, provisions like those in the Specifications, Delivery and Changes paragraphs of the sellers current invoice form will probably be given effect unless contradicted in the purchasers own terms and conditions.
<p>

<STRONG><li></STRONG>	If the EDI protocols themselves provide terms that apply whenever EDI messages are used to form a contract, it is highly unlikely that a sellers attempts to impose the Sellers Terms would be given effect.
<p>

<STRONG><li></STRONG>	Sample provisions of document sent from seller to customers setting forth the terms and conditions of sales:
<p>

<OL type=1>
<LI><STRONG>OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE.</STRONG>  XYZ (Seller) sells goods only on these Terms and Conditions.  Any communication intended to initiate a purchase of goods from Seller, whether in writing, by telephone, by electronic data interchange (EDI), online services, electronic mail, the Internet, or by any other means, shall be treated as a request to Seller to quote its price for the quantity and types of goods described, and Sellers response, however communicated, shall be Sellers offer to sell such goods or services at the price quoted, subject to these Terms and Conditions.  Seller hereby objects to any terms or conditions, whenever or however communicated, which are in addition to or different from these Terms and Conditions, except such as may be agreed to in a writing executed by Seller.
<P>

<LI><STRONG>TRADING PARTNER AGREEMENT.</STRONG>  By initiating any purchase of goods from Seller via EDI, Buyer shall be deemed to have confirmed that these Terms and Conditions constitute an EDI trading partner agreement between the Seller and Buyer.
</OL>
</ol>
<H3>V.	<A NAME="Webwrap">Webwrap</A> Agreements</H3>
<ol type=A>
<STRONG><li>	<A NAME="background">Background.</A></STRONG>  Mass software packages have traditionally been distributed through retail stores.  In order to limit the rights that the purchaser obtained, and to limit the liability of the publisher, such software packages generally are licensed rather than sold.  The license terms are commonly placed inside the box containing the software.  Such licenses have become known as shrinkwrap licenses.
<P>

As the distribution channels for mass software has expanded to the World Wide Web, Webwrap licenses are likely to become more and more common.  Moreover, as applications written in languages such as Java become mainstream, they too are likely to be distributed under Webwrap licenses.
<P>

Many commentators and practitioners have questioned the enforceability of shrinkwrap licenses, but market pressures have led software publishers by and large to continue distributing software under these shrinkwrap licenses.  Surprisingly, there have been only a handful of cases dealing with the enforceability of shrinkwrap licenses.
<p>

<STRONG><li>	<A NAME="procd"><EM>The</A> ProCD Case.</EM></STRONG>  

<OL>
<LI><EM>Background.</EM>  The most recent case on the subject involved ProCD, Inc., a company that distributed a CD-ROM software package having a national directory of telephone numbers.  The software box mentioned in small print that it contained a license agreement, but it did not detail the specific terms of the license.  
<P>

<LI><EM>The license agreement.</EM>  The license agreement, which was packaged inside the box, included the following clause; 
<p>

<blockquote>
You will not make the Software or the Listings in whole or in part available to any other user in any networked or time-shared environment, or transfer the Listings in whole or in part to any computer other than the computer used to access the Listings.
</blockquote>

<LI><EM>What the defendant did.</EM>  Believing that telephone directory information was not protectable by copyright law under Feist<super><font size=-2><A HREF="#footnote1">1</A></font></super> and that the shrinkwrap agreement was unenforceable, a graduate student named Zeidenberg purchased a copy of the software, extracted the telephone listings, and published the listings on the World Wide Web. Zeidenberg was careful to design the Web site so that Internet users, when visiting the Web site, would not use ProCDs search-engine software.
<P>

<LI><EM>District court decision: copyright issues.</EM>  ProCD filed suit in federal court in the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The district court held<FONT  SIZE=-2><SUPER><A HREF="#footnote2">2</A></SUPER></FONT> that under Feist, the telephone listings themselves were not protectable under copyright law.  The court further held that Zeidenbergs use of ProCDs software package to extract the telephone listings did not constitute copyright infringement. 
<p>

<blockquote>
Although plaintiffs software is protected by copyright law, its compiled data are not.  Because defendants used the software only to download and access the data and did not further distribute this copyrightable information, their actions are protected by  117 [of the Copyright Act].<FONT  SIZE=-2><SUPER><A HREF="#footnote3">3</A></SUPER></FONT> 
</blockquote>
<P>

<LI><EM>District court decision: shrinkwrap issues.</EM>  The district court then analyzed whether the terms of the shrinkwrap license were enforceable and concluded that they were not:
<P>

<blockquote>
The terms of the Select Phone<sup><font="-2">TM</font></sup> user agreement were not presented to defendants at the time of sale.  The sole reference to the user agreement was a disclosure in small print at the bottom of the package, stating that defendants were subject to the terms and conditions of the enclosed license agreement.  Defendants did not receive the opportunity to inspect or consider those terms.  Mere reference to the terms at the time of initial contract formation does not present buyers an adequate opportunity to decide whether they are acceptable.  They must be able to read and consider the terms in their entirety.  The potential incorporation of the terms can occur only after the purchaser opens the package and has a reasonable opportunity to inspect the user agreement.  Sections 2-207 or 2-209 [of the UCC] control that incorporation.<FONT  SIZE=-2><SUPER><A HREF="#footnote4">4</A></SUPER></FONT> 
</blockquote>
<P>

<LI><EM>Seventh Circuit decision: shrinkwrap issues.</EM>  On appeal, the Seventh Circuit held that the terms of the shrinkwrap license were enforceable:<FONT  SIZE=-2><SUPER><A HREF="#footnote5">5</A></SUPER></FONT> 
<P>

<blockquote>
Zeidenberg does argue, and the district court held, that placing the package of software on the shelf is an offer, which the customer accepts by paying the asking price and leaving the store with the goods. ... In Wisconsin, as elsewhere, a contract includes only the terms on which the parties have agreed. One cannot agree to hidden terms, the judge concluded. So far, so good-- but one of the terms to which Zeidenberg agreed by purchasing the software is that the transaction was subject to a license. Zeidenbergs position therefore must be that the printed terms on the outside of a box are the parties contract--except for printed terms that refer to or incorporate other terms. But why would Wisconsin fetter the parties choice in this way? Vendors can put the entire terms of a contract on the outside of a box only by using microscopic type, removing other information that buyers might find more useful (such as what the software does, and on which computers it works), or both. The Read Me file included with most software, describing system requirements and potential incompatibilities, may be equivalent to ten pages of type; warranties and license restrictions take still more space. Notice on the outside, terms on the inside, and a right to return the software for a refund if the terms are unacceptable (a right that the license expressly extends), may be a means of doing business valuable to buyers and sellers alike. ... Doubtless a state could forbid the use of standard contracts in the software business, but we do not think that Wisconsin has done so.
<p>

Transactions in which the exchange of money precedes the communication of detailed terms are common. Consider the purchase of insurance. The buyer goes to an agent, who explains the essentials (amount of coverage, number of years) and remits the premium to the home office, which sends back a policy. On the district judges understanding, the terms of the policy are irrelevant because the insured paid before receiving them. ...
<P>

Consumer goods work the same way. Someone who wants to buy a radio set visits a store, pays, and walks out with a box. Inside the box is a leaflet containing some terms, the most important of which usually is the warranty, read for the first time in the comfort of home. By Zeidenbergs lights, the warranty in the box is irrelevant; every consumer gets the standard warranty implied by the UCC in the event the contract is silent; yet so far as we are aware no state disregards warranties furnished with consumer products. ...
<P>

Next consider the software industry itself. Only a minority of sales take place over the counter, where there are boxes to peruse. A customer may place an order by phone in response to a line item in a catalog or a review in a magazine. Much software is ordered over the Internet by purchasers who have never seen a box. Increasingly software arrives by wire. There is no box; there is only a stream of electrons, a collection of information that includes data, an application program, instructions, many limitations (MegaPixel 3.14159 cannot be used with BytePusher 2.718), and the terms of sale. ...
<P>

What then does the current version of the UCC have to say? We think that the place to start is sec. 2-204(1): A contract for sale of goods may be made in any manner sufficient to show agreement, including conduct by both parties which recognizes the existence of such a contract. A vendor, as master of the offer, may invite acceptance by conduct, and may propose limitations on the kind of conduct that constitutes acceptance. A buyer may accept by performing the acts the vendor proposes to treat as acceptance. And that is what happened. ProCD proposed a contract that a buyer would accept by using the software after having an opportunity to read the license at leisure. This Zeidenberg did. He had no choice, because the software splashed the license on the screen and would not let him proceed without indicating acceptance. So although the district judge was right to say that a contract can be, and often is, formed simply by paying the price and walking out of the store, the UCC permits contracts to be formed in other ways. ProCD proposed such a different way, and without protest Zeidenberg agreed. Ours is not a case in which a consumer opens a package to find an insert saying you owe us an extra $10,000 and the seller files suit to collect. Any buyer finding such a demand can prevent formation of the contract by returning the package, as can any consumer who concludes that the terms of the license make the software worth less than the purchase price. Nothing in the UCC requires a seller to maximize the buyers net gains.
<P>

Section 2-606, which defines acceptance of goods, reinforces this understanding. A buyer accepts goods under sec. 2-606(1)(b) when, after an opportunity to inspect, he fails to make an effective rejection under sec. 2-602(1). ProCD extended an opportunity to reject if a buyer should find the license terms unsatisfactory; Zeidenberg inspected the package, tried out the software, learned of the license, and did not reject the goods. We refer to sec. 2-606 only to show that the opportunity to return goods can be important; acceptance of an offer differs from acceptance of goods after delivery, ... but the UCC consistently permits the parties to structure their relations so that the buyer has a chance to make a final decision after a detailed review.
<P>

Some portions of the UCC impose additional requirements on the way parties agree on terms. A disclaimer of the implied warranty of merchantability must be conspicuous. UCC sec. 2-316(2), incorporating UCC sec. 1-201(10). Promises to make firm offers, or to negate oral modifications, must be separately signed. UCC secs. 2-205, 2-209(2). These special provisos reinforce the impression that, so far as the UCC is concerned, other terms may be as inconspicuous as the forum-selection clause on the back of the cruise ship ticket in Carnival Lines. Zeidenberg has not located any Wisconsin case--for that matter, any case in any state--holding that under the UCC the ordinary terms found in shrinkwrap licenses require any special prominence, or otherwise are to be undercut rather than enforced. ...

<STRONG><li>	<A NAME="implic">Implications.</STRONG></A>  If all circuits were to follow the Seventh Circuits analysis in ProCD, then licensors have little to fear.  Due to the lack of precedent in this area, it is far from clear how other courts will rule in similar circumstances.  Therefore, at the very least, the lesson from ProCD is that when distributing software pursuant to a shrinkwrap license, the most important terms, if not the entire agreement, need to be available prior to the completion of the transaction.  While placing a license agreement on the outside of a software box may be undesirable from a packaging and marketing perspective, distribution over the Web can overcome some of the resistance to showing the license prior to the purchase of  the software.

<li>Internet as a Source of Information.

<ol type=A>
<li>The Internet contains an ever-increasing amount of information.  Set forth at the end of this outline is a list of some sites on the World Wide Web with useful legal related information.  All of these sites can be easily accessed with hypertext links from <EM>www.faegre.com</EM>.
</ol>
<p>

<li>E-Mail with Clients.

<ol type=A>
<li>Some of the Benefits of E-Mail.

<ol type=1>
<li>Fast communication:  no phone tag, faster than facsimiles.
<li>Electronic document transfer:  allows the recipient to directly enter changes to the document.
<li>Remote access:  attorneys can access e-mail from out of the office.
<li>Direct communications:  e-mail is sent directly to the computer on the recipients desk, rather than common fax location, allowing better secrecy.
<li>Group lists:  multiple recipients can be addressed at once, without risk of forgetting one of the intended parties.
</ol> 
<p>

<li>Attorney-Client Privilege.

<ol type=1>
<li>Courts have found that e-mail can be subject to attorney-client privilege.
<li>E-mail in an internal system has been held by Massachusetts Superior Court to be privileged and protected from discovery.

<ol type=a>
<li><EM>National Employment Ins. Corp. v. Liberty Mutual Ins. Co.</EM>, No. 93-2528-G (Mass. Sup. Ct. Dec. 21, 1994) (Lawyers Weekly No. 12-420-94).
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
 
<li>E-Mail Security, or "How to Lose Attorney-Client Privilege".

<ol type=1>
<li>E-mail over the Internet.

<ol type=a>
<li>The Internet allows most e-mail systems in country to pass e-mail to each other.
<li>However, the Internet is not a secure network.  The Internet is a group of computers linked together.  An e-mail message sent over the Internet may physically move through many computers before reaching its destination.  Messages can be intercepted at many points along this path.
</ol>

<li>Most e-mail is sent without encryption.
<li>However, the attorney-client privilege can be lost without encryption.

<ol type=a>
<li>Attorney-client privilege:  four requirements.

<ol type=1>
<li>Attorney giving legal advice;
<li>Is made with expectation of confidentiality;
<li>Is not in furtherance of a future crime or tort; and
<li>Client has not waived privilege.
</ol>

<li>The expectation of confidentiality or privacy may not exist on e-mail transmissions over the Internet.  As a result, the attorney-client privilege may be lost.
<li>Why?--Compare to cellular phone calls:

<ol type=1>
<li>Cellular phone calls, like un-encrypted e-mail messages, can be easily "tapped."  These phone calls are essentially radio broadcasts that anyone with appropriate, inexpensive equipment can intercept and listen to.  Although it is a crime to intercept cellular phone calls, insurers and ethics committees are warning attorneys about the risk of losing attorney-client privilege through the use of cellular phones.
<li>ALAS:

<ol type=a>
<li>"Given the current legal environment in which lawyers are being sued for just about everything, it is probably only a matter of time before some client will sue a lawyer for allowing client information to fall into the wrong hands, or for causing the attorney-client privilege to be waived, through the lawyers alleged careless use of a portable phone."
<li>We believe that lawyers may ethically communicate with or about clients on the Internet without encryption.  We also believe that an unauthorized interception of such a communication should not trigger a waiver of the attorney/client privilege.  As stated earlier, ALAS extensive claims experience does not suggest that such an intentional (and criminal) interception would trigger lawyer liability. We advise great caution, however.  There are no cases, and the technology is evolving at lightning speed.  Even today, because of the looseness of the rhetoric, courts and ethics committees will be tempted to bypass a careful analysis and simply hold that unencrypted Internet messages either violate ethics rules on confidentiality or waive the privilege.  You must advise clients of this risk.  Such a court ruling, however inappropriate, could lead to malpractice liability.
</ol>

<li>California enacted legislation that attorney-client communications do not lose their privileged character because they were conducted over a portable phone.  However, the client would still lose the secrets themselves.
</ol>
</ol>


<li>It is possible and easy to encrypt an e-mail message.

<ol type=a>
<li>Encryption is best done on a file by file basis.

<ol type=1>
<li>This requires creating a separate document, encrypting that document, and then e-mailing the encrypted document as an attachment to the e-mail message.
</ol>

<li>Private Key Encryption.

<ol type=1>
<li>A single password is responsible for both encryption and decryption.
<li>Problem:  it is difficult to safely communicate the password to the message recipient.
</ol>

<li>Public Key Encryption:  Patented RSA technology.

<ol type=1>
<li>One private key, one public key.
<li>Uses:

<ol type=a>
<li>Assurance of authenticity. 

<ol type=i>
<li>Use private key for encryption.
<li>Use public key of sender for decryption.
</ol>

<li>Privacy.

<ol type=i>
<li>Use public key of recipient to encrypt.
<li>Use private key to decrypt.
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>

<li>PGP (export restrictions).

<ol type=1>
<li>Public key encryption.
<li>Author was investigated for export control violations and patent infringement.
</ol>

<li>Viacrypt PGP.

<ol type=1>
<li>Commercial, licensed version of PGP.
<li>Not exported, licensed under patent.
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>

<li>Unauthorized Practice of Law.

<ol type=A>
<li>Generalizations.

<ol type=1>
<li>Almost all states prohibit the unauthorized practice of law through legislation and/or local bar associations.  
<li>The definition of "unauthorized practice of law" within a particular state is clearly decided on the basis of that states law.  At one time, the rules were uniform across the states.  Now, however, the rules vary greatly from state to state.
<li>Punishment for the unauthorized practice of law can vary from a misdemeanor to contempt of court.
</ol>
<p>
 
<li>Minnesota law.

<ol type=1>
<li>Minnesota Rules of Professional Conduct Rule 5.5.

<ol type=a>
<li>"A lawyer shall not (a) practice law in a jurisdiction where doing so violates the regulations of the legal profession in that jurisdiction; or (b) assist a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law."
</ol>

<li>Minnesota Statutes Annotated 431.02

<ol type=a>
<li>"It shall be unlawful for any person..., except members of the bar of Minnesota admitted and licensed to practice as attorneys at law, ... to hold out as competent or qualified to give legal advice or counsel, or to prepare legal documents...."
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
 
<li>Rarely is it clear when unauthorized practice occurs in the case of a licensed attorney in one state representing a client in a second state.
<p>
 
<li>Scenario:

<ol type=1>
<li>An attorney in Minnesota uses the Internet to develop a lasting attorney-client relationship with Massachusetts client.  The attorney is not licensed in Massachusetts.  In representing that client, the attorney furnishes legal advice, drafts documents, and gives legal advice with respect to both state and federal law.
<li>This scenario is similar to a situation where the Internet is not involved, except that this situation is much more likely to occur if clients are developed over the Internet.
</ol>
<p>
 
<li>Question:  Does this constitute unauthorized practice of law in the state of Massachusetts?

<ol type=1>
<li>A similar question (in connection with non-resident in-house attorneys working for a local corporation) was asked of the chief justices of all 50 states by the author of a Winter 1994 Marquette Law Review Article (77 Marq. L. Rev. 307).
<li>Answer:  Legal Counsel to Attorney General from Massachussetts answered:

<ol type=a>
<li>"In my judgment, the foreign lawyer in the hypothetical would be found by a Massachusetts court to have violated [Massachusetts law] because, on a long-term basis, he furnishes legal advice, drafts documents, and interprets the law for his clients in Massachusetts.  All of these acts likely would fall within the Massachusetts courts interpretation of the practice of law."
</ol>

<li>Similar answers (which stated that the attorney would be engaged in the unauthorized practice of law) were received from authorities in Georgia, West Virginia, Illinois, Tennessee, Oklahoma.
</ol>
<p>

<li>Conclusion.

<ol type=1>
<li>The attorney always should inform his or her out-of-state clients that the attorney is not authorized to practice law in their state.
<li>Activities that are occasional and temporary are unlikely to be considered the unauthorized practice of law.
<li>Attorneys are better off if they communicate into a state than if they travel to that state, but this is not a universal rule.
<li>Attorneys also are safer if they are practicing federal law:  patent, copyright, bankruptcy, admiralty, etc.
<li>Rules are rarely enforced against out of state attorneys.  This issue usually arises when an attorney is trying to collect fees from an out-of-state client.
<li>New Jersey courts have used the following four factors to help guide the determination of what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law (<EM>Appell v. Reiner</EM>, 195 A.2d 310, 315 (N.J. 1963).

<ol type=a>
<li>Are services rendered in New Jersey (including by phone or letter) (and presumably Internet/e-mail)?
<li>Were services and legal advice rendered based upon the laws of New Jersey?
<li>Did legal services relate to transaction or property situated in New Jersey?
<li>If litigation results, would forum be New Jersey courts?
</ol>

<li>The law of the jurisdiction in question must be researched in order to decide if a particular activity constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.
</ol>
</ol>
<p>

<li>Advertising on the Internet.

<ol type=A>
<li>Methods.

<ol type=1>
<li>World Wide Web sites.
<li>Usenet postings.
<li>E-mail to clients and Potential Clients.
</ol>
<p>
 
<li>Most Famous Example:  Canter and Siegel (Usenet postings).

<ol type=1>
<li>Laurence Canter and Martha Siegel were Arizona attorneys who wanted to use the Internet to advertise their law practice.  They decided that they would post messages to Usenet newsgroups stating that the immigration service was holding a lottery for "green cards" and that their firm would assist in filling out lottery forms for a $100 fee. 
<li>What is the Usenet?

<ol type=a>
<li>Discussion groups which allow users from all over the world to post messages and to read messages that others have posted.
<li>The Usenet contains literally thousands of different topics, ranging from cats (<EM>rec.pets.cats</EM>) to Laotian society (<EM>soc.culture.laos</EM>) to computer law (<EM>misc.legal.computing</EM>).
<li>c. When posting to a Usenet newsgroup, very clear etiquette must be followed.  This etiquette is sometimes referred to as "Netiquette."
</ol>

<li>3. What did Canter and Siegel do wrong?

<ol type=a>
<li>They sent Usenet posting to 6,000 newsgroups regardless of topic.  So readers of "<EM>rec.pets.cats</EM>" would end up reading their post regarding the green card lottery.  People in such groups only want to read relevant postings and were not happy with these off-topic postings.
<li>In addition, they sent separate copies of their messages to each newsgroup rather than "cross-posting."  This is called "spamming" and is universally disliked by the Usenet users since it requires the computers the support the Usenet groups to contain thousands of copies of the exact same posting.  The articles could have been cross-posted, requiring that only one copy of the posting be made.  
<li>Finally, the mere fact that they sent a pure advertisement to the Usenet newsgroups made people angry.  Many on the Usenet still view advertisement as inappropriate use of Internet resources.
</ol>

<li>What happened to them?

<ol type=a>
<li>Numerous Internet users were very upset.  
<li>They received hate mail, hate faxes and hate e-mail.
<li>Their Usenet provider received so many negative e-mail responses that its server failed to operate ("crashed").
<li>Their Internet accounts were cancelled.
<li>Ethical complaints were made about their actions.
<li>On the other hand, they found over 1,000 paying clients and they received a tremendous amount of publicity (although most of it was negative).
<li>In large part because of this posting, neither Canter nor Siegel are currently practicing law.  However, they are now best selling authors of "How to make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway" and are operating an Internet advertising business named Cybersell.  They have reportedly agreed with their new Internet provider to restrain from posting off-topic ads to Usenet groups.
</ol>

<li>How to participate in Usenet newsgroups:

<ol type=a>
<li>Search for and subscribe to groups relevant to what you do.
<li>Watch what happens for a while.  Get a feel for the proper etiquette for the group.
<li>Answer questions posed by users in the groups.  Your answer may be seen by thousands of people in that newsgroup.  In your answer, you may state your name and how you can be reached (phone number, e-mail, Web site).
</ol>
</ol>
<p>
 
<li>World Wide Web.

<ol type=1>
<li>In November 1994, only five law firms were known to be on the Internet.  By January, there were 20.  By March, 1995, there were 50.  By August, 1995, estimated between 500 and 1,000.
<li>Most Internet users find Web sites advertising a law firm to be acceptable, since only interested users will see that information.
</ol>
<p>
 
<li>Ethical Considerations.

<ol type=1>
<li>Web sites and Usenet postings are accessible to Internet users in all 50 states and internationally.
<li>Since every state has different rules regarding attorney advertisements, it is unclear if (a) a Web site has to comply with every states rules (a dubious task indeed), or (b) it has to comply only with the rules of the state where the host server for the page is located, or (c) it has to comply only with the rules of the state where the attorney or firm is located.
<li>How do you deal with the dynamic nature of Web sites?
<li>Most Web sites include multiple screens having information about the attorney or firm along with legal developments and links to other legal related Web sites. It is unclear if the advertising content of screens that are arguably not advertising (<EM>i.e.</EM>, screens discussing recent legal developments or cases) must comply with advertising regulations.
<li>Furthermore, in states that require attorney ads to be submitted to the state bar for approval, it is unclear if all screens must be approved.
<li><STRONG>Model Rules</STRONG>

<ol type=a>
<li>The Model Rules of Professional Conduct published by the American Bar Association sets out a comprehensive list of rules regarding attorney advertising.  Generally, under the Model Rules:

<ol type=i>
<li>attorneys are forbidden from making false or misleading communications in advertisements (Rule 7.1, comment 1);
<li>attorneys must keep a copy of all advertisements for at least two years, cannot compensate others for recommending them, and must indicate in all advertising the name of the attorney responsible for the ads content (Rule 7.2);
<li>attorneys must label all advertisements sent directly to a prospective client as "Advertising Materials" (Rule 7.3);
</ol>

<li>The Model Rules thus set forth standards regarding the content of Web sites, but do not address the multi-jurisdictional problem set forth above.  Since the Rules are the basis for many individual states rules, however, these provide a starting point in the effort to make attorneys Web sites comply with as many states rules as possible.
</ol>

<li><STRONG>Minnesota Rules</STRONG>

<ol type=a>
<li>The Minnesota Rules of Professional Conduct are very similar to the Model Rules set forth above.  They do not expressly mention electronic or on-line advertisements, but Rule 7.2(a) generally allows ads through public media, presumably including the Internet.  
<li>Commentary to the Minnesota Rules indicates that prior review of attorney advertising is not required before dissemination, and thus the dynamic nature of a Web site does not create any specific problems beyond meeting the general content requirements.  
<li>Minnesota firms should be cognizant of the fact, however, that should they choose to list the attorneys in the firm on their Web sites, Rule 7.5 regarding firm names and letterheads may, by analogy, require them to list the jurisdictions in which individual attorneys are licensed to practice.
</ol>

<li>Two states have issued statements and guidelines on the use the Internet for advertising, Floida and Texas.
<li><STRONG>Florida Approach</STRONG>

<ol type=a>
<li>On January 1, 1996, the Florida state bar published an advisory statement regarding Internet advertising.<FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER><A HREF="#footnote1">1</A></SUPER></FONT>  The Florida Bar Standing Committee on Advertising advised that "computer ads" such as "law firm web sites or Web sites" on the Internet are a form of lawyer advertising, and as such, are subject to the Florida Rules of Professional Conduct regarding advertisements.  
<li>While the Committee stated that these electronic ads do <EM>not</EM> have to include Floridas standard "hiring disclosure" language of Rule 4-7.2(d), <A HREF="#footnote2"><FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER>2</SUPER></FONT></A> they must be submitted to and approved by the Committee prior to dissemination under Rule 4-7.5.  It is this provision that has caused great concern for attorneys due to the constantly changing nature of their Web sites and the $50 fee for each submission.  
<li>The Committee ended its report by stating it was only an "initial step" in this unsettled area, and thus, changes in this reporting requirement may be forthcoming.
</ol>

<li><STRONG>Texas Approach</STRONG>

<ol type=a>
<li>One week after the Florida bar published its guidelines, Texas published guidelines regarding advertising on the Internet.  The State Bar of Texas Advertising Review Committee, similar to Florida, maintains the Texas Rules of Professional Conduct requirement of submitting ads to the Committee for review under Rule 7.07(d).
<li>Unlike Florida, the Texas Committee only requires attorneys to submit the first screen of a Web site, including its location, along with subsequent pages which are <EM>primarily</EM> concerned with soliciting clients.  Information beyond the first page that is not primarily concerned with solicitation of clients is not subject to review, and the Committee stated the following information is thus exempted: newsletters, news articles, legal articles, editorial opinions, illustrations, questionnaires, survey forms, announcements of office openings or relocations, requests for information from the public, e-mail and e-mail response forms, attorney biographical information, announcements of personnel changes, attorney and support staff recruiting, job openings, legal developments and events, announcements of seminars and events, links to other Internet sites, and entertainment devices.
</ol>

<li>Web sites generally are unobtrusive and would not subject a potential client to undue influence.  As a result, Web sites that contain no misstatements are unlikely to violate ethics provisions which conform to first amendment standards.
<li>As to Usenet postings, even Canter and Siegel have not been subject to a disciplinary hearing.  However, it is likely that states could control time, place and manner of Usenet postings, such as by limiting off-topic postings.
<li>E-mail solicitation is similar to solicitation through normal U.S. mails, and is likely governed by the same ethical limits.  In fact, more restrictive limits may be required given the immediacy of e-mail transmissions.

<h2>TRADEMARKS AND THE INTERNET</h2>

<ol type=I>
<li>Domain Names
<p>

<ol type=A>
<li><A NAME="background">Background</A>
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>Over the past two years, more and more companies have begun to realize the value of obtaining a domain name on the Internet.  These domain names usually take the form of company-name.com, such as faegre.com, and serve to give a company an instantly recognizable address on the Internet.  World Wide Web sites generally are set up on a particular node on a domain name registered to a company and are given names related to the domain name, such as www.faegre.com.  Much like novelty telephone numbers, domain names are assigned on a first-come-first-serve basis by a non-profit organization called InterNIC. 
<p>

<li>As the value of domain names increases, it is only natural that disputes would develop over who has the right to control which names.  Famous domain name disputes in the past included Adam Currys attempt to hold onto <EM>mtv.com</EM>, Princeton Review surprising its major competitor Stanley Kaplan by reserving the domain name <EM>kaplan.com</EM>, McDonalds learning that it would have to pay a "ransom" to the party who had registered <EM>mcdonalds.com</EM>, and superstore retailer Frys Electronics discovering that <EM>frys.com</EM> had been taken by a french fry vending machine distributor.
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="internic">InterNIC</A> Institutes a Domain Name Dispute Policy
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>To deal with such problems, in summer of 1995 InterNIC instituted its first policy related to the trademark implications of domain names.  Under that policy, when applying for a domain name an applicant had to:
<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>warrant that its use of the domain name would not result in trademark infringement;
<p>

<li>warrant that it had a bona fide intention to use the domain name on a regular basis;
<p>

<li>warrant that it was not seeking to use the domain name for any unlawful purpose; and
<p>

<li>promise to indemnify InterNIC and its affiliated organizations for any claims relating to the use of the domain name.  
</ol>
<p>

<li>The earlier version of the policy further stated that another party could challenge the right of the registrant to continue to use a registered domain name by submitting to InterNIC a valid trademark registration (either from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office or a foreign trademark office) with a filing date or date-of-first-use prior to the first use of the domain name.  If such a challenge was raised, the domain name registrant had to follow the terms of InterNICs policy carefully or face losing the right to use its domain name.  In order to avoid losing the right to use the domain name, the registrant had to:
<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>submit, within thirty days of a request by InterNIC, proof that the registrant also had valid trademark rights in that name (satisfactory proof would include either a certified copy of a U.S. or foreign trademark registration or a court order supporting the claimed rights);
<p>

<li>agree to hold InterNIC harmless relating to use of the domain name; and
<p>

<li>post a bond to cover sufficient to cover possible damages.
</ol>
<p>

<li>If the domain name registrant complied with these requirements, it could continue to use the domain name until the dispute was resolved or a court granted an order (temporary or permanent) ruling otherwise.  If the registrant failed to meet these three requirements and chose not to adopt a new domain name, then InterNIC would suspend the domain name until the dispute was resolved or a court ruled otherwise.  If the domain name registrant chose to adopt a new domain name, then InterNIC allowed the domain name registrant to use the old and new domain names simultaneously for ninety days.  Regardless of whether the domain name was suspended, InterNIC itself stated that it would not become involved in the dispute, and the parties would have to resolve the dispute either through arbitration or in court.  
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="shortfalls">Shortfalls</A> of Previous Domain Name Dispute Policy
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>Because the InterNIC domain name dispute policy was designed to protect InterNIC from being drawn into disputes, it simplistically treated trademark rights as being equivalent to owning a federal trademark registration (or foreign trademark registration), thereby allowing InterNIC to determine easily who had the "right" to use a domain name.  
<p>

<li>The policy not only failed to account for common-law trademark rights in an appropriate manner, but it also did not adequately address the fact that multiple parties often have trademark rights in a mark.  
<p>

<li>Furthermore, InterNIC attempted to enforce its policy retroactively on those domain name holders who registered their domain names prior to InterNICs adoption of this policy, and it also purported to have the freedom to modify the policy and bind all domain name registrants to such modifications. 
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="disputes">Disputes</A> Involving Trademark Infringement 
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>Some domain name disputes are fairly straightforward from a traditional trademark vantage.  For example, Playboy Enterprises, Inc. discovered that another party was using the domain name playmates.com for an Internet site advertising compilations of photographs of former Playboy Playmates.  While the photographs themselves supposedly did not infringe any of Playboys copyrights, by using the domain name playmates.com the operator of this site likely infringed Playboys trademark.
<p>

<li>Playboy followed InterNICs domain name policy, sending InterNIC a letter and a certified copy of its trademark registration for the mark "PLAYMATES."  Playboy then sent a copy of that letter to the sites operator and also threatened to sue for trademark infringement.  Not surprisingly, the other party stopped using the domain name.
</ol>
<p>


<li><A NAME="dilution">Dilution</A>
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>Many domain name disputes lack the key elements of traditional trademark infringement case, namely a likelihood of confusion as to source or origin.
<p>

<li>Consider how Hasbro, Inc., the manufacturer of the well known childrens game "Candy Land," reacted when learning that the World Wide Web site <EM>www.candyland.com</EM> contained sexually explicit materials.  Clearly, nobody could reasonably believe that this site was sponsored by or affiliated with the childrens game.  While Hasbro presumably could tolerate sex-oriented businesses operating in various parts of the country under names similar to "Candy Land," because of the ease with which people, including children, visit Internet sites having names closely affiliated with favorite products, usage of similar marks on the Internet posed unique problems.
<p>

<li>Hasbro filed a lawsuit in federal district court, claiming that defendants conduct violated the recently enacted federal trademark anti-dilution  statute, 15 U.S.C.  1125(c).  The court issued a preliminary injunction  in Hasbros favor, ordering:
<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>Defendants ... are enjoined from directly or indirectly using the name CANDYLAND or the Internet domain name "candyland.com," or any similar name which is likely to dilute the value of Hasbros CANDYLAND mark, in connection with the advertising, operation or maintenance of any Internet site, including but not limited to any Internet site containing sexually explicit material or other pornographic content.  Defendants are directed to immediately make affirmative efforts to stop, cancel or discontinue any previously purchased advertising which refers to the name CANDY LAND or the Internet domain name "candyland.com." 
<p>

<li>[D]efendants shall immediately remove all content from the "candyland.com" site. However, defendants shall be allowed to post a "referral notice" at the URL address "http:\\www.candyland.com" until May 5, 1996, which shall provide the new location of defendants Internet site.  The referral notice shall not contain any hyperlink to defendants new site or sites, or to any other site.  After the expiration of the 90 day referral period, defendants must remove the referral notice and thereafter discontinue any use, either direct or indirect, of the name domain name "candyland.com."  
</ol>
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="roadrunner">Disputes</A> Without Trademark Infringement -- The Roadrunner Case
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>Many disputes do not stem from traditional trademark infringement (i.e., a likelihood of confusion) or dilution, but rather from the desire to obtain -- or at least stop others from using -- domain names that are similar to a companys existing products, services, and marks.  Companies were exploiting the weaknesses in InterNICs domain name policy to achieve these goals.  
<p>

<li>One of the leading cases in this area was a dispute between Warner Brothers, Inc. and Roadrunner Computer Systems, Inc. over the domain name roadrunner.com.  Roadrunner Computer Systems is an Internet service provider that registered this domain name in 1994 in accordance with InterNICs policy in effect at that time, namely a pure first-come-first-serve registration policy without trademark exceptions.  Roadrunner Computer Systems strongly believed that if it was forced to change its domain name, even temporarily, it would lose many customers and suffer financial harm.
<p>

<li>Warner Brothers, which has a federal trademark registration for the mark "ROAD RUNNER" for use with toys, dolls, Halloween costumes and masks, decided to challenge Roadrunner Computer Systems right to this domain name, even though Warner Brothers most likely would not be able to win a trademark infringement suit against Roadrunner Computer Systems.  Pursuant to the InterNIC domain name policy in effect at the time, Warner Brothers sent InterNIC a copy of its trademark registration and demanded that InterNIC terminate Roadrunner Computer Systems domain name.  Under InterNICs policy, Roadrunner Computer Systems was given thirty days to submit a valid national trademark registration.
<p>

<li>Warner Brothers and Roadrunner Computer Systems began discussions, and Warner Brothers requested that InterNIC extend the thirty-day period before suspending the domain name.  As Roadrunner Computer Systems did not have a United States federal trademark registration, and had no hopes of obtaining one in a short time period, it applied for and obtained a trademark registration from Tunisia.  It then submitted a copy of this registration to InterNIC.  InterNIC took the position, however, that it had granted an extension of time only for using the domain name, but not for submitting a certified copy of a trademark registration. 
<p>

<li>Roadrunner Computer Systems, presumably fighting to save its business, filed suit against InterNIC.  In addition to claiming that it had been granted an extension by InterNIC, Roadrunner Computer Systems claimed that it was never bound by InterNICs new policy statement because it had registered the roadrunner.com domain name prior to the adoption of the policy.  Moreover, Roadrunner Computer Systems contended that InterNIC, acting as an agent of the National Science Foundation in doling out domain names, has a public duty to adopt a "fair and evenhanded" policy and not to "arbitrarily interfere" with domain name registrants ability to use domain names.  Not surprisingly, Roadrunner Computer Systems alleged that InterNIC should be liable for any losses sustained by Roadrunner Computer Systems if the domain name is suspended.
<p>

<li>Although this case has since been dismissed,  it resulted in InterNIC being sued -- the exact situation InterNIC hoped to avoid in instituting its policy.
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="interpleader">InterNIC</A> Tries a New Approach -- Interpleader
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>Roadrunner Computer Systems was not the only party to sue InterNIC to prevent its domain name from being suspended.  Clue Computing, Inc., an Internet provider based in Colorado, obtained the domain name clue.com.  Hasbro Corp., owner of a federal trademark registration for the mark "CLUE" for use in connection with its board game of the same name, instituted a domain name challenge.
<p>

<li>After being faced with its domain name being suspended, Clue Computing filed a suit against InterNIC in Colorado state court seeking to enjoin InterNIC from suspending its domain name.
<p>

<li>InterNIC, which had been widely criticized for its policy because it favored trademark registrants, responded by doing something that many people had been calling for, namely turning the matter over to a court to decide who should get the domain name.  InterNIC filed an interpleader complaint in federal court in Colorado, stating: "Network Solutions [InterNIC] has no financial or other interest whatsoever in the registration, use, or even existence of any particular domain name by any particular party ... .  Network Solutions [InterNIC] performs the registration service in an impartial and unbiased manner with no interest in any particular domain name. ... This dispute is properly between Clue Computing and Hasbro and requires resolution of conflicting claims to the intangible property interest in a particular domain name."  In addition, InterNIC asked the federal court to stop Clue Computings pending case in state court.
<p>

<li>Both parties have opposed InterNICs attempt to interplead the domain name:<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>Clue Computing wants to continue in state court rather than federal court.  It has responded to the interpleader action by stating that, "Network Solutions [InterNIC] is not the kind of objective stakeholder required for an interpleader action.  Although Network Solutions [InterNIC] administers what is, in essence, a public utility and should therefore be held to a high standard of maintaining a public trust, it has gratuitously implemented a policy favoring large economic players over small ones.  By so doing, it has encouraged litigation where none need exist."
<p>

<li>Hasbro also believes that an interpleader action is not appropriate for this dispute because, unlike a typical interpleader case where the property in question is deposited with the court, Clue Computing can continue to use the clue.com domain name during the pendency of the case.
</ol>
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="new name policy">New </A>Domain Name Dispute Policy -- September 1996
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>InterNIC has since adopted a new domain name dispute policy,  which is reproduced in the appendix to these materials.  This new policy, like the previous versions, was drafted with the hope that InterNIC will be able to avoid being dragged into future lawsuits.
<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>The policy clarifies that for U.S. federal trademark registrations, only registrations on the Principal Register will be accepted, and the registration should be for the domain name without the suffix ".com," ".org" or ".edu" (presumably a registration which included this suffix would also be accepted).
<p>

<li>Before instituting a suspension proceeding, InterNIC now requires that the trademark registration presented by the claimant either be issued or have a date-of-first-use that predates the domain name (the old policy was keyed off the filing date, not the issue date, of a trademark registration).
<p>

<li>Prior to instituting a suspension request, the trademark registrant must send to the domain name holder a letter, and provide InterNIC with a copy of such letter, specifying "unequivocally and with particularity that the registration and use of the Registrants Domain Name violates the legal rights of the trademark owner."  This seems to be required so that the domain name holder has adequate grounds to seek a declaratory judgment action.  Presumably, however, trademark registrants will continue to craft letters in such a manner as to prevent the domain name holder from having sufficient grounds to institute a declaratory judgment action.  InterNICs policy states that it will not undertake "any separate investigation of the statements" in the letter from the trademark registrant to the domain name holder.  Most likely, this means that InterNIC will not review the letter to determine whether it specifies "unequivocally and with particularity that the registration and use of the Registrants Domain Name violates the legal rights of the trademark owner."  If InterNIC were to make such an evaluation (even without conducting an investigation as to the underlying facts), it likely would invite further suits against itself with respect to such evaluations.
<p>

<li>Unlike the old policy, which allowed the domain name holder to rush off and obtain a trademark registration from a country such as Tunisia in order to avoid domain name suspension, InterNIC now requires that any trademark registration presented by the domain name registrant be obtained prior to the date of the challenge letter from the complaining trademark registrant.
<p>

<li>In an attempt at avoiding being dragged into lawsuits, the new policy states that if either party files a lawsuit related to the registration of the domain name, and InterNIC is not named as a party to the suit, then InterNIC will not suspend the domain name and instead will deposit control of the domain name with the court.  If InterNIC is made a party to the suit, however, then it will respond in whatever way it sees fit.
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="considerations">Considerations</A> in Light of the New Policy.
<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>InterNIC has been known to change its policy midcourse, and there is no guarantee that it will not do so again.  Even though the current policy states that InterNIC will abide by a court decision if it is not a party to the suit, naming InterNIC as a party and seeking an injunction preventing it from suspending or terminating the domain name will provide more security to the domain name holder.  Alternatively, if your domain name is challenged, consider requesting that InterNIC enter into a separate signed agreement binding it not to suspend or terminate your domain name except pursuant to a court order, and requiring that it notify and join you in any proceeding that the challenger might raise against InterNIC.
<p>

<li>Because a trademark registration is valid protection against suspension only if issued prior to a challenge, applying for U.S. registrations may not offer sufficient protection because an application generally takes at least a year before it matures into a registration.  Similarly, applying for a foreign trademark registration after a challenge arises is no longer sufficient.  Therefore, if you do not already have a trademark registration, you should consider preemptively applying for a trademark registration in a quick turnaround country (e.g., Tunisia).  Note, however, that InterNICs policy could change at any time and no longer accept foreign trademark registration, or put limitations on how they will be accepted.

<li><A NAME="registering">Registering</A> Trademarks
<p>

<ol type=A>
<li><A NAME="identification">Identification</A> of Goods and Services
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>In February, 1996, the PTO issued a policy statement regarding the registration of domain names as trademarks, a copy of which is set-forth in the appendix. 
<p>

<li>Marks used on Web sites, including domain names, are classified by the PTO as service marks.  The PTO is classifying these marks in the class associated with the content of the information offered by the Web site.
<p>

<li>As examples of appropriate recitation of services, consider "providing online magazines in field of cooking by means of a global computer network in class 42" or "providing multiple user access to a global computer network in the field of banking services in class 36."
<p>

<li>Online products, such as online publications or interactive software, are not considered products and do not fall within classes 9 or 16.  Marks for such "products" are treated by the PTO as service marks.
<p>

<li>While point-of-sale displays would count as acceptable trademark usage in the non-online world, the equivalent in the online world is viewed by the PTO as a service.  Case in point, if a mark is used on a Web site in connection with downloading software, such a specimen would be acceptable by the PTO to show use of the mark for the services of offering software via an online service, but not for the class 9 software itself.
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="specimens">Specimens</A>
<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>Acceptable specimens include screen prints from the Web site showing trademark usage in the normal sense.  Alternatively, you can submit photographs of the computer screen on which the Web site is displayed.
<p>

<li>The submitted specimens must show that the services listed in the application are being offered -- the PTO is not accepting print-outs of the home page of a Web site when the home page itself does not mention the listed services -- make sure to submit any necessary lower level pages.
<p>

<li>If you want to protect a domain name as a service mark, make sure that you use it as a service mark -- display the domain name, or the URL, prominently on the Web site.
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="internet">The</A> word "INTERNET"
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>The word "INTERNET" is a registered trademark, registration number 1,560,167.  Internet, Inc. of Reston, Virginia filed an application for this mark in 1988 for use in connection with providing electronic data transmission services in the electronic banking field and retail marketing field.
<p>

<li>Several parties are involved in consolidated opposition proceedings (numbers 91,237 and 94,357), and cancellation proceedings (number 23,324) regarding the use and registration of marks containing the term "INTERNET."
<p>

<li>Because this is a registered mark, the PTO will not allow you to use the word "INTERNET" in the identification of goods and services in trademark applications.  Instead, use a phrase such as "global computer network."
<p>

<li>If the mark itself includes the word "INTERNET," then current PTO policy states that when the application is otherwise in condition for the issuance of a final refusal because of the registered "INTERNET" mark, then the application will be suspended pending the substantive outcomes of the TTAB proceedings.  In addition, the PTO often will require a disclaimer of the word "INTERNET."
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="domain names">Domain</A> Names
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>Trademark Usage
<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>If a domain name is only used as an address (for e-mail or Web sites), then the PTO will not view the domain name as being used as a service mark.  Notwithstanding the PTOs view, courts are likely to take a broader view of what constitutes trademark use.
<p>

<li>If you want to protect a domain name as a service mark, use it that way -- display the domain name, or the URL, prominently on the Web site.
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="what register">What</A> to register:
<p>

<ol type=a>
<li>There are a variety of choices for trademark registration, such as faegre, faegre.com, www.faegre.com, or http://www.faegre.com.
<p>

<li>Register the form that is used in a trademark sense.  For instance, if the name of a site (not the URL, but the name prominently displayed on the home page) is "www.boston.com," then this should be registered.
<p>

<li>Before including a prefix such as "http://," consider that this is a computer protocol that may not be the protocol of choice next month or next year.
</ol>
</ol>
</ol>
<p>

<li><A NAME="tm disputes">Trademark</A> Disputes
<p>

<ol type=A>
<li>There are many Web sites that keep lists of trademark disputes.  One such site is <A HREF="http://www.muchmusic.com/muchmusic.cyberfax/trademark.html">www.muchmusic.com/muchmusic.cyberfax/trademark.html</A>.
<p>

<li>In <EM>Malarkey-Taylor Assoc., Inc. v. Cellular Telecommunications</EM>, Ind. Assoc., 929 F. Supp. 473 (D. D.C. 1996), the court granted a preliminary injunction enjoining the defendant from using mark "Go Wireless Now!" is the name of an information service offered on a Web site.  The plaintiff had a trademark registration for the mark "WirelessNOW" for a similar information service offered via an electronic bulletin board.  The court dismissed the defendants arguments that the registration covered only electronic bulletin board systems and therefore excluded services offered via the Internet.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 476.
<p>

<li><A NAME="jurisdiction">Jurisdiction</A>
<p>

<ol type=1>
<li>In August, 1996, a suit against a Minneapolis ad agency Fallon McElligott was dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.  The plaintiff had argued that because Fallons Web site was accessible in California, California had personal jurisdiction over Fallon.  Judge John Rhoades of the Southern District of California held that there was not sufficient contacts to establish jurisdiction, "Because the Web enables easy worldwide access, allowing computer interaction via the Web, to supply sufficient contact to establish jurisdiction would eviscerate the personal jurisdiction requirement as it currently exists; the Court is not willing to take this step."
<p>

<li>In September, 1996, a suit by the Blue Note jazz club in Greenwich Village, New York, against Blue Note club of Columbia, Missouri was similarly dismissed for lack of personal jurisdiction.  The court rejected plaintiffs argument that the availability of defendants Web site in New York was sufficient to establish jurisdiction. 
<p>

<li>Inset Systems, Inc. of Brookfield, Connecticut, sued Instruction Set, Inc. of Natick, Massachusetts, for trademark infringement.   Inset Systems owns a federal trademark registration for the mark "INSET," and  Instruction Set obtained the domain name inset.com.  Inset filed suit in federal court in Connecticut to obtain this domain name.  The court ruled that Instruction Sets operation of its Web site satisfies jurisdictional requirements set forth in Connecticut state law and under federal constitutional standards. "Once posted on the Internet, unlike television and radio advertising, the advertising is available continuously to any Internet user," the judge wrote. "ISI has therefore purposefully availed itself of the privilege of doing business within Connecticut."  The judge noted that the proximity of the parties (Connecticut and Massachusetts) was a factor in keeping the case in Connecticut.
<p>

<li>In <EM>Playboy Enter. Inc. v. Chuckleberry Publishing Inc.</EM>, No. 79 Civ. 3525 SAS (S.D.N.Y. June 19, 1996), the court held an Italian operator of a Web site in contempt of a 1981 injunction.  The previous injunction barred the defendant using the word "PLAYMEN" on magazines or related products or services sold or distributed in the United States.  In 1996, Playboy learned that the defendant was offering a subscription based Web site from Italy which provides similar content to that of the magazines, and was doing so under the mark "PLAYMEN."  Playboy argued that as long as the Web site was available to users in the United States, the defendant was violating the injunction.  The judge noted that while a United States court cannot shut down a Web site operated in a foreign country, it could prohibit access to users located in the United States.  The court held that the injunction was being violated, and that the operator would have to terminate the subscriptions of United States residents and stop accepting subscriptions from United States residents.

<H2>Copyright and Free Flow of Information</H2>

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="intro">I.</A>  Introduction</H3></CENTER>

	The "information superhighway," which has found its most prominent manifestation in the Internet, has revolutionized the way people access, generate and share information.  In the digitized world of the Internet, people can receive information instantaneously through a continuously available, borderless distribution network without perceptible degradation in the quality of the transmission.
<P>

	These features of the Internet, however, are also the source of some of its greatest problems.  The ease with which information can be copied, recast and distributed over the Internet, or taken from it, without degradation in quality and with practically no incremental cost makes it all too easy for end-users to use information with impunity.  This is especially true when end-users are used to paradigms of conduct governing information distributed in more tangible forms.  Passing along a book to a friend, browsing through a magazine in a waiting room, or making a personal copy of a newspaper article, for example, are all innocuous enough, but when analogous kinds of activities are performed on the Internet, they may be illegal.  The problems associated with such activities are further exacerbated by the lack of effective means to control such largely anonymous conduct and the Internet sub-culture that asserts that "information wants to be free."
<P>

	As the Internet and on-line services continue to expand from a community of users to a major avenue for commerce, the stakes associated with these problems will grow.  While there is little debate over policies aimed at optimizing the free flow of information by promoting universal service, interconnectivity, interoperability of technical environments and architecture, and encouraging competition, there has been considerable discussion over what rules should govern content and the way in which it can be used.
<P>

	The content debate focuses on regulations imposed by the government or restrictions placed by service providers.  For example, the Communications Decency Act of 1996 has been objected to on the grounds that its prohibition against making "indecent" material available to children will have a chilling effect on all Internet speech.  In responding to passage of this Act, former Grateful Dead lyricist John Perry Barlow capsulized the attitude of many who believe the Internet should be an unregulated sanctuary:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Governments of the Industrial World, you weary giants of flesh and steel, I come from Cyberspace, the new home of Mind.  On behalf of the future, I ask you of the past to leave us alone.  You are not welcome among us.  You have no sovereignty where we gather.<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE1"><FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER>1</SUPER></FONT></A></BLOCKQUOTE> 

Similar reactions have erupted in reaction to efforts by online service providers to restrict access to adult-oriented Web sites.  In contrast, others have applauded attempts by online providers to restrict unsolicited e-mails.
<P>

	Another debate centers on how the content that is available on the Internet can be used.  While many users of such information worry that they will be hounded "relentlessly for stealing a crumb of intellectual property,"<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE 2"><FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER>2</SUPER></FONT></A> many writers and information providers are concerned that others are using their works without sharing any of the income derived from such uses.  It is this second part of the debate, which implicates important copyright principles, that is the focus of these materials.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="how works">II.</A>  How the Internet Works</H3></CENTER>

	The Internet is an electronic infrastructure that forms a virtual community that stretches from one end of the globe to the other.  When an end-user connects to the Internet, the end-users computer becomes an extension of what seems like a giant single computer.  This is particularly true of the area of the Internet known as the World Wide Web, which is built on a protocol known as HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP).  By using software known as a "browser," such as that offered under the trademark Netscape Navigator, an Internet user can retrieve documents from Web sites around the world.  In simplified terms, a Web document can contain text, formatting instructions, graphics, sound, and links to other documents.  Often, a Web page is made up of a master document containing links to other documents, such as image and graphics files.
<P>

	Each Web document has its own unique Uniform Resource Locator (URL), the name and location of the document on the Web.  By pointing a Web browser at a specific URL, an Internet user can download an individual element of a Web page, even if the creator of that Web page intended that the Web page be used only as an integral piece.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="copyrightability">III.</A>  Copyrightability of Works on the Internet</H3></CENTER>

	Copyright law has perhaps the most pervasive effect on the way content is used on the Internet.  With no requirement that current works display a copyright notice or be published to be eligible for federal protection, works must simply meet the threshold of copyrightability to be protected.
<P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="works eligible">1.</A>	Works Eligible for Copyright Protection</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	A work will be eligible for copyright protection if it consists of original expression and a modicum of creativity and exists in a form sufficiently permanent or stable to permit the work to be perceived, reproduced or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.  This test in most instances will be easily met for the kinds of works that appear on the Internet, whether the works take the form of text, graphics, photographs, moving images or sounds.  There are some kinds of works, however, that raise special issues in view of these criteria.
<P>
	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="databases">2.</A>	Databases</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
	The originality requirement may not easily be met for electronic information stored on a computer database.  The requirement that a work be original to obtain copyright protection was given renewed emphasis by the United States Supreme Court in <EM>Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., Inc.</EM>, 499 U.S. 340 (1991), where the Court held that a telephone directory consisting of an alphabetical listing of telephone subscribers names, addresses and telephone numbers lacked the necessary "modicum of creativity" to be protected by copyright law.  <EM>Id.</EM> at 362.  Given this requirement, copyright protection will be unavailable for electronic data unless the data itself consists of something more than facts or unless it is selected and arranged in an original way.  Because most databases comprise compilations of facts in textual form, developers likely will have to rely on the form in which the facts are presented to obtain copyright protection, unless that form is itself too mechanical, typical, routine or obvious.<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE3"><FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER>3</SUPER></FONT></A> Compare, e.g., <EM>Coates-Freeman Associates, Inc. v. Polaroid Corp.</EM>, 792 F. Supp. 879 (D. Mass. 1992) (selection and arrangement of elements in a cross-hatched chart format showing relationship between decision making styles and problem solving steps was not copyrightable) with <EM>CCC Info. Servs., Inc. v. MacLean Hunter Mkt. Reports, Inc.</EM>, 44 F.3d 61 (2d Cir. 1994) (selection and arrangement of information in used car "Red Book" was protectable).
<P>

	One way to ensure originality beyond a creative selection and arrangement of text is to present graphic depictions of facts.  With the growth of high-speed graphics technology, that method of presenting data is increasingly feasible.  Even in this situation, however, copyright protection likely would be limited to the screen display.
<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="bitstreams">3.</A>	Bit Streams</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	The electronic impulses making up a data stream themselves are not copyrightable (even though they may represent a copyrightable work), until they are "fixed" at various points along the transmission path.  Almost all such impulses, however, not only are fixed at many computer relay stations, but also on the floppy disks, hard disks, CD-ROMS and tapes that serve as memory devices on an end-users computer.  Courts even have found works embodied momentarily in a computers random access memory to be sufficiently fixed to be protected by copyright.  See <EM>MAI System Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.</EM>, 991 F.2d 511, 517 (9th Cir. 1993), <EM>cert. dismissed</EM>, 114 S.Ct. 671 (1994).

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="rights holders">IV.</A>  Rights of Copyright Holders
</H3></CENTER>

<STRONG><A NAME="section 106">A.</A>	Section 106 Rights</STRONG>
<P>

	Because most works on the Internet are protected by copyright, end users cannot use works in ways that violate any of the exclusive rights granted to copyright owners under the Copyright Act.  These rights, which are embodied principally in section 106 of the Act, 17 U.S.C.  106, are the following:

<UL>
<LI>The exclusive right to reproduce copies of the work;
<LI>The exclusive right to prepare derivative works based on the copyrighted work;
<LI>The exclusive right to distribute copies of the work publicly;
<LI>The exclusive right to perform the work publicly;<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE4"><FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER>4</SUPER></FONT></A> and
<LI>The exclusive right to display the work publicly.
</UL>


	Because of the way works are transmitted and stored on the Internet, almost any use of a copyrighted work on the Internet likely will implicate one of these exclusive rights.  In fact, the use of works on the Internet may often involve several of these rights.  Several illustrations prove the point.
<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="rights implicated">B.</A>	Rights Implicated by Particular Activities</STRONG>
<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="browsing document">1.</A>	Browsing a Document on the Web</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	Browsing a document that resides on anothers Web site involves the creation of a copy in the random access memory of the end-users computer in order for that document to be displayed as an image on the end-users computer screen.  Since such an image is capable of being perceived by the end-user, it would appear to meet the definition of a "copy" that has been "fixed" within the meaning of the Copyright Act and thus be susceptible to protection, so long as it can be perceived, reproduced or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE5"><FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER>5</SUPER></FONT></A>
<P>

	The legislative history of the 1976 Copyright Act indicates that works are not considered fixed if they are "purely evanescent or transient in nature, such as those projected briefly on a television or cathode ray tube, or captured momentarily on the memory of a computer."  HR. Rep. No. 1476, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 53 (1976), reprinted in 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5666-67.  Despite this language, the courts that have addressed whether execution in RAM results in a fixation of a work have concluded that it does.  See <EM>MAI Systems Corp. v. Peak Computer, Inc.</EM>, 991 F.2d 511, 518 (9th Cir. 1993), <EM>cert. denied</EM>, 114 S.Ct. 671 (1994); <EM>Advanced Computer Services of Michigan, Inc. v. MAI Systems Corp.</EM>, 845 F.Supp. 356 (E.D.Va. 1994).  Similarly, the Administrations comprehensive reassessment of copyright law in view of the information superhighway by the U.S. Department of Commerces Working Group on Intellectual Property Rights recommended no change in this view when it issued its final "White Paper."<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE6"><FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER>6</SUPER></FONT></A> Thus, under current law, any information that resides in the random access memory of the end-users computer will be deemed to exist in the form of a copy.
<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="downloading page">2.</A>	Downloading a Web Page</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	If browsing a document on the Internet involves the creation of a copy, then certainly transmitting and downloading a work onto a more permanent storage device, such as the hard disk of the end-users computer, does so as well.  Indeed, one of the basic tenets of using works on the Internet is that the acts of transmission and downloading (or uploading) arguably invoke both the reproduction right and the distribution right.  First, almost any use of a work online involves the creation of a copy, since the original work, while being transmitted and downloaded onto a second computers memory, will continue to exist simultaneously on the storage device of the senders computer.  Furthermore, the act of downloading arguably involves "distribution" of the work to another computer.  However, unlike the world of traditional publishing, where one physical copy of a publication changes hands when it is distributed, this distribution involves only the flow of an intangible stream of bits.
<P>

	The White Paper has recommended clarifying these concepts by suggesting that the Copyright Act expressly recognize that copies of works can be distributed to the public by transmission, and that such transmissions fall within the exclusive distribution right of the copyright owner.  While pointing out that this recommendation does not involve the creation of any new right, the White Paper states that it would result in "an express recognition that, as a result of technological developments, the distribution right can be exercised by means of transmission--just as the reproduction, public performance and display rights may be."  White Paper at 213-214.
<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="transmitting email">3.</A>	Transmitting a Document Via E-Mail</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	The concept of a "transmission" takes a slightly different form when it is not publicly disseminated, since the distribution right relates only to works distributed "to the public."  17 U.S.C.  106.  The White Paper notes, for example, that a transmission in an online environment will not in all circumstances constitute a distribution to the public.  Both private e-mail messages and transmissions of copies within a companys computer network, for example, are typically restricted as to further distribution, and thus would not likely constitute publication or distribution to the public.  See White Paper at 28-32, 215-216, 220.  
<P>

	On the other hand, the distribution of copies to even a small group under circumstances where further distribution is authorized would likely constitute distribution of the work to the public.  Therefore, since many e-mails are transmitted with an implied license to retransmit them (see discussion below), it is possible that such transmissions will constitute a public distribution of the content of the e-mail.
<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="downloading a/v file">4.</A>	Downloading an Audio or Audio-Visual File</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	It is also possible that the transmission of an audio or audio-visual work may constitute a public performance or display of the work.  When a copy of a work is transmitted in digital form and received in storage by the end-users computer, without the capability of simultaneous "rendering" or "showing," the majority view is that no performance or display has occurred.  While a stored file so transmitted that contains audio information might later be played over the computers speakers, that later performance would likely be considered a private one that would not implicate the public performance right.
<P>

	With transmissions involving software such as Real Audio that allow sound files being downloaded to be heard "on the fly," however, the probability that a performance has taken place via transmission is greatly increased.  Furthermore, such a performance will be regarded as "public" so long as multiple individual viewers are capable of perceiving a performance of the work, even if the performances occur at different times and locations.  Therefore, a work such as a sound file that can be accessed and performed off of a record companys Web site will likely implicate the public performance right.
<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="linking site">5.</A>	Linking to Another Web Site</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	A common practice of Web site operators is to link their sites to other Web sites.  This linkage is possible because the HyperText Mark-up Language (HTML) used on Web sites contains codes that act as "link tags" to point to other Web addresses.
<P>

	While the practice of linking Web sites is pervasive and in some instances actively encouraged, it can result in false suggestions of sponsorship or approval.  The legality of such practices generally will be governed by the Lanham Act and state unfair competition laws.  Nonetheless, depending on the manner in which the link is created, it is conceivable that copyright principles may come into play.  For example, while creating a link does not involve copying the linked site (since the end-users computer receives the transmission of the images from the linked site directly from the memory of the linked sites host computer), it is possible that a derivative work of the linked sites images have been created.  This might occur, for example, if the images from the linked site are melded seamlessly into the first site by use of an automatic return from the linked site to the host site after a minimal duration.
<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="caching pages">6.</A>	Caching Web Pages</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	Another common practice for some online providers providing access to the Web and for Web site operators whose sites act solely as links to other sites is to cache Web pages from other sites onto a permanent storage device.  Such caching saves time for the end-user, who then does not have to receive transmissions from the host computers of each of these sites.  It also arguably benefits all Internet users by lessening the overall load on the Internet.  This practice, however, clearly involves the making and distribution of a copy.  If there is no modification of the site that is cached from the way it appears on the host site, the host site operator may not care.  However, because such activities typically deprive the host site operator of information about the number of people accessing the site, they may take offense at such practices.<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE7"><FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER>7</SUPER></FONT></A>
<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="contributory">C.</A>	Contributory Infringement Issues</STRONG>
<P>

	Although most infringement takes place at the individual end-user level, the liability of on-line providers and bulletin board operators is a key legal issue because enforcement at the end-user level is usually impractical.  The debate over liability for on-line providers echoes the debate over the liability of videocassette manufacturers, which was resolved in favor of the manufacturers in <EM>Sony Corp. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.</EM>, 464 U.S. 417 (1984), which held that Sony was not liable as a contributory infringer for selling VCRs even though many consumers would use the machines for copying television programs and movies.
<P>

	The key legal question is whether on-line providers are liable, either as direct infringers or as contributory infringers, for infringements conducted by subscribers.  Generally, direct copyright infringement is a strict liability offense; a defendant may be found liable as an infringer even though he or she is not aware of the infringement.  Contributory infringement (except in the case of providing equipment that provides the means to infringe) generally requires either knowledge of the infringement or supervisory responsibility over the infringer.
<P>

	The courts that have addressed the issue have usually applied these principles broadly.  In <EM>Playboy Enterprises, Inc. v. Frena</EM>, 839 F. Supp. 1552 (M.D. Fla. 1993), for example, Playboy obtained summary judgment for copyright infringement against a bulletin board operator who allowed Playboy photographs to be uploaded, displayed, and downloaded.  The court found direct infringement even though the BBS operator testified that he did not know and had no reason to know of the infringements.
<P>

	Similarly, in <EM>Sega Enter Ltd. v. MAPHIA</EM>, 857 F. Supp. 679 (N.D. Cal. 1994), Sega obtained a preliminary injunction against a BBS operator who encouraged the uploading and downloading of Sega games.  The court found that Sega would likely prove at trial both direct and contributory infringement by the BBS operator.  The court noted that "[E]ven if [d]efendants do not know exactly when games will be uploaded to or downloaded from the MAPHIA bulletin board, their role in the copying, including provision of facilities, direction, knowledge, and encouragement, amounts to contributory infringement."  Id. at 686-87.
<P>

	Finally, in <EM>Religious Technology Center v. Netcom et al.</EM>, 907 F. Supp. 1361 (N.D. Cal. 1995), the court was faced with determining the extent of an Internet providers liability for a subscribers posting of material to the Internet.  The court denied the Internet providers motion for summary judgment, stating that the provider could be liable for contributory (but not direct) copyright infringement if the plaintiff could prove that the service provider had actual knowledge that material posted through its system was in fact infringing, and then failed to take action on the knowledge to prevent further distribution.
<P>

	While suits by individual companies against small BBS operators may stop some infringement, a wholesale assault on alleged on-line infringement of sound recordings was launched on behalf of the music publishing industry in <EM>Frank Music Corp. v. CompuServe Inc.</EM>, No. 93 Civ.  8153 (S.D.N.Y.).  This class action copyright infringement suit, which was filed on behalf of the music publisher principals of the Harry Fox Agency (a central clearinghouse for rights in music other than performance rights), asserted copyright infringement against CompuServe for maintaining a bulletin board-MIDI/Music Forum.  The forum was one of about 1700 that CompuServe carried but did not operate directly.  Because the parties settled this case, however, with CompuServe agreeing to pay over $500,000 in fees and obtain licenses, no decision was rendered.  The settlement is regarded as significant, however, because it establishes a model for the use of copyrighted works owned by multiple parties on the Internet through a central licensing agency.
<P>

	While the trend has been to hold online providers contributorily liable for the acts of their subscribers, online providers have doggedly pushed their position that their liability should be limited.  Because of the difficulty in policing the millions of bits of information that transgress their networks each day, providers argue that they should be liable for infringement only if (1) they have actual knowledge that infringing material has been or is being transmitted to, or resides on, their systems, and (2) having knowledge such material is infringing, and the ability and authority to stop its transmission or remove it, failed to stop the transmission or remove it from their systems in a reasonable time.
<P>

	While the White Paper gave consideration to online providers suggestion that the Copyright Act should be amended to alter the strict liability of online providers, it ultimately rejected any changes.  The White Paper concluded that, as between two "relatively innocent parties" (the online provider and the copyright owner), the "best policy is to hold the service provider liable."  White Paper at 117.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="rights users">V.</A>  Rights of End Users</H3></CENTER>

	Given the copyright "thicket" in which end-users and Web site operators find themselves, end-users may be left wondering how they can safely navigate the Internet without routinely showing contempt for the law.  As one user lamented in a posting to a use-net group on copyright:

<BLOCKQUOTE>Separate for me if you will what is protected and what is not.  Tell me how I know when I am violating the law and when I am not.  It is no answer to say that "all is protected" because we cannot partic[i]pate in ordinary discourse without violating the law.<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE8"><FONT SIZE=-2>8</FONT></A></BLOCKQUOTE>

	Other copyright principles must come into play if "ordinary discourse" on the Internet is not to become unduly restricted.  Chief among these principles are the notions of express or implied licenses that permit the use of copyrighted material, and the concept of fair use.
<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="licenses">A.</A>	Licenses</STRONG>
<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="express">1.</A>	Express Licenses.</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	The restrictions imposed on end-users by copyright law on the use of copyrighted material on the Internet often are altered expressly.  The most common form of alteration is through language granting permission to use a work.  Such permissions normally involve two elements:  an indication of what material may be used, and what the permissible scope of use is.  They may or may not be elegantly or elaborately phrased.  Motorolas home page, for example, contains the following explicit statement:
<P>

<blockquote>While Motorola, Inc. provides the information on this server to anyone, we retain copyright on all text and graphic images.  This means that <STRONG>you may not</STRONG>:  distribute the text or graphics to others without the express written permission of Motorola, Inc.; "mirror" this information on your own server without our permission; modify or re-use the text or graphics on this system.  <STRONG>You MAY</STRONG>:  print copies of the information for your own personal use; store the files on your own computer for your personal use only; reference this server from your own documents.</blockquote>
<P>

In addition, there may be even more complex statements, such as those contained in a subscriber agreement with American Online.  Unfortunately, however, the use of information in many online situations are not guided by such express permissions.  In those situations, end-users must rely on implied licenses to avoid liability.
<P>

	<BLOCKQUOTE><STRONG><A NAME="implied">2.</A>	Implied Licenses.</STRONG></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>

	Courts will find an implied license to use intellectual property in a variety of circumstances.  See, e.g., <EM>McCoy v. Mitsuboshi Cutlery, Inc.</EM>, 67 F.3d 917 (Fed. Cir. 1995) (manufacturer that made patented knives at request of patentee had implied license to resell the knives as a self-help remedy when the patentee refused to pay).  In most instances where such licenses are found, however, it can be traced to the necessity of such a license because of the nature of the work and functional considerations relating to uses of the work, or some act or conduct on the part of the copyright holder or custom in the industry.
<P>

	As noted earlier, almost all transmissions on the Internet impact one of the exclusive rights under copyright law.  Unlike copies embodied in printed form, which can be distributed and "browsed" without the necessity of making an additional copy, transmissions on the Internet require the creation of a copy and arguably the distribution of a copy.  It can be argued, therefore, that the law should imply permission to create a copy that is inherent in the transmission process. 
<P>

	In fact, this situation is not altogether different from that which existed when computer software programs were first used on a widespread basis.  At that time, Congress decided to give explicit protection to software under copyright; however, it also created exceptions for certain uses of the software that were inherent in the way computers utilize software.  In particular, Congress enacted section 117 of the Copyright Act which, among other things, allows software "owners" to make a copy of a computer program if the copy is "created as an essential step in the utilization of the computer program in conjunction with a machine and that it is used in no other manner[.]"
<P>

	Congress has not yet acted to make similar allowances for uses of material on the Internet.  It is faced now, however, with a situation that practically requires recognition of such uses.  Without such explicit recognition, courts will have to create such an exception, expand the notion of "fair use," or rely on the notion of an implied license.  Otherwise, in the mind of at least one commentator, "[t]he only sure result is contempt for the law."
<P>

	An implied license also may be implied by the acts of the copyright holder.  Sending a letter to the editor of a newspaper, for example, clearly is the sort of act that impliedly permits the newspaper to publish it, just as consenting to a television interview impliedly gives the station the right to broadcast the words of the person being interviewed.  Similar examples exist in an online environment.  For example, anonymous ftp sites are universally recognized as sites that exists so that others may download files from it.  Therefore,  posting a file on such a site would also seem to impliedly give others the right to download it.  Similarly, because of the way the Internet works, it might also be assumed that anyone who places a work on a publicly available site on the Internet impliedly consents to some copying of that work.  For example, materials placed on a Web site are, at the very least, there to be browsed, and it can be assumed that any copy made in the end-users random access memory is one that is permitted by the copyright holder of the material on the Web site.
<P>

	In addition, even in the relatively short time that the Internet has had substantial public use, a number of customs and practices have been established that have not grown out of the inherent functionality of the Internet.  An example of this is the way most of us view publicly posted e-mails.  E-mail messages routinely are printed out or forwarded, sometimes with additional commentary.
<P>

<STRONG><A NAME="fair use">B.</A>	Fair Use</STRONG>
<P>

	The doctrine of fair use creates a right to use the copyrighted material of another in a reasonable manner without the copyright holders consent.  The fair use doctrine offers a means of balancing the exclusive rights of copyright holders with the publics interest in the dissemination of information affecting areas of universal concern, such as "for purposes of criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research[.]"  17 U.S.C.  107 (Copyright Act).  In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is fair, a court is to consider four factors.
<P>

	The first factor is the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes.  The central inquiry here is whether the second work uses the copyrighted material for a commercial or noncommercial purpose, and whether this use supplants the original work or instead adds something new, creative and productive, transforming the original work.  Commercial uses are less likely to be regarded as fair uses.  However, the more transformative the new work, the less significant are other factors, like commercialism, that may weigh against a finding of fair use.  Therefore, a work that adds new expression or meaning to the copyrighted material, or serves as a comment on that material, is more likely to qualify for fair use.
<P>

	The second factor involves an evaluation of the nature of the copyrighted work.  This factor recognizes that some works are closer to the core of intended copyright protection than others, and hence will be less susceptible to fair use.  Generally, copying form works that have not yet been published, such as someones private letters, will be  more difficult to justify as a fair use.  On the other hand, copying from nonfiction works or works that are factually intensive will be easier to justify as fair use.
<P>

	The third factor concerns itself with the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole.  This factor involves an assessment of whether the quantity and value of the material used from the original work are reasonable in relation to the purpose of the copying.  In this sense, the third factor harkens back to the first factor, recognizing that the extent of permissible copying varies with the purpose and character of the use, and foreshadows the fourth factor, by revealing the degree to which the new work may serve as a market substitute for the original or potentially licensed derivatives of the original.
<P>

	Courts have found that even a minor amount of copying cannot be justified as fair use where the material copied constitutes the "heart" of the work.  See, e.g., <EM>Harper & Row, Publishers, Inc. v. Nation Enterprises</EM>, 471 U.S. 539, 569 (1985).  In contrast, use of an entire work has been found to constitute a fair use in circumstances where it was republished for purposes of criticism or comment.  See, e.g., <EM>Belmore v. City Pages, Inc.</EM>, 880 F. Supp. 673 (D. Minn. 1995).
<P>

	Finally, the fourth factor involves a consideration of the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.  Courts have repeatedly identified this as the most significant of the four factors.  In making a determination regarding the economic effect of the use, courts consider not only the extent of market harm caused by the particular actions of the alleged infringer, but also whether unrestricted and widespread conduct of the sort engaged in by the alleged infringer would result in a substantially adverse impact on the potential market for the original work, and any derivatives of the original work.
<P>

	There is no reason to expect that courts will approach claims of fair use of material on the Internet any differently that they do outside an online environment.  Commercial uses that involve no "transformation" of the material by end-users and that simply duplicate or supplant the original work or potential markets for the work will almost always be infringing.  On the other hand, end users who copy material for a nonprofit educational purpose and who comment on or criticize the copyrighted work will likely enjoy the benefits of fair use.  In addition, some activities, such as printing a copy of a document off a publicly available Web site might be analogized to the use of videotaping television programs for "time-shifting" purposes.  The vast majority of uses will fall somewhere between these extremes, and will be judged on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

	In a series of cases involving the posting on the Internet of works by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology, by individuals criticizing the tenets of his teachings, courts have reached different results regarding fair use depending on the particular evidence presented.  In one of these cases, <EM>Religious Technology Center v. Netcom On-Line Communications Services, Inc.</EM>, No. C-95-20091, 1995 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 16184 (N.D. Cal.), the substantiality of the works copied has been a critical factor in negating a finding of fair use.  While the court found that both the first and fourth factors weighed in the defendants favor, it also determined that the works were unpublished.  Most importantly, because it concluded that the defendant copied all or almost all of many of the works with minimal criticism or commentary, the use overall could not be regarded as a fair use.
<P>

	In contrast, the court in <EM>Religious Technology Center v. F.A.C.T.NET, Inc.</EM>, 901 F. Supp. 1519 (D. Colo. 1995) found that the postings could constitute a fair use.  The court noted that the postings were used in a nonprofit manner as part of "a topical debate concerning whether the Works are of substance or are perpetrated as part of systemic mind control."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 1526.  The court also noted that the Church had not presented evidence as to the substantiality of copying of the works or that the postings would supplant or serve as a market substitute for the works or the potential market for the works.
<P>

	Courts in two other cases involving the "uploading" or "downloading" of copyrighted materials to and from bulletin board services have held that the activities of the defendants could not be justified on the grounds of fair use.  In <EM>Playboy Enterprises Inc. v. Frena</EM>, 839 F. Supp. 1552 (M.D. Fla. 1993), the court found that the unauthorized downloading of digitized photographic images by BBS subscribers could not constitute a fair use.  It determined that the bulletin board was operated for a commercial purpose; that the photographs were creative works entitled to broad protection; that the photographs constituted an important part of Playboys copyrighted publications; and that unrestricted and widespread conduct of this sort by others would harm the potential market for and the value of the photographs.
<P>

	Similarly, in <EM>Sega Enterprises Ltd. v. MAPHIA</EM>, 857 F. Supp. 679 (N.D. Cal. 1994), the court rejected a fair use defense with respect to the activity of making and distributing copies of copyrighted video games via a bulletin board service.  In issuing a preliminary injunction, the court found that each of the four factors militated against a finding of fair use.  Like the Playboy court, however, the court noted in particular the harm that would result were these activities engaged in on a widespread basis, creating "a substantial and immeasurable adverse effect on the market for Segas copyrighted video game programs."  <EM>Id.</EM> at 688.
<P>

	<STRONG><A NAME="other principles">C.</A>	Other Principles
</STRONG>
<P>

	Even without the existence of a license or a use that qualifies as fair use, some information still can be utilized off of the Internet without running afoul of copyright law.  As noted earlier, for example, much information on the Internet may be in the form of factual databases that are not subject to copyright protection.  In addition, works that are in the public domain, either because the copyright has expired<A HREF="#FOOTNOTE9"><FONT SIZE=-2><SUPER>9</SUPER></FONT></A> or has been abandoned by the copyright holder, are freely available for use.  So are works created by the federal government (such as the White Paper).  See 17 U.S.C.  105.

<CENTER><H3><A NAME="conclusion">VI.</A>  Conclusion</H3></CENTER>

	Despite the dire predictions made by some about the stranglehold copyright law would place on the use of the Internet, the flow of information on the Internet seems to be guided by an implied rule of reason.  In those instances where use of a work "freely available" clearly should not be one "available for free," copyright law firmly protects the rights of copyright holders on the Internet (even if enforcement is sometimes difficult).  In most cases, however, a complex, if somewhat tenuous, tacit and ill-defined, course of conduct has evolved that permits end-users to use copyrighted material in a reasonable way.  Because it is often difficult to reasonably predict what might constitute a reasonable way, end-users will continue to struggle with these issues until Congress or the courts provide firmer guidance.
