<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>With frustrated Americans focusing their anger increasingly  on Washington
and gridlock, many political candidates in 1994  successfully ran against
Washington, appealing to voters to &quot;throw  the bums out&quot; and replace
them with individuals who are more  honest and more devoted to the public
welfare.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One result has been that ideas such as devolution and  federalism, ignored
for decades, are back in the forefront of public  debate. Because Washington is
seen as cumbersome, rigid, and  distant from the people, this Congress has
attempted to give the states  and local governments more autonomy and
responsibility in areas  such as welfare. The assumption is that this will
result in greater  experimentation, increased efficiency, and government that
once again  is closer to the people.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Contract With America emphasized the need for  devolution and a shift of
selected responsibilities from Washington to  state and local governments.
However, although devolution in its  many forms may produce benefits in selected
programs, by itself it  will not address the root cause of the many problems
plaguing  American society. The reason: The source of the problem is not an 
inefficient distribution of functions between the different layers of  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  ernment, to be corrected by
reshuffling. Nor is it bad people  holding public office, or even poorly
designed programs. The  fundamental problem is systemic: The Constitutional
system  established by the Framers has been largely dismantled, releasing 
government, especially the national government, from virtually all  restraint.
Unconstrained government inevitably has swept aside civil  society, replacing it
with political decisionmaking and  bureaucratic administration unaccountable to
the public. Together, these  have created the conditions within which the
economic and social  problems now burdening society have arisen and flourished. 
Encroachment by Washington also has blocked state and local  governments, as
well as civil society, from initiating innovative responses  to those problems.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This has resulted in four dilemmas, all of which require action:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>First,</B> the central purpose of the Constitution  limiting the  power
of government  has been forgotten, and many of the  mechanisms for enforcing
those limits have been dismantled.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second,</B> the states  the key element in the American  constitutional
system  have been stripped of the ability to carry out  their constitutional
responsibility of checking and balancing the  national government, and this has
allowed Washington to assume an  unlimited and unchallengeable role in the
economy, in society, and  in the lives of individuals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third,</B> the resulting centralization of power in Washington and  the
unchecked expansion of its reach have undermined the  institutions of civil
society and thereby severely weakened the ability of  the people to exercise
self-government. Washington has replaced  civil 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  society with bureaucratic
rulemaking and administration  from above, and<B> </B>has<B> </B>made
decisionmaking in all areas of public  and private life more responsive to
political factors  and<B> </B>ideologies than to empirical results and the
preferences of the citizenry. In  addition, centralization has insulated
decisionmaking from  participation by the very people most directly affected by
government  programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Fourth,</B> the federal judiciary has permitted, even mandated,  an
open-ended expansion of power by the national government,  arrogating to itself
the role of legislature of last resort and imposing  a liberal agenda explicitly
and repeatedly rejected by the electorate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The national government's rise to dominance has taken  many years. Some
steps, such as the popular election of Senators,  occurred for entirely
democratic reasons and with full public  support; others, such as the weakening
of the criminal justice system,  were accomplished by sleight of hand and
against solid public  opposition. Taken together, they constitute a virtual
rewriting of the  Constitution, the impact of which has yet to be fully
appreciated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What the Framers Intended</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A fundamental assumption of the Framers of the Constitution  was that the
American people were and would continue to be  largely self-governing, running
their own affairs by means of the  network of social relationships and voluntary
organizations  collectively known as civil society, such as families,
communities,  and churches. Government, especially local government  controlled

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  directly by the community, was
seen as a necessary ally of  civil society. But it was restricted to those
limited functions which  civil society could not easily perform for itself, such
as defense,  the police, and the coining of money. The purpose of government 
was to secure an environment within which free people would  control their own
affairs: in other words, an environment that makes  possible the individual &quot;pursuit
of happiness.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>In writing the Constitution, the Framers had two objectives:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>1)  To correct the failings of the Articles of Confederation,  due
largely to the states' domination of a weak national  government.</B> Thus, a
new national government was created with sufficient  powers to carry out a
limited number of crucial functions, such as  the regulation of international
and interstate commerce, and to  prevent the states from interfering in these
areas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  To limit the power of the new national government.</B>  Having
fought a revolution against what they defined as tyranny   the unchecked
exercise of power, regardless of motive  their  second, and far more important,
objective was to prevent its  reemergence from their own handiwork. They
therefore spent the bulk of  their deliberations on devising ways to limit the
power of the  national government.
</P>
<P>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Trusting neither the written word of the Constitution nor  self-restraint on
the part of officeholders to enforce the necessary  limits, the Framers devised
a complex system of checks and balances  in which various political actors were
placed deliberately in  permanent opposition to one another. This tension was
intended to  ensure that the energies and ambitions of the respective  groups 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  would be directed against one
another, thereby protecting  civil society from unwanted interference. The best
known of these  safeguards  the division of the national government into three 
competing branches: executive, legislative, and judicial  has  proven both
effective and durable despite two centuries of change.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Central Role of Federalism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even more essential to the intent of the Constitution were the  several
checks and balances between the national government and  the states, and the
division of power between them, a wholly new  system which came to be called
federalism. Despite the crucial  role assigned to it, however, federalism
remains widely misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federalism is commonly defined as the division of powers  among the federal,
state, and local governments according to which  performs them best. For
example, the national government has  general responsibility for defense; the
states, for most prisons  and roads; and local governments, for schools. Certain
powers, such  as taxation and the regulation of commerce, are shared. Advocates 
of federalism often assert that this division of powers is more  efficient than
centralizing all functions in Washington, and that  innovative approaches to
problems are more likely to emerge from  the experiments of 50 state governments
than from a monolithic  national bureaucracy. In addition, proponents generally 
emphasize the need to keep government as close to the people as possible  by
keeping its functions at the lowest possible level.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, all of these arguments in favor of federalism are  subsidiary to
its central purpose: limiting the power of government at  all levels. The
national and state governments were intended to  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  strain one another, not to work
hand-in-glove or parcel out  functions to that level of government which will
perform them  best. Thus, the new government was given the power to prevent  the
states from abusing their authority through such actions as  erecting trade
barriers against one another, and national legislation  was given preeminence
over state and local law in those limited  areas reserved to the national
government. In turn, the states were  expected to constrain Washington, as they
were regarded as the  only effective means of doing so.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>So crucial was the role of the states in limiting the  national government's
power that the Framers provided them with  several safeguards, including:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     A direct role</B> in the making of all laws and the
appointment of  all federal officials, including federal judges, through a
Senate  composed of members appointed by the states;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The ability to block</B> all constitutional amendments proposed 
by Congress and to bypass an out-of-touch national government  altogether by
means of a constitutional convention; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     A written guarantee</B> against Washington's assumption of 
additional powers in the form of the blunt and sweeping language  of the Tenth
Amendment, which reserved all powers not delegated  to the national government
by the Constitution either to the states  or to the people.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>How the Safeguards Were Dismantled</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This carefully constructed system remained largely intact for  over 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  100 years; but beginning in the
early part of this century, the  ability of the states to perform their
constitutional role of limiting  the national government has been progressively
reduced to the  point that it has been virtually eliminated.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The process was a lengthy and complex one, but its principal  landmarks
were:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     The ratification in 1913 of the 16th and 17th
Amendments,</B>  which removed key restraints on the national government by
giving  it unlimited taxing authority and by mandating that Senators were  to be
elected by popular vote rather than selected by state  legislatures. As a
result, Washington secured the resources necessary  for an open-ended expansion
of its functions even as the states  were removed from the making of national
policy and eliminated as  the principal bulwark against expansion by the
national government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The national emergencies of the Depression, World War II,  and the
Cold War,</B> which legitimized political forces arguing  for greater power at
the national level to deal with domestic and  international problems. The powers
and functions assumed by  Washington in times of emergency have remained long
after their  original justification has passed. In fact, many of the emergency 
powers of the 1930s were vastly expanded in the 1960s and 1970s in  such
programs as the Great Society and the War on Poverty, each  of which further
increased Washington's power by giving it an  activist leading role in areas of
the economy and society never  before assumed by any level of government.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Beginning in 1937, the Supreme Court's abandonment of its 
traditional role of enforcing limits</B> laid out in the Constitution through  a
series of decisions that have removed virtually all  constitutional 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  restraints on the national
government. The power of the  national government to regulate interstate
commerce, for example, has  been interpreted as being virtually unlimited,
extending to virtually  every area of the economy and society; the Tenth
Amendment,  in effect, has been gutted.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Beginning in the 1950s, in pursuit of what its advocates  have
called a &quot;judicial revolution,&quot;</B> the Supreme Court's radical 
alteration of established interpretations of rights guaranteed by  the
Constitution, with some vastly expanded, others restricted,  and still others
simply invented. This judicial activism has  transformed the Court into an
unelected &quot;super legislature,&quot; effectively  unbound by any restraints.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Judicial Activism</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Judicial activism now extends to all areas of public and private  life
because the Supreme Court and the federal judiciary have  succeeded in granting
themselves virtually unlimited power.  Federal, state, and local laws, duly
enacted by elected officials, have  been struck down; state and local government
functions such as  schools and prisons have been taken over by the federal
courts and  subjected to their increasingly minute direction; and state 
constitutions have been rewritten at will. Referenda passed with  overwhelming
public support are annulled. The courts even order that taxes  be imposed
directly on populations deemed incompetent to  govern themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The courts have engaged in highly subjective and selective  interpretations
of the Constitution, creating rights by locating them  in previously unnoticed &quot;penumbras&quot;
and &quot;invisible radiations&quot;  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  as they ignore other, clearly
expressed constitutional  provisions. This has led to inconsistent and confusing
judicial decisions  with little, if any, basis in the Constitution, or even in
common sense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     The First Amendment's guarantee of &quot;speech&quot;</B>
has been  interpreted to include aggressive panhandling, while the provision 
that Congress &quot;shall make no law respecting an establishment of  religion&quot;
has been interpreted to mean that the Ten  Commandments may not be used in
classrooms but that prisoners demanding  pornography must be accommodated.<A
HREF="ftnt14.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     The Second Amendment</B> is regularly circumscribed with the 
permission of the federal courts despite the fact that it states  explicitly
that &quot;the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not  be
infringed.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     The language of the Tenth Amendment,</B> which states with 
magnificent clarity that &quot;the powers not delegated to the United States  by
the Constitution...are reserved to the States respectively, or to  the people,&quot;
has been dismissed as a mere &quot;truism&quot; with no real  application to the
national government's authority.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>In short, unelected, unrepresentative, and ideologically  driven courts have
dispensed with democratic choice and  constitutional procedure to impose
sweeping changes in the law. Intended as  a clear and agreed-upon set of rules,
the Constitution has become  a document subject to the most arbitrary revision
by the  federal courts.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Thus, the system established by the Framers has largely ceased  to exist. Of
the elaborate restraints they placed on the national  gov
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ernment, virtually none remain
other than those that  Washington chooses to impose on itself. This is not a
subjective judgment:  In recent questioning before the Supreme Court, the
Solicitor  General of the United States was asked to name just one area that
could  be considered beyond the national government's legitimate reach  under
the current interpretation of the Commerce Clause (its  constitutional authority
to regulate interstate commerce in order to  prevent the states from erecting
barriers against one another). He  was unable to provide a single example.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE COST OF RUNAWAY NATIONAL GOVERNMENT</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The central purpose of the Constitution was to ensure that  government
remained limited, but the system established to police  those limits has been
undone. As a direct result:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><CITE><B>-</B></CITE>     Government has expanded its reach
into all areas of American life;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><CITE><B>-</B></CITE>     All major governmental decisionmaking has been
centralized  in Washington; and
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE></B>     A self-governing society has been replaced by
distant,  bureaucratic, and all-powerful government.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Advocates of the concentration of power in Washington  usually have pointed
to some pressing national need for action.  However, the costs associated with
these changes have rarely been  given more than passing consideration. The
centralization of power  in the hands of the national government has exacted a
heavy  economic price, weakened the democratic process, and helped to  undermine
civil society.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>I. The</B> <B>High Cost to Taxpayers</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Calculating the economic costs stemming from the demise of  federalism and
the expansion of the national government is  difficult, if only because of the
enormity of the task. These costs  include reduced economic growth for the
nation as a whole through  heavy taxation, burdensome regulation of businesses,
and the  skewed investment of resources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     As programs have expanded to cover all areas of
national life,  the federal budget has grown commensurately, both in terms of 
taxpayer dollars and as a percentage of the national economy.  In 1934, the
national government accounted for 10 percent of  gross domestic product (GDP).
In 1948, it was still only 12 percent.  By 1960, however, it had ballooned to 18
percent, and by 1994, to  22 percent.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The tax burden also has necessarily expanded. In 1914, the 
first year of the federal income tax, Americans making from $4,000  to $20,000
were taxed 1 percent of their incomes. The rate  gradually increased to 7
percent for Americans making over $500,000.  Because those making over $4,000 in
1914 accounted for less than  1 percent of the population, the average family
paid no income  tax. Even by 1950, following the expansion of the national 
government during and after the New Deal, the average American family  with two
children paid only 3 percent of its income to the federal  government. In 1994,
federal taxes accounted for 24 percent of a  typical family's income.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Though taxation has increased dramatically since World War 
II, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  spending has grown even faster. A
1991 study prepared for  the Joint Economic Committee found that for every $1
increase  in taxes since the end of World War II, expenditures have  grown
$1.59. The national debt now stands at $4.9 trillion,  representing more than
$18,500 for every man, woman, and child in the  country  an obligation that will
be paid by every individual and  family through higher taxes and lower living
standards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Roughly one-third of the average family's income tax today  is
used merely to pay interest on the national debt, a significant  reduction in
standard of living for which that family receives no  benefits. Much of this
debt and tax burden is used to subsidize  special interests with political clout
in Washington, from millionaire  peanut farmers to the affluent elderly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     By contrast, 49 of the 50 states are required to balance their
 budgets every year, making the perennial accumulation of debt  difficult if not
impossible. Although all opinion polls show that there  is overwhelming public
support for a balanced budget amendment  to the Constitution, every attempt to
have Congress pass the  measure has failed. Powerful special interests lobby
behind closed  doors against any proposal which would force Washington to cut 
spending, and the government continues to borrow money and  obligate future
generations for its repayment.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Overregulation</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>An enormous regulatory bureaucracy has been created in  Washington to
oversee every area of public and private life.  Although the public manifests
high levels of support for many  regulatory objectives, such as clean air and
water, access for the disabled,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  other social goals, one reason
for this popularity is that these  goals are commonly portrayed as having little
or no economic cost,  at least for the average citizen. The reach and
inflexibility of  the regulatory agencies lead to frequent absurdities.

burdensome. The costs are substantial and fall not  just on state and local
governments, but also on private businesses  and individuals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Federal mandates are requirements laid down by  Washington, through
legislation, executive regulation or order, or judicial  fiat, which force state
and local governments to undertake certain  programs or provide certain services
at their own cost.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The National Conference of State Legislatures
(NCSL) has  identified 192 unfunded mandates on the states, including  Medicaid,
regulations governing the use of underground storage tanks,  the Clean Water
Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource  Conservation and Recovery Act, the Safe
Drinking Water Act, requirements  to remove lead paint and asbestos from schools
and other areas,  the Endangered Species Act, the Americans with Disabilities
Act,  and the Fair Labor Standards Act, to name only a few.

Emergency Response Act of 1986 had totaled $6 billion in the  five years since
the Act was passed. Estimates of the cost of full  compliance for all schools
reach $200 billion. These costs are  mandated in spite of mounting evidence that
asbestos removal  programs actually may increase the exposure of children to
asbestos.

<P><B>*</B>     Even though immigration is solely the responsibility of the 
national government, extensive judicial and legislative  mandates require states
and local governments to provide services to  illegal immigrants. The current
data are inconclusive on whether  illegal immigrants are a drain or benefit to
the economy as a whole,  but federal mandates that require the states to provide
 education, health services, and other services to illegal aliens still cost 
the states billions each year. The cost of incarcerating prisoners is 
especially burdensome. For the seven states most affected by  illegal
immigration (Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, New  Jersey, New York, and
Texas), the Urban Institute estimates that,  even 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  after accounting for tax revenues
paid by working illegal  immigrants, net costs of services provided to illegal
aliens in 1992  alone totaled nearly $3 billion. And this is a low estimate. The
 California Office of Planning and Research estimated in 1994 that  illegal
aliens would cost the state a net $3.4 billion in FY  1994-1995.<A

Washington.

<P><B>II. The High Cost to Democracy</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>More difficult to calculate, but nevertheless far-reaching, are  the high
costs to democracy that stem from the demise of  federalism. An oft-repeated
description of the American system of  government is that it is a &quot;government
of laws, not of men,&quot; meaning that  the rules which govern society are
openly formulated, apply equally  to all, and are reliably stable over time.
Laws are made by  citizens and their elected representatives; they are not
supposed to be  subject to the whims of individuals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, this characterization is no longer accurate. Even as  federal power
over the economy, society, and all facets of  public policy has grown, the
concentration of decisionmaking in  Washington has radically reduced the ability
of the public to affect  it. Whereas the American people once were described
routinely  as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  self-governing and self-reliant,
it is now virtually impossible  for individuals or communities to influence the
decisions which  directly affect them. Distant rule-making bureaucracies are 
immune from local pressure; Congress is overrun with powerful and  well-heeled
interest groups; and enormous coalitions of citizens  are required to get even
rudimentary attention from Washington.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As local and state governments have been reduced increasingly  to the role
of implementing federal decisions, elections for them  have lost most of their
importance. Regardless of who holds office,  and regardless of the electorate's
intentions when electing these  officials, Washington need pay attention to none
of them as it  imposes programs on state and local governments. Governor Ben 
Nelson (D-NE) has said that he often feels he is merely an  administrator for
the federal government, and Governor Michael Leavitt  (R-UT) has noted that his
constituents, when referring to government,  now think almost exclusively in
terms of Washington, not state or  local government. National elections, in
turn, are not about  individual issues, but about large combinations of them,
with the  individual voter unable to register his preferences. And each voter's 
choice must compete with those of 100 million others. With their  votes meaning
so little in terms of how decisions are made, it is not  surprising that the
percentage of the electorate which goes to the  polls has declined steadily over
decades.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the power of citizens has declined, however, that of  certain individuals
has grown. Committee chairmen in the House and  Senate, unelected staff, obscure
bureaucrats, and federal judges  wield vast powers which are often exercised out
of the public's  eye. Hundreds of bills with thousands of prescriptions,
allotments,  and prohibitions are passed each year, often with Members of  Con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  gress having only the haziest of
ideas about their content. An  endless stream of special interests brings
enormous financial and  organizational capacities to bear on Congress and the
executive  branch  often to secure enactment of agendas these interests know 
the public would not support if given the opportunity to decide  for themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Untethered Judiciary</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even if elected officials could be made more responsive to  the public's
preferences, however, they would remain subject to  the unelected judges of the
federal courts. The Supreme Court and  the federal judiciary as a whole have
arrogated to themselves a  dominant role in every public and private institution
in society.  Federal judges have taken charge of wide areas of state and local 
jurisdiction and imposed on them their own dictates, from which there  is little
appeal. Individual judges overturn and rewrite laws,  suspend whole sections of
state constitutions, impose detailed  mandates, order actions by officials at
all levels, and even mandate the  imposition of taxes on populations which
refuse to vote for them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No area of American life can escape detailed examination and  reconstruction
by the Supreme Court. Members of the Court  are bound by little but their own
self-restraint. Cynics often say  that the Constitution is whatever the Supreme
Court says it is. In  fact, no less an authority than Chief Justice Charles
Evans  Hughes stated in a 1907 speech: &quot;We are under a Constitution, but 
the Constitution is what the judges say it is.&quot;  But the reality is  even
worse: It is whatever any five of the Court's nine justices say it  is. A 5 to 4
decision one day can be abruptly reversed the next;  what was once legal may
become illegal, and vice versa;  wrenching 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  changes can be produced by the
replacement of a single  individual on the Court, or even by a change of opinion
by any one of  the justices, regardless of the language of the Constitution or
the  preferences of the public.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Long-established rights may be cast aside, while newly  mined ones are put
in their place. No law, constitutional provision,  popular referendum, community
standard, or tradition, regardless of  its support among the people or their
elected officials, has any  meaning or standing other than that which the
federal courts choose  to give it. All may be set aside, and the public has no
recourse. It  is for this reason that the once-routine confirmations of  Supreme
Court justices have become brutal political contests.

<P><B>III. The High Costs to Civil Society</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Of all the costs produced by the demise of federalism, the  greatest have
been those associated with the breakdown of civil society:  the individuals,
families, communities, and voluntary  organizations and institutions which
together enable individuals to control  the environment in which they, their
families, and their  communities live and operate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For the Framers, the purpose of government was to establish  and secure the
general environment within which civil society  could operate essentially
unmolested. Within this environment, the  array of social institutions would
regulate the public aspects of the  community and intrude in the lives of
individuals and families as  little as possible. Government, especially local
government  controlled by the adult citizenry, was essential to maintaining this
order,  but only if its power was limited to narrow purposes. It was well 
understood that the more distant the government, the less control  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  citizens would have over its
actions, and thus the more damage  it could do.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Once the national government had freed itself from its  constitutional
restraints, however, its rapid expansion inevitably  undermined civil society,
because the purpose of expanded  government is to substitute itself for civil
society. The national government,  in centralizing power, inevitably has taken
control away from  citizens and communities and replaced it with  political
decisionmaking and bureaucratic administration. It also has  forcibly replaced
civil society's home-grown workings with its  own political and bureaucratic
vision of how society should be  structured and run, and with devastating costs.
Unconstrained  government and civil society cannot coexist; their respective 
resources are too unequal to permit competition. When government  expands,
society must retreat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The result has been a broad decline in civilized life, especially  in the
nation's cities where government activism has been  greatest. Among the results:
vastly increased crime and violence, a  breakdown of public order, a decline in
community life, erosion of  the family, the rise of illegitimacy, and the
pervasive mediocrity  of public education, among other ills.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Social scientists profess bafflement at the emergence and  continuation of
these developments. Among the most common  explanations: America is an
inherently violent society, there has been  a &quot;war on the poor&quot;
stemming from hard-hearted budget cutters,  or endemic racism prevents progress.
The true source, however,  can be located directly in the engineered demise of
civil society and  its replacement by the federal government. Individuals,
families,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  communities have been stripped of
the ability to control  either their environment or the behavior of individuals
within it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>The Rise in Crime</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The rate of violent crime in the U.S. has risen dramatically   over 400
percent since the late 1950s. Some of this is attributable to  the increase in
the population aged 15-30, the age group  responsible for the vast majority of
felonies. But if demographics were the  sole factor, the rate should have
plummeted in the 1980s along  with this segment's share of the population. It
did not, and other  countries with similar demographics did not experience the
same rise  in crime. Liberals claim the reason is widespread availability of 
guns in the United States, but gun ownership has been common in  the United
States since the country's inception. Moreover, other  societies, such as
peaceable Switzerland, that actually require all  able-bodied men to maintain
guns in their homes experience no  upsurge in drive-by shootings. Why, then, the
vast and rapid increase in  the rate of violent crime in the U.S. and its
continuance at such  high levels?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two reasons. One is the breakdown in family structure  in America 
itself exacerbated by federal policies (see Chapter  6). The other is the
Supreme Court's radical reconstruction of  the criminal justice system in the
U.S., an all-embracing  exercise weighted consistently toward restricting the
policing power  of communities. Beginning in the 1960s, federal courts began 
viewing law enforcement, rather than criminals, as the principal  threat to
public safety and set out to restrict the power of police to  arrest criminals,
the ability of the judicial system to convict them,  and the right of society to
put and keep them behind bars. The  courts 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  vastly expanded, and even
invented, rights for criminals which,  if not actually written in the
Constitution, were held by the courts  to be &quot;inspired&quot; by its &quot;penumbras.&quot;
 However lofty this  solicitude for the rights of criminals may be, its
real-world impact has  been to create an America much more dangerous and violent
for  law-abiding citizens.<A HREF="ftnt14.htm#12">12</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To curb alleged coercion of defendants, the Supreme Court  has virtually
eliminated the ability of state and federal prosecutors  to use confessions by
the accused as evidence. In the mid-1960s,  with the Court's imposition of
arbitrarily detailed procedures for  arrest and investigation, the rate of
solved crimes plummeted  virtually overnight from the level of 70 percent in the
1950s to 40  percent, and hundreds of thousands of felons were never prosecuted 
even though ample evidence was available. In addition, severe  restrictions have
been placed on the collection of evidence; trials  increasingly focus not on the
defendant's innocence or guilt, but  on whether the police have adhered
sufficiently to procedural  minutiae.

<P><B>*</B>     In 1983, the Justice Department estimated that up to 55,000 
serious criminal cases are dropped every year because  exclusionary rule
restrictions eliminate the evidence needed for prosecution.  By 1992, an
independent report concluded that the number had  grown to 120,000, including
30,000 violent crimes and 90,000  serious property crimes. This figure does not
include either the tens  of thousands of crimes that could have been prevented
or the  cases that never came to trial because police are effectively 
prohibited from gathering evidence and questioning suspects regarding  these
crimes.<A HREF="ftnt14.htm#15">15</A>
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The results of these and many other innovations have been  nothing short of
disastrous: the release of criminals, plea-bargaining  down to less serious
charges, or  increasingly  no prosecution at  all. As the risk of punishment for
crimes of all types has been  reduced, so has the value of punishment as a
deterrent.

</P>
<P>The death penalty was abolished by the Supreme Court in  1972, despite
widespread public support. Although partially reinstated  in 1976, it remains
exceedingly difficult to use, even when  requested by the convict himself.

William Brennan stated  that he believed it to be unconstitutional and
prohibited &quot;under all  circumstances.&quot;<A
HREF="ftnt14.htm#16">16</A>  A death penalty which everyone
knows  almost certainly will not be carried out is no deterrent.

<P>
</P>
<P>The federal bench also has intervened to change the way  states deal with
felons convicted of crimes and sentenced to  prison terms. In state after state,
entire prison systems have been  taken over by the federal courts. Ostensibly to
eliminate  &quot;overcrowding,&quot; tens of thousands of prisoners have been
released onto  the streets. But &quot;overcrowding&quot; has never been
consistently  defined, so each judge is free to define it for himself on an
entirely  subjective basis. To several judges, therefore, it means not groups 
of prisoners crammed into single cells, but simply more than  one prisoner to a
cell, however large. Some federal judges even  refuse to allow convicted felons
to be sent to prison in the first place  because of &quot;overcrowding&quot; and
simply release them, even those  convicted of violent crimes and repeat
offenders. These released  felons have been responsible for tens of thousands of
additional  violent crimes.

<P><B>The Obsession with Prisoners' Rights </B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The federal courts have demonstrated an amazing solicitude  for the small
minority of felons who actually reach prison, being  especially attentive to
suits claiming violations of the  Eighth Amendment's prohibition of &quot;cruel
and unusual punishment.&quot;   To help prisoners develop and file these claims,
the federal  courts have ruled that prisoners must be provided with 
state-of-the-art law libraries in their prisons, and even with law clerks. 
Arizona Attorney General Grant Woods has said that the law libraries  in state
prisons are equipped with better services and resources  than those in his own
office.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As a result, the number of suits by prisoners claiming violations  of
constitutional rights has exploded in recent decades.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1966, prisoners brought 218 suits in federal court for  alleged
constitutional violations in state and federal prisons. In 1993,  prisoners
filed over 53,000 suits, primarily against state prisons,  representing 25
percent of all cases handled in federal courts and  7,000 more suits than the
federal government itself filed against  criminals. Most of this litigation is
frivolous  inmates have sued,  for example, because they were given creamy
instead of chunky  peanut butter, were denied breast implants at public expense,
or  did not like the color of their cells  and ultimately are dismissed  by the
courts. But the cost to the taxpayers is still heavy, as the  state must treat
each case seriously lest it be lost by default.  Generally, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  prisoners pay no fees, claiming
indigent status.

<P>Keith Poladian, an inmate in New York's Auburn state  prison, brought suit
on Eighth Amendment grounds against the state's  use of razor wire on fences

gives us a way to  be heard.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt14.htm#19">19</A>

<P>
</P>
<P>It is little wonder that most criminals show a psychology of  denial for
their criminal actions. Nevada Deputy Attorney General  Anne Cathcart says
criminals &quot;come into prison denying any  wrongdoing, and they are
constantly presented with further reasons  to blame others. Unlimited access to
federal courts gives them  an added tool to vent their anger and rebel against
the system.&quot;   But that is only one element. The total effect of the
federal courts  on the criminal justice system has been staggering. Thanks to a 
succession of messages to the potential felon  you won't be  arrested, you won't
be convicted, your sentence will be cut short,  prison isn't really so bad, and
your rights in prison are superior to  those of the administration, for example 
deterrence has been all  but destroyed. Even violent felons remain on the
streets, free to  commit crimes. Far from having a mysterious source, the 
enormous upsurge in crime was all but inevitable.

mentally ill or  drug-dependent and unable to care for themselves. The advent of
drugs in  the 1950s and 1960s led to the widespread closing of institutions

eliminated most of the need for institutionalization. At the  same time, in

eliminated much of the housing space available  to the very poor. Much of this
lost housing has been replaced by  shelters and other facilities, but many of

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has a mixed record, at best, in the  area of
reducing the power of the federal government and  devolving power back to the
states. Clinton has assisted states in  accelerating the waiver process whereby
state welfare and health care  agencies can receive exemptions from a host of
federal requirements as  they attempt novel approaches to welfare and health
care reforms.  Unfortunately, most governors are still frustrated at the slow 
granting of waivers by the Administration and many believe the entire  process
is flawed in that they are seeking exemptions from  federal 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  laws they believe to be an
encroachment on state prerogatives.  For instance, the Clinton Administration's
proposal in 1994 to  revamp the nation's health care system envisioned a
diminishing role  for the states, which would merely administer a national
system  created and directed from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In areas such as environmental protection and federal  land-use policy, the
Clinton Administration has continued to support  a growing federal role and has
resisted attempts by the states to  devolve powers back to them. For instance,
this is most  evident among Western states, where Interior Secretary Bruce
Babbitt  has been promoting an overarching policy of environmental  protection
that dramatically increases the power of the federal government  in land-use
policy in federal, state-owned, and private lands. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To the extent the Administration has even focused on federalism  it has
missed the true meaning of the word. For instance, Vice  President Al Gore's
calls for a &quot;New Federalism&quot;are embodied in  his efforts to streamline
and reinvent the federal government  through its National Performance Review.
Regardless of the merits of  the National Performance Review  which attempts to
make the  federal government more efficient through downsizing and 
restructuring  it has had little if anything to do with reestablishing a 
balance between the state and federal governments. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress has taken important first steps in the areas  of
devolution, federalism, and the restoration of constitutional  government. Under
the Contract With America, it passed  legislation that turns over most
responsibility for welfare to the states  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  allows them more flexibility and
authority in the administration  of welfare programs. Even more important, it
has put the country  on course for a balanced budget in seven years. While not
strictly  an issue of federalism, bringing spending under control is a 
prerequisite both for reimposing limits on government's ambitions and  for
rebuilding civil society. The federal government also has agreed  to reimburse
the states for part of the education, health care,  and other costs associated
with the incarceration of illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In addition, a number of pending bills and resolutions are  designed to make
the federal government more responsive to its  constitutional limits. These
include requiring Congress to cite its  constitutional authority for each piece
of legislation, restricting the  ability of the federal judiciary to take over
state administrative  functions, and eliminating agencies of the federal
government which  exercise &quot;powers not delegated to the United States by
the  Constitution,&quot; among other proposals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Correcting the many problems confronting American society  will involve more
than isolated reforms; a lasting solution will  require dealing with their root
causes, especially the federal  government's crushing impact on civil society.
This means more than  merely resurrecting the past. Too much has changed to
permit a  simple repeal of the many constitutional innovations of the preceding 
decades, and powerful and well-entrenched groups with  economic, political, and
ideological interests at stake are certain to resist  any change which
diminishes the power of Washington to reward  them from the public treasury and
impose their agendas on the rest  of 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  the country. Instead, new
approaches must be developed that  draw on the lessons learned in this century
about Washington's ability  to free itself, Houdini-like, from almost any
constraint.
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Devolve power to the states by returning taxes, not
just programs.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Contract With America has taken the essential first step  in reversing
the trend toward centralization of power in  Washington by curtailing some
entitlements and allowing states greater  discretion over welfare and other
programs, but several additional  measures are needed to ensure its success.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Under current plans, the principal funding for programs  devolved to the
states will continue to be through block grants from  Washington. Although the
states gain flexibility, this formula  undermines accountability because the
federal government collects  the money but state and local governments spend it.
As a result,  the public is less able to connect the collection of taxes with
the  provision of services, and neither level of government has  sufficient
incentive to ensure that the money is spent wisely and frugally.  A far better
approach would be for Washington to bow out of  the picture entirely and return
the money to the people in the form of  a tax cut. The states could collect the
taxes themselves   and thereby assure a direct connection between taxes and
services   or allow individuals to retain the money for their own use. If this 
is not done, the likely consequence is that rising budgetary  pressures will
lead Washington simply to maintain current federal  requirements on the states
to deliver services while cutting back on  the federal grants to fund them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal argument for continuing a federal role in these  programs is
that it assures equality of treatment for recipients,  regard
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  less of whether they live in
high-income or low-income  states. This argument is based on a misunderstanding
of the actual  impact of federal spending. Federal funding for individual
programs  often does vary widely from state to state, but those variations 
largely disappear when a broader range of programs is considered.  For example,
if responsibility for the more than 70 programs that  comprise federal welfare
spending was turned over to the states  along with a broad reduction in the
federal income tax, only a few  states would be adversely affected, and none by
more than 5 percent  of current revenue. And this does not take into account
money  that states could save by providing services more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It is also important for candidates to stress that devolution is  not
necessarily federalism. While state-friendly legislation passed  by Congress is
a marked improvement over past practice, the  current debate and decisionmaking
on devolution have been  conducted almost entirely from Washington's point of
view. The programs  to be transferred will continue to be subject to conditions
imposed  by the federal government, which can change them unilaterally at  its
discretion to suit its own needs. And Washington will retain  the ability to
reverse or modify its grant at any time. Devolution  is evidence not that
Washington has been restrained, but merely  that it has changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Hold a constitutional convention on federalism.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Calling a convention to propose amendments to the Constitution  is the route
most favored by those who seek a quick and  comprehensive solution to the
problem of Washington's overreaching.  Two-thirds of the state legislatures may
call a constitutional  convention by petitioning Congress to do so, a provision
the Framers  included 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  both to deny Congress a monopoly
on proposing amendments  and to prevent it from insulating itself from the
public will.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In the two centuries since the Constitution's adoption, there  have been
several efforts to call a convention. The most notable  attempts in recent
decades include an effort in the 1960s to  overturn the Supreme Court's revision
of state constitutions regarding  the structure of state legislatures and
several efforts concerning a  balanced budget amendment, the most successful of
which reached  32 states by 1983.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal reason these and other efforts have not succeeded  is fear
that a &quot;runaway&quot; convention might lead to an extensive  rewriting of
the Constitution. But opponents generally do not  take into account the fact
that any amendment proposed by a  convention is exactly that: merely a proposal.
To become part of the  Constitution, it must be ratified by the same
three-fourths of the  state legislatures required for the approval of any
amendment put  forth by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents also ignore the fact that, in effect, two permanent 
constitutional conventions already exist: Congress, which can  propose an
amendment on any subject at any time, and the Supreme  Court. Although the Court
technically has no role in the amending  process, its rulings repeatedly have
had the same effect, adding  and deleting sections as the justices see fit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opposing a convention called by the states merely ensures  that Congress and
the Supreme Court  and thus Washington   retain their monopoly on changing the
Constitution while denying  the states and citizens any real opportunity to
participate. This  position 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  is understandable in those who
wish to keep power centralized  in Washington but somewhat perplexing when held
by  conservatives and others who profess a desire to restrict the federal 
government. Given the opposition, however, calls for a constitutional 
convention are not likely to be successful without considerable  public
education.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Revive the Tenth Amendment.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Efforts to revive the Tenth Amendment occupy a special place  in the
movement to restore federalism. The Tenth Amendment is  the &quot;federalism
amendment,&quot; a written contractual guarantee  against the expansion of
federal power. It has not performed as  intended because the political and other
mechanisms designed to make  it effective have been removed and because the
Supreme Court  has been allowed to render it null and void.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Indications that the Supreme Court may revive the Amendment,  at least in a
limited fashion, are easily exaggerated. In a  recent case,<A
HREF="ftnt14.htm#22">22</A> the Supreme Court made headlines
by ruling that the  states cannot always be used as simple administrative arms
of the  federal government. This was the first time in six decades that the 
Tenth Amendment had been used to restrict federal power, but even  this
vestigial application was decided by a very narrow majority (5  to 4) and can be
reversed at any time.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A grass-roots movement to revive the Tenth Amendment has  been gathering
strength. Several state legislatures have passed  resolutions stating their view
that the Amendment remains fully in  effect, with several going further to
demand that the federal  govern
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  ment abide by its provisions.
However, this has occurred in  a largely uncoordinated and low-key manner, and
little  political pressure has been brought to bear on Washington.

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Implement federalism legislation.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Though Congress has been an egregious violator of federalism,  it also has
the power to reverse its own excesses and curb those  of the executive and
judicial branches as well. The most  prominent effort in this regard is the
Contract With America's commitment  to returning to the states many functions
now performed by the  federal government, such as the primary responsibility for
 welfare. Efforts in other, more specific areas need to be made as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Unwilling to part with its own money, Congress often has  resorted to
requiring state and local governments to pay for programs  that Washington
enacts and for which it takes the credit. Faced with  a growing revolt in the
states because of the unsustainable  burden these mandates impose on state
budgets, Congress in 1994  passed the Unfunded Mandates Act, advertised as
largely solving  the problem. However, the scope of the Act is very limited, 
covering only new mandates while leaving the truly burdensome  existing ones in
place. More important, the legislation puts no real  restraints on Congress at
all, as it requires Congress merely to  label an unfunded mandate as such before
enactment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As pressures on the federal budget increase, Congress may  be tempted to use
unfunded mandates to transfer responsibilities  for certain programs to the
states while keeping all or most of  the funding in Washington to balance the
federal books. States  and local communities need to close this gaping loophole
before  Con

<P>Among the actions the next Congress should take:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Restore constitutional authority.</B> At present,
Congress may  legislate on virtually any subject it chooses, regardless of  the
Constitution's actual provisions. Legislation sponsored by  Senator Spencer
Abraham (R-MI) and Representative John Shadegg  (R-AZ) seeks to restrict this
unlimited power by requiring that  each bill specifically cite Congress's
constitutional authority to act  in the affected area, including grants of
authority to the  executive branch. Although the bill might not prevent Congress
from  simply making up whatever constitutional authority seemed convenient  at
the time, the requirement that it do so publicly and on the  record might have a
restraining effect.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Curb the federal judiciary.</B> Article III of the Constitution 
gives Congress virtually unlimited power to regulate the federal  judiciary
through legislation; Congress should use this power to  limit the abuses of the
federal courts. Areas of possible  congressional action include, among others,
limiting the ability of federal  courts to force state and local governments
into burdensome and  open-ended consent decrees; restricting the ability of the
federal  courts to take over state and local administrative functions for
decades  at a time; directing that the measures federal courts impose to 
rectify problems at the state and local levels be appropriate to the  specific
situation; limiting the federal courts' appellate review power  in order to help
restore the autonomy of the individual states as  originally guaranteed by the
Constitution; and prohibiting courts  from ordering the imposition of taxes.

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Propose constitutional amendments through Congress.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since it is unlikely that a constitutional convention will be  called within
the next few years, Members of Congress should  propose several amendments that
can be presented to the states for  debate and ratification. The following are
among the measures needed  to restore a balance between the state and federal
governments:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     A balanced budget amendment.</B> The last proposal
for a  balanced budget amendment passed the House but failed by one vote  to
achieve the necessary two-thirds majority in the Senate. Passage  of such an
amendment must remain one of the highest priorities  for the 104th Congress or
its successors.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     A &quot;states' veto&quot; amendment.</B> There are several
versions of  amendments which would allow a majority of the state legislatures 
to veto or recommit federal legislation. Governor George Allen  (R-VA) has
proposed a measure that gives that power to a simple  majority of the state
legislatures; other versions would require  a supermajority or merely request
that Congress reconsider the  subject legislation or regulation. Restoring to
states the ability  to block the most objectionable national legislation would
help  reduce some of the blatant disregard for state and local interests  that
has characterized Washington for so long.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     An amendment to allow states to propose amendments.</B> Under  the
amending formulas of Article V, the states may not propose  constitutional
amendments except by calling a constitutional  convention. Since there are a
host of perceived and real dangers in calling  such a convention, this route has
proven unusable, and Congress  retains 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  its monopoly on proposing
amendments to the Constitution.  However, amending Article V to allow the states
to propose  amendments without calling a convention, but subject to a 
congressional veto on such amendments, could overcome this obstacle.  Amendments
approved by Congress would be reintroduced in the  states for the three-fourths
approval needed to adopt an amendment  to the Constitution.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Support collective state action.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal factor in the demise of federalism and the growth  of
government in Washington is the undermining of the states'  ability to act as a
counterweight to the national government. The  states have been reduced to
subservience for so long that most have  lost the incentive to challenge
Washington and concentrate instead  on lobbying for better treatment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The principal problem confronting the states is fragmentation: 
Individually, states cannot have much influence in Washington;  only by
combining their efforts can they bring to bear the political  pressure needed to
deal with Washington as equals.  Unfortunately, however, the existing
organizations that serve state officials,  such as the National Governors'
Association (NGA), have not  succeeded in promoting an independent and effective
voice.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A number of efforts in this area have been made in recent  years, the most
notable being the Conference of the States. Initiated  by Governors Mike Leavitt
(R-UT) and Ben Nelson (D-NE) in  1994 and joined by the NGA and other
organizations, along with  scores of state officials, the COS was designed to
create a process  by which the states could meet, discuss their common problems 
and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->  recommended solutions, and bring
their collective influence  to bear on Washington.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For many reasons, the COS was not able to achieve the goals  it laid out for
itself, but some similar effort would prove to be  invaluable to the states in
their dealings with Washington.  Among the possible steps:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Suits against the federal government.</B> Several
states have  initiated or are contemplating suits against the federal government
 for abuse of its authority, especially on Tenth Amendment  grounds. Arizona
leads this effort; the legislature voted in 1994 to  establish a Constitutional
Defense Council and appropriated $1 million  for this purpose.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Mandates recall.</B> Beginning with Alabama in 1992, a number  of
state legislatures have established annual meetings between  themselves and
members of their congressional delegations to  review the latter's votes on
unfunded federal mandates. Although  the states cannot compel attendance or
attentiveness, there is a  certain political cost for those who simply ignore
such requests, and  the meetings do provide a way for both sides to air their 
respective concerns.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Far more should be done to reconnect the state legislatures to  the making
of national policy. It once was common for state  legislatures to instruct their
representatives in Washington on how to  vote on particular issues, even if the
latter chose to ignore them.  On issues which affect a state, its legislature
certainly has at least  as much claim to represent the interests of the people
as does  any federal representative, and it should not hesitate to make its 
views 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 -->  known.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Term limits.</B> An additional area for emphasis is imposing  term
limits on federal officials, the theory being that a guaranteed  turnover will
reduce the opportunities for elected officials to  insulate themselves from the
voters and guarantee a continuing infusion  of individuals who are closer to the
people. Term limits by  themselves, however, will neither constrain Washington's
power  nor erect a permanent barrier to activism, even on the part of 
short-termers. More important, the Supreme Court has ruled that  the people have
no right to impose term limits on federal officials,  and proponents are now
seeking other ways  including a  constitutional amendment  to advance this
objective.(See table below)

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 48 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q.What is the difference between devolution and federalism  and can they
contradict one another?  
</B></P>
<P><B>A.</B> Devolution legislation in Congress has dealt primarily  with
granting greater flexibility and decision-making authority to  state and local
governments in specific programs such as welfare.  Federalism, in contrast, is
concerned with the structure of  government as a whole and deals with the proper
balance that should exist  between the state governments and the national
government as  outlined in the U.S. Constitution. Current efforts to devolve 
selected powers from Washington to the states, however beneficial,  will have
only a small impact on the balance of power between  the federal and state
governments; Washington's primacy will  remain largely unaltered. For example,
the debate and  decision-making regarding devolution have been almost entirely
the product of  the Congress; state and local officials have played only 
secondary roles. As a result, the design and extent of the affected  programs
reflect Washington's preferences far more than those of the  states, and even
the devolved responsibilities remain subject to  unilateral revision by the
federal government. Devolution concerns the  reapportioning between the federal
and state governments of the  responsibility for current programs; federalism
addresses the  means by which Washington and the states can be made to limit 
each other's power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are there issues too important to entrust to state governments?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The domination of the national government by the states  under
the Articles of Confederation produced such chaos that the  Framers of the
Constitution sought to permanently redress the  balance. As a result, the
Constitution lists several powers reserved to  the national government and makes
its laws superior to those of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  states in these areas. That grant
of power, however, is strictly  limited. The Constitution specifies procedures
for amending the  document to alter that list should a sufficient majority of
the  country desire it, but it does not sanction federal action simply because 
it may be efficient or expedient. Under the system established by  the Founders,
state governments and the national government were  to have distinct and limited
powers in order to serve as a check  on one another.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The presumption throughout much of this century, however,  has been that the
national government is progressive and the  states regressive, and therefore
that progress requires a centralization  of power in Washington. Once achieved,
however, the result has  been not only to shift most decision-making to the
federal  government, but to make possible the vast expansion of government 
throughout every area of society, with decidedly negative results.  Whatever the
past failings of the states, they pale in comparison with  those of the federal
government. Federalism is not based on the  assumption that one level of
government is necessarily better than  another; instead, it holds that limited,
constitutional government  is the goal and that the different levels are needed
to restrain  one another.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Q. If states assume more power under a reinvigorated  federalism, how will
civil rights be protected?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A. A reinvigorated federalism would not reduce the power of  the federal
government to protect the civil rights guaranteed by  the Constitution. The Bill
of Rights, and especially the Fourteenth  and Fifteenth Amendments, provide the
federal government with  sufficient powers to enforce the civil rights of all
Americans. In  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  past, the political will to
exercise these powers was often  lacking, a failing which has been more than
made up for over the past  four decades. Nevertheless, advocates of an activist
federal  judiciary often cite the need for an unelected protector of civil
rights  to guard minorities against the inevitable abuses of the  majority.
However, the contempt for the citizenry this attitude is based on  is wholly
contradictory to the theory of the American  government &quot;which rests on the
consent of the governed.&quot;  The  assumption must be that the majority wants
the rights of minorities (of  which everyone is a member of at least one) to be
fully guaranteed,  and for this reason has brought into being a Constitution
which has  that objective as one its principal goals. To assume that the purpose
 of government is to override and suppress the desires of a  thuggish and
intolerant majority is to believe that self-government is  an impossibility.

<P>Q. Isn't the U.S. economy becoming so sophisticated that a  national
economic and regulatory regime is needed to maintain  competition in the global
economy? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A. Taken to its logical conclusion, this approach would argue  for the
superiority of international regulation over national  regulation. However, one
of the most important phenomena of the last  quarter of the 20th century is the
widespread realization that the costs  of governmental control over the economy
greatly exceed its  benefits. Communist economies have collapsed; socialist and 
heavily regulated economies have stagnated; and free-market  economies
increasingly have demonstrated the benefits of reducing the role  of the state
through such measures as privatization and the  lowering of trade barriers.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To this has been added the new pressures and opportunities of  the emerging
global economy, which is rapidly undermining the  idea of separate national
economies. This new economy places an  emphasis on flexibility and the ability
to adapt quickly to  changing economic and commercial realities. Slumbering
central  governments are proving to be grossly inadequate to such a challenge. 
A renewal of federalism would not replace Washington's  regulation with that of
the states as much as it would allow the latter to  experiment with policies
that are more conducive to  economic growth. Every state would have an interest
in promoting its  own economic growth, and competition between them would 
ensure that only the most beneficial policies survived. The federal  government
would continue to exercise its crucial function of  preventing the states from
erecting their own barriers against one another.  The overall limitations on
government at all levels that this  system would encourage would ensure a more
positive environment  for economic growth.

<B>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration came into office with a widely  recognized lack
of experience in defense and foreign policy. But  the new President did not take
the necessary steps to correct this  deficiency. The new Commander in Chief,
already suspect in the  national security community for his history of draft
avoidance  during the Vietnam War, made decisions which reinforced his image as 
a President out of touch with the military services and inattentive  to foreign
policy and national security issues. His flip-flops on  Haiti, Cuba, China, and
Bosnia weakened American credibility  abroad and created doubts around the world
about U.S. leadership.  Moreover, the Clinton Administration has presided over a period of neglect  and decline of
U.S. military strength. The Administration's series  of missteps amounts to
little more than on-the-job-training.  Despite over three years in office, the
job as leader and chief architect  of America's foreign and defense policies
still appears to be too  big for Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Instead of developing a clear and coherent foreign and  defense policy
grounded in American principles and national interest,  the Clinton
Administration allowed politics and indifference to  foreign policy issues to
create muddle and confusion in America's  foreign 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  policy. Until the beginning of the
104th Congress and the  Contract With America, Congress regrettably did little
to correct the  unwise course being followed by the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President and his advisors, indelibly influenced by their  opposition to
the Vietnam War, came into office confused about  the principles that legitimize
the exercise of American power. It  soon became apparent that the Clinton team
believed unilateral  U.S. action was improper, and that U.S. power must be  &quot;legitimized&quot;
by operating through some international or multilateral agency  like the United
Nations. The resulting policy of  &quot;assertive multilateralism&quot;
subordinated clear national interests to the  U.N. and other supranational
entities. Extending his liberal  worldview to international politics, President
Clinton in Somalia, Haiti,  and Bosnia looked upon foreign policy as social
work. Clinton's  vague global utopianism led him to commit the U.S. to dubious 
enterprises, with American soldiers needlessly killed and scarce  defense
dollars wasted. The Administration claims to have learned  that &quot;assertive
multilateralism&quot; in the U.N. does not work, but  the President exercised
the same unwise judgment from his early  years in office by unnecessarily and
unwisely sending U.S. troops  to Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Dubious Foreign Policy Successes</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many of these enterprises have been hailed as foreign policy  successes by
the Clinton Administration. The President has  claimed that his greatest
successes are in North Korea, Haiti, and  Bosnia. But these claims are
overblown. For example, the  Administration has:
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 --> 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Made extraordinary concessions to a most dangerous 
potential enemy, North Korea.</B> Rewarding North Korea's blatant and 
persistent refusal to live up to its obligations as a signatory to  the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the U.S. agreed to provide  $5 billion in fuel oil and
to help finance and build two new light  water reactors for Pyongyang. These
terms were spelled out in  the Nuclear Framework Agreement the Clinton
Administration  negotiated with North Korea. The Administration brags that this 
agreement gives the U.N.'s International Atomic Energy  Agency (IAEA) the right
to inspect certain nuclear facilities inside  North Korea. But the IAEA already
had the right to carry out  inspections. Moreover, the Nuclear Framework
Agreement provides no  guarantee that the North has stopped trying to build
nuclear weapons  at hidden sites, or that the North will continue to cooperate
with  the IAEA once Pyongyang has extracted financial and diplomatic 
concessions from the West.<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> North Korea has  been paid to do what
it already was obligated to do under the  Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, and
the U.S. is still not certain  that North Korea has stopped its nuclear weapons
program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Embarked on a costly venture of dubious value in Haiti.  President
Clinton hails his Haiti venture as a great foreign policy success.</B>  To be
sure, the U.S., the world's remaining military superpower,  did subdue the
Hemisphere's poorest and most backward country.  But for what purpose?  To
restore to office an avowed Marxist  demagogue known for his hostility to the
U.S. While the Haiti  mission did not turn into a Somalia-like disaster with the
loss of  American lives, it has cost upwards of $2 billion and placed enormous 
strain on U.S. forces at a time when they were engaged in many other  so-called
peace operations. Moreover, under the watchful eyes  of U.S. occupation forces,
former President Jean-Bertrand  Aristide 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  hijacked democracy in Haiti,
placing his hand-picked and  easily controlled successor in power via the
elections of December,  1995, and allowing political murders of his opponents to
occur  unpunished. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> The U.S. operation in Haiti was  unnecessary
and wasteful, serving no vital U.S. interest, and it did  not achieve its stated
purpose  the creation of democracy in Haiti.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Boxed America into an unwise and unnecessary U.N. troop  commitment to
Bosnia.</B> By failing to lift the arms embargo on the  embattled Bosnians so
they could defend themselves, it was left up  to the Croatians to push back the
Bosnian Serbs, who had  dominated the military balance of power inside Bosnia.
Once this shift in  the balance of power occurred, the stage was set for the
peace  agreement which was negotiated November 30, 1995, in Dayton,  Ohio.
Although U.S. pressure and NATO airstrikes played a role  in bringing about the
Dayton agreement, the real key was the  military defeats which the Bosnians and
Croatians imposed on the  Bosnian Serbs last year. But because the Bosnian
Muslims do not fully  trust the Croatians  indeed a few years ago they were at
war with  each other  the Dayton peace agreement is not only very fragile,  it
requires the presence of 20,000 U.S. troops and other  NATO forces to enforce
it. Thus, by failing to lift the arms embargo  on Bosnia, President Clinton
practically guaranteed that U.S.  troops would have to go to Bosnia to enforce
the peace, something  which he had repeatedly in the past promised he would not
do.
<br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> The U.S. troop deployment was unneccessary and  unwise, and
peace is by no means assured in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Claimed credit for the two Israeli-Palestinian peace accords  signed at
the White House in September 1993 and September 1995.</B>  But the two
agreements came about through bilateral negotiations  be
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  tween Israel and the Palestine
Liberation Organization,  initially conducted without the Administration's
knowledge. <br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> President Clinton enjoyed two photo opportunities,
but  the diplomatic breakthroughs that produced the agreements  came about
mainly through bilateral talks between Israelis and  Palestinians, not through
American diplomatic efforts.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Claims to have advanced the peace process between the  Irish Catholic
minority in Northern Ireland and the Irish Protestant  majority, backed by the
British government.</B> But the  Administration's controversial embrace of Gerry
Adams, leader of Sinn Fein,  the political wing of the Irish Republican Army
(IRA), is a risky  diplomatic gambit that has backfired. Despite the fact that
the  IRA has killed almost 2,000 people in terrorist attacks over the last  25
years, the Administration has rewarded it with a &quot;carrot and  carrot&quot;
policy. Clinton overruled the advice of his own State  Department, Defense
Department, and Justice Department to  allow Adams to obtain a visa to visit the
U.S. in February 1994.  In March 1995, the Administration allowed Adams to
travel to  the U.S. on a fund-raising trip, open an office in Washington, and 
visit the White House on Saint Patrick's Day. Although the IRA  agreed to a
cease-fire in its terrorist war, it did not agree to disarm,  and maintains a
huge arsenal, including more than a ton of  Semtex plastic explosive, much of it
provided by Libyan  dictator Muammar Qadhafi. Of course, the IRA broke its
cease-fire,  renewing its terrorist campaign, making a mockery of Clinton's 
efforts to bring peace to Nothern Ireland. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>  Clinton's opportunistic embrace of Gerry Adams, motivated at least in  part by domestic
politics, has undermined U.S. counterterrorism  policy; strained relations with
Britain, a staunch ally; and raised the  IRA's expectations that Washington will
press London to make  conces
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  sions without IRA concessions,
thereby undermining the  chances of a genuine peace.

<P><B>NAFTA and GATT: Successes Unfulfilled</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One genuine success for which the Clinton Administration fails  to claim
much credit is the approval of the North American  Free Trade Agreement and the
Uruguay Round of talks in the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or GATT.
The Clinton  Administration is to be commended for completing these agreements, 
but the initiative and much of the work behind them occurred in  the Reagan and
Bush Administrations. Moreover, by dropping the  ball on expanding NAFTA to
include Chile, the Clinton  Administration has practically taken the U.S. out of
the game of expanding  free trade in the Western Hemisphere. As a result, the
President  has ceded the initiative to Brazil and others who may want to  create
trade blocs closed to the U.S. but possibly more open to U.S.  competitors in
Europe and Japan.

<P><B>Clinton's Failures</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While the President's foreign policy &quot;successes&quot; have proven to 
be doubtful, his many foreign policy failures are obvious and  admitted even by
his supporters. For example, the President has: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Dragged his feet on protecting the U.S. homeland and troops
 and interests abroad from the growing danger of ballistic missiles. </B> He cut
the budget for missile defense by over 50 percent from  levels projected by the
Bush Administration and has attempted  illegally to broaden the restrictions of
the 1972 Anti-Ballistic  Missile (ABM) Treaty, which imposes severe restrictions
on strategic  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  fenses, to cover tactical and
theater defenses as well. <br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> Americans will be left vulnerable to
nuclear attack,  even though the Clinton Administration itself has admitted that
the  proliferation of nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles is the most 
serious threat to national security.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Wasted American lives and treasure on dubious peacekeeping  operations.</B>
Clinton allowed a limited, humanitarian mission to  Somalia to escalate into an
uncertain and dangerous  &quot;nation-building&quot; mission, which included
hunting Somali warlords and  disarming militant factions  in effect making the
U.S. a combatant in  a bloody civil war. Putting U.S. troops under a confused
U.N.  command structure, the Clinton Administration failed to provide  adequate
weapons and equipment to U.S. forces engaged in a  combat operation. The result
was an intense street battle in Mogadishu  in October 1993 which left 18 young
American Rangers dead,  75 other soldiers wounded and led to America's
humiliating  retreat from Somalia. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> American lives were lost 
unnecessarily, and U.S. national prestige and credibility suffered  needlessly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Frittered away American military strength and credibility in a  series
of &quot;peace operations&quot; with little or no benefit to the  nation's
security, consuming billions of defense budget dollars intended  for training,
operations, and maintenance of U.S. forces and  equipment.</B> These missions
included an unwise expansion of the  peace mission in Somalia, which led to the
mission's failure, and  the dispatch of troops to peacekeeping missions in
Haiti,  Macedonia, and Bosnia. At the same time, by cutting the defense budget, 
the President has neglected the core duty of the armed forces: to  fight and win
wars in defense of U.S. strategic interests and  existing 
 military alliance commitments. 
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Under  Clinton, American fighting troops are weaker and less able
to deal  with larger military contingencies, such as in Korea or the Persian
Gulf.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Built America's military strategy on a potentially fatal illusion.  In
1993 President Clinton's Pentagon released a study of  America's long-range
military requirements.</B> Called the &quot;Bottom-Up  Review,&quot; this study
concluded that the U.S. should have the  means and forces to fight two nearly
simultaneous medium-sized  conflicts. Yet Clinton proceeded to cut the very
forces needed to  sustain this capability. The President refused to fund
adequately  and field the force which his own planners said the country  needed.
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Because the U.S. will not be able to protect  all its interests
around the world, its alliances may weaken, its  credibility and influence may
wane, and Americans could be forced  to follow the lead of others rather than to
lead themselves.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Weakened the armed forces with social experimentation and  &quot;political
correctness.&quot;</B>  The President has imposed his radical  vision on the
military services by pushing women into combat  positions before their
effectiveness has been tested, or their impact on  combat effectiveness honestly
evaluated. He has advocated the  admission of acknowledged homosexuals into the
ranks, contrary to  the judgment of the nation's top military leaders. The
result has been  a corrosion of the mutual trust between leaders and those they 
lead that is essential to unit cohesion and combat  effectiveness.<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Clinton has weakened the morale of  America's fighting forces.
</P>
<P>
</P> 
<P><B>Followed a &quot;Russia-only&quot; policy that has not bolstered 
democracy in Russia, but it has blocked development of strong relations  with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  former Soviet states like Ukraine.</B>
President Clinton has  staked U.S. policy on the fate of one man, President
Boris Yeltsin.  The ostensible reason for this policy is to bolster democracy in
 Russia, but it clearly has not worked. Yeltsin has kicked democrats  like
former Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev and former  Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly
Chubais out of his cabinet, replacing  them with old Soviet hardliners like
Yevgeny Primakov, the new  Foreign Minister. But still the U.S. offers Yeltsin
good will and  cooperation. Clinton has largely turned a blind eye to Russia's 
hard-line policy toward its former &quot;republics&quot; and provinces  the 
so-called &quot;Near Abroad&quot;  and he has failed to condemn Russian 
aggression in trouble spots like Chechnya, Moldova, and Georgia. 
<br>
<b>The  Bottom Line:</b> Clinton's policy of accommodation has not  worked. Russia continues to
drift away from democracy and toward a  more hard line foreign policy, while the
U.S. continues to offer  friendship and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Put at risk key alliance relationships with Japan and the  Republic of
Korea. The Administration's effort last year to manage  trade with Japan was
acrimonious and counterproductive from the  start.</B> The U.S. reached auto
trade agreements with Japan in  November 1994 and March 1995, but these achieved
little and strained  U.S.-Japan relations. After initially denying that its
confrontational  policies were damaging the U.S.-Japan alliance, the 
Administration, under the Pentagon's leadership, belatedly tried to limit the 
damage and reaffirm the alliance. The main purpose of the April  1996
U.S.-Japanese summit is to repair the damage caused by the  previous year's
trade battles. At the same time, Clinton's efforts  to strike a nuclear bargain
with North Korea marginalized the  influence and role of a reliable U.S. ally,
South Korea. Recent  opinion polls by the United States Information Agency show
South  Korean 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  support for a U.S. military
presence at 72 percent, down 10  percent from 1994. Overall opinion of the U.S.
not only is down 20  percent, but also  and for the first time in 12 years  is
more  unfavorable (53 percent) than favorable (43 percent).<br><b>The Bottom  Line:</b> America's alliances with South Korea and Japan, key links in  the security chain
of Asia, have been weakened. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Damaged U.S. credibility in dealing with the People's Republic  of
China. After campaigning in 1992 to link China's Most  Favored Nation (MFN)
trading status to its human rights record,  President Clinton reversed himself
in 1994 and delinked MFN from  human rights.</B> <TT><B><A
HREF="ftntfor.htm#1">1</A></B></TT>  This was the correct
decision. As the Administration  belatedly recognized, the best way to encourage
China to  observe international norms of conduct is to promote policies which 
enhance economic interaction and, in turn, economic freedom  and reform. These
are the seeds from which democracy can  grow. However, the Administration's
flip-flops created the impression  of ineptness and weakness. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b>
While the  Administration ultimately did the right thing, its ill-conceived
linkage  policy cost the U.S. credibility both in Beijing and across Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Allowed Beijing to set America's agenda with the Republic  of China on
Taiwan.</B> In response to nearly unanimous  congressional resolutions, the
Administration relented and allowed  Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui to make a
&quot;private&quot; visit to his alma  mater, Cornell University, in June 1995.
Previously, in the face  of Beijing's protests, the Administration had resisted
the visit  of President Lee, claiming that it would violate its  &quot;One-China&quot;
policy. Clinton reversed himself only when he was pressured to  do so. The
mistake was the initial refusal to allow President Lee  to visit the U.S. 
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Beijing should not be allowed  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  dictate the terms of America's &quot;unofficial&quot;
commercial and  cultural relations with Taiwan, and its interest in Taiwan's
security,  as established by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Abandoned three decades of principled U.S. policy towards  Cuba.</B>
President Clinton secretly negotiated with Fidel Castro's  communist regime in
August 1994 to reach an agreement whereby all  Cuban boat people intercepted at
sea by U.S. ships would be  repatriated forcibly to Cuba. Hitherto Cuban
refugees were permitted  to enter the U.S. without restriction.
<br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Clinton changed the longstanding U.S. policy of isolating communist  Cuba to a
new conciliatory stance, without winning any democratic  or free-market
concessions from Castro. Clinton was  eventually forced to abandon this
conciliatory policy, and to strengthen  the embargo against Cuba, but only after
he was forced to do so in  the aftermath of the Cuban downing of two U.S.
civilian aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Failed to take seriously the global challenge of radical or 
revolutionary Islam.</B> Nor has the President pursued realistic steps to  deal
with the Islamist threat to friendly regimes or secular Muslim  powers in the
Middle East, North Africa, and Central Asia. Instead,  he has sought to
establish diplomatic contacts with radical  Islamic movements such as Algeria's
Islamic Salvation Front, thereby  undermining secular regimes battling Islamic
radicals. As a  result, the U.S. is not properly anticipating the potential
realignment  of global power in regions critical to U.S. interests. <br>
<b>The Bottom Line:</b> Radical regimes could threaten not only U.S. access to oil, but  also
American lives and interests through terrorism.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The mistakes, misjudgments, and missed opportunities that  have
characterized the Clinton Administration's approach to foreign  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  defense policy over the past four
years are serious. They  have weakened U.S. influence and credibility abroad
and, unless  rectified, could lead inevitably to America's decline as a great 
power capable of defending its values and interests. For America, it  is either
lead or be led. The first road leads to freedom, security,  and greatness, the
second to weakness and submission. For its  own well-being, and for that of the
entire globe, America's  leadership needs to be restored.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE 104TH CONGRESS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The weak record of the Clinton Administration in foreign and  defense policy
was singled out for criticism in the GOP's  Contract With America. Alarmed over
Clinton's defense budget cuts  and failure to move rapidly toward a national
missile defense  system, Republicans marching under the banner of the Contract 
promised to restore America's military strength. Once elected in  November 1994,
they got to work on trying to fulfill their promise. On  February 7, 1995, the
House of Representatives passed the National  Security Revitalization Act (H.R.
7), which sought to establish  a commission to eliminate the funding shortfall
in defense, set a  new policy for the development and deployment of missile 
defenses, expand NATO membership, and limit the authority of the  President to
subordinate U.S. troops to United Nations command.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Senate did not take up H.R. 7. However, parts of H.R. 7  found their way
into different pieces of legislation in the Senate, such  as in the defense
authorization bill and foreign relations  authorization bill. While not all of
the original Contract items were included  in final legislation reconciling
differences between the House  and Senate  for example, Congress dropped the
House's demand  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  create a commission to examine
U.S. national security strategy   conservative supporters of the Contract
delivered on the  majority of their promises to the American people. 
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P>The Congress undertook a number of other foreign and  defense policy
initiatives in 1995 that complemented and supplemented  the legislation inspired
by the Contract With America. For  example, the new majority in Congress
endeavored to:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Restore America's military strength. Congress approved a 
defense spending bill that added $7 billion to the defense budget  request
submitted by President Clinton.</B> This money was needed not  only to keep
America's armed forces trained and combat ready, but  also to maintain a force
with modern high-technology weapons in  the 21st century. Primarily because he
counted on congressional  support for his Bosnia mission, President Clinton
bowed to  congressional demands and signed the defense appropriations bill for 
fiscal 1996, which provided the additional $7 billion above his  original
request. But in an unprecedented act the President vetoed  the accompanying
fiscal year 1996 defense authorization bill  which would have: 1) provided more
funds to maintain the  technological superiority of U.S. forces, 2) authorized a
pay raise and  housing allowance increase for military personnel (including
those  deployed to Bosnia), and 3) mandated the defense of the U.S.  homeland
against ballistic missiles. However, in early 1996 the  President signed a
different version of the defense authorization bill  that weakened missile
defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Move the United States closer to a national missile defense  system.</B>
The defense authorization bill approved by Congress but  vetoed by the President
sought to establish a clear timetable for  de
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  velopment and deployment of both
national and theater  missile defenses. Further, it sought to bar the
application of  Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty restrictions to theater
defense  systems. However, the President refused to sign the defense bill,
giving  as his primary reason the strong missile defense provisions it 
contained. Of course, the President eventually got his way,  forcing Congress to
accept a weakening of missile defense in the  final 1996 defense authorization
bill. Once again the President has  succeeded in blocking this country's ability
to defend its citizens  from nuclear attack and Congress was not able to muster
enough  votes to override his veto. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Cut foreign aid.</B> While the new Republican majority promised 
extensive cuts in foreign aid, little has transpired by way of  revamping
America's wasteful foreign aid programs. Federal spending  on foreign aid will
likely be only $2 billion less in FY 1996 than  it was in FY 1995. However,
under the umbrella of a balanced  budget by the year 2002, further cuts are
likely. While current  cuts amount to nearly 30 percent for all programs except
aid to  Israel and Egypt, much still needs to be done. One step in the right 
direction is a new law, that the U.S. government report on the  progress being
made by foreign aid recipients developing free markets,  the main engine of
economic development. This effort was inspired  by The Heritage Foundation's
<I>Index of Economic  Freedom</I>, a global comparison of economic freedom in
142 countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>End the Castro dictatorship in Cuba.</B> Congress passed and  the
President signed the Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity  Act just a few
days after the February 24, 1996, downing by Cuba  of two U.S. registered
civilian aircraft in international waters.  This legislation, which tightens the
U.S. trade embargo on Cuba  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  allows American citizens to seek
compensation for property  stolen by Castro, is another step toward hastening
the end of  Castro's dictatorship.
</P> 
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Reorganize the State Department.</B> Congress proposed to cut  waste in
the State Department and foreign operations accounts by  consolidating several
independent foreign policy agencies into  the State Department. This effort, led
by Senate Foreign  Relations Committee Chairman Jesse Helms (R-NC), had the
support of  Secretary of State Warren Christopher until bureaucratic  interests
within the Administration persuaded him to oppose it. Key  legislation to move
the Arms Control and Disarmament  Agency (ACDA), United States Information
Agency (USIA), Agency  for International Development (AID), and two other
foreign  policy agencies into the State Department was approved by a 
House-Senate conference committee in March 1996. The President  has vowed to
veto this legislation if approved by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Express reservations on sending U.S. troops to Bosnia.</B> In  December
1995, the House and Senate passed resolutions to support  the U.S. troops being
deployed on the peacekeeping mission  to Bosnia. These resolutions, however, did
not endorse  the President's decision to deploy them, and raised questions about
 the wisdom of American involvement in a mission lacking clear  goals. The House
went so far as to vote to cut off funds for the  Bosnia mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Maintain America's trading relations with China by  approving
most-favored-nation trade status for China.</B> In July 1995, the  Congress
sustained most-favored-nation trading status for China.  This decision reflects
the belief held by a majority in the Congress  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  increasing economic interaction
is the best way to promote  economic reform and advance political liberalization
and  human rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Protect the U.S. relationship with Taiwan.</B> In the face of 
Administration resistance to granting Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui  a visa to
visit his alma mater Cornell University, the Congress  voted with near unanimity
in May 1995 to support his visit. As a  result, the President reversed course
and granted the visa. Also, both  the House and Senate, have included provisions
in the 1996 State  Department authorization bill that would give precedence to
the  1979 Taiwan Relations Act over U.S.-China  government-to-government
communiqu&eacute;s when considering future weapons exports to  Taiwan. U.S.
China policy too often is framed by communiqu&eacute;s  that have no force of
law, international or domestic. The Taiwan  Relations Act, however, is the law
of the land. The President  has vowed to veto the bill if approved by Congress.

<P><B>M</B>ost Americans believe that America, for all its flaws, is a 
peaceable, generous, and benevolent nation that has been a force  for good in
the world. Today, the industrialized democracies, led  by the United States,
face rising new challenges to their security,  interests, and prosperity. The
fall of the Soviet Union and  Warsaw Pact has meant not the end of threats to
U.S. and allied  security, but the unleashing of forces contained by 45 years of
the  Cold War. U.S. leadership is still vital if America and other free  nations
are to deal effectively with these forces. To provide this  leadership, the
United States needs to remain engaged in world  affairs, working to create
conditions that serve the interests of the U.S.  and its allies and trying to
shape the kind of world in which  democratic institutions, free trade, and the
unimpeded flow of ideas can  flourish.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America cannot be -- nor should it try to be -- the world's  policeman. But
neither can the nation retreat into neo-isolationism.  This is an era
characterized by the global spread of ballistic  missiles; nuclear, chemical,
and biological weapons; and other  high-tech weaponry among potential
adversaries. And while the threat  of thermonuclear war has subsided, at least
from the former  Soviet Union, threats from nuclear proliferation, terrorism,
and tribal  and ethnic conflict have not. Even in this new &quot;Age of Chaos,&quot;
 however, the world remains linked by innumerable strands of  trade, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  commerce, and telecommunications;
and these essential links  must operate despite conflict, confrontation, and
dislocation. A  &quot;Fortress America&quot; strategy in this kind of world is
not workable.  The U.S. could not put its head in the sand for long even if it
wanted  to. The North Koreas, Iraqs, and Irans, not to mention the  positive
demands of trade and commerce, would not allow it.  America needs access to the
world's markets and resources and must  maintain the ability to move goods
freely and safely.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Consequently, acting in concert with friends and allies when  possible but
unilaterally when necessary, the United States should  use all the components of
national power and influence -- diplomacy, trade, communications, and (as a last resort) armed force -- to shape a world friendly to America's interests and
values. In  short, the U.S. needs to make the world safe for America. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. has global interests and must be a world leader in  ways that suit
its interests, values, and capabilities. Because it is a  trading nation
dedicated to the free exchange of ideas and  goods, America has commercial and
political interests in almost all  corners of the world. Therefore, the U.S.
must be engaged -- through diplomacy, trade, and other means -- in practically all
regions  of the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the U.S. does not have security interests  everywhere. Some of the
world's regions are more important than others.  Since the U.S. cannot be the
world's policeman -- it has neither  the means nor the will to impose a security
order on the world -- it  will have to choose carefully in deciding when, and
under what  cir
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  cumstances, to engage its military
forces and prestige. It will  have to choose strategies, alliances, and military
capabilities that  are best suited to its unique position as the world's only
global  military power. It will have to choose when its use of military force 
is decisive and unique.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To exploit this unique and unenviable position, the U.S.  should adopt a
military strategy of selective engagement  whereby America, lacking a single
global threat, engages its military  power primarily to maintain a balance of
power in regions that are  most vital to her interests. The U.S. must always be
prepared to  protect its borders and regions close to home; for this reason,
security  matters in the Western Hemisphere will always be vitally  important.
But as a global power, the U.S. also must be prepared to  intervene militarily
to maintain a positive balance of power in other key  regions of the world. Now
that the Soviet Union has dissolved,  no single power can challenge the U.S.
globally, but smaller  powers in Europe, Asia, and the Persian Gulf can threaten
U.S.  security interests in these vitally important regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's &quot;global&quot; strategy is both global and regional. The 
primary aims of U.S. military strategy should be: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1)</B>  <B>To defend the American people and territory
from attack. </B> Thus, America's top priorities should be not only to deploy a 
ballistic missile defense for the U.S. homeland, but also to take a lead  role
in countering nuclear proliferation and other global threats to  security. <B>
</B>The greatest threat to the peace and stability in the world  today is the
acquisition by rogue regimes or hostile forces of  weapons of mass destruction
(nuclear, biological, and chemical).  The proliferation of weapons of mass
destruction, along with the  ballis
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  tic missiles to deliver them, will
result inevitably in greater  confrontation and conflict unless the free
nations, led by the  United States, take steps to keep dangerous weapons out of
the hands  of potential enemies. America has the resources to counter the 
proliferation of advanced weaponry, including the ability to build  an effective
defense against ballistic missiles, thereby rendering  them less useful.
Harnessing these resources and demonstrating the  leadership necessary to use
them should be a top priority for U.S.  foreign and defense policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2)  To maintain a balance of power in Europe, Asia, and the
 Persian Gulf.</B> It is still a vital interest of the U.S. to prevent the 
domination of Europe, Asia, or the Persian Gulf by a hostile power  or bloc of
hostile powers. NATO and other military alliances  remain the best ways to
prevent such domination. These alliances are  insurance policies against the
instability and chaos that  brought America into two world wars in this century.
Without an  American military presence in Europe, Asia, and the Persian Gulf,
chaos  and conflict will fill the vacuum if security arrangements among  the
free nations of the world erode. The U.S. must cultivate good  relations with
allies in Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and  Latin America, and where possible
bring emerging democracies  into security partnerships. Top priorities include
bringing new  democracies in Central Europe into NATO and strengthening 
alliances and friendships in Asia.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>Therein lies not only the basis of American leadership in the world -- not as the world's policeman, but as the only power capable  of
preventing major regional or even global wars -- but also a  new division of labor
with allies. America's allies should take the  lead in settling purely regional
conflicts, such as the civil war  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  Bosnia-Herzogovina, while the U.S.
focuses primarily on the  core military mission of collective defense. The U.S.
should not try  to put out every brushfire that breaks out in Europe or Asia, 
but should husband its resources to deal with larger threats that  endanger the
overall security of these regions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This strategy of selective engagement is very different from  the one
pursued by the Clinton Administration. The President calls  his strategy &quot;engagement
and enlargement.&quot;  No one is sure  exactly what these terms mean, but his
strategy entails a heavy focus  on peacekeeping, multilateralism, appeasement of
large powers  like Russia and China, and a general neglect of military 
capabilities, military alliances, and the core military missions of those 
alliances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The strategy of selective engagement is practically the opposite  of
Clinton's approach. Peacekeeping would be downplayed (and  U.S. troop
participation in such operations avoided); multilateralism  de-emphasized except
through military alliances; policies  toward large powers like Russia and China
toughened; military  capabilities maintained at higher levels; and military
alliances focused  on core missions of collective defense, not peacekeeping or 
crisis management. Leadership would be demonstrated not by  engaging in global
social work, as the President has done, but by  emphasizing America's unique and
decisive contributions to world  peace and stability as a global power.


<P>
</P>
<P><B>ECONOMIC PROSPERITY FOR AMERICANS</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There is more to maintaining America's leadership role in  the
world than military strategy. There also are the key issues of  trade 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  and economics. To be sure,
America's standard of living  depends on its role as a global power; the wealth
of America as a nation  is inconceivable without the security provided by
America's  armed forces and alliances. But it is also true that America's 
wealth would be inconceivable were it not for its access to overseas  markets
and the relative stability of the world's financial markets.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For this reason, the U.S. has a vital interest in free trade and  open
overseas markets. As a maritime nation dependent on  foreign trade, the U.S.
depends on access to world markets, raw  materials, and energy resources for its
prosperity and security.  Protecting these interests depends on the free and
safe transit of the air,  space, and the world's sea lanes and maritime choke
points.  Historically, the U.S. has been compelled to intervene with armed force
to  protect these freedoms, and it must remain prepared to do so  when
necessary. But persuasion is always preferable. Therefore, the  U.S. should
conduct an enlightened diplomacy to remove artificial  barriers to the free flow
of goods, services, and ideas,  especially among the industrialized democracies.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>PROMOTING FREEDOM ABROAD</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Americans care deeply about the morality of their foreign 
policy. They wish to see a reflection of themselves as a people in the  foreign
policies which their government pursues. For this reason,  they wish to support
freedom and democracy abroad, not only for  the practical benefits of spreading
peace and stability, but  because doing so is a reflection of their own values
in the world. It also is  a source of inspiration which sustains their
commitments  beyond what is required by self-interest.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, most Americans do not wish to see their country  embark on some
overseas crusade for democracy. They understand  the limits imposed by reality.
It makes little sense to imply, as  the Clinton Administration did in Haiti,
that creating democracy is  a general and unlimited goal of U.S. military
policy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nevertheless, it is both a practical and moral benefit for the U.S.  to help
free institutions take root abroad, particularly in  regions where old
totalitarian or authoritarian empires have collapsed.  Free nations grounded in
democratic institutions generally do not  start wars. The freer and more
democratic the world becomes, the  more peaceful, and therefore the more
congenial to U.S. values and  interests, it will be. The best tools with which
to help emerging  democracies are foreign aid and public and private diplomacy, 
not direct military intervention, which should be undertaken  only when vital
interests are threatened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>CONCLUSION</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These principles can and should guide policymakers, not only 
in the next Administration or next session of Congress, but in  successive
Administrations and Congresses for decades to come. In  short, they should be
viewed as the basic principles of foreign and  defense policy for America in the
21st century. They are, in  essence, the foundations of a post-Cold War national
strategy for the  United States.

<P>U.S. defense policy is undergoing its most sweeping  reappraisal since World
War II. The defense budget has dropped every  year for ten years, and from the
end of FY 1988 through FY 1995,  the Pentagon has eliminated well over one
million military  personnel. Nevertheless, despite the shrinking of America's
military might,  it is not yet clear how weak America can afford to become, or 
indeed what the major mission of the U.S. armed forces will be in the  21st
century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The most dangerous threat to America today is the proliferation  of
long-range nuclear missiles that could reach American soil  from Iran, Iraq,
North Korea, or some other hostile nation.  Intelligence officials state that at
least 20 countries already have or may  be developing both weapons of mass
destruction (including  nuclear weapons) and ballistic missile delivery 
systems.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#1">1</A>  While no Third World
countries yet have ballistic missiles with sufficient range  to reach the United
States, it is a virtual certainty that some will  have them by the next decade.
Yet America has no defense against  these weapons. Strategic anti-missile
defenses are more important  than ever and could be deployed by the early part
of the coming  century. To do otherwise -- to leave America undefended against such a clear physical threat -- would be a dereliction of duty with  tragic
potential consequences.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other possible near-term threats to U.S. vital national interests  are the
potential re-establishment of an expansionist dictatorship  in Russia, military
expansionism by Iran or Iraq, attacks by  North Korea against South Korea, or
militarily threatening moves  by China against Taiwan. A defense posture capable
of  countering these threats can be maintained at far less cost than the Cold 
War demanded. However, the Clinton Administration is not  maintaining these
necessary defenses. Instead, it has presided over a  period of decline and
confusion in America's military capabilities.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are many national security issues and questions  dividing liberals
from conservatives, but not all are familiar. What, for  example, is the right
amount to spend on defense now that the  Soviet threat has ended?  There is no
consensus on the Left or the  Right; much of the old Left-Right division on
defense strategy and  spending ended with the fall of the Soviet Union. Many 
conservatives want to focus entirely on domestic problems and cut all  federal
spending, including defense. Many liberals (including the  Clinton
Administration), while not supporting higher defense  spending, want to use
American military forces in humanitarian,  peacekeeping, and non-traditional
missions which put enormous pressure  on the shrinking defense budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are many other issues and questions facing the  candidates this year:
What is the proper use of American military force in  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  post-Cold War world, and what kind
of forces are needed?   Should the U.S. military be converted to a kind of
global  peacekeeping constabulary?  Or should the armed services continue to
focus  on their traditional role of deterring threats to America's vital 
interests, the central element of which is preparing to fight and  win wars?  If
the U.S. military is to maintain its focus on this  traditional warfighting
role, what level of personnel is needed, and  how should the armed forces be
organized, trained, and equipped  for the future?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The post-Cold War world can be characterized as an &quot;Age  of Chaos.&quot;
 While the Soviet Union has fallen and no longer  threatens the free world with
nuclear annihilation, new conflicts have  been spawned  ethnic, tribal, and
religious  between emerging  nations and at the sub-national level. Some of
these conflicts  may threaten U.S. interests; most will not. But they certainly 
disturb peace and order in the world. Under what circumstances should  the U.S.
intervene?  What are sound and politically supportable  criteria for the use of
American military force abroad?  These are  two key questions facing the U.S.
today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. armed forces are not merely subordinate to civilian  leadership,
starting with the Commander in Chief, but highly  responsive, precisely because
of their command hierarchy. How  should the military respond to the social and
political agenda of the  President and his Administration?  Should the
Administration use  this highly responsive institution to foster revolutionary
social  change or as a laboratory for social experimentation?  What is the 
impact on combat readiness when radical social changes are forced on  the armed
forces?
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the most contentious unresolved defense issue is  this: Should the
American homeland be defended against the  growing threat of long-range
ballistic missiles and the proliferation   especially among potentially hostile
nations  of weapons of mass  destruction?  Five years after the Gulf War, in
which the  largest single loss of American lives came from an Iraqi Scud missile
 attack, the U.S. still has no better defense against regional or  theater
missile threats than the <U>Patriot</U> missile, which was designed  primarily
not as a missile defense, but as an anti-aircraft missile.  The question is:
Should the U.S. move aggressively to deploy  more effective theater missile
defenses for U.S. forces and allies abroad?   Or should America continue to rely
on arms control treaties  like the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty to protect
its security?

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The budget (in spending authority) for the
Defense  Department reached its peak in FY 1985. Today, it is being cut sharply 
despite instability and threats to America's security around the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In constant, inflation-adjusted dollars, there was a decline
of  35 percent in defense spending from FY 1986 to FY 1995. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     President Clinton proposes to slash budget authority for the 
Department of Defense from $282 billion to $276.6 billion by  the year 2002. In
constant, inflation-adjusted dollars, this would  represent another cut of about
24 percent in defense spending from  the FY 1992 baseline.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     President Clinton's defense budget fails to fund his own 
defense program. The Heritage Foundation calculates that projected  spend
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  ing in the President's five-year
defense plan (FY 1996 - FY  2000) will fall short by $110 billion. Other
organizations, including  the Congressional Budget Office, the Center for
Strategic and  International Studies, the Defense Budget Project, and the
General  Accounting Office, concur that the Clinton Administration  is
underfunding its own defense program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Reagan defense buildup in the 1980s increased active  Army
divisions from 16 to 18 and reserve divisions from 8 to 10 by  FY 1986.
Clinton's defense plan would cut these forces roughly  in half, reducing active
Army divisions to 10 and reserve  division equivalents to somewhat more than 5.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Air Force reached a high during the Reagan years of 26 
active tactical wings and 13 reserve wings. Clinton would cut  these forces by
about half, to 13 active and 7 reserve wings.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Marine Corps during the Reagan years reached a high  of
199,000 active-duty Marines and 42,000 reservists. Clinton  proposes
approximately 174,000 active-duty and 42,000 reserve  personnel.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In addition, Ronald Reagan increased total Navy ships from 479
 to a high of 569 and the number of aircraft carrier battle groups to  15.
Clinton would reduce these levels by about 40 percent, to  346 ships and 11
aircraft carrier battle groups.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Clinton Administration proposed a budget for missile 
defense that is less than half of what the Bush Administration proposed  for the
five-year period covering FY 1995-FY 1999.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A general readiness crisis precipitated by the Clinton defense
 budget was highlighted in two separate congressional  reports.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#2">2</A>  These reports noted that many
front-line American combat units  were understrength and forced to cancel
critical training, strip  other units for spare parts, and deploy on missions at
80-90  percent strength. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A General Accounting Office report on the effect of 
peacekeeping operations on combat capability concluded that it could take up  to
18 months to retrain a division on peacekeeping duty for  combat.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#3">3</A>  This means that the U.S. Army in
Europe, most of which is  deployed in support of the Bosnian peace
implementation mission,  is effectively out of the warfighting business for from
two to  three years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A March 1995 report by the CIA's Nonproliferation Center 
entitled <I>The Weapons Proliferation</I><U> 
</U><I>Threat </I>states that at least 20 Third World countries either are
developing or already have  ballistic missiles.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has all but abandoned strategic  ballistic
missile defense (BMD). What is left of the nation's BMD  program is both
misdirected and underfunded. The  Administration's current plan directs the bulk
of funds toward defenses  against short-range ballistic missiles, ignoring the
need to defend  U.S. territory against long-range ballistic missiles. It reduces
the  budget for missile defense by almost $23 billion  more than 50 percent  
from FY 1995 through FY 1999. Even the plan's  high-priority &quot;theater&quot;
defenses against short-range missiles are cut by $4.5  bil
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  lion over the same period.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration is providing neither the resources  nor the
proper direction in maintaining strong conventional  forces. Instead of
identifying specific national interests and the threats  to them, the
Administration has formulated a vague strategy of  &quot;engagement and
enlargement&quot; that confuses the purposes of  national security policy. In
its national security planning, the  Administration has placed far too much
emphasis on tangential issues  like domestic economic policy, environmental
policy, and foreign  economic development.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#4">4</A>  The result has been a national
security  planning process out of control  one disconnected not only from  the
Administration's decision-making process, but also from the  hard realities of
the threats America faces.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The current National Security Strategy developed by the  Clinton
Administration fails to make clear where and under what  circumstances U.S.
forces may be asked to fight. While the Clinton  Administration has established
some guidelines for military  intervention, for example, it ignored many of them
in its decision to  send troops to Bosnia. In Bosnia, the Administration made
the  mistake of creating a vital American interest where there otherwise  would
not be one. By promising U.S. troops in a yet-to-be-defined  mission and putting
American credibility on the line during the  Dayton peace talks, the Clinton
Administration presented  Congress with the choice of supporting the
Administration or damaging  U.S. credibility by breaking its word. The risks of
the Bosnian  intervention clearly are out of proportion to the costs, and the
exit  strategy is essentially an exit date of a year or less after the 
intervention began. Most controversial of all, however, was President  Clinton's
decision to deploy American forces without congressional  ap
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  proval or public support. Public
opinion supporting the  intervention crested at 40 percent in December 1995,
when the House  of Representatives passed a resolution condemning the Bosnia 
mission. At the same time, the Senate expressed only lukewarm  support  support
directed at American forces, but not the  Clinton policies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another example of poor defense leadership by the  Administration was its
1993 &quot;Bottom-Up Review&quot; of U.S. military forces.  The purpose of the
BUR was to devise a new military force to  implement U.S. strategy in the
post-Cold War era. In meeting this  goal, however, the BUR failed. The Clinton
Administration promised  to maintain sufficient military forces to fight and win
two  medium regional conflicts, but the forces provided for by the 
Administration strategy are clearly inadequate for a two-war scenario. 
President Clinton's proposed defense budgets for the period  covering FY 1996 to
FY 2000 are not enough to pay for the BUR  force, according to numerous defense
analyses, including those of  The Heritage Foundation and the General Accounting
 Office.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#5">5</A>  The Pentagon will be
around $110 billion short over five years if  it pursues the current Clinton
Administration defense spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> Deploying the forces proposed for a single major conflict from  the other
services would leave virtually nothing in reserve if a  second major conflict
began. Of the total active force of 11 aircraft  carrier battle groups proposed
for the Navy, for example, the Clinton  Administration would assign four to five
carriers to each of the  two major regional conflicts, leaving perilously little
room for error.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even worse, because &quot;peace operations&quot; will draw from the  &quot;same
collection of general purpose forces&quot; already obligated for  major 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  regional contingencies, the
Administration intends to support  them by committing up to two Army divisions,
one Marine brigade,  two aircraft carrier battle groups, and two Air Force wings
from  an already overcommitted force.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#6">6</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The bottom line: At the same time the Clinton Administration  has been
cutting the size and readiness of U.S. forces, it has been  increasing the
commitments they are supposed to cover. In  other words, the President is
developing a military &quot;strategy&quot;  whose reach exceeds its grasp and
which inevitably will leave some  vital U.S. interests undefended.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because of Clinton's mismanagement of U.S. defense policy,  the U.S. could
not repeat the<B> </B>sweeping victory of the Persian Gulf  War today<B>.</B>
The Persian Gulf War epitomizes U.S. military  prowess. The forces that won
Desert Storm were largely the product of  the Reagan Administration's military
buildup during the early  1980s. But the Clinton Administration is sacrificing
the combat  readiness of the force of tomorrow to preserve operational readiness
 today. Had Ronald Reagan and Congress done this in the 1980s,  George Bush
could not have won such a decisive and relatively  low-casualty victory in the
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton and Congress owe the same careful  stewardship to the next
President. Not only has Clinton reduced the  armed forces to the point where
they lack the means to fight and win  a Gulf War (while maintaining a minimum of
other defense  commitments), but his budget cuts have severely affected the 
combat readiness of this reduced force. For instance, some Marine  divisions are
operating at 80-90 percent of their assigned  combat strength, Army combat
battalions assigned to be the first forces  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  the Persian Gulf have been forced
to cancel annual gunnery  training, and Navy fighter squadrons have been forced
to  cannibalize some units in order to keep others  flying.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#7">7</A>  These types of readiness crises
threaten to make the U.S. military a hollow  fighting force.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To avoid further critical weakening of America's combat  capability, there
are several actions that the next Administration and  Congress must take.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Devise a coherent national military strategy.</B> In addition to 
providing adequate resources, Congress and the next Administration  need to
devise a new military strategy for the U.S.; for all intents  and purposes,
America now has none. U.S. defense policy should  be built on four fundamental
strategies:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Strategy #1:</B> Selective Engagement. The United States
has  global interests. In fact, it has economic and political interests in 
practically all regions of the world. But it does not have security  interests
in all parts of the world. When it comes to employing  U.S. military power,
America has to make choices. It should choose  to engage its armed forces
primarily in ways that affect the  global balance of power. The main purpose of
American military  power should be to establish a balance of power favorable to 
American and Western interests in key regions of the world  Europe,  Asia, and
the Persian Gulf. According to this strategy, the U.S.  would bear the principal
responsibility for the collective defense of  these regions, while U.S. allies
in the regions affected would  become responsible primarily for collective
security, peacekeeping,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  settling lesser conflicts that
are essentially regional in nature.  It must be emphasized that selective
engagement is a military  strategy, not a national strategy encompassing all
aspects  (economic, political, and diplomatic) of U.S. policy. Moreover,
selective  engagement implies that America needs a military force capable  of
handling core missions in different regions of the world.  These forces should
not be customized for specific regions when  undertaking peacekeeping and other
missions short of war.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #2:</B> Dissuasion. The U.S. armed forces should be  strong
enough to dissuade other nations from attempting to threaten  the U.S., its
interests, and its allies. By forcing them to recognize  the futility of
aggression, such power even may discourage  potential enemy nations from
substantially arming themselves. To have  the desired deterrent effect, this
power must be global in reach  and capable, when necessary, of achieving
decisive military  victory over most potential enemies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #3:</B> Strategic Defense. With many potentially  unstable
regimes acquiring both nuclear weapons and long-range  ballistic missile
delivery systems, anti-ballistic missile defenses are  absolutely essential to
defense of the U.S. homeland.  Threatening nuclear retaliation to deter an
attack using these weapons may  fail with any one of these regimes. The ability
to knock out single  or multiple missile launches could save tens of millions of
 American lives and spare the country unimaginable devastation.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strategy #4:</B> Force Projection. With many potential trouble  spots
around the globe, U.S. forces need to be redesigned so they can  be deployed
quickly around the globe. With U.S. bases  overseas shrinking in number, America
increasingly will have to be able  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  project force overseas from its
own territory. Thus, the U.S.  needs a strong navy, flexible expeditionary
forces, and an army  capable of decisively defeating a large and modern force on
the battlefield.

<P>In addition to reflecting these four fundamental strategies, a  sound and
credible U.S. defense policy must:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Acknowledge that the Clinton Administration's Bottom-Up  Review
force is not adequate to fight and win two medium-size  regional conflicts
simultaneously,</B> but should be postured to  fight and win simultaneously one
major regional conflict and  one smaller contingency. If the Administration's
objective is to  win two major regional conflicts simultaneously, it must
provide  a larger force  and the budget and other resources to sustain  that
force.
</P>
<P>

at 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  1995 levels, adjusted for

trained and combat ready.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restore adequate funds to crippled ballistic missile defense 
programs.</B> In FY 1997 the Pentagon should spend about $1.2  billion more on
missile defenses than the $3 billion the Clinton  Administration is likely to
request. Thus, the total, which includes funds  for the Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization (BMDO) and a  few select programs under the Air Force
budget, should be about  $4.3 billion to $4.5 billion in FY 1997.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Develop a cheaper but more effective approach to missile  defense.</B>
Sea-based and space-based systems, rather than relatively  ineffective and
costly ground-based ones, would fill the bill. The  best architecture would be
one based on accelerating the Navy's  &quot;Upper Tier&quot; missile defense
system and then moving to deploy  a combination of space-based interceptors and
space-based  lasers early in the next decade.<A

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Keep an eye on the future.</B> The computer chip and 
microelectronics revolutions are bringing about a corresponding revolution  in
military affairs. As its forces shrink, the U.S. must maintain  the most
technologically advanced military in the world, paying  close attention to new
operational concepts made possible by new  technologies  in particular,
information warfare capabilities,  improvements in surveillance and
precision-strike weapons, and  advanced &quot;situational awareness&quot; of
battlefield commanders.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Don't we spend enough on defense?  The Cold War is  over; 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  why can't we get by with
dramatically smaller military forces?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> American forces already are smaller than during the Cold  War,
and they continue to shrink in size. The Pentagon has cut  more than one million
personnel during the drawdown after the end  of the Cold War. But though the
Cold War threat has ended,  the world is entering an era of new threats and
conflicts, some  of which are very dangerous. America's security and prosperity 
still depend upon a military large enough and capable enough to  defend vital
U.S. interests around the globe. For that force to remain  sufficiently combat
ready and technologically advanced to deter or  defeat future threats, the
nation must invest in adequate resources.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Critics of missile defense say that no rogue state can threaten  us
with missiles today. Why do you insist on hyping the threat  from ballistic
missiles?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Ballistic missile technology is now 50 years old and is  no
longer high technology. More countries are acquiring ballistic  missiles and
missile technology and using these destructive  weapons once they obtain them.
Ballistic missiles have been used in the  war in Afghanistan, the Iran-Iraq War,
the civil war in Yemen, and  the Persian Gulf War. In the Gulf War, more
Americans (28)  died from missile attack than from any other enemy action when 
an Iraqi Scud fell on a U.S. barracks in Dharan. Inevitably,  these rogue states
will acquire missiles with greater ranges and  increased accuracy. Fielding
comprehensive defenses against the  emerging missile threat will take some 10
years; if the U.S. waits until  rogue states actually deploy missiles with
ranges sufficient to reach  U.S. territory, it will be too late. Finally, U.S.
territory is at risk  today because of intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs) and  subma
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  rine-launched ballistic missiles
(SLBMs) deployed by China  and Russia. At a minimum, the U.S. should deploy
defenses to  address the possibility of unauthorized or accidental missile
launches  by these two countries. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Some critics say there is no readiness crisis in the military.  Is
there a crisis in readiness or not? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Former Assistant Secretary of Defense Lawrence J. Korb,  a
scholar at the Brookings Institution, argues that there is no  readiness crisis.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#9">9</A>  However, two separate reports
based on the  evidence from field units themselves paint a dramatically
different  picture. Senator John McCain's <I>Going Hollow: The Warnings of the 
Chiefs of Staff</I> and Representative Floyd Spence's 
<I>Military Readiness: The View from the Field</I> document how funding
shortfalls  have forced understrength first-line combat units to cancel
training,  curtail missions, and cease flying in preparation for eventual 
military missions. At the same time, Clinton has sent the military on 
humanitarian missions to Bosnia, Somalia, Haiti, Rwanda, and  elsewhere at the
expense of combat readiness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be done about the inability of the Bottom-Up  Review
Force to fight and win two simultaneous major conflicts?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Create a &quot;one-and-a-half-war&quot; fighting force. The size
of  the U.S. forces needed depends on the magnitude of the  commitments made to
meet possible threats. It is unlikely that the U.S. will  face more than one
large-scale regional conflict similar to the  Persian Gulf War at any one time
over the next five years.  Conceivably, however, the nation may have to deal
with one small-scale  regional conflict roughly the size of the 1989 Panama
operation  con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  currently with a large-scale
conflict. The U.S. should maintain  a one-and-a-half-war force capable of
engaging in such  conflicts simultaneously.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#10">10</A>  While this strategy accepts a
higher level of  risk than the Clinton Administration's &quot;two war&quot;
strategy,  the Administration's defense budget puts the nation in a  position
where it will have barely enough forces to fight one major  regional conflict by
itself. The important thing is to stop the  demobilization process now. If the
nation later finds it necessary, it should  re-examine the two-war strategy and
increase the defense budget  accordingly.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How many and what kinds of conventional forces and  equipment does
the nation need?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. needs a Navy of about 400 ships, with 12 active 
aircraft carriers. The Marine Corps should retain three Marine  Expeditionary
Forces (MEFs), which would require 177,000  active-duty Marines; the Marine
Corps Reserve should number 42,000.  The Navy and Marine Corps Reserve,
therefore, should be reduced  by a smaller proportion than the other services.
Also needed are  fast sealift ships and new heavy airlifters, like the C-17, to
replace  the nation's rapidly aging airlift fleet and maintain the ability to 
get heavy forces into a theater of conflict in a hurry. Finally,  adequate
pre-positioned stocks of heavy equipment, either ashore near  likely trouble
spots or on maritime pre-positioned ships, are essential  to sustain a conflict
for more than a few weeks.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't building strategic defenses kill arms control?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should carry out the strategic nuclear weapons 
reductions agreed upon with Moscow. This would lessen the  Russian 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 -->  nuclear threat while leaving the
U.S. with the forces it needs  both to protect itself should a political
reversal take place in  Moscow and to deter such lesser nuclear powers as China.
At the  same time, however, a policy of nuclear deterrence will be inadequate 
in a world where many nations possess both weapons of mass  destruction and
long-range delivery systems. With many  potentially unstable, even irrational,
regimes capable of delivering  nuclear weapons, strategic anti-missile defenses
are more essential  than ever. The Cold War policy of deliberate vulnerability
to  missile attack is unthinkable in this new international climate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Building missile defenses will not kill arms control.  Ronald Reagan signed
numerous arms reduction deals with the  Soviets while pursuing the Strategic
Defense Initiative (SDI). It would  be no different in the future. The Russians'
bluster against U.S.  strategic defense comes simply from their desire to keep
America  vulnerable to their strategic missiles, in which they have made such  a
huge investment, and which constitute their one surviving  qualification as a
global power. The U.S. should offer to discuss a  transition from an
offense-only posture to missile defenses by  both sides, but Russia should not
be permitted a veto over the  deployment of U.S. missile defenses.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be done about the ABM Treaty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should terminate the 1972 Anti-Ballistic  Missile (ABM)
Treaty. The treaty effectively bars the deployment of  effective,
non-threatening defenses. A new multilateral  agreement with all relevant
parties to provide for the mutual deployment  of such defenses should be
pursued.<A HREF="ftnt16.htm#11">11</A>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the U.S. military be reorganized to deal mainly  with
peacekeeping operations and not large wars, which are things  of the past?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. military exists for one principal reason: to fight  and
win America's wars. Under no circumstances can it fail in  that most profound
task. Given the many American security  commitments around the globe, the U.S.
military must train  continuously and arduously towards this goal. During the
Cold War, the  U.S. military concentrated almost exclusively on decisive 
battlefield engagements against the forces of the Soviet Union and the  Warsaw
Pact. It was this training and focus that gave America the  military prowess to
defeat Iraq so completely in the Persian Gulf  War. Such a commitment to winning
in combat must not be  squandered through continuous commitment to peacekeeping
operations or  a restructuring of vital combat units for such missions. The 
deployments to Somalia, Haiti, and Bosnia already have greatly  reduced the
combat capabilities of the military. Any further dilution of  this fundamental
mission stands to put the U.S. military in a  position similar to the one it
faced in Korea in 1950. At that time,  American occupation forces were untrained
for combat and nearly  wiped out by the North Korean invasion. America cannot
afford to  lose on the battlefield, and history conclusively proves that 
concentrating on military missions other than war increases the possibility  of
such a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B> Q. When should the U.S. support or participate in U.N.  peacekeeping
operations?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Only when it serves U.S. national interests. There are  many
humanitarian crises in the world, but neither the U.S. nor the  U.N. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  has the resources to deal with
every one. When America does  participate, U.S. troops must remain under U.S. or
allied, rather  than U.N., command. A peacekeeping mission must have clear 
command and control arrangements, adequate force, appropriate  criteria for
success, a definite endpoint, and a plan for  disengagement once success is
achieved. As a rule, U.S. military forces  should engage in allied combat
operations when their employment is  decisive, unique, and make the difference
between success and failure.

<P><B><A NAME="ISSUES2">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S. military exists for one principal reason: to fight and  win the
nation's wars. But an effective military force depends on  more than weapons,
equipment, and adequate defense budgets.  Such intangible human factors as
leadership, esprit de corps,  morale, mutual trust, and unit cohesion are as
vital to an effective  combat force as the material factors. These intangible
elements make  up the &quot;warrior ethos&quot; that is needed if U.S. armed
forces are to  win America's wars.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This ethos is under siege. The Clinton Administration has tried  to put
homosexuals in the military and women in combat  positions. This agenda of
political correctness will undermine the  combat effectiveness of U.S. forces if
allowed to continue unchecked. It  is eroding morale and corroding the mutual
trust that must exist in  an effective fighting organization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The goal of this agenda is to re-create the military services in  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  fashionable, liberal image.
Liberal social activists who exercise  an inordinate influence on the Clinton
Administration view the  military as a federally sponsored vehicle for social 
experimentation. Because they see it as the last bastion of &quot;male
domination,&quot;  liberals want to de-masculinize the military regardless of
the effect  on its capacity to do its only job, which is to fight and win 
America's wars. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Because the military is a command hierarchy, liberal social  activists
believe they can impose their agenda from the top down.  Most service members
oppose social engineering of this kind  because they know it saps the fighting
power of the services, and thus  exposes them to greater danger. But they are
intimidated from  speaking out, and often find their careers in jeopardy if they
do not  embrace the &quot;diversity&quot; agenda imposed on them from above.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS2">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs General Colin
Powell,  all serving Chiefs of Staff, and most former members of the  Joint
Chiefs have stated unequivocally that acknowledged  homosexuals in the
military's ranks are harmful to the good order and  discipline of the services.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      Women currently make up approximately 12 percent of the  U.S.
armed forces, more than any other nation's military. While  women do not serve
in so-called direct combat positions in the  infantry, armored, or field
artillery units, many are being assigned to  combat support units, combatant
ships, and pilot billets which put  them in harm's way. These assignments
inevitably would put women  in combat during a war.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     During the Persian Gulf War, American women soldiers  were
taken prisoner for the first time in U.S. history. These women  were sexually
abused by Iraqi captors. The possibility that women  prisoners will be raped and
tortured, or that large numbers of  women will be killed and wounded in action,
could have a  dramatically negative effect on American public opinion and on the
 nation's ability to prosecute a war. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     No other nation places women in combat posts, not even 
Israel, despite a common misconception to the contrary and even  though Israel
has a manpower shortage. Israel used women in combat  for a short time during
its war of independence and made it  policy never to do so again except in the
most dire national  emergencies. In the Israel Defense Force, women do receive
basic combat  training and may be attached to combat units in support roles, but
 they do not take part in combat operations. (Recently, the Israeli  Supreme
Court directed the Israeli armed forces to permit a  woman to train as a combat
pilot; she has since dropped out of flight  training.) Other nations, such as
Denmark, allow women to serve  in combat units but also note that they are not
likely to see combat.  In any event, Denmark concedes that its policy was
undertaken  to satisfy contemporary social mores and could hurt unit  cohesion
and combat readiness. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Introducing women into all combat specialties means creating 
two different standards in order to account for the physiological  differences
between women and men. A combat unit's effectiveness  is predicated on unit
cohesion, which is based in turn on the bonds  of trust among soldiers in a
unit. Training to two different  standards is the surest way to wreck unit
morale, raising problems of  favorit
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  ism and of training that does not
meet the standard required by  the mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Putting women in combat units degrades combat readiness.  For instance,
pregnant women are not able to deploy on military  missions with their units,
causing further problems of morale,  unit cohesion, and readiness. The aircraft
carrier USS Eisenhower  is the first U.S. naval ship to try to integrate men and
women. In  the first six months of a recent deployment, 14 women on  the
Eisenhower became pregnant while on cruise, and were freed  from their duties.
The message sent to sailors is that there are  different standards for men and
women, standards that are based not on  the capability of the individual to help
the team win in combat, but  on one's sex.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD2">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has instituted policies that would put women  in combat
and homosexuals in the military. Because the  President comes from an
aggressively anti-military background, these  decisions as Commander in Chief
have been resisted by the  American military establishment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For example, on April 28, 1993, the Clinton Administration  announced that
the Department of Defense would open certain  combat aviation positions to
women. This change in policy affected  all three services and made women
available for duty in all  aviation units, including air cavalry units in the
Army. Women  currently are barred only from direct participation in infantry,
armor,  and some artillery units.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Moreover, early in his Administration, the President revoked  the
long-standing military ban on homosexuals, establishing instead  a fuzzy &quot;don't
ask, don't tell&quot; policy that simply prohibits open  displays of
homosexuality. This policy is a poor compromise  between the President and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, who were  concerned about the adverse impact of lifting
the ban. It makes it  technically legal for homosexuals to serve in the armed
forces, but also  allows them to be discharged for openly displaying homosexual 
behavior. As might be expected from such an ambiguous compromise,  the policy
has been challenged in several court cases but with  unclear results, being
upheld in some decisions and struck down in  others. Congress has hidden behind
the compromise language, refusing  to hold hearings or conduct proper oversight
of Defense  Department regulations implementing the law prohibiting open 
homosexuals from serving, as passed in the FY 1995 Defense authorization bill. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> President Clinton also objected to provisions in the 1996  Defense
authorization bill that allow the military to  discharge servicemembers
diagnosed with HIV, the virus that causes  AIDS. This ban was imposed because
HIV-positive  servicemembers could infect other members in combat operations.
This is in  keeping with existing military policy that prevents the deployment 
of servicemembers with other contagious or debilitating  diseases. President
Clinton maintains that this discriminates against  HIV-positive personnel; the
Department of Defense maintains that  because HIV-positive servicemembers cannot
serve on  deployments, they should not continue to serve while others must
deploy in  their place. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To ensure that the U.S. military continues to do its job of  fighting and
winning America's wars, the Administration and  Congress should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Return to the Chiefs of Staff the power to determine social 
policies based on the requirement to fight and win in combat.</B> The  service
Chiefs are charged by law to provide the best military advice to  the President
and Secretary of Defense, and the best command  guidance to their respective
services. They have a heavy  responsibility and must be allowed to put the
nation's defense needs and  the combat capabilities of the services ahead of the
political  pressures or passing social agendas of the moment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Eliminate the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the  Service.</B>
This committee was set up after the Korean War to advise  the Chiefs of Staff on
women's issues in the service. Over the  years, however, it has become a vehicle
for promoting the  legislative agendas of militant homosexual lobbies, feminist 
organizations, and other liberal pressure groups. In addition, similar 
organizations in the services should be focused on the challenge of  maintaining
equality and professionalism in the military while promoting  the warrior ethos
and military ethic among all members of the  service. They should not advance
the radical agendas of groups who  view the military as &quot;just another job&quot;
and believe it needs to be  restructured so its values and ethics are in line
with those of  contemporary society.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Ensure that the military oversight committees of Congress  protect
the careers of loyal service officers who properly advise  against the social
engineering agenda.</B> For instance, congressional  oversight  which includes
final approval of military promotion lists   
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  must ensure that exemplary
officers like Commander  Robert Stumpf, U.S. Navy, are not ridden out of the
service as the  result of a political correctness witch hunt. Commander Stumpf,
a  Naval aviator and former commander of the Navy's precision  combat flying
team, was denied promotion because he attended the  notorious Tailhook
convention in 1991. Even though a Navy  investigation completely exonerated him
of any connection with the  events of Tailhook, Commander Stumpf was denied
promotion by a  Senate Armed Services Committee policy that the Navy notify  the
committee of all officers who attended the Tailhook  convention. Such egregious
bows to political correctness are nonsensical,  unjust, and damaging to morale.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Abandon the confusing &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; policy 
regarding homosexuals in the military.</B> This policy is a clear example of  a
President who wants to have his cake and eat it too. As a result,  the policy is
under legal challenge in two different courts and  most likely will need to be
settled by the Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A2">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the services ban women from combat and  homosexuals from
military service?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Advocates of women in combat and homosexuals in the  military
view military service as similar to any other job and  assume that gender or
sexual orientation are insignificant in the  military environment. They are
wrong. Combat is a team endeavor and  the most demanding environment 
physically, mentally, and  morally  that one can endure. It is not a &quot;job&quot;
but a life-and-death  under
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  taking. The primary criterion for
inclusion must be the ability  of the individual to enhance  not to detract from
 the  effectiveness of the unit. A military organization functions best when 
differences among individuals in a unit are minimized. That is why  soldiers are
required to look, act, dress, and train alike. It makes  no sense to break down
all of these differences only to inject  the greatest difference of all 
individual sexual identity  into a unit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Professional military judgment and experience indicate that  mixing known
homosexuals with heterosexuals undermines  cohesion and combat effectiveness.
Common sense suggests that men  and women distract each other even when trying
not to do so. In  combat, such distractions can be the difference between life
and  death. The purpose of the military is to build the most effective  fighting
force to defeat an enemy as quickly, and with as few  American casualties, as
possible. Differences in sexual identity will  weaken discipline and
effectiveness, thus making it more difficult to  prevail in combat.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Access to the military has never been based on what is &quot;fair.&quot;  
Military service is a privilege and sometimes a duty, but never  a right.
Because victories in combat are achieved by cohesive  units, the armed forces
routinely sacrifice individual interests to  ensure unit cohesion. Military
service is legally restricted or denied  to patriotic Americans who are too
tall, too short, too fat,  color-blind, flat-footed, or mentally or physically
handicapped. This is no  reflection on the inherent worth of these individuals;
they simply  do not meet the military's needs.<A
HREF="ftnt16.htm#12">12</A>  For the same reason,  women
should be barred from combat and known homosexuals should  be excluded entirely
from military service.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Before the military was desegregated in 1948, many of  the same
arguments used today to oppose gays in the military  were used to oppose blacks
in the service. Can't America's GIs learn  to live and work with homosexuals in
the same way they learned  to live and work with black Americans?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As General Powell  himself a black man  has explained,  being
black is a benign condition, a matter of birth. On the  other hand, homosexual
activity is not. It is a gross fallacy to equate  the two. Moreover, black
Americans have proven themselves on  the field of battle and in every other
military function. They  have made remarkable contributions to the military and
to the  nation's security, and are recognized universally among the best 
soldiers, sailors, Marines, and airmen in the world. On the other hand,  the
open acceptance of homosexuality in the ranks almost  always causes problems of
morale and discipline.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. If a woman can perform the same job as a man, why  can't women hold
combat jobs?  To limit women to support roles  also limits their career
opportunities for advancement in the military.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The fundamental purpose of military service is to  defend
America, not to advance careers. There can be only one  standard for a warrior,
and that is determined by what it takes to fight  and win in combat. The great
majority of women in the military,  and even some men, cannot meet the physical
standards required  for service in combat units. Having different standards for
men  and women would ruin morale and unit cohesion. Putting women  in combat
also would raise a host of thorny questions, among  them: How will the
inevitable formation of male-female special  relationships affect discipline and
unit cohesion, which are essential  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 -->  success in combat?  How can a
woman's privacy be respected  adequately in combat conditions?  What would be
the effect  on troops and the impact on public support for a combat mission if 
a number of females were taken prisoner and abused by their  captors or
exploited for psychological warfare or propaganda advantage?   How would
official and legal efforts to prevent sexual  harassment of women prevent the
rise of double standards and the  inevitable breakdown of morale and unit
cohesion?

<P>

<P><B>A</B>merica is a global power with vital interests in key regions of 
the world, specifically in Europe, Asia, Latin America, and the  Middle East.
America fought two world wars in this century to  preserve freedom and stability
in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region,  and then endured the long twilight
struggle of the Cold War,  including shooting wars in Korea and Vietnam, to
protect Europe and  Asia from communist domination. In effect, the U.S. is both
a  European and Pacific power. It has maintained a military presence in  Europe
and Asia since the end of the Second World War to protect  vital links of trade,
communication, and cultural exchange. And  even though the Cold War is over,
U.S. security interests still  require America's military, political, and
economic involvement in  European and Asian affairs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf War dramatized the vital interests of  America and the
world's industrialized democracies in the Middle  East. U.S. air and naval
forces patrol the Eastern Mediterranean  and keep watch on the potential threat
from Iraq and Iran to the  Persian Gulf, still the source of much of the free
world's energy  supplies. In fact, the U.S. depends more on crude oil from the
Gulf  today than it did when Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To make the world safe for America, the U.S. needs to keep  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  vital regions of Europe, Asia, and
the Persian Gulf free of  hostile domination. This strategy requires a mixture
of diplomacy  and military deterrence. The U.S. must maintain its military 
alliances in these regions and adapt them to new conditions. At the  same time,
new types of relationships with friends and allies, based  on trade and
commercial ties, must be advanced to supplement  (and possibly, in some cases,
replace) old ones based on military  alliances.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect America's interests in various regions of the world,  the U.S.
needs some forces deployed overseas, the capability to  respond rapidly and
effectively to regional crises, and the ability  to support U.S. forces that
have been deployed overseas from  the continental United States. Effective
regional security  strategies, coupled with the means and the will to carry them
out, not  only will allow the U.S. to prevail in the event of a conflict, but 
also may deter aggression in the first place.

<a href="bosnia.gif">Map 1</a>: The NATO Mission in Bosnia: Operation Joint Endeavor
<p>
<B><A NAME="ISSUES">THE ISSUES
</A></B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>During the Cold War, the U.S. was primarily responsible for  guaranteeing
that Western Europe would not be dominated by a  hostile power. With the demise
of the Soviet Union, many  Americans wonder what role America should play in
Europe and exactly  how the American role in the Atlantic alliance should be
defined. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some Americans believe that the U.S. should simply pull its  military forces
out of Europe. Others warn against such an action.  Historically, when it has
taken no notice of European affairs, the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  has been called upon to intervene
in conflicts that threaten the  global balance of power and the safety of
America as well. This  was the case in the First and Second World Wars and
during the  Cold War. Proponents of U.S. military involvement in Europe argue 
that America had to help defend Europe in order to defend the  security and
liberty of the American people. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The issue today is how to structure America's participation in  European
security. Should the U.S. be primarily a peacemaker in  settling civil wars like
the one in Bosnia?  Or should it confine  itself to the core mission of
collective defense, defending Europe  from major power threats regardless of the
source or sources of  those threats? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>These questions are at the heart of the debate over NATO's  future. NATO has
been undergoing an identity crisis since the  Soviet Union collapsed. At issue
is whether the U.S. and its allies, in  order to make NATO more relevant, should
task the alliance  with out-of-area missions, including peacekeeping, peace 
enforcement, and other security activities NATO was never intended to  perform.
But this search for a new role could turn NATO into an  organization like the
United Nations, which, because of its many  different members and missions, is
not suited to organizing and  directing significant military operations. In the
end, some fear NATO  could become no more effective than the U.N. is now.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>For some in America, the question is not how the U.S. role  in NATO should
be defined, but whether the U.S. should be  in NATO at all. Others argue that
America's 100,000 troops in  Europe act as a stabilizing force that enhances
European  security; they believe that the American military presence in Europe
is  an 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  insurance policy against the
threat of war between any of  Europe's major powers. The cost of maintaining
these troops is a matter  for legitimate debate, but given the costs of a
European  conflagration, it is well worth paying. Those Americans who advocate 
pulling U.S. military forces out of Europe or reducing the U.S. presence  to a
skeleton force are saying, in essence, that the U.S. has no  vital national
interests in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious NATO issue involves the peacekeeping  operation in
Bosnia-Herzegovina. The U.S. is heavily involved in  the NATO Peace
Implementation Force in Bosnia, and while  the Clinton Administration has
promised to end the mission after  a one-year deployment, many questions arise:
If the promised  peace does not take hold, and especially if Americans are drawn
 into combat with one or more Bosnian factions, will the U.S. be able  to
withdraw on schedule?  
</P>
<P>Will the U.S. be able withdraw in the midst of renewed  fighting and
possible American casualties without the appearance of  an ignominious retreat,
and without harming U.S. credibility  and prestige?  What happens if peace has
not taken hold at the end  of one year?  Will the U.S. pull out anyway, bringing
the  European peacekeepers out with it? 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>NATO expansion is another significant issue in the debate  over Europe and
the U.S. role in Europe. NATO expansion would  extend NATO's zone of peace,
democracy, stability, and freedom  to its new members. Many security experts
believe that the  Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO
enlargement out  of fear of offending Russia. They maintain that Russia has an 
implicit veto over extending NATO membership to new democracies  in Central
Europe. However, critics of expansion maintain that  en
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  larging NATO will only encourage
an adversarial response  from Russia and may precipitate a return to Cold
War-style  relations. These critics also insist that expanding NATO will dilute
the  alliance, enlarging its commitments while weakening its basic  structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The economic prosperity of the United States is closely tied 
to trade with Europe. Europe is America's second largest  customer, taking 31
percent of American exports and providing 29 percent  of imports. Fifty percent
of direct American investment abroad is  in Europe and over 60 percent of direct
foreign investment in  the U.S. comes from Europe. Over three million Americans
are  employed in the U.S. by European-owned firms, and another 1.5  million
American workers are supported directly by U.S. exports  to Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The United States maintains approximately 100,000 troops in 
Europe, and most of the troops involved in the Bosnia peace  implementation plan
were taken from U.S. forces based in  Europe. These forces are a key element in
America's national strategy  for two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>1) European-based forces contribute directly to European 
stability and security</B> by giving clear evidence of America's  commitment,
and 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>2) The forces stationed in Europe are one ocean closer to many  of the
regions</B> in which the U.S. might be called to fight.  Approximately half of
the U.S. combat units deployed during  Operation 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  Desert Storm came directly from
Europe.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     NATO still consists of the 16 nations that belonged to the 
alliance at the end of the Cold War. France recently decided to rejoin  the
integrated NATO military structure, at least partially, after  leaving it in
1966. Spain, the NATO Secretary-General's home country,  is not integrated fully
into NATO's military structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Besides NATO's 16 full members, there are 27 states enrolled 
in the Clinton Administration's Partnership for Peace program, a  U.S.
initiative that enables non-NATO nations to associate with  and apply for
membership in NATO. Almost every country of  Eastern Europe and the former
Soviet Union is a member of the  Partnership for Peace, designed as an
intermediate step to membership  in NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     A European collective security organization often touted by 
the Russians as a possible substitute for NATO is the Organization  for Security
and Cooperation in Europe. Despite having over 50  members, however, OSCE is
little more than a &quot;talking shop&quot; for  general issues of European
security.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Clinton Administration estimates that the Bosnia Peace 
Implementation Force will cost the U.S. between $2 billion and $3  billion per
year, but this does not include costs for the  reconstruction of civilian
infrastructure in Bosnia. Many experts believe that  the actual cost will be
closer to twice that predicted by the  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     European integration under the auspices of the European  Union
(EU) is proceeding more slowly than expected, and there is  no 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  certainty of a federal Europe, a
European army, or even a  unified currency in the immediate future. Last year
the EU expanded  to include Sweden, Finland, and Austria. Further expansion, 
especially in Eastern Europe, is not expected anytime soon,  although most
former Warsaw Pact countries are eager to join the EU.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on NATO  enlargement and
missed an important window of opportunity for  offering membership to Poland,
the Czech Republic, Hungary,  and Slovakia, the most likely candidates for NATO
membership.  Instead of expanding Europe's zone of peace, security, and  freedom
to Central Europe, President Clinton has taken counsel of his  fears and handed
the Russians an implicit veto over when, where,  and how NATO should expand.
What has the U.S. received in return?   A meaningless Russian troop
participation in the Bosnian  peacekeeping operation  something of only marginal
interest to  the U.S. Every day NATO delays enlargement, opposition from  the
Russians grows. Former communists have regained power in  Central and Eastern
Europe and may soon do the same in Russia.  Unless the U.S. Administration acts
soon, the opportunity to  enlarge NATO may disappear.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The GOP's Contract With America called for NATO expansion  in the form of
near-term membership for Poland, Hungary, the  Czech Republic, and Slovakia.
Both the House and Senate versions of  the foreign operations bill contained
language supporting this  expansion but neither specifically nor legally
mandating a concrete  time frame for expansion.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Even as the Clinton Administration has delayed NATO  expansion, it has
committed U.S. power and prestige to a questionable  peacekeeping operation in
Bosnia. President Clinton has deployed  over 35,000 U.S. troops to support the
Peace Implementation  Force (IFOR). These troops are stationed in Croatia,
Hungary, Italy,  and afloat in the Adriatic Sea, and include 20,000 U.S. combat 
troops in northeastern Bosnia. His reason: to keep faith with U.S.  allies and
preserve NATO. But failure in Bosnia could wreck the  very cohesion that the
President hopes to preserve. If IFOR  fails, NATO could fail with it.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Administration does not have an exit strategy for U.S.  forces in
Bosnia, the President invented one by promising that U.S.  forces will return
home in &quot;about a year.&quot;  Such an ambiguous and  poorly defined
commitment endangers the U.S. soldiers involved,  opens the door for &quot;mission
creep,&quot; and raises the possibility of a  long and open-ended commitment to
a mission that may never succeed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The President assumes unrealistically that within a year the  new state of
Bosnia-Herzegovina will have resettled all  refugees, settled all territorial
disputes, conducted free and democratic  elections, and formed a new
constitutional central government  based on an elaborate power-sharing
agreement. Most experts agree  that these issues will take much longer to settle
and that U.S.  troops either will leave too soon to make a lasting contribution
or,  even worse, will be drawn into new roles and mandates that prolong  an
already ill-advised U.S. commitment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most troubling issues is what to do with indicted  war criminals.
If NATO tries to arrest them, the aggrieved faction  may pull out of the
agreement. But if these war criminals are ignored  or 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  released, the other side may take
matters into its own hands  and resume the fighting.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>From the beginning, Congress was reluctant to support  the Bosnian mission.
On December 13, 1995, the Senate voted  69-30 in favor of the Dole-McCain
resolution, which supports the  men and women in uniform but &quot;does not
endorse the President's  decision [or] the agreement reached in Dayton.&quot; 
The House was  more critical and voted 287-141 to condemn the mission while 
expressing support for the troops being deployed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To protect U.S. interests in Europe, the Administration and  Congress
should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Declare that America's vital national interest in Europe lies in 
preventing the domination of the continent by a hostile power or  bloc of
powers.</B> This is a clear and focused national interest. A  major power threat
to Europe would present a political and  economic threat to the peace, security,
and prosperity of the United  States itself, and America must be prepared to
defend this interest  with military action. This is done most effectively
through NATO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Clearly define the role the U.S. will play in European security 
affairs and NATO.</B> First, an American military role must be  focused on the
core mission of NATO: collective defense. America  can support peacekeeping or
other out-of-area operations, but  the American contribution to NATO operations
should be  focused primarily on this core mission. Second, American military 
involvement should make a unique and decisive contribution to  any NATO
operation. American power will be squandered if it is  used 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  only to address peripheral and
marginal security issues that  the European allies are reluctant to undertake
themselves. This  will promote a clear and sensible division of labor with
America's  European allies and show the American people that the Europeans  are
&quot;pulling their weight&quot; as well.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the Europeans to take the lead in addressing  marginal
and peripheral security problems while guaranteeing an active  U.S. support role
in these endeavors.</B> In the past, an  American-led NATO effort was the only
option available for dealing with  a range of security issues in Europe. The
U.S. must promote a  more flexible range of responses to the many different
types of  security problems in and around Europe. When the U.S. role is 
re-focused on collective defense, the European powers can work  through other
structures (such as the Western European Union or OSCE)  to manage more marginal
security problems. This also will  prevent NATO from trying to become all things
to all people,  thereby minimizing the risk that the alliance could become an 
unwieldy and emasculated collective security organization instead of a  focused
and robust instrument of collective defense.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Offer immediate NATO membership to Poland, Hungary,  the Czech
Republic, and Slovakia and drop the implicit guarantee  of membership for other
countries in the Partnership for Peace.</B>  The addition of these countries to
Europe will expand NATO's zone  of peace and freedom and contribute to the core
mission of  collective defense against a major power threat to Europe. These 
countries are best suited for NATO membership. They have  demonstrated their
commitment to democracy, and their membership makes  strategic and geopolitical
sense for NATO. While other countries  can maintain a relationship with the PFP
or develop new ties with  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  Western European Union, these
four Central European  countries should be the only new members admitted to NATO
itself.  Any more countries would be practically impossible for NATO to  defend
and assimilate.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Lower expectations for &quot;success&quot; in the Bosnia peace 
implementation mission.</B> This can be done by limiting the U.S. military role 
to purely military functions and to operations that are both  clearly definable
and achievable. Above all, the U.S. must avoid  &quot;mission creep,&quot; or
escalation of the mission, in which IFOR might be  given long-term
nation-building or war crimes tasks. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage the European Union to maintain free trading  relations
with the U.S. and avoid instituting protectionist trade  measures.</B> The U.S.
should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested European countries,
including those in Central and Eastern  Europe. This should be initiated through
a &quot;framework agreement&quot;  to ensure that the EU and the U.S. stay on
track to create a  world-wide free trade regime in line with the WTO and GATT 
agreements. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q &amp; A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Cold War is over, and Europe is now full of many  prosperous
democratic states. Can't they bear the burden of their own  security?  Why do we
need to keep hundreds of thousands of  American troops over there?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> To defend our own freedom and security. A secure Europe is  a
vital U.S. interest. American freedom could not long endure if  all of Europe
with its resources and power were turned against  us. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  Besides, the continued peace and
stability of Europe gives  considerable economic benefit to the United States.
Europe takes  almost one-third of U.S. exports and supplies 30 percent of
American  imports. Almost half of U.S. direct investment abroad is in Europe. 
In addition, millions of Americans are employed in the U.S. by  European-owned
firms, and millions more are supported by U.S.  exports to Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't NATO expansion alienate Russia and risk creating a  new Cold
War with a new Iron Curtain in Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NATO membership brings security and stability. Therefore,  by
extending membership to Poland, the Czech Republic,  Slovakia, and Hungary, NATO
can help stabilize an area of Europe that  has rarely been either stable or
prosperous. NATO can work with  Moscow throughout this process to explain that
limited enlargement  is no threat to Russia. This should be done while the U.S.
has  relatively good relations with a friendly Russian administration.  The
return to power of a more nationalist Russian administration  is possible down
the road and would make NATO expansion  considerably more difficult. In any
event, however, Russian opposition  to NATO expansion is motivated mainly by
internal political  debates and economic instability, not by any real fear of
the West.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Won't expanding NATO just draw a line between East  and West, fueling
a new Cold War?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> This is a line that inevitably must be drawn somewhere, 
sometime, unless you assume Russia will become a NATO member   something that is
both inadvisable and highly unlikely. Those  who complain about drawing lines
between East and West are  really 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  saying that they do not want the
free and democratic systems  of Western Europe moved east. NATO need not expand
to all  countries in Central and Eastern Europe, but it should incorporate 
those Central European states that strategically make sense to  NATO and which
politically, economically, and culturally already are  part of Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should U.S. soldiers fight and die in a place like Bosnia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. soldiers should not fight and die in Bosnia, at least  under
current circumstances. American troops should be committed  to hostilities only
where their sacrifice is needed to protect  America's vital national interests.
That interest in Europe is to prevent  the continent from being dominated by a
hostile power or bloc of  powers. This is the core mission of NATO. American
combat  troops should not be deployed in the middle of peripheral civil wars  in
order to enforce a tenuous and cosmetic peace. The contribution  of American
combat forces to NATO must be unique and decisive,  as well as oriented toward
NATO's core mission of collective  defense.
</P>
<P>

<P><B>Q. What are U.S. interests in the Balkans?  What should we  do there now
that we are involved in the peacekeeping operation?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. has a vital national interest in ensuring that Europe 
is not threatened by a major hostile power. To guarantee that  this vital
interest is protected, the U.S. should be willing to use  American combat
forces. The ethnic conflict in Bosnia does not  threaten the peace and stability
of Europe in this way. However, the  U.S. can assist the lead efforts of its
European allies in containing  and helping to resolve this conflict. The U.S.
can provide  logistical, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  intelligence, and air support for
European peacekeeping  operations, but American troops need not be involved
where  European troops can do the job. However, now that U.S. troops are there 
as part of IFOR, the U.S. should ensure that their mission is limited  to purely
military operations. Military objectives should be  clearly defined, and upon
achieving them, U.S. military forces  should leave. U.S. forces should not be
involved in rebuilding  Bosnia's political, economic, or social institutions.
This would be the  first step on the road to &quot;mission creep&quot; and would
ensure that  U.S. forces are drawn into the conflict with no clear exit in
sight.

<p>
<P><A NAME="ISSUESA"><B>THE ISSUES
</B></A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America's interests in Asia have remained consistent for two  centuries.
These interests are freedom of navigation, commercial  access to markets, and
preventing the domination of the region by  a hostile power or coalition of such
powers. The question  looming before America today is whether the United States
will retain  the leadership role in Asia required to defend these interests. 
After over three years of indecisive and faulty leadership from  the Clinton
Administration, the U.S. leadership role is in doubt.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Nowhere is this more evident than in the President's policies  toward the
People's Republic of China (PRC). The Clinton  Administration has failed to
follow a consistent and coherent strategy  in dealing with China. As a result,
the U.S. has lost much of its  credibility in the region. For example, the
President, like many  liberals, tried to link trade with China to Beijing's
performance on  human rights issues. Conservatives, on the other hand, believing
that  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  best way to encourage democracy
and promote human rights  is through open trade, opposed early attempts by
Clinton to  deny China most-favored-nation trading status. Ultimately, the 
President had to reverse course, implicitly admitting the bankruptcy of  his
policies, but his inconstancy weakened his hand in dealing  with the Chinese and
undermined U.S. credibility in the region.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is how to deal with the PRC's attempts  to
intimidate the Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC). Bill  Clinton has demonstrated
an inclination to succumb to bullying  from Beijing. In early 1995, he sided at
first with the mainland  Chinese against granting a visa to permit Taiwan's
President, Lee  Teng-hui, to make an unofficial visit to the United States. He 
reversed course abruptly, granting the visa in May 1995, but only after 
pressure from Congress. Subsequently, the President was  painfully slow to
recognize the seriousness of Beijing's threats of  military force against the
ROC, including the testing of  nuclear-capable missiles in the vicinity of
Taiwan. Even when the  Administration abandoned its policy of ineffectual
diplomacy in March, after  three test missiles landed near two Taiwanese ports,
the Clinton  team shrank from labeling the Chinese actions for what they are  
political terrorism. Finally, mainly because of opposition  from Beijing,
Clinton has failed to provide adequate support  for Taiwan's entry into
international economic organizations like  the World Trade Organization, the
World Bank, and the  International Monetary Fund. Taiwan deserves membership in
these  organizations because of its growing status as an economic  powerhouse
and emerging democracy in Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of the President's China policies argue that  Beijing should not
be allowed to dictate the terms of America's  unofficial 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  relations with Taiwan  terms
established by the 1979  Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which stipulates that
although the U.S.  does not have official relations with the ROC, it does stand
ready  to help Taiwan defend itself. Critics of the President insist that 
Taiwan should have the weapons necessary to defend its security  and that, if
necessary, the U.S. should provide the ROC with  these weapons. In particular,
it should be working with Taiwan to  build a defense against the PRC's ballistic
missiles, which threaten  Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On the Korean peninsula, the issue is how to restore trust and  confidence
to the U.S.-South Korea alliance. In pursuing its  nuclear bargain with North
Korea, called the Agreed Framework,  the Clinton Administration marginalized the
role of its ally South  Korea. Negotiating directly with North Korea, the U.S. 
got Pyongyang to freeze its nuclear weapons program in return  for help in
converting its nuclear reactors to peaceful purposes.  The North has used the
agreement to open a direct channel to the  U.S. while continuing to vilify and
shun South Korea.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of Clinton's policies contend that this approach  has damaged
relations with an important ally, South Korea. They  also insist that progress
in the North-South dialogue should be linked  to implementation of the Framework
Agreement. America has a  vital interest in deterring a North Korean attack on
the South  an  interest that has not been given adequate attention by the
Clinton  Administration. North Korea's million-man army stands only a  few miles
away from the South Korean capital of Seoul and the  37,000 U.S. troops near the
North-South border. Reducing this  conventional military threat from the North
should be equally as  important as eliminating Pyongyang's nuclear weapons
potential.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 17 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On Japan, the issue dividing Clinton and his opponents is how  best to
sustain and strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance while  advancing deregulation and
the further opening of Japan's markets.  Critics argue that Bill Clinton made
two fundamental mistakes in  his policy toward Japan: He put economics and trade
at the center  of the U.S.-Japan relationship, and he attempted to use a highly 
confrontational managed-trade strategy to force internal change  in Japan.
Neither policy worked. Clinton's November 1994 and  June 1995 trade deals with
Japan did little to open Japan's market  to U.S. goods; instead they damaged
U.S.-Japan military alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.S.-Japan security alliance remains the key to peace  and prosperity in
Asia. Relations with Japan must be managed  with this fact in mind. This is a
realization Bill Clinton came to  only belatedly. In 1995, the Pentagon, under
the leadership of  Assistant Secretary Joseph Nye, undertook a major initiative
aimed  at strengthening the alliance; at the same time, the Clinton trade  team
backed off from its confrontational approach. Managed trade is  not the answer
to the trade deficit with Japan; it only reinforces  the clout of bureaucratic
elements hostile to free trade. A far  better approach, Clinton's critics
maintain, is for the U.S. to  support forces inside Japan advocating
deregulation and the further  opening of Japan's market. These are America's
allies inside Japan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On trade in Asia, the issue is whether the U.S. will or will not  take the
lead in opening up Asian markets to U.S. goods and  services. Bill Clinton
claims to support trade liberalization in Asia, but  he leaves the heavy lifting
to others. In 1994, the President agreed  to work with leaders of the
Asia-Pacific Economic  Cooperation (APEC) forum to create an Asia-Pacific
free-trade area by the  year 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  2020. But at an APEC meeting in
Tokyo last year, he not  only failed to show up; he also left the U.S.
delegation without  authority to make substantial commitments on his behalf.
Critics  believe the President's commitment to APEC and free trade in Asia  is
lukewarm and largely rhetorical. To advance free trade and  American prosperity,
they believe, the President should ask Congress  for &quot;fast-track&quot;
authority to negotiate free-trade agreements in  Asia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The major issue in Southeast Asia is how to respond to rising  instability
in Cambodia, where Bill Clinton has failed to use the  leverage provided by U.S.
economic assistance to advance  American interests. Indifferent to Washington's
diplomatic protests, the  government of Cambodia has proceeded to ban political 
opposition parties, attack press freedoms, and even assassinate  journalists.
Critics of the President argue that the U.S. should not tolerate  such assaults
on the democratically elected government in  Cambodia and that future U.S.
economic assistance must depend  on Cambodia's respect for democratic freedoms
and human rights.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     Asia is the home of the world's most dynamic and
most  rapidly growing economies. America's two-way trade across the Pacific  is
now approximately one-third larger than America's trade with  Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Exports to Asia in 1994 totaled more than $153 billion, with 
the nations of the region purchasing $45 billion more from  American companies
than the 15 nations of the European Union and  $30 billion more than Europe as a
whole. In 1994, more than 3  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  Americans owed their jobs to U.S.
exports to Asia, and of these  3 million jobs, more than 428,000 were created in
1994 alone.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The most immediate threat to U.S. security interests comes 
from North Korea's enduring hostility toward South Korea, a U.S.  ally. During
the 1970s and 1980s, North Korea pursued a nuclear  weapons development program,
now frozen under the 1994  Framework Agreement between the U.S. and North Korea.
North  Korea's graphite-moderated reactors have produced between 7 and 22 
kilograms of plutonium, enough for from 2 to 6 nuclear devices.  In addition,
North Korea has an active missile development  program; its Soviet-made <I>SCUD
</I>ballistic missiles are capable of  reaching Seoul, the capital of the
Republic of Korea, and even  threatening U.S. forces stationed in Japan. And its
million-man  conventional army remains deployed within 26 miles of Seoul. South 
Korean active-duty forces number approximately 650,000; U.S. forces  in the
Republic of Korea number approximately 37,000, forward  deployed mostly along
the 38th parallel.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      A second major threat to U.S. security interests arises  from
China's aggressive behavior. In February 1995, the Chinese  navy occupied
Mischief Reef, an atoll in the South China Sea  well within the Philippines'
Exclusive Economic Zone, which is  internationally recognized by the Law of the
Sea Convention.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Against the Republic of China on Taiwan, Beijing has conducted
 a campaign of military intimidation in response to the visit to  the United
States of Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui. This  campaign was highlighted by
Beijing's testing of nuclear-capable  intermediate range ballistic missiles 100
miles north of Taiwan.  Six test firings of these missiles took place on July
21-26 1995.  On 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 20 -->  March 8, 1995, China fired three
test M-9 missiles into two  zones astride Taiwan's largest ports and near
international sea and  air lanes. The M-9 missile can carry conventional,
chemical,  or nuclear warheads.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In l978, the U.S. diplomatically recognized the People's 
Republic of China as the sole government of China. However, the U.S.  has
maintained unofficial relations with the Republic of China on  Taiwan under the
Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) of 1979. The TRA  has allowed the U.S. to maintain
commercial, educational,  cultural, and defense  but not diplomatic  relations
with Taiwan.  The U.S. acknowledges that Beijing claims a &quot;One-China 
policy,&quot; which the PRC interprets as including sovereignty over  Taiwan,
but the U.S. does not officially recognize the legitimacy of  this claim.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan held its first democratic 
presidential elections on March 23, 1996. President Lee Teng-hui  was elected in
an overwhelming victory, despite weeks of  Chinese threats and saber-rattling.
This was the first democratic election  of a leader in Chinese history.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The Republic of China on Taiwan, like the PRC, has made clear 
its interest in joining the World Trade Organization (WTO).  This body was set
up in 1995 under the auspices of the General  Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or
GATT. Thus far, however,  neither the ROC nor the PRC has met the requirements
for WTO  membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is America's largest overseas market, importing more 
goods and services from the U.S. than the United Kingdom and  Germany 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  combined. Japan imported some $70
billion in goods and  services from the U.S. in 1994, supporting 1.4 million
American jobs.  Over 60 percent of U.S. exports to Japan is made up of 
manufactured goods, which support 840,000 American jobs. Japan is  America's
largest overseas market for agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In 1989, with strong support from the United States, the 
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) was established  to promote trade
liberalization in the region. Five years later,  at Bogor, Indonesia, the
leaders of the region's economies  pledged themselves to create a free-trade
area in Asia by 2020.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      United States security strategy toward the Asia-Pacific
region  is based on a network of bilateral alliances with Japan, the  Republic
of Korea, Australia, Thailand, and the Philippines. America's  military forces
in Japan and the Republic of Korea are committed  to the defense of U.S. allies
and to the protection of American  interests in the region.1  U.S. forces in
Okinawa also are an  integral part of this commitment. Japan provides some $4
billion in  host nation support for U.S. forces and another $1 billion in a 
facilities improvement program. ROK cost-sharing is $330 million for  1996 and
will increase to $400 million by 1998.

</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORDA">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in Asia is one of  confusion and failed
leadership. In a startling admission, Clinton's own  Assistant Secretary for
East Asian and Pacific Affairs, Winston  Lord, in 1994 said that the
Administration's Asia policies have  produced an &quot;emerging malaise&quot; 
an environment in which &quot;Asian  and others view us as placating domestic
special interest groups  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->  criticize us for tactics that
destabilize relationships which are  central to the region's peace and 
prosperity.&quot;<A HREF="ftnt17.htm#1">1</A>  Unfortunately,
the mid-course corrections which Lord called for have not been  made. As a
result, the danger of lost influence has only increased.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Risking Alliances with Japan and the Republic of Korea.  The Clinton
Administration's Japan policy, focused initially on  efforts to manage trade,
has been acrimonious and counterproductive.  In 1993-1995 talks with the
Japanese, the Clinton trade team  demanded that the Japanese government accept
numerical targets  or indicators to ensure that the U.S. trade deficit with
Japan would  be reduced. While taking constructive steps toward deregulation, 
the Japanese government successfully resisted the U.S. demand  for enforceable
targets. After denying that its confrontational  trade policies were harming the
U.S.-Japan alliance, the  Administration, led by the Pentagon, in 1995 belatedly
engaged in a damage  limitation effort to reaffirm the alliance. Known as the
Nye  Initiative, after then-Assistant Secretary of Defense Joseph Nye, this 
undertaking publicly highlighted the importance of the security  relationship
with Japan. But U.S. relations with Japan received  another blow in late 1995
when, citing domestic priorities during the  November budget negotiations with
Congress, the President  canceled a scheduled trip to Tokyo which was supposed
to be the  centerpiece of this campaign to reaffirm the U.S.-Japan  alliance.
Clinton's Asian advisors had warned that shunning the  Japanese would amount to
&quot;a body-blow&quot; to the alliance. To patch up  relations, Clinton
scheduled a summit with the Japanese in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another key relationship in Asia has been weakened by  the President's
policies toward the Republic of Korea. A  democracy and free-market economy,
South Korea is a military ally of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 -->  United States. This alliance is
aimed at Communist North  Korea, which remains focused on uniting the Korean
peninsula under  its leadership. In addition to the threat of its million-man
army,  North Korea has long been suspected of pursuing a nuclear weapons 
development program. The Clinton Administration struck a  diplomatic bargain
with North Korea in October 1994 to freeze  its nuclear program in exchange for
internationally financed and  constructed light water reactors. Thus was born
the U.S.-North  Korean Agreed Framework, which permits North Korea to put off
for  at least five years international inspections of its nuclear  facilities.
These inspections are required by the Non-Proliferation Treaty  of 1968, to
which North Korea is a signatory. So far, North Korea  has honored its
commitments in the Framework Agreement and  maintained the freeze on its
reactors, but it remains to be seen  whether it will do so in the future. And
the fact remains that North  Korea was able to extract concessions from the U.S.
in exchange for  doing what it already was obligated to do under international
law.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the biggest casualty of the Framework Agreement  has been the trust
and confidence of America's South Korean allies.  In reaching its nuclear
bargain with North Korea, the Clinton  Administration marginalized the input and
role of South Korea in the  negotiations. Indicative of the Clinton
Administration's  diplomacy toward the Korean peninsula, recent opinion polls by
the  United States Information Agency show South Korean support  for America's
military presence in the ROK at 72 percent, down  10 percent from 1994. In
addition, overall opinion of the U.S. is  down and, for the first time in 12
years, more unfavorable (53  percent) than favorable (43 percent).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>As the record shows, America's Asian alliances, which are key  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 -->  protecting commerce and U.S.
security interests, have been  weakened by feckless and myopic Administration
leadership. No  one can say whether such damage is permanent, but four more
years  of these policies could set the stage for a general retreat of U.S. 
influence and power from Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Clinton's Misguided China Policy. </B>After campaigning in 1992  to link
most-favored-nation (MFN) trading status for China to  its human rights record,
President Clinton reversed himself in  1994 and, two months after the Chinese
leadership had publicly  humiliated the Secretary of State during his March
visit to  Beijing, dropped its human rights demands and supported MFN for 
China. This was the correct decision, but the Administration's  ill-conceived
linkage strategy forced it into a series of policy retreats  and flip-flops
which have undermined U.S. credibility throughout  the region.<A
HREF="ftnt17.htm#2">2</A>  More and more, America's word in
Asia has come  to matter less and less.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps the best example was the Administration's mishandling  of ROC
President Lee Teng-hui's visit to the United States in  June 1995. At first, the
Clinton Administration caved in to  Beijing's protests and resisted granting a
visa so that Taiwan's President  Lee could pay an unofficial visit to his alma
mater, Cornell  University. Agreeing with Beijing, the Administration argued
that granting  a visa would violate its &quot;One-China&quot; policy. However,
in  response to nearly unanimous congressional condemnation of its  decision,
the Administration relented and permitted President Lee to make  a private visit
to Cornell last June. While the decision to let  President Lee visit the U.S.
was the right one, it should have been  made at the beginning. The ROC should
have been spared this  painful ordeal that angered all involved and undermined
U.S. credibility.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In yet another misstep, the Clinton Administration in  February 1995
mishandled the Chinese navy's occupation of Mischief  Reef in the South China
Sea. Mischief Reef is a small atoll well  within the Philippines' 200-mile
Exclusive Economic Zone, but it is in  an area also claimed by China, Taiwan,
and Vietnam. It took  the Clinton Administration three months to respond to this
breach  of international law, and even then it could muster only a mild 
diplomatic protest. In addition to the Mischief Reef episode, China  decided to
express disapproval of U.S. support for President  Lee's visit by conducting
large-scale military maneuvers, including  the firing of nuclear-capable
missiles, in the vicinity of Taiwan.  Only after the Chinese launched these
missiles near two Taiwanese  ports on March 8, 1995, did the Clinton
Administration belatedly  take action, dispatching two aircraft carriers to the
area. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> The President's ineffectual and delayed reactions have  cost America much
in lost prestige and credibility in Asia. The  ROC feels more threatened, the
PRC more emboldened, and the  entire region of Asia more uncertain, not only
about China's  intentions, but also about America's credibility and staying
power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Half-Hearted Support for Asia-Pacific Free Trade. The  Clinton
Administration's record on advancing U.S. trade interests in  Asia is mixed. In
1994, the President joined other leaders of the  Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) forum in declaring his  support for the idea of a free-trade
and investment area in the  Asia-Pacific region by the year 2020. This is a
worthy goal, but then  the President failed to attend the 1995 APEC meeting in
Tokyo,  which focused on developing a blueprint for implementing the 1994 
declaration. In addition, the U.S. delegation came without the  fast-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 26 -->  track negotiating authority
needed for the U.S. to move  ahead more quickly with a free-trade agenda, and
U.S. Trade  Representative Mickey Kantor threw roadblocks in the way of gaining 
fast-track authority from Congress. Kantor, for example, refused  to compromise
when Congress opposed environmental and labor  provisions that the President
wanted included in trade treaties.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Failure to Defend the U.S. Investment in Cambodian  Democracy. The U.S. is
in danger of losing its $500 million investment in  the United Nations
peacekeeping operation in Cambodia. In  May 1993, the Cambodian people voted
freely for a government to  be led by non-communist political parties. However,
the  communist Cambodian People's Party (CCP), installed by Vietnam in  1979,
bullied its way into a coalition with the non-communists.  While claiming
Cambodia as one of its supposed diplomatic success  stories, the Clinton
Administration has failed to censure the  government of Cambodia as it has
proceeded to attack press  freedoms, assassinate journalists, and ban opposition
political parties.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Better define U.S. interests and priorities with respect to 
China.</B> 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  These are: 1) a peaceful
resolution of issues outstanding  between Beijing and the Republic of China on
Taiwan; 2) non-use of  force by China in the South China Sea; 3) stopping the
proliferation  of missiles and missile technology into the Persian Gulf and 
South Asia; and 4) respect for human rights by China. America  should assume
neither China's friendship nor its hostility. By  sustaining Asian alliances,
clearly defining interests and priorities  toward China, and measuring China's
actions against them, America  can judge the nature of Beijing's intentions and
adopt appropriate  policies. Once these policies are adopted, Washington needs
to stick  to them and not, as the Clinton Administration has done,  abandon them
under pressure from Beijing.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Insist that China uphold international standards and &quot;rules
of  the road.&quot;</B>  China's willingness to observe international &quot;rules
of  the road&quot; with respect to non-proliferation, the protection of 
intellectual property, and human rights should be used as a benchmark  to
measure China's conduct as a responsible international  power. China should be
told that the degree to which it will be  respected and integrated into the
international economic and political  community depends on how well it abides by
international rules  and standards.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Support the Republic of China's entry into the World Trade 
Organization.</B> Should the Republic of China meet the criteria for  admission
to the WTO, it should permitted to join. Taiwan's joining  the WTO should not be
held hostage to Beijing's insistence that  the People's Republic of China be
admitted first. This would be  unfair to Taiwan, which is not only one of the
world's most  vibrant economies, but also a democracy.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 28 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Closely monitor implementation of the U.S.-North Korea  Agreed
Framework.</B> North Korea must not be allowed to avoid  compliance with the
terms and conditions of the Framework agreement.  In particular, it must
continue the freeze on its nuclear  program. Should the North restart its
plutonium-producing reactors or fail  to allow inspections of the facilities
agreed to under the terms of  the Framework, the U.S. should build an
international coalition to  support sanctions against Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Expand opportunities for greater American trade with Asia.</B> 
The United States should explore with Australia, New Zealand,  Chile, and
Singapore the possibility of their accession to the  North American Free Trade
Agreement (NAFTA). Similarly,  America should offer to negotiate a merger
between NAFTA and other  existing free-trade agreements, including the
Australia-New  Zealand Closer Economic Relations Agreement (CER) and the  ASEAN
Free Trade Area (AFTA).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Explore with allies and friends in Asia the construction of an 
integrated anti-missile defense system. North Korea's missile  program threatens
South Korea and Japan, while China's tactical and  strategic missile arsenal is
a threat to the security of the entire  Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. should
equip its own ground and  naval forces with missile defense systems and then
offer to sell  those systems to key allies and friends. Missile defense should
be a  key mission for U.S. forces in Asia in the next decade.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Restructure America's approach to U.S.-Japan trade issues.</B> 
The Clinton Administration's approach to trade with Japan is based  on using
external pressure to force internal change. This  approach was confrontational
from the outset, and it has not worked.  More
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  over, it has damaged the U.S.
military alliance with Japan. A  more effective approach would be to recognize
that change in Japan  is internally driven, and align U.S. trade and economic 
objectives with reformers inside Japan who advocate deregulation and a  further
opening of Japanese markets. For example, the U.S.  should propose a
deregulation summit to Japan, aimed at producing  commitments to an action plan.

</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the United States still need to maintain a large  military
presence in Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The end of the Cold War has not ended threats to peace in  Asia.
North Korea's large conventional military force and its  nuclear program pose a
direct threat to South Korea and Japan, both  of which are U.S. allies. China's
rapid military buildup and its  willingness to use force to pursue territorial
claims in the South  China Sea and against Taiwan also are cause for concern. 
America's military presence in Asia has been reduced significantly  since 1990,
but it remains large enough at its current 100,000-man  level to deter possible
threats. American forces in Japan and South  Korea receive significant financial
support from their host  countries. By helping to preserve peace, the U.S. is
helping Asians  and Americans alike to become more prosperous.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the United States need to press for freer trade  in Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> By pressing to reduce trade barriers, both within Asia and 
between the United States and Asia, Americans will benefit from  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  jobs created by economic growth.
More U.S. exports mean  more American jobs. In 1994, U.S. exports to Asia grew
at a rate of  16 percent, totaling over $153 billion. In that same year, more
than  3 million Americans owed their jobs to U.S. exports to Asia.  Of these 3
million jobs, more than 428,000 were created in  1994 alone. In addition,
greater prosperity in Asia reinforces  regional stability and strengthens the
democratic political evolution  underway in countries like Taiwan, South Korea,
and the  Philippines. Democracy and stability reduce the risk of armed conflict 
between states.

<P><A NAME="ISSUESR"><b>THE ISSUES</b>
</A></P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The future of U.S.-Russian relations is uncertain. Much  depends on the
outcome of the presidential elections in Russia,  currently scheduled for the
summer of 1996. Among candidates for  the Duma (the lower house of the Russian
parliament) in the  December 1995 elections, communists, nationalists, and their
allies  captured over 50 percent of the popular vote. President Boris  Yeltsin,
who declared his candidacy for the presidency in February 1996,  is trailing the
pack of presidential candidates. The most popular  candidate is Gennady
Zyuganov, leader of the unreformed  Communist Party. Another dangerous contender
is Vladimir Zhirinovsky,  an anti-American ultra-nationalist. Victory for either
Zyuganov  or Zhirinovsky would seriously endanger Russia's young  democracy and
market reforms. A communist or extreme nationalist at  the helm could well put
the world's second-largest nuclear power on  a collision course with the United
States in Central Europe or  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  Middle East.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Yeltsin's own prospects look grim. His health is  failing, and
Russia's internal economic and political crisis continues  unabated. The war in
the breakaway republic of Chechnya  and Russia's economic difficulties have
eroded the popularity  of Yeltsin's administration to the point where polls show
 approval ratings at around 10 percent to 15 percent. Moscow is awash  in rumors
of coups and falsified presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>No one knows who will rule in Moscow by the end of 1996,  but the period of
romantic partnership with the U.S. and the West  is over. Russia is striking out
on its own, taking a path that  already has led to confrontation with the West.
In fact, Russia is in  the midst of a political turbulence fraught with dangers
for the  West, and the chances are good that the next American President  will
have to deal with a new and very different set of players in  Moscow.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A major point of disagreement between President Clinton and  his U.S.
critics concerns the U.S. support for President Yeltsin.  Critics charge that
the Clinton Administration's continued  unquestioning support for Boris Yeltsin
makes less and less sense. According  to critics, Yeltsin today is presiding
over the return of the  hard-line Soviet nomenklatura to top positions of power.
He has lost  the support of the Russian reformers and is pursuing an 
increasingly confrontational foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Anti-Western sentiments are growing in Russia. Moscow is  attempting to
re-establish its influence in neighboring regions  that once were part of the
Soviet Union. The Kremlin is  employing 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 32 -->  economic, diplomatic, and
military means to achieve a sphere  of economic and military influence in what
Moscow calls its  &quot;near abroad&quot;  the Baltic States, Ukraine, and the
non-Russian states  in Central Asia and the Caucasus that used to be part of the
 Soviet Union but became independent when it collapsed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton's critics believe that preventing the  emergence of a
Russian empire in the lands of the former Soviet Union  should be a top Western
priority, both to help assure the development  and survival of Russian democracy
and to safeguard vital Western  interests. Moreover, an anti-Western policy
could lead Russia  to forge alliances with anti-Western forces in Iran, Iraq,
China,  and Libya. Yet, critics allege, the Clinton Administration has given 
the Russians a free ride in the &quot;near abroad.&quot; 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics of the Clinton Administration also claim that the U.S.  has turned a
blind eye to the atrocities in Chechnya. The President  and his aides have bent
over backwards not to offend President  Yeltsin as he has crushed the rebellion,
which so far has resulted in  over 30,000 deaths and more than 300,000 refugees.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A critical concern is the sale of Russian nuclear reactors to  Iran. The
Islamic regime in Tehran has launched a bid to  acquire nuclear weapons. It is
buying two Russian-made nuclear  reactors capable of producing plutonium that
can be enriched to  become weapons-grade raw material for atomic bombs. The
Russian  Ministry of Foreign Affairs itself does not support this sale, 
believing it could endanger both Russian and Western security.  Nevertheless,
the sale goes on, primarily because of pressure from the  powerful Russian
Ministry of Atomic Industry (MinAtom) headed  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  Victor Mikhailov.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another important issue is aid to Russia and the NIS  countries. Aid to
Russia has attracted bipartisan support, but this may  be weakening as Russia
becomes more anti-Western and  expansionist. The Bush and Clinton
Administrations have provided over  $4 billion in aid to Russia since 1992.
Combined aid monies  and loans to the former Soviet Union and Russia for 
1985-1995 amounted to over $100 billion. The results of these aid  programs have
been mixed; critics argue that U.S. aid programs often  disregard Russia's real
needs and are ineffective.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Also dividing President Clinton and his critics is NATO  expansion. The 1994
Contract With America stipulated that NATO  enlargement (to include Poland,
Hungary, and the Czech  Republic) should be a top national priority. However,
the Clinton  Administration has put NATO expansion on the back burner, both to 
secure Moscow's cooperation in peacekeeping in Bosnia and to  appease Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Critics charge also that the President is appeasing Yeltsin on  missile
defense and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which bans  the deployment of a
missile defense system from the U.S. The  Clinton Administration opposes
ballistic missile defense (BMD) and  wants to expand the scope of the ABM Treaty
to limit even shorter  range (tactical) missiles  something which it was not
originally  intended to do.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another point of contention concerns conventional arms  control. The
Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty places limits  on the numbers of
conventional weapons (such as tanks and  cannon) 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  in Europe and Russia. It was
signed with the now-defunct  U.S.S.R. in 1990 after more than two decades of
negotiations. Critics  became worried when Clinton agreed to a unilateral
revision of  the treaty that permitted the Russians to exceed agreed limits on 
conventional weapons in Russia's northern and southern states.  Beefing up the
numbers of tanks and cannon on the borders of  Russia's neighbors, be it the
Baltic States or nations in the Caucasus,  raises questions about Moscow's
long-term intentions. Moreover,  critics point out that Russia is already far
behind on meeting the  weapons system destruction targets stipulated by the CFE
agreement.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     On August 17, 1991, hard-line elements of the

coup against Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev. The coup  was defeated by the
Russian people and Boris Yeltsin, who at the  time was President of the Russian
Federation, then a republic of  the Soviet Union. The coup leaders were put on
trial and jailed  but were released in 1993.

<P><B>*</B>      The Soviet Union dissolved on December 25, 1991.  Russia,
Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and other former Soviet republics  became independent.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      On September 21, 1993, Boris Yeltsin disbanded the 
Soviet-era Russian parliament. The recalcitrant Supreme Soviet of Russia  had
become the site of intense opposition to Yeltsin and his  market reforms. After
a week-long standoff, Yeltsin ordered the  Russian military to fire on the
parliament building, called the  &quot;White 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 35 -->  House.&quot;  At least 130 people
were killed. The new  parliament, named the State Duma, was elected on December
12, 1993.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Boris Yeltsin's health is failing. He has had two heart
attacks  in four months, his behavior is sometimes erratic, and  intelligence
services report that he has a serious drinking problem.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Presidential elections are scheduled for June 1996. Hard-line 
nationalist and communist forces are on the rise, and the  democratic reformers
are retreating. The main contenders are President  Boris Yeltsin; Gennady
Zyuganov (leader of the communist party);  ultra-nationalist leader Vladimir
Zhirinovsky; economist  Grigory Yavlinsky (a moderate reformer); and retired
General  Alexander Lebed (an authoritarian and charismatic nationalist).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since 1992, Russia has received over $4 billion in direct U.S.
 aid, over $20 billion in total Western aid, and over $50 billion in  loans from
the G-7 countries and multilateral financial  organizations such as the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the  World Bank. Including its holdover
Soviet debts, Russia owes  approximately $130 billion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      Russia started a war in the breakaway republic of Chechnya 
in December 1994. So far, over 30,000 people have been killed  and over 300,000
others have become refugees. The war has cost  Russia over $6 billion. Yeltsin
was concerned about the  possible breakup of Russia, as well as the possible
loss of access to  the valuable oil in the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Russia joined the Partnership for Peace (PFP), an intermediate
 step for countries wishing to join NATO, in the spring of 1995.  How
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 36 -->  ever, today there is little
likelihood that Russian will join  NATO any time soon. Russia's reaction to the
prospect of NATO's  eastward expansion has been shrill and hostile. Most Russian
 politicians, erroneously claiming that NATO has aggressive  designs against
Russia, are using the NATO expansion issue to build  up nationalism and
anti-Western sentiments at home. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Russia agreed to cooperate with NATO in a peacekeeping 
mission in Bosnia. In exchange, the Clinton Administration  allegedly promised
not to expand NATO any time soon, acquiesced to  an increase in the number of
conventional weapons in place  on Russia's northern and southern flanks in
violation of the  CFE treaty, and agreed to Russian freedom of action in the
former  Soviet area. Russia has over 2,000 peacekeepers in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Russia's unilateral violation of the CFE treaty, signed in 
1990, threatens other former Soviet states, such as Ukraine, the  Baltic
countries, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Georgia. The Russian  military wants to keep
many more tanks, cannon, and other heavy  systems than was originally agreed.
This buildup also jeopardizes the  oil resources of the Caspian Sea and the
independence of  Georgia, Armenia, and Azerbaijan. Moscow claims that it needs 
more heavy weapons to protect its borders, despite the fact that none  of her
neighbors is capable of waging war on Russia.
</P>
<P>

corrupt Russian officials is well documented. Germany alone  has

nuclear material components  exported from the NIS. General Anatoly Kuntsevich,
head of  the Russian presidential Chemical Weapons Department, illegally  sold
over 1,600 pounds of chemical weapons components to a  Middle Eastern country.

medical insurance fraud and hundreds of millions in gasoline  tax fraud from

</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>THE RECORD</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has made relations with Boris Yeltsin too  personal. As
Yeltsin's popularity plummeted, Clinton fed the  flames 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 -->  of Russian resentment toward the
U.S. with his unequivocal  support of the Russian president, especially after
the dramatic  shooting at the parliament building in October 1993 and the 
beginning of the Chechen war. As a result, the U.S. is now perceived  by many in
the Russian political elite as partisan and uncritically  supportive of
Yeltsin's faltering policies. The Clinton policy has  endangered the ability of
the U.S. to maintain a relationship  with segments of Russian society that
oppose President Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration paid lip service to the idea of  enlarging NATO
to include Poland, Hungary, and the Czech  Republic. However, it has done very
little to make this happen. Critics  accuse the Administration of promising not
to expand NATO  in 1996 in exchange for Russia's cooperation on peacekeeping  in
Bosnia. Republican Members of Congress, who included  NATO expansion in their
Contract With America, generally are more  supportive of a rapid expansion of
NATO than the Clinton  Administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has been too slow to  recognize the
importance of countries other than Russia. For example,  without Ukraine, the
Russian empire cannot be recreated and will  have only limited access to the
heart of Europe. Azerbaijan  controls vital oil and gas reserves, while Georgia
is situated in a  strategically crucial location in the Caucasus. Nevertheless,
the  Clinton Administration has neglected these countries, promoting a  &quot;Russia-first&quot;
policy and recognizing Moscow's domination of  the &quot;near abroad.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration also has failed to prevent the sale  of nuclear
reactors to Iran, despite America's share in the  massive 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 39 -->  financial aid provided to Moscow
by the International  Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and other multilateral
financial  institutions. The reactors are a vital component of the Iranian bid
to  acquire &quot;Islamic&quot; nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>U.S. assistance to the reform efforts in Russia and other  former Soviet
states has been poorly executed. Much of the $4.1 billion  in U.S. assistance
allocated to date has been wasted. The Bush  and Clinton Administrations erred
in choosing the U.S. Agency  for International Development as the main
implementing agency  for assistance. AID has its expertise in the developing
world, not  in post-communist transitional economies. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Russia and other New Independent States (NIS) have become  leading exporters
of crime, together with Colombia, Southeast  Asia, Afghanistan, Iran, and
others. Law and order in Russia have  collapsed, organized crime is merging with
legal government  structures, and it is difficult to say where the mafiosi end
and the  government begins. Many Russian and Eurasian criminal  organizations
operate internationally, including in the United States  and Western Europe.
Russian organized criminals and corrupt  officials have access to weapons and
technology of mass destruction,  including uranium, chemical and biological
weapons, and the  raw materials and components for their manufacture, as well as
 scientists with specific weapons-related expertise. Despite all of  this
evidence, the Clinton Administration has continued to hail the  success of
economic reforms in Russia, failing to raise the crime  and corruption issue in
bilateral talks with the Yeltsin administration.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration championed the START II  nuclear arms reduction
treaty with Russia. The main obstacles to  START 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 40 -->  II ratification are not in
Washington (the U.S. Senate ratified  the treaty on January 26, 1996) but in
Moscow, where a majority  of deputies in the newly elected Duma probably will
refuse to  ratify it. Objections have been raised based on America's presumed 
intention to build a missile defense, but the real reason for the  Russian
intransigence lies elsewhere: The Russian military  establishment wants to keep
large, land-based multiple-warhead  missiles, such as the SS-18, SS-19, and
especially the mobile SS-24.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The weakest part of Clinton's arms control record concerns  the ABM Treaty.
Russia today claims to be the heir to the  now-defunct Soviet Union, and is
demanding that the U.S. abide by  the 1972 ABM treaty. The Administration not
only wants to abide  by the treaty, it wants to expand its scope. U.S.
negotiators  reportedly have accepted a Russian demand to limit the performance
of  the most promising U.S. short-range missile defenses. And  President Clinton
vetoed the FY 1996 defense authorization bill because  of its missile defense
provisions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration's record in conventional arms  control with the
Russians has not been much better. The  Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE)
treaty places limits on the numbers of  conventional weapons, such as tanks and
cannon, permitted in the  European theaters of operation. It was signed with the
U.S.S.R.  in 1990, and the U.S. agreed in 1995 to allow Russia to exceed  the
limits imposed by the CFE on weapons stationed on its  northern and southern
flanks. Russia's neighbors in the Baltic region or  the Caucasus are now more
insecure as the number of weapons  and tanks on the Russian border continue to
grow. This is  especially worrisome because of all the rhetoric in Moscow about 
restoring the Soviet Union. Moreover, Russia is far behind in meeting  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 41 -->  weapons system destruction
targets stipulated by the CFE.

</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>

<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Develop a Russian policy based on support for ideas
and  interests, not individual politicians.</B>  The U.S. should support
democracy  and free markets in Russia, as well as political forces advocating 
these ideas, not controversial individual politicians like Boris  Yeltsin.
Yeltsin is the elected president of Russia and was a key figure  in bringing
about the collapse of Soviet communism. Today,  however, today some of his
policies and his personal style are  extremely controversial, and his popularity
is plummeting.  Moreover, there are other reform-oriented politicians in Russia 
with whom a dialogue should be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Advocate broad-based cooperation with Russia and
other  NIS members to ensure their integration into global markets and  the
democratic community of nations.</B> The U.S. should continue  selective and
targeted technical assistance programs and provide  support to pro-democracy
forces and nascent market institutions in  the NIS. The U.S. must design and
implement trade, investment,  and assistance programs for Russia and the NIS
that reduce  inflation, lower market barriers, and stimulate growth. Thriving
Russian  and Eurasian markets would create jobs and export opportunities  for
American businesses. U.S. assistance programs should be  taken away from AID and
given to an independent board  of policymakers, area specialists, and business
representatives.  Such a board can be appointed jointly by the President and
Congress.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 42 -->

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's interference in the affairs of its
neighbors.  The survival, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of all NIS 
countries are important to future peace and prosperity in Eurasia.</B> The  U.S.
should support the independence of Ukraine, Azerbaijan,  Georgia, and the
Central Asian states, many of which are being drawn  unwillingly back into the
Russian orbit. Washington should  intensify its ties with Ukraine, the Baltic
States, and countries in  the Caucasus and Central Asia. The West should assist
them in  developing foreign and domestic policy decisionmaking bodies  and
mechanisms, training their bureaucracies, and increasing  security cooperation.
Technical assistance in privatization of industry  and agriculture also should
be provided.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Condemn Russia's brutality in Chechnya.</B> The U.S.
should  make clear to Moscow that the use of force against other states or 
areas of the former Soviet Union could trigger U.S. retaliation  against Russian
economic and political interests. While the U.S.  should support the territorial
integrity of the Russian Federation, the  West should oppose the brutal methods
of the Russian military in  handling internal dissent, such as those used in
Chechnya. The  Clinton Administration should stop issuing declarations of
support  for Russia's actions in Chechnya and instead support OSCE efforts  to
resolve the Chechen crisis peacefully. The OSCE should  undertake a high-profile
mission to Chechnya and Russia. If Russia is to  integrate into the world
community, it must abide by its rules of  conduct, including international law
and custom. Washington  should clarify to Russia that aggressive military action
against her  neighbors could result in international isolation and possible 
economic sanctions. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 43 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Not allow Moscow to veto the opening of NATO to new 
members.</B> The U.S. should maintain a constant dialogue with Russia  on NATO
expansion, pointing out possibilities for  Russian-NATO cooperation and
stressing that NATO is not a threat to  Russian security. While NATO enlargement
will occur, Russian  participation in the Partnership for Peace program should
be expanded  simultaneously as appropriate to assuage Russian concerns. But 
under no circumstances should Moscow be allowed to prevent  sovereign countries
in East and Central Europe from joining the  NATO alliance.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Oppose Russia's policies of nuclear proliferation.</B>
The U.S.  should take every step to prevent Iran, Iraq, and other rogue states 
from gaining nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities. For  example, voluntary
export controls similar to those developed by the  Coordination Committee on
Multilateral Export Controls  (COCOM) regime during the Cold War could be
imposed on technology  sales to these countries. Pressure should be applied
against the arming  of rogue states, up to and including the imposition of
selective  economic sanctions. At the same time, Russia should be  encouraged to
pursue other less threatening commercial ventures, such as  commercial space
launches. These could bring about a voluntary  cancellation of the reactor deal.
The U.S. also should cooperate  with pro-Western circles in Turkey and
Azerbaijan to promote  democracy and oppose radical Islam in Eurasia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Assist Russia and other NIS countries in fighting organized  crime
and corruption. The U.S. could do this by helping the  Russians devise
comprehensive criminal and criminal procedure  codes.</B> Some of the leftover
Soviet laws in Russia make it difficult to  fight organized crime; for example,
there is no adequate law against  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 44 -->  conspiracy to commit a crime. In
addition, U.S. law  enforcement agencies should cooperate with trustworthy and
reliable law  enforcement personnel in the East. In particular, they can assist 
in developing a witness relocation program. They should strive  to track and
penetrate Russian and NIS criminal rings dealing  in weapons of mass destruction
and narcotics. Finally, American  law enforcement agencies should monitor
East-West financial  transactions more closely. Deposits that originate in the
NIS should  be carefully screened and the legitimacy of earnings established.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Reject Russian demands for broadening the ABM
Treaty.</B> The  U.S. needs to be defended against missile launches by rogue
states  and terrorists and against accidental launches. The Clinton 
Administration and the Russians are attempting to extend the life of the  ABM
Treaty by designating Russia and other states as successors to  the Soviet Union
under the treaty and broadening its scope to  cover theater missile defense
systems. Ballistic missile defense is a  vital goal for the U.S. These moves by
Clinton and the Russians  therefore should be resisted firmly. The ABM Treaty
needs to be  eliminated, not extended or broadened.

</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The window of opportunity for the West in Russia may be  closing.
While there is still time, we should provide aid that  strengthens free markets
and free minds. Communism worked to  destroy both of these for 70 years. Many
Russians still want to learn  about democracy and capitalism, and we should
provide them with  a fighting chance before it is too late. However, we must
ensure  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 45 -->  the aid is used wisely. Aid to
Russia needs to be customized  for Russian conditions. If a hard-line government
were to take over  in Russia, making U.S. aid meaningless or worse, we probably

<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What do we do if hard-liners take Yeltsin's place?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should act now to strengthen relations with all countries  in
the region, which will be threatened even more than the West  if hard-liners
come to power in Moscow. We should expand  NATO to include Poland, the Czech
Republic, Hungary, and  perhaps Slovakia, and should prevent any U.S. or
international  assistance to Moscow if an aggressive, anti-American, or
anti-Western  government emerges. Even under these severe circumstances, 
however, the U.S. should maintain a dialogue with Moscow,  clarifying what price
Russia may pay if &quot;red lines&quot; are crossed. Eventually,  if the need
arises, we may need to plan for military  contingencies and even to contain
Russia if it becomes aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't NATO expansion endanger Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P></P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. NATO enlargement is aimed at creating a zone of  stability
and security in Eastern and Central Europe. Opening NATO  to new members 
something which has happened repeatedly in  the past  will hasten the
integration of the Czech Republic,  Poland, Hungary, and other new members into
the West. NATO is a  defensive alliance, and its posture in Central Europe
should remain  defensive.

</P>
<P><B>Q. Why shouldn't we be more cooperative with Russia?  After  all, the
Cold War is over. Russia is a democracy and a great  power. Why shouldn't we
allow Moscow a greater role in policing  unstable regions, such as the Caucasus
or Central Asia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We can cooperate with reformers in Russia who are  interested in
building a market economy and democracy. It will take  time, however, to assess
whether democracy has taken root in  Russia. Russia will always have a
considerable role in the region  because of its sheer size and economic,
political, and cultural weight,  but there are forces in Russia that dream of
re-establishing the  Soviet Union or the Russian Empire. These anti-Western and 
anti-American forces desire to expand Russia's power and influence to  compete
with the West, not cooperate with it. We should  oppose Russia's heavy-handed
interference in the affairs of its  neighbors and attempts to violate their
sovereignty and territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. In view of Chechnya, what should the U.S. do to prevent  Russia from
invading its neighbors?  
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> We should enhance our relations with Ukraine, the  Baltic States,
and countries in the Caucasus and Central Asia. There  are as many people in
these countries as there are in Russia.  We should draw &quot;lines in the sand&quot;
and stick to them. For example,  we should warn Moscow that we will block all
IMF and World  Bank assistance if an NIS country is invaded, and that the U.S.
will  lead the international diplomatic campaign to restore the  independence of
a violated country. If Russia crosses these lines, we should  consider imposing
both restrictions on exchanges and economic  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 47 -->  trade sanctions against Russia.
We also should demand from  Moscow that the war in Chechnya stop. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Are democracy and reform the causes of crime in Russia?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> There is widespread crime and corruption in Russia, and  some
Russians mistakenly think that the cause of crime is  free-market capitalism.
Crime is rampant, of course, but because there is  no rule of law in Russia.
Moreover, real democracy barely exists,  and the country still has a long way to
go before a free-market  system is fully established. Free markets mean the rule
of law, not the  rule of crime.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is Russian organized crime a threat to U.S. and Western  security?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, because Russian criminals are very sophisticated, 
well-educated, and well-connected worldwide. They often boast  advanced college
degrees, as well as KGB and special forces  training. There is great potential
danger in the merger of former  communist, KGB, and criminal elements in Russia
and the NIS,  and the threat from the possible access of organized criminals to 
weapons of mass destruction is particularly acute.

<a href="iran.gif">Map 4</a>: Iran Remains a Long-Term Threat to U.S. Interests in the Gulf<br>
<a href="israel.gif">Map 5</a>: Israel and Syria: At Odds Over the Golan Heights<P>
<P><B><A NAME="ISSUESP">THE ISSUES</A></B>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Persian Gulf is the strategic storehouse of roughly 55  percent of the
world's oil reserves. The U.S. cannot allow hostile  powers such as Iran or Iraq
to gain hegemony over Persian Gulf oil  supplies. This would allow them to gain
an economic stranglehold  on oil-importing states and could fuel a military
buildup that  includes weapons of mass destruction. The issue is how best to
contain  Iran and Iraq. Congressional Republicans, led by Senator  Alfonse
D'Amato (R-NY) and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich  (R-GA), have pushed for a
hard-line policy of aggressive  containment of Iran and the stiffening of
economic sanctions against it, but  the Administration has dragged its feet. On
Iraq, the  Administration came to office prepared to improve relations with
Baghdad if  Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein behaved himself, but Saddam's 
repeated provocations have convinced the Administration that the U.S.  must
contain Iraq vigilantly and firmly. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Arab-Israeli conflict, one of the many cleavages that  threaten the
stability of the region, has been muted substantially but  still poses a threat
to the security of Israel and moderate  pro-Western Arab regimes. A renewal of
this conflict also could help fan  the flames of Islamic radicalism and lead to
an upsurge in  international terrorism. The issue is how to help advance 
Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. The Clinton Administration has pushed for  a
peace treaty between Israel and Syria. It has offered to  deploy American
peacekeeping forces on the Golan Heights, following  an Israeli military
withdrawal from that strategic border area,  to monitor compliance with a
possible Syrian-Israeli peace treaty.  A growing chorus of conservatives
questions the wisdom of an  open-ended U.S. peacekeeping commitment on the Golan
Heights  which could divert U.S. military forces from other missions, erode 
military readiness, and serve as a lightning rod for terrorist attacks  by 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 49 -->  Middle Eastern terrorist groups
opposed to peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third issue is how to help contain the rising tide of Islamic  radicalism
that threatens to sweep away the Algerian military  regime and undermine
pro-Western regimes in Egypt, Jordan,  Morocco, Pakistan, Tunisia, and Turkey.
Islamic radicals also threaten  U.S. interests by promoting international
terrorism and opposing  the Arab-Israeli peace process. The Clinton
Administration has  established diplomatic contacts with Islamic radicals and
has called  for a political dialogue between them and the states they seek to 
overthrow. Many conservatives oppose such contact because it  undermines secular
Middle Eastern regimes that the radicals seek  to overthrow, makes it easier for
Islamic radicals to seize power,  and would not change their anti-Western
policies if they did come  to power. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="FACTSP">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein remains a dangerous, albeit 
weakened, threat to regional stability. The Iraqi army remains the  strongest
regional military force in the Persian Gulf region, and  Iraq continues its
efforts to build weapons of mass destruction, such  as chemical, biological, and
nuclear weapons. Saddam Hussein  will remain a threat to Western interests in
the Persian Gulf as long  as he remains in power.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran looms large as the principal long-term threat to U.S. 
interests in the Persian Gulf. It has launched a massive military buildup  and
continues to support terrorism against its neighbors and  Western countries,
including the U.S. It also has sought to intimidate  the Arab emirates across
the Persian Gulf by rattling its saber. In  1992 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 50 -->  Iran seized three disputed
islands at the mouth of the Persian  Gulf and fortified them with 8,000 troops,
chemical weapons,  anti-aircraft missiles, and anti-ship missiles.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Iran, like Iraq, has launched a clandestine program to build 
nuclear weapons under cover of its civilian nuclear power program.  Russia,
China, and Pakistan have provided technology, equipment,  or training that could
help advance Iran's nuclear weapons  program. Western companies, including many
from Germany, have  sold Iran dual-use (civilian/military) technologies that
could aid  its nuclear weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>    The Arab-Israeli peace negotiations achieved the October  1994
Jordan-Israeli peace treaty, but Syrian-Israeli negotiations  have been
deadlocked by Syrian intransigence. The  Palestinian-Israeli negotiations have
lurched along through two interim  self-rule agreements that have led to an
unstable, uneasy peace  continually undermined by persistent terrorism from
Palestinian Islamic  radicals. The most difficult issues  borders, Palestinian 
statehood, security arrangements, Jerusalem, the Israeli settlements, 
Palestinian refugees, and water resources  have been relegated to  the final
status talks, set to begin in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Islamic radicals form a tiny majority of the world's more than
 900 million Muslims. They pose a threat primarily to secular  regimes in the
Muslim world, which they have not had a great deal of  success in overthrowing.
But when they seize control of a state,  as they did in Iran in 1979 or Sudan in
1989, their power to  threaten U.S. interests greatly increases.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. has suffered repeated terrorist attacks from Islamic 
radi
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 51 -->  cals, including the 1979-1981
hostage crisis, the 1983 bombing  of the Marine Barracks in Beirut, the 1983
bombing of the U.S.  embassy in Lebanon, the kidnappings of 15 Americans in 
Lebanon between 1985 and 1991, the 1993 World Trade Center bombing  in New York
City, and numerous other incidents. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Algerian Islamic militants have waged a bloody civil war that 
has killed roughly 40,000 Algerians since the Army intervened  in January 1992
to oust the discredited National Liberation Front.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORDP">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has done a mediocre job of  consolidating the
benefits of the Bush Administration's Desert Storm  victory and protecting
Western interests in the Persian Gulf against  Iranian and Iraqi aggression. It
has done marginally better at assisting  in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations but
also has offered to  commit American peacekeeping forces to a risky open-ended 
deployment on the Golan Heights if Israel signs a peace treaty with Syria.  The
Administration has fared worst of all in its policy toward  Islamic radicals.
For example, the Clinton Administration's May  1993 &quot;Dual Containment&quot;
policy, which calls for the simultaneous  containment and isolation of Iraq and
Iran, takes a passive approach  to containing these two countries unless prodded
by Iraqi  provocations or concerned members of the U.S. Congress. Another 
example: Clinton in June 1993 ordered an attack by  Tomahawk cruise missiles
against the Baghdad headquarters of Iraq's  secret police in retaliation for the
failed April 1993 Iraqi-sponsored  assassination attempt against former
President George Bush in  Kuwait. But this was a mere slap on the wrist in view
of the  grave nature of the terrorist attack against a former American head  of

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 52 -->  state.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has dragged its feet on  increasing pressure on
Iran to halt its support of terrorism. Clinton on  April 30, 1995, announced the
signing of an executive order banning  all U.S. trade with Iran, but he did so
in part to prevent the U.S.  Congress from going farther and placing an import
ban on any  foreign company that continued to trade to Iran. The Administration 
feared this would create tensions with U.S. allies in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Congress has tried to strengthen America's policy toward  Iran. Led by
Senator D'Amato, the Senate passed a bill on December  21 that would punish
foreign companies that invest in Iran's oil  industry. The House is likely to
pass this measure. House  Speaker Gingrich also forced the Administration to
toughen its policy  on Iran by insisting that the intelligence authorization
bill include  $18 million to support covert actions against the Iranian 
government by Iranian opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>If the Clinton Administration's policies toward Iraq and Iran  have been
unsuccessful, its role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations has been
overrated. President Clinton hosted  Israeli-Palestinian signing ceremonies at
the White House in September 1993  and September 1995, but the interim
Palestinian self-rule  agreements signed at those two ceremonies came about
through bilateral  Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, not through U.S. diplomatic
 efforts. In October 1993, the Administration pledged to provide $500  million
in foreign aid to the Palestinians over five years. In 1994  Congress passed the
Middle East Peace Facilitation Act requiring  the State Department to certify
each year that the Palestine  Liberation Organization had complied with its
commitments under the  treaty 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 53 -->  before this aid could be
disbursed. Representative  Benjamin Gilman (R-NY), Chairman of the House
International  Relations Committee, has denounced the State Department
compliance  reports as a &quot;whitewash.&quot;
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Yielding to pressure from Congress, the President signed into  law a bill
requiring that the U.S. move its embassy in Israel from  Tel Aviv to Jerusalem,
Israel's capital, by May 31, 1999. The  legislation contains a provision that
permits the President to delay  the embassy move if he considers it harmful to
U.S. national  security interests. The Clinton Administration had opposed the
bill,  arguing that it would upset the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, which 
include conflicting claims to Jerusalem, but the embassy would  be located in
Western Jerusalem, which is not claimed by the PLO.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To facilitate the negotiation of a Syrian-Israeli peace treaty,  the Clinton
Administration has offered to dispatch a U.S.  peacekeeping force to the Golan
Heights, strategic territory along the  Syrian-Israeli border which Israel
captured in the 1967 Six Day War  and which Syria demands be returned to its
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has been much more active than  previous
administrations in establishing diplomatic contacts with  Islamic radicals, such
as the Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) in  Algeria. This is dangerous because it
undermines confidence in  secular governments battling Islamic movements,
thereby helping  these movements come to power. The Clinton Administration has 
called for a political dialogue between the FIS and the Algerian  military
regime. It believes that the FIS can halt terrorism and enter  a power-sharing
arrangement with secular Algerian parties,  despite the fact that the FIS is
unable to control the more radical  Armed 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 54 -->  Islamic Group which perpetrates
much of the terrorism in  the country and increasingly is eclipsing the FIS.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To protect U.S. interests in the Middle East and Persian Gulf, 
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain a strong military presence in the Persian Gulf to  deter
Iran and Iraq from aggression and safeguard the free flow of  oil from the gulf
region.</B> Both countries have staged military  maneuvers in recent years to
intimidate their smaller neighbors. The  U.S. needs to maintain strong air and
naval forces in the region, as  well as pre-positioned military supplies that
can be deployed rapidly  by air transport to equip ground troops in a crisis.
Kuwait and  Qatar have agreed to provide facilities for pre-positioned military 
equipment, but the Saudi government has refused American requests  for a similar
arrangement in Saudi Arabia because it fears that  Islamic militants will
denounce such an arrangement as an American  base. Given such local political
sensitivities, the U.S. must seek to  limit the number of military personnel
stationed on the ground in  Saudi Arabia while depending on naval and air units
deployed in the  region to deter aggression from Iraq and Iran and relying on
rapid  air and sea transport to bring ground troops to the region in a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Maintain U.N.-sponsored economic sanctions on Iraq as long  as
Saddam Hussein remains in power, if necessary by vetoing  any move in the
Security Council to lift the sanctions.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Tighten economic sanctions against Iran and press the  European
allies and Japan to stop lending money to Iran or renegotiating  its foreign
debt.</B> Iran is having increasing difficulty in financing  its 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 55 -->  roughly $30 billion foreign debt.
The stagnant Iranian  economy has been plagued by government mismanagement and
by  continued low prices for oil, its principal export. The U.S. ban on  trade
with Iran has cut into Iran's export earnings but has had  limited impact
because Japan and Western European states continue  their policy of &quot;constructive
engagement&quot; with Iran, which amounts  to business as usual. Washington
should press its allies to join  the embargo on trade with Iran and halt their
efforts to help Iran  reschedule its debt until the regime ends its support of
terrorism  and Islamic revolution. Washington should make a point of 
publicizing Iranian involvement in terrorism and subversion to  embarrass
Western leaders that turn a blind eye to Iranian aggression. If  the allies
continue to neglect the Iranian threat, the U.S. should  impose trade sanctions
on Western companies that continue to do  business with Iran. Banning such
companies from selling their goods in  the United States would force them to
choose between the  American market and the smaller Iranian market.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Pressure Russia, China, and Pakistan to halt their support of 
Iran's nuclear power program, which is being used as cover for  Iran's
clandestine nuclear weapons program.</B> These countries have  signed agreements
to provide nuclear technology, equipment, or  training to Iran. The U.S. should
increase pressure on all three countries  to break off their nuclear cooperation
with Tehran or risk U.S.  economic sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Take a cautious, go-slow approach to the Arab-Israeli peace 
negotiations.</B> Washington should demand that the PLO comply with  its past
commitments, especially to fight terrorism and revoke  provisions in the
Palestinian Covenant, the PLO's charter, that call  for the destruction of
Israel. The U.S. should not pressure Israel  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 56 -->  make any concessions in the final
status talks, which begin in  May 1996, but should allow the two sides to work
out their  differences on their own.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Withdraw the offer to deploy U.S. peacekeeping forces on  the
Golan Heights. If peacekeeping forces are needed to monitor  a Syrian-Israeli
peace treaty, they can be drawn from other  nations, as is the present United
Nations peacekeeping force on the  Golan Heights.</B> American forces should not
be used because they will  be a lightning rod for terrorist attacks by groups
based in  nearby Lebanon, such as the militant pro-Iranian Hezbollah. If the 
forces deployed are too small, they will not significantly reduce the  military
risks that Israel would run in returning the heights to Syria;  if they are
large enough to deter Syrian aggression, they will  divert other U.S. military
units from more important missions and  erode U.S. military readiness by
interfering with combat training  schedules. For a Golan peacekeeping force to
be credible would  require the commitment of a heavy brigade of roughly 5,000
troops.  To maintain a long-term deployment would require the  commitment of
three brigades: one for deployment, one for retraining for  combat missions
after deployment, and one for training and  preparing to deploy. This represents
roughly 10 percent of the U.S.  Army's active duty combat strength, a
prohibitively high burden for  an open-ended peacekeeping commitment.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Break off diplomatic contacts with the FIS and other radical 
Islamic groups.</B> Such contacts undermine the embattled secular  regimes

arrangement with Islamic radicals.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Encourage free-market economic reforms, including the  development
of a European Union - North African free trade area, to  fuel economic growth in
North Africa and the Middle East.</B>  Economic reforms will create jobs for the
unemployed youth who serve  as the vanguard of Islamic revolutionary movements.
The U.S.  also should encourage the development of secular political parties 
that can give voice to political opposition and preclude Islamic  radicals from
monopolizing the opposition to established regimes.

</P>
<P><B>*     Strengthen congressional oversight over the $100 million in

<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. seek to maintain U.N. economic  sanctions on Iraq
when the Iraqi people, not the regime, appear to be  doing all the suffering?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.N. specifically exempted food and medicine from  its
embargo and gave Iraq the opportunity to export $1.6 billion  worth of oil to
pay for its imports if it did so under U.N.  supervision. Saddam Hussein
rejected this as an infringement of Iraqi  sovereignty and prefers to use the
suffering of his own people to  manipulate international public opinion. The
U.S. cannot afford to  lift the sanctions because Saddam has not complied with
U.N.  resolutions requiring that he provide a full accounting of his  military
buildup, recognize of the border with Kuwait, return Kuwaiti  hos
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 58 -->  tages and assets, and halt
terrorism against his own people.  Moreover, Saddam remains a threat to the
region. If Iraq is allowed  to resume its oil exports, both Saddam's hold on
power and his  ability to threaten his neighbors will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What should be the U.S. role in the Arab-Israeli peace  negotiations?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Paradoxically, the U.S. should minimize its role as much  as
possible to encourage the Israelis and Arabs to negotiate with  each other, not
with Washington. Some of the biggest breakthroughs  in the peace negotiations,
such as Egyptian President Anwar  Sadat's 1977 visit to Jerusalem and the 1993
Oslo Accords, came  about without any direct U.S. involvement. Washington should
let  the two sides work out their problems by themselves to the  greatest extent
possible, suggesting ways to break diplomatic  impasses only when both sides
request that it do so. A lasting  Arab-Israeli peace must be negotiated
painstakingly by the parties to the  conflict and should not be imposed by
outside powers. Secretary  of State Warren Christopher, who has traveled to the
Middle East  17 times, should adjust his priorities and spend more time 
addressing more important issues, such as U.S. policy toward Russia  and China,
which he has visited less frequently.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why should the U.S. reject a peacekeeping presence on  the Golan
Heights when it has maintained a similar  peacekeeping force in the Sinai
peninsula since 1982 to monitor compliance  with the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> U.S. forces would face a very different political, military,  and

<!-- Generation of PM publication page 59 -->  terrorist threat environment in
the Golan Heights.  Peacekeepers would be deployed close to large armored
forces, in a  constricted area, and in positions that would become important
military  objectives if fighting erupts. Moreover, Golan peacekeepers could  be
subject to terrorist attacks from nearby Lebanon or from  terrorists hiding
among Syrian civilians. Finally, unlike Sadat's  Egypt, Hafez al-Assad's Syria
is one of the world's leading exporters  of terrorism. Syria supported
Hezbollah's terrorist attacks  against American peacekeeping forces in Lebanon
in 1983-1984 and  may be tempted to do so again in the Golan Heights to drive 
peacekeepers away. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. By firmly opposing Islamic radicalism, can the U.S. be  accused of
being anti-Muslim?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Not at all. Muslims are the chief victims of Islamic  radicals,
who are totalitarian ideologues willing to use violence,  terrorism, and
intimidation to impose their narrow religious and  political views on their
countrymen. The U.S. has cooperated closely  with fundamentalist states such as
Saudi Arabia and President Zia  al-Haq's Pakistan. The U.S. is opposed to
terrorism and the export  of violent revolution, not to the religious beliefs of
any group.

<P>America has two vital national interests in Latin America:  countering such
ongoing threats to U.S. national security as illegal  drug trafficking and Fidel
Castro's Cuba and encouraging the  development of prosperous and stable
capitalist democracies  throughout 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 60 -->  the Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Latin America's economies are among the fastest growing in  the world, and
the United States has been one of the principal  beneficiaries of this growth.
U.S. exports to Latin America more  than doubled between 1988 and 1994, rising
to $94 billion, and  now support over 2 million American jobs. Moreover,
democratic  reforms are advancing at a quicker pace in Latin America than 
anywhere else in the world. Today, Cuba is the only  undemocratic country in the
Western Hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Trade expansion drives U.S. relations with Latin America,  and NAFTA (the
North American Free Trade Agreement) will be  the main instrument for achieving
America's principal foreign  policy goals for the region. These goals consist of
expanding U.S.  exports and investment as quickly as possible and assuring
long-term  economic and political stability on America's southern flank, 
particularly in Mexico and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In 1989, the Bush Administration unveiled the Enterprise of  the Americas
Initiative, a bold proposal to create a single  free-trade area encompassing the
entire Western Hemisphere. The  following year, in 1990, the U.S. and Mexico
agreed to negotiate  NAFTA, the first comprehensive free-trade agreement ever
signed by  the U.S. with any Latin American country. NAFTA was signed  into law
by President Clinton on December 8, 1993. One year later,  at the Summit of the
Americas in Miami, President Clinton and  33 other hemispheric heads of state
agreed unanimously to create  a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005.
President Clinton  also pledged at the summit to expand NAFTA to Chile in 1996,
but  that presidential promise has not yet been fulfilled.

<P>The most immediate threat to stability and security on  America's southern
flank is the crisis in Mexico. The peso's collapse on  December 19, 1994,
plunged Mexico into the worst economic  and political crisis it has suffered in
more than a century. The  peso crisis also weakened support for NAFTA in the
U.S. and may  have derailed further U.S.-led trade expansion in the Western 
Hemisphere for a period of two or three years. The Clinton  Administration is
aiding Mexico with a $50 billion emergency bailout  package, and the government
of President Ernesto Zedillo has  stepped up the pace of economic and political
reform, but the turmoil  will not subside quickly. It remains to be seen whether
the  Clinton Administration's bailout and the Zedillo government's  emergency
economic reforms will be enough to end the current crisis; if  not, Mexico will
be forced to implement even tougher reforms in  1996 and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Other threats to stability and security in Latin America  include
corruption, the widespread absence of the rule of law,  inadequate protection of
property rights, drug trafficking, organized  crime, and guerrilla activities in
several countries. These are  structural problems for which there are no easy or
quick solutions.  However, without sustained economic development, prospects for
 confronting these threats successfully are poor. The expansion of  NAFTA to
include Chile and other Latin American countries is the  vehicle proposed by the
U.S., and embraced by the emerging  capitalist democracies of Latin America, to
achieve sustained economic  development and create a 21st century hemispheric
partnership  based on free trade and democracy. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of the most important Latin American issues is whether  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 62 -->  include Chile in NAFTA. Some
American protectionists  oppose NAFTA's expansion, arguing that NAFTA caused the
 Mexican crisis and that free trade is bad for the United States. Others 
believe that expanding NAFTA is the only way to expand the  economies of the
U.S. and Latin America. Thus, they advocate  extending fast-track negotiating
authority to the President. Fast-track  negotiating authority authorizes the
President to conduct trade  negotiations with a view to achieving specific goals
established  by Congress. Agreements negotiated under fast-track are submitted 
to Congress for an up-or-down vote, but Congress may not amend  or otherwise
alter the proposed agreement submitted for its approval. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether the U.S. should be bailing out  Mexico's economy.
In 1995, the Clinton Administration bailed out  Mexico with a rescue package
totaling nearly $50 billion. About half  of this amount has been borrowed by the
Mexican government so  far, yet the economic crisis has not ended. Critics of
the  Administration argue that it is both unwise and wasteful to  subsidize
Mexico's economic inefficiencies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A third important Latin American issue is whether the U.S.  should impose
sanctions on Colombia for not doing enough to curb  the drug cartels operating
in that country. President Ernesto  Samper financed his 1994 election campaign
with more than $6 million  in political contributions from the Cali cartel. In
1995, the  Clinton Administration renewed Colombia's annual certification with 
a &quot;national interest waiver,&quot; which is analogous to flunking a  final
exam but receiving a passing grade anyway. The Republican  majority in Congress
criticized Colombia's national interest  certification in 1995 and urged Clinton
instead to decertify Colombia  and impose trade sanctions. The Administration in
March 1996  decerti
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 63 -->  fied Colombia as a sign of U.S.
opposition to the penetration  of Colombia's presidency, Congress, and court
system by  corrupt drug traffickers.

<P><B><A NAME="FACTSL">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     U.S. exports to Latin America and the Caribbean have more 
than doubled in just six years, rising from $46.4 billion in 1988 to  over $98
billion in 1994. These exports support nearly 2 million  American jobs. Total
U.S. exports to Latin America represent 19  percent of all U.S. exports, making
Latin America the fourth-largest  U.S. export market. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since 1990, U.S. exports to all countries in the Western 
Hemisphere, including Canada, have increased over 50 percent,  from $137 billion
to nearly $207 billion. In all, these exports  support over 4.1 million American
jobs. Total U.S. exports to all  countries in the Western Hemisphere in 1994
represented over 40 percent  of America's exports worldwide. The Western
Hemisphere  is America's second-largest export market, after Asia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Negotiations for NAFTA were substantially concluded in 1992 
by the Bush Administration. The final agreement was approved  in 1993 by the
U.S. Congress, but only after the Clinton  Administration forced Mexico and
Canada to accept unnecessary side  agreements on labor and the environment.
NAFTA is to be  implemented over a period of 15 years, with full implementation
scheduled  for 2009. Chile is next in line for membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Trade growth during NAFTA's first two years surpassed even 
the most optimistic forecasts. In 1994, two-way trade between the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 64 -->  and Mexico increased over 22
percent, to more than $100  billion. The U.S. reported a trade deficit of nearly
$16 billion with  Mexico during 1995, mainly because Mexican exports had
increased  by more than one-third since 1994. However, despite the peso  crisis,
U.S. exports to Mexico in 1995 fell by less than 9 percent from  the year
before, and were still higher than in 1993.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The South American Common Market (Mercosur), which is led  by
Brazil and also includes Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay, is  rapidly
developing a free-trade area in South America while  seeking closer trade
relations with the European Union and several of  the APEC countries, including
Japan. If NAFTA is not  expanded quickly to include Chile, and subsequently
Argentina, the  U.S. may be sidelined from South American trade liberalization 
centered on Mercosur at the expense of American exports, jobs,  and U.S.
leadership in that region of the Americas.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Drug cartels in Colombia and Mexico have become a  significant
threat to U.S. economic and security interests. Colombian  drug traffickers
financed the election of President Ernesto Samper  in 1994 and have penetrated
Columbia's Congress, courts, and  law enforcement institutions. Moreover, over
80 percent of the  cocaine imported illegally into the U.S. is transported
through Mexico  by powerful drug cartels in league with corrupt politicians, law
 enforcement, and military personnel. Belatedly, the Clinton  Administration
appears to have acknowledged that drug traffickers are  a national security
threat to America by appointing former  Army General Barry McCaffrey as the new
head of the White  House Office of National Drug Control Policy.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The high watermarks of the Clinton Administration's  foreign policy toward
Latin America were the approval of NAFTA  in 1993 and the Summit of the Americas
in 1994. It was at this  conference that the President pledged to expand NAFTA
to  include Chile in 1996 and promised to create a Free Trade Area of  the
Americas by 2005. Both achievements were eclipsed by the  collapse of the
Mexican peso in 1995, and the crisis in Mexico  has derailed further U.S.-led
trade expansion in Latin America for  one or two years at least. The Clinton
Administration is  pretending otherwise, but without NAFTA's expansion to Chile,
the  President has nothing to offer Latin America, and the U.S. is  temporarily
sidelined from the process of hemispheric trade liberalization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In other words, with NAFTA's expansion pushed off  the Administration's
agenda, at least for now, President Clinton  has little to show for his efforts
in Latin America except a string  of foreign policy blunders. These include:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     The U.S. military occupation of Haiti.</B> President
Clinton  ordered the invasion of Haiti to establish a lasting democracy in that 
country. In truth, however, the Clinton Administration restored  Haitian
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide to power and then  provided Aristide with over
$2 billion in military security and financial  aid as he consolidated his
one-man rule. New Haitian President  Rene Preval is Aristide's closest friend,
chosen by Aristide to  succeed him in power. Moreover, political violence has
continued in  Haiti since the start of the U.S. military occupation. Since
Aristide  was restored to power, more than 20 leaders of the political 
opposition have been murdered. Now that the U.S. has left Haiti, there  are
fears of renewed political violence.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 66 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     The Mexican peso crisis.</B> The Clinton Administration had  more
than a year's advance warning, during 1993 and 1994, of  Mexico's impending
financial collapse but did nothing to prevent it.  When the crisis hit,
President Clinton rushed to the  Mexican government's rescue with a $50 billion
bailout package that  assured Americans holding Mexican government bonds of full
 repayment at the expense of American taxpayers. However,  the Mexican economy
suffered a brutal contraction that will be felt  for many years by the Mexican
people, and the expansion of  NAFTA to Chile and other Latin American countries
was derailed.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Dealing secretly with Castro.</B> The White House secretly 
negotiated an agreement with Castro that requires U.S. Navy and Coast  Guard
ships to intercept Cuban refugees fleeing the island and  return them forcibly
to Cuba. However, Clinton obtained no economic  or political concessions from
Castro, except a promise not to  permit any new mass departures of Cubans
seeking freedom.

<P>
</P>
<P>To protect U.S. interests in Latin America, the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*     Renew fast-track negotiating authority.</B> Without
fast-track,  the Administration cannot negotiate new trade agreements with 
Chile or any other countries. Fast-track is an essential tool for  American
trade negotiators.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Allow no more bailouts for Mexico or any other country.</B> 
Clinton's bailout of Mexico is a case of throwing good money after bad.  The
crisis in Mexico is not over. As soon as 1997, another peso  crisis 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 67 -->  could force the Zedillo
government to request more financial  aid from the U.S., and possibly also to
call for a new round of  debt negotiations to prevent a default. The U.S. should
refuse all  future Mexican requests for emergency financial bailouts and should 
urge Mexico instead to resolve its economic difficulties with  market-oriented
solutions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Expand NAFTA to include Chile.</B> Including Chile in  NAFTA would
send the rest of Latin America and the Caribbean a  strong message that U.S.
commitment to creating a Free Trade Area  of the Americas (FTAA) remains firm.
It also would  enhance America's leadership in the Western Hemisphere while 
expanding export and investment opportunities for U.S. companies in  South
America, creating a South American gateway to Asian markets  for U.S. producers,
and strengthening the relative bargaining power  of U.S. trade negotiators in
future talks between NAFTA and  the South American Common Market (Mercosur)
headed by  Brazil and Argentina.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Give Caribbean and Central American countries  NAFTA-level trade
parity.</B> Raising the countries of the Caribbean Basin  Initiative to NAFTA
parity with Mexico would not cost the U.S.  anything. To the contrary, it would
increase market access for U.S.  companies and investors in the Caribbean and
Central America  and would compel countries in the region to accept NAFTA 
standards in other areas beneficial to American commercial interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Negotiate a framework free-trade agreement between NAFTA  and
Mercosur, the South American Common Market.</B>  A  free-trade agreement between
NAFTA and Mercosur is an essential step  in creating a Free Trade Area of the
Americas. At present, Brazil  is 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 68 -->  pursuing a policy of
consolidating Mercosur first in order to  create a South American Free Trade
Area (SAFTA), centered on  Brazil, that would exclude NAFTA initially. This
would have  adverse long-term consequences for U.S. exports and investments in 
South America. The U.S. should try to counter this Brazilian strategy  by
expanding NAFTA to include Chile, and subsequently  Argentina, in order to push
Mercosur toward a convergence with NAFTA.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Suspend all U.S. government aid to Haiti.</B> The Clinton 
Administration has withdrawn the American military presence from Haiti,  but it
plans to continue funding the Aristide-sponsored government  of President Rene
Preval with hundreds of millions of dollars in  financial aid disbursed through
the U.S. Agency for  International Development (USAID) and multilateral
institutions like the  IMF, World Bank, and Inter-American Development Bank. 
However, lasting democracy has not been established, and American  taxpayers
should not be dunned for the cost of maintaining the illusion  of democracy in
the least democratic country in the Americas  (after communist Cuba).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Continue pressure against Fidel Castro's dictatorship in Cuba.</B>
 The Clinton Administration has agreed to return to Cuba all  refugees
intercepted at sea, but Castro has made no economic or  political concessions.
Castro wants the U.S. trade embargo lifted, but  he refuses to relax his
totalitarian enslavement of the Cuban  people. Until Castro agrees to make real
free-market and democratic  concessions aimed at freeing the Cuban people, the
U.S. should  continue to turn the economic screws against Castro, as it did 
recently by approving the Helms-Burton Bill that tightens sanctions  against
Cuba.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Did NAFTA cause the Mexican peso crisis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican peso crisis. The peso  collapsed
because the Mexican economy is not free and  because Mexico is not a
full-fledged democracy. NAFTA prevented  the Mexican crisis from becoming much
worse, because it  provided Mexico with a strong institutional anchor that
encouraged the  government to stay on course with the economic and political 
reforms that, over the next decade, will foster the consolidation of a  true
capitalist democracy in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Is NAFTA responsible for growing illegal immigration  and drug
trafficking from Mexico?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Mexicans emigrate to the U.S., legally and illegally,  because
they are fleeing poverty and repression. Mexicans have been  migrating to
America for over 100 years and will continue to do so  as long as they are
denied opportunities for economic advancement  in their own country. NAFTA
compels the Mexican government  to open up the Mexican economy; over the next
10-15 years,  therefore, more economic freedom in Mexico will be reflected in 
reduced immigration to the U.S. Similarly, NAFTA is not  responsible for drug
trafficking in North America. The real cause is  the lack of economic and
political freedom in Mexico, combined  with incoherent U.S. anti-drug policies.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Wouldn't America be better off without NAFTA?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Without NAFTA, relations between the U.S. and Mexico  would 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 70 -->  deteriorate. NAFTA is the first
successful effort, in nearly  200 years of frequently difficult U.S.-Mexico
relations, to build a  lasting partnership based on economic prosperity and
democratic  stability. Abolishing NAFTA would not end common security  concerns
related to economic relations, immigration, and drug  trafficking. However, with
NAFTA in place, the U.S. has an  effective foreign policy instrument with which
to create a durable  cross-border relationship for the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Was the military occupation of Haiti a mistake?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B>Yes. President Clinton's commitment of U.S. troops to  Haiti was
driven by domestic policy concerns. Haiti has no  democratic tradition, and
history teaches that democracy cannot be  imposed forcibly by external power.
The creation of a true democracy  in Haiti is important to all democracies in
the Americas, but the  drive to become a democracy must come from within.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Throughout most of its history, America sought to avoid  entanglement in the
affairs of other countries, focusing instead on  peaceful avenues of trade.
America has grown into an industrial giant  partly because of international
trade, which now accounts for some  23 percent of the national wealth. With
increased reliance on  global markets, the U.S. is trying to expand its exports
by involving  itself in agreements such as the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While America has been largely a free-trade nation, the  principles of free
trade today are under siege. On the one side of the  argument are those who
advocate free trade because it creates  jobs, promotes economic growth, and
maximizes efficiency and  individual wealth. On the other are those who argue
that free  trade forces American manufacturing overseas, and leads to lost 
jobs, declining wealth, and increased national suffering.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>To its proponents, free trade is a matter of principle.  Individuals should
enjoy the right to buy lawful products, wherever  made, without governmental
interference. Free traders believe that  governments should not dictate to
individuals what clothes they  will wear, what food they will eat, and which
cars they will drive  to 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  benefit domestic producers.
Tariffs, import quotas,  discriminatory regulations, and other forms of
protectionism are unwarranted  infringements of individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Proponents also believe that free trade promotes economic  growth and
creates jobs for Americans. Virtually all economists argue  that free trade
increases competition, spurs innovation, lowers  prices, accelerates economic
growth, and on balance creates more  jobs than are lost to foreign competition.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Opponents of free trade advocate closed borders and argue  that cutting off
or restricting trade with other nations is in  America's interest. While they
admit that tariffs and import quotas raise  consumer prices, they believe such
measures also safeguard jobs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Perhaps no other recent public figure has advocated trade  protectionism
more vigorously than Patrick Buchanan, who says  he would impose stiff tariffs
on imports and withdraw America  from almost all of its international
agreements, including the  North American Free Trade Area with Mexico and Canada
and  the World Trade Organization (WTO), a global trade organization.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The outcome of this debate is vitally important to America's  future. The
choice before the U.S. is whether to continue or  abandon its standard of living
and its position as the world's  leading economy. A false move on the trade
front could have  disastrous consequences for the U.S. economy. It should be
recalled that  the protectionism of the 1930s was a major factor in bringing 
about the Great Depression. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The challenge for America is whether it will embrace free trade  as 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  a key to its continuing
prosperity. Linked to this challenge are  such issues as expanding NAFTA to
include Chile and other  countries, expanding free trade in Asia through the
Asia Pacific  Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum, expanding trade across the 
Atlantic with Europe, and dealing with the entry of the People's  Republic of
China (PRC) and Republic of China on Taiwan (ROC) into  the World Trade
Organization. Generally, free traders have been  disappointed in President
Clinton's handling of all these trade  issues. They accuse him of dragging his
feet on expanding NAFTA  to include Chile and of trying to force &quot;managed&quot;
trade deals  with the Japanese over auto parts.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     America is the largest exporter of goods and

year,  and over 14 million Americans are employed producing these exports.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     America's trade deficit is minuscule when compared to the size
 of the U.S. economy. The U.S. trade deficit in goods and services is  a mere
1.5 percent of America's overall economy (gross  national product). America's
annual budget deficit  2.5 percent of GNP   is almost twice the size of its
trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. trades with Asia more than any other region in the 
world. U.S. two-way merchandise trade with Asia in 1994 was  $424.9 billion, or
36.1 percent of total U.S. two-way merchandise  trade worldwide. Merchandise
exports to Asia support 3.1  million 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  American jobs<B>.</B>

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     <B></B>The U.S. exports over $120 billion in goods to Europe,
not  including the newly independent states of the former Soviet  Union. These
exports support over 2 million U.S. jobs. Removing  barriers to U.S. exports to
Europe means creating more American jobs in  a number of different sectors,
including agricultural goods,  automobiles, electric power and natural gas
equipment, information  technology products, medical devices, pharmaceuticals,
and  telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is America's second-largest foreign market, importing 
more goods and services from America than any other country  except Canada. In
1994, Japan imported some $70 billion worth of  goods and services from the
U.S., supporting some 1.4 million  American jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Japan is a big customer for the U.S. manufacturing  industry.<B>
</B>Over 60 percent of U.S. exports to Japan are manufactured goods,  and
Japan's purchases of these goods support over 840,000  American manufacturing
jobs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. exports nearly $98 billion in goods to Latin  America
each year. These merchandise exports represent 19 percent of  all U.S.
merchandise exports and support 1.96 million U.S. jobs.

<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Since NAFTA went into effect on January 1, 1994, U.S. 
merchandise exports to Mexico and Canada have soared. During  NAFTA's first year
in 1994, U.S. merchandise exports to Canada,  America's largest trading partner,
grew by more than 13 percent to $114  billion. Likewise, U.S. merchandise
exports to Mexico grew over  22 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  percent to $51 billion.

<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since the Reagan and Bush Administrations, the expansion of  free trade has
been the cornerstone of U.S. policy toward  Latin America and the Caribbean. The
Enterprise for the Americas  Initiative launched by former President George Bush
in 1989 laid  out the goal of creating an American-led free-trade area 
encompassing the entire Western Hemisphere, from Alaska in North America  to
Tierra del Fuego in South America. The first step in creating  a Free Trade Area
of the Americas (FTAA) was taken by the  Bush Administration in 1990 with the
announcement that the U.S.  would negotiate a free-trade agreement with Mexico.
The North  American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was approved by the  U.S.
Congress in 1993 and implemented as of January 1, 1994.  Subsequently, at the
Summit of the Americas held in Miami,  Florida, from December 9-11, 1994,
President Clinton and all of the  democratically elected leaders of Latin
America, the Caribbean,  and Canada pledged unanimously to create an FTAA by the
year  2005; President Clinton also pledged that Chile would become  NAFTA's
fourth member by 1996, thus confirming to the region's  leaders that the U.S.
was firmly committed to hemispheric trade  expansion.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In April 1994, the United States signed the Uruguay Round  trade agreement,
which went into force on January 1, 1995. The  Reagan Administration initiated
these trade negotiations in 1986 as part  of an ongoing series of talks under
the General Agreement on  Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This was the seventh &quot;round&quot;
of GATT  trade talks that started in 1947. Prior to World War II, many 
countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 -->  established barriers to
international trade which contributed to  the Great Depression in the U.S. and
Europe. Following the war,  many of these barriers remained in place. The first
GATT round  was held in Geneva, Switzerland, in 1947 and resulted in some 
45,000 separate agreements that reduced tariffs on manufactured  goods and some
agricultural goods. Since GATT's inception, world  trade has expanded from less
than $100 billion in the late 1940s to  over $3 trillion today. Among other
things, the Uruguay Round  agreement creates a new body called the World Trade 
Organization (WTO). This organization is a forum in which countries can  seek
peaceful solutions to trade disputes without resorting to trade  protectionism.
Thus, instead of occasional international trade  negotiations like the seven
rounds GATT talks, the WTO allows for  ongoing negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The forum for Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC)  is America's
institutional link to fast-growing Asian  economies. Formed in 1989, APEC
encompasses Australia, Brunei,  Canada, Chile, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia,
Japan, Malaysia,  Mexico, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, 
Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, and the United States. The  leaders of
APEC's member economies, including President Bill  Clinton, in 1994 set as their
goal achieving &quot;free trade and investment  in the Asia Pacific&quot; region
by 2010 for developed members and  by 2020 for developing members.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, while paying lip service to free trade, the Clinton  Administration
has pursued a policy that isolates America from  the international economy and
thus threatens Americans whose  jobs depend on international trade. For example,
NAFTA's  expansion to include Chile has stalled because the Administration and 
Con
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 -->  gress cannot agree on the language
of a new fast-track  negotiating authority. The Administration insists on
language that would  allow trade sanctions to be imposed against countries that
violate  labor and environmental rules contained in the side agreements  to
NAFTA. Republican leaders in Congress reject this demand,  arguing that
extraneous issues unrelated to trade should not be  confused with trade. Without
a new fast-track negotiating  authority, NAFTA cannot be expanded to Chile, and
it is unlikely that  free-trade agreements could be negotiated with any other
country.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton snubbed other government heads and  reduced American
prestige in the region when he skipped the  November 19, 1995, Leaders' Meeting
in Osaka, Japan. The leaders will  meet in November 1996 in Subic Bay,
Philippines, and again in  November 1997 in Canada to review the each member's
progress  toward achieving APEC's free trade goal.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton has vacillated between free trade and  managed trade in
Asia. On one hand, he agreed to create a vast APEC  free-trade area, including
China and Japan, and help China join  the World Trade Organization (WTO). On the
other, he has  tightened import quotas on Chinese apparel and textiles and has
tried  unsuccessfully to force Japan to consent to new managed trade  agreements
on autos and semiconductors. Additionally, since  Clinton became President, the
U.S. has threatened to impose trade  sanctions on such imported products as
steel, textiles, cellular  telephones, consumer electronics products, and a host
of other  manufactured goods.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 --> 
</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The path of trade protectionism paved by the Clinton  Administration should
be reversed. America needs to be put back on the  road to free trade. In 1997,
the U.S. should:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>-     Establish free-trade areas between the United States
and its  trading partners.</B> NAFTA should be expanded to incorporate Chile 
and other Latin American countries, and Caribbean nations should  receive
trading parity with NAFTA members. The U.S. should  cooperate with other APEC
members and take more concrete steps  at the next two Leaders' Meetings to
achieve a free-trade area in  the Asia-Pacific. The U.S. also should encourage
other Latin  American economies to join Chile and Mexico in APEC in 1997. 
Finally, the U.S. should offer a Transatlantic Free Trade Area to  interested
European countries, including the recently freed nations in  Eastern and Central
Europe.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Propose a free-trade area &quot;framework agreement&quot; with 
European countries interested in a free-trade area with the U.S.</B> A 
framework agreement precedes a free-trade agreement, allowing both sides  to
propose which items and topics they wish to pursue as part of  the formal
negotiating process. It is a necessary first step toward  formal negotiations to
create a free-trade agreement with  European countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free trade area with Europe would make it easier for U.S.  companies to
sell their goods there.<B> </B>Most European countries still  have their own
peculiarities regarding product standards, testing,  labeling, and
certification. These differences often increase the cost  of U.S. products as
companies must alter their products to meet  these differing requirements. A
free-trade area with Europe would  allow the U.S. and Europe to seek common
product standards,  testing, 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  labeling, and certification
requirements, thereby reducing the  costs of doing business.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A free-trade area with Europe also would increase America's  access to
Europe's agricultural market. Even though the U.S.  and Europe reached an
agreement in 1994 to reduce some  agricultural subsidies as part of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and  Trade (GATT), Europe still maintains a host of
subsidies, trade  quotas, and import bans that restrict or prevent U.S.
agricultural exports  to Europe. Likewise, the U.S. still maintains agricultural
 subsidies, import quotas, and other restrictions that restrict agricultural 
imports from Europe. A free-trade agreement would allow U.S.  and European
negotiators to reduce barriers and promote  agricultural exports on both sides,
benefiting all parites.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-    Support the accession of both the People's Republic of China  and
the Republic of China on Taiwan to the World Trade  Organization on a
commercially viable basis.</B> In 1986, Beijing applied to  resume China's seat
in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade,  the predecessor of the WTO,
which the Republic of China on  Taiwan had abandoned in 1950. In 1990, Taiwan
also applied to join  the GATT. Following Hong Kong's example, Taiwan elected to
 apply as the autonomous customs territory of &quot;Chinese Taipei,&quot; 
rather than as a sovereign country. This move was intended to  finesse Beijing's
sensitivities over questions of sovereignty. Beijing  insists that Taiwan not
join the WTO before the PRC, but has offered  as its first act as a WTO member
to sponsor Taiwan. Joining  the WTO is an economic, not political, act.
Therefore, Beijing  should not be allowed to block Taiwan's entry; each
application should  be considered on its own merits. Although negotiations with 
Taiwan have progressed further, neither China nor Taiwan has offered  suf
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  ficient concessions to warrant
WTO membership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Demand an end to China's practice of forcing foreign firms  to
transfer technology as a condition of investing.</B> The leverage  that China
can exert with its huge market makes it difficult even  for large industrial
firms to resist this form of  government-sponsored theft. The U.S. must also
insist that all existing bilateral  trade agreements, especially the 1995
Intellectual Property  Rights Memorandum of Understanding, be fully enforced
before  approving China's accession to the WTO. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Repeal the outdated Jackson-Vanik Amendment to the Trade  Act of
1975.</B> The Jackson-Vanik Trade Act was designed to  encourage the Soviet
Union and its Eastern European satellites to lift  restrictions on Jewish
emigration to Israel and the U.S. It  withdraws America's most-favored-nation
trading status from any  country that restricts immigration. Threatening to deny
MFN status  to China because of human rights abuses has become an annual  ritual
in Congress. But maintaining MFN with China is clearly  in America's economic
interest. At stake are billions of dollars  in trade. It also encourages the
liberalization of China's political  system. Trade forces China to open up to
the outside world and  therefore serves the long-run cause of human rights.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Approve fast track for Chile before the 1996 elections.</B> Chile 
has enjoyed the fastest economic growth and the greatest  economic stability of
any country in Latin America since the mid-1980s. It  is in the forefront of
economic and democratic reform in the  Americas, having successfully achieved
the transition from military  dictatorship to civilian democracy. Chile is a
member of the APEC;  it is a strong candidate to join Mercosur (the South
American  Com
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 11 -->  mon Market comprised of
Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay)  when Mercosur's members can reduce their
tariffs to match Chile's;  and it has a working bilateral trade agreement with
Mexico.  However, Chile cannot join NAFTA before 1997 if Congress does not 
approve fast-track negotiating authority. Under fast track,  trade agreements
negotiated by the Administration are submitted  to Congress for a straight
up-or-down vote; however, Congress  may not change or amend any portion of the
proposed agreement  before voting. Chile is the benchmark against which the rest
of the  region will measure America's hemispheric vision and leadership.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>-     Submit more accurate trade reports.</B> The United States Trade 
Representative (USTR) produces an annual report on foreign  trade barriers. This
report is important because it identifies the  barriers that U.S. exporters face
when selling their products  overseas. However, it tells only one side of the
story. America maintains  a host of import restrictions such as trade quotas,
high tariffs,  and import bans that are not described in the report. They should
 be. By including such information, the U.S. government would  be presenting a
more open picture of the status of free trade and  of where reforms are still
needed, including within the U.S.  Moreover, such USTR reports should
incorporate a scorecard of  the current cost to the economy of each of these
U.S. restrictions  on trade.

<P><B><A NAME="Q&A">Q&amp;A</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. How can you support free trade when our huge trade deficit  is
destroying jobs?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America's trade deficit is only 1.5 percent of the size of  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  overall U.S. economy. The U.S.
budget deficit is 2.5 percent  of America's GNP. Thus, while much is made of
America's  trade deficit, it is nearly half the size of the U.S. budget deficit.
The  budget deficit hinders America's economy far more than does  the trade
deficit. Free trade creates jobs: One of every five U.S. jobs  is the result of
U.S. trade. Besides, free trade provides  Americans with greater consumer
choice, adds to the national wealth, and  is responsible for the fact that
American businesses are the  largest exporters in the world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Free trade is fine, but shouldn't America require a level  playing
field with its trading partners?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Countries that maintain trade barriers harm their  own
economies for more than they harm America's. Rather  than threaten to close
America's markets to foreign countries if they  do not remove barriers to U.S.
exports, America should seek to  use free-trade areas and the newly created
international dispute  settlement forum, the World Trade Organization, to
encourage  open markets. Under the WTO, the U.S. would be able to seek the 
opening of foreign markets through negotiations rather than threats  and
destructive retaliation. Even if the U.S. could not achieve  open markets abroad
through such means, it would be better  for America and its consumers to
dismantle U.S. trade  protectionism unilaterally than to impose higher barriers
to foreign imports.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Shouldn't America tell countries like Japan that if they do  not open
up, we will close our borders to them?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. That would be self-defeating. Japan is America's  largest
overseas market. It imports more goods and services from the  U.S. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  than the United Kingdom and
Germany combined and  is America's largest overseas market for agricultural
goods. Also,  the average Japanese person buys more goods and services from  the
U.S. than the average U.S. citizen buys from Japan. Why  does America have a
trade deficit with Japan?  There are many  factors, including the stubbornness
of American companies in refusing  to design products for the Japanese market.
But the main reason  is that there are twice as many Americans as there are 
Japanese. Even the Clinton Administration agrees that if Japan removed  all
supposed trade barriers to U.S. imports, the deficit would  shrink only
marginally.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Did NAFTA cause the Mexican crisis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA did not cause the Mexican crisis. The peso  collapsed on
December 19, 1994, because the Mexican economy is not  sufficiently free, and
because Mexico's political system is  undemocratic. Moreover, former Mexican
President Carlos Salinas  de Gortari refused to make needed monetary and
exchange  policy adjustments in advance of Mexico's 1994 presidential 
elections. When investors lost confidence in Mexico, they fled to safer 
markets. Mexico was unable to retain the confidence of investors  because it
lacked strong economic and democratic  institutions. Thanks to NAFTA, however,
President Ernesto Zedillo is  implementing economic and political reforms that
should create the  institutions Mexico lacked in 1994.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What is fast track, and why is it important?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Fast-track negotiating authority consists of special  legislative
rules adopted by Congress. These authorize the President to  nego
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  tiate trade agreements and submit
them to Congress for an  up-or-down vote without the addition of any amendments
by  Congress. Fast track accelerates the process of negotiating free trade 
agreements with other countries, while providing them the  assurance that
agreements they reach with the U.S. government will not  be changed subsequently
by Congress.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why is it important that fast track be approved before the  1996
elections?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> On four separate occasions since 1990, the U.S. has  pledged
officially that Chile would become the fourth member of  NAFTA. If Chile is not
admitted to NAFTA until 1997, America will  lose the opportunity to take the
lead in negotiating free-trade  agreements with other major economies in South
America,  including Argentina and Brazil. By 1997, Chile's interest in joining 
NAFTA may weaken, and America's chances of consolidating U.S.  leadership in
South America may be diminished. Chile cannot  join NAFTA until Congress has
granted fast-track negotiating  authority to the President. This authority is
needed to expedite negotiations.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Since NAFTA has not worked, why would a free-trade  area with Europe
work.
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> NAFTA has worked. Exports to Mexico increased by 20  percent
during the NAFTA's first year in 1994. Due to the  Mexican peso crisis, U.S.
exports to Mexico dropped slightly during  1995, but they were still higher than
the total for 1993, before  NAFTA was implemented. Moreover, the &quot;giant
sucking sound&quot;  predicted by Ross Perot never did occur. In fact, some
companies  that moved to Mexico prior to the NAFTA now are moving back to  the 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 15 -->  U.S. Why?  Because even though
Mexican workers may get  paid less, some companies are finding it harder to get
their products  out of Mexico because its roads, ports, and transportation
networks  are costly and inefficient.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What happens if some members of the European Union want  a free-trade
area with the U.S. but others do not?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. should extend an offer for a free-trade area directly 
to the European Union. At the same time, it should extend an offer  to
non-European Union members in Central and Eastern Europe,  and even to the newly
independent states of the former Soviet  Union. If the EU drags its feet in
negotiating with the U.S.,  America should pursue a free-trade area with such
non-EU members as  the Czech Republic and Estonia, two of Europe's most rapidly 
growing market economies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. What U.S. industries could be expected to benefit from  freer trade
with Europe?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> A host of industries would benefit from freer trade with  Europe.
These would include those involved in agriculture,  telecommunications, and the
manufacturing of automobiles, medical  equipment, and pharmaceuticals.

</center><p>

<P>Beyond the traditional tools of statecraft  war and diplomacy   America has
many lesser tools at its disposal in formulating  and executing foreign policy.
Like all good tools, however, they  are means to an end and should be used only
under the right  circumstances and with proper care. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>One of these tools is the United Nations. The U.S. should treat  the U.N.
not as some superior body to which it must apply for  approval, but as an
institution which can be useful in cultivating  international support for U.S.
policy. Another tool is foreign aid.  Aid can be an effective adjunct to U.S.
foreign policy, but only if  it works and serves American interests, neither of
which it has  done very well. Two other tools, both of which are indispensable 
for national security, are intelligence gathering and covert  operations. Even
though the Cold War is over, the chaotic and  threatening condition of today's
world requires a robust and effective  intelligence capability. Finally, there
is the important work of  public diplomacy, as represented by the United States 
Information Agency (USIA), the Voice of America (VOA), and other  official
media. Telling the American story to people overseas helps  build international
support for democracy and freedom, as well as  for specific U.S. policies.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>America must be engaged in world affairs. The U.S. cannot  protect its vital
interests unless it seeks to influence world opinion  and events in such
international bodies as the United Nations. But  this does not mean compromising
American principles, sovereignty,  or freedom of action. Whether in the U.N. or
any other  multilateral organization, the U.S. government should strive to
protect  American interests and represent American values. America must  pursue
its own agenda, not that of international bureaucrats often  hostile to U.S
interests. Only by doing so can the United States  remain strong enough to
contribute effectively to international peace  and stability.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>How to develop this American agenda in international  diplomacy is an issue
which separates conservatives from liberals.  Liberals tend to distrust American
power and seek to constrain it by tying  it to the U.N. Conservatives, knowing
that this power historically  has been used for good, want to liberate it from
these constraints.  Liberals want to put American forces under U.N. military 
command, and to have America adopt the U.N. bureaucracy's generally  socialist
agenda as its own; some have gone so far as to propose  that the U.N. be given
taxing powers over U.S. citizens. By  contrast, conservatives want America to
retain sovereign control over  its own military forces when they are involved in
U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Above all, conservatives want to prevent the U.S.
 from becoming a mere servant of the U.N.'s agenda, as the Clinton 
Administration has allowed to happen in Somalia and elsewhere;  they are willing
to work through the U.N. when it suits American  interests, but not when these
interests are not served.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another issue is whether, and to what extent, to support  U.S. policy abroad
through public diplomacy. Most people believe  that 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 3 -->  the U.S. needs some form of public
diplomacy to explain  American policy and values to people in foreign lands. It
is well  known that Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty and the Voice of  America
played important roles in bringing down the Iron Curtain.  What role should they
play in today's international diplomacy?   And once this role has been
established, what is the best way to  convey this message, through existing
official media structures and  outlets or through new ones?

<P>

<P>Even its strongest advocates recognize that the U.N. is  bloated, wasteful,
poorly managed, and disorganized. Only  fundamental reform can reinvigorate the
U.N. and restore its lost  credibility. The Clinton Administration itself
recognizes that unless the  U.N. is reformed, it will drift into irrelevance and
lose public support. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The U.N. claims that the U.S. is some $1.3 billion behind in  its financial
contributions. Washington says the figure should  be somewhat less. With
approximately half of its 185 member  states delinquent in their dues, the U.N.
is in serious financial crisis.  The Clinton Administration wants to pay, but
Congress wants to  withhold payment until the U.N. gets its budget under control
and  ends corruption and poor management practices. The Clinton  Administration
may propose a deal with Congress to repay America's  back fees over several
years in return for promised U.N. reforms.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Over the past few years, the U.N. has proven that it cannot  manage 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 4 -->  large, complex, and ambitious &quot;peace
operations&quot;  competently. This was seen most clearly in the debacles in
Somalia and  the former Yugoslavia. Not only have these operations been 
spectacular failures; they have been costly in terms of lives, material 
resources, and money. The U.S. spent almost $3 billion (in  direct and indirect
costs) in 1995 to support these failed U.N. operations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another contentious issue involves the specialized agencies.  Conservatives
believe that agencies such as the United Nations  Development Program (UNDP) and
United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO) do not merit
American financial  support or membership. Not only are they poorly managed and 
wasteful, but their mandates are counterproductive.

<P><B><A NAME="FACTS">THE FACTS</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     There is broad consensus that the U.N. needs
reforming.  Secretary of State Warren Christopher, in a September 1995 address
to  the U.N. General Assembly, proposed a &quot;concrete agenda&quot; for  U.N.
reform. This agenda involves ending programs that have  achieved their purpose,
consolidating overlapping programs,  downsizing regional economic commissions,
and imposing a moratorium  on big conferences.<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm#1">1</A>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Funding for the U.N. system falls into two categories:
assessed  and voluntary contributions. An assessed contribution is the price  of
membership in the U.N. and its specialized agencies.  Countries make voluntary
contributions to specialized agencies they  also wish to support. For 1996, the
Clinton Administration  requested some $1.07 billion for U.S. assessed and
voluntary contributions  to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and
commissions.  Actual 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 5 -->  U.S. spending for these
organizations totaled $1 billion in  1994. By contrast, more than 90 other
countries together account for  less than 1 percent of the U.N. budget, paying
only .01 percent each.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Cases of fraud and abuse erupt with disturbing regularity. In 
1995, for example, $10 million was embezzled from the United  Nations Children's
Fund (UNICEF) in Kenya. Various agencies of  the U.N. spent approximately $1
million a day at the height of the  Somalia peacekeeping operation in 1993. This
included renting  hundreds of apartments equipped with air conditioning. In 
December 1995, the U.N. scrapped a never-used $1 million turnstile  security
system at its New York headquarters. The reason: The  turnstile clocks would
have tracked the arrival and departure times of  U.N. employees. In 1995, the
U.N. spent some $500,000 for a  two-week conference on the Sustainable
Development of Small Island  Developing States, including $15,000 to fly
representatives from  the Western Sahara to Barbados.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has grown into a massive bureaucracy of over 70 
agencies and programs, including the United Nations Research  Institute for
Social Development (UNRISD) and the International  Labor Organization (ILO),
with overlapping mandates. The U.N.  system has over 50,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The United States plays a key role in supporting U.N. 
peacekeeping. Until last year, the U.S. paid nearly one-third of the  annual
$3.5 billion peacekeeping bill (now unilaterally reduced to 25  percent). The
U.S. assigns thousands of American soldiers to  U.N. missions and provides
billions of dollars worth of  transportation, equipment, and other support
services to the U.N. at no charge.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 6 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Until recently, traditional U.N. peacekeeping operations 
entailed small observation or peacekeeping missions deployed to  monitor an
already existing peace settlement. These operations  were simple, inexpensive,
unambitious, and usually staffed by  countries like Canada, Sweden, Norway, or
Austria. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     With the end of Cold War tensions among members of the 
Security Council, there was an explosion in peacekeeping  operations from 1989
to 1993, with the Security Council authorizing  more missions than it had in the
previous 40 years. In 1990, the  U.N. controlled approximately 10,000 &quot;blue
helmets&quot; in eight  operations at a cost of less than $700 million per year.
By the end  of 1993, there were over 90,000 &quot;blue helmets&quot; in 18
different  operations costing over $3.5 billion per year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has conducted 21 observation missions and six 
traditional peacekeeping missions since 1948. These missions have  a mixed
record in limiting armed conflict and promoting  conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. has expanded the definition of peacekeeping 
significantly since 1990. Now peacekeeping is called &quot;second  generation
peacekeeping&quot; or &quot;peace-enforcement.&quot;  In these  operations,
peacekeepers have been sent to volatile and dangerous areas  (such as Somalia
and Bosnia) before a conclusive peace was  achieved. These missions have been
large (employing up to 40,000  troops); complex (involving armored combat
formations with combat  air and naval support); dangerous (resulting in hundreds
of  U.N. troops killed in Somalia and Bosnia); ambitious (attempting  to impose
peace through force of arms); and expensive (costing  the U.N. almost $5 million
per day in Bosnia). All have been failures. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 7 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     As of August 1995, the U.S. had over 3,200 American troops 
deployed in support of U.N. peacekeeping operations. These  operations include
Macedonia, Western Sahara, Kuwait, and Haiti.  The U.S. also provided the great
bulk of NATO air forces to enforce  a U.N.-sponsored &quot;no-fly zone&quot;
over Bosnia-Herzegovina  from 1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Peacekeeping operations harm U.S. combat readiness. Time 
spent on peacekeeping missions is time not spent learning or  rehearsing
critical warfighting skills. A recent General Accounting  Office report noted
the deleterious effects of peacekeeping on  readiness,<A
HREF="ftnt19.htm">2</A> documenting how it can take 12 to 18
months for a unit to return  to the minimum proficiency standards required by
U.S. doctrine.  This means, for instance, that the U.S. Army in Europe, which
has  deployed most of its units to Bosnia for peace implementation  duty, will
be out of the warfighting business for two to three years.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.N. cannot command and control most military operations. 
It does not have the legitimacy, authority, structure, or procedures  to
organize and direct military missions competently. U.N.  command and control is
characterized by confusion and unresponsiveness.  A prime example is the
incoherent command and control  structure used in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. withdrew from the Paris-based United Nations 
Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) in  1984 because of
its hostility to free markets and record of waste  and abuse.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     In January 1996, the U.S. Army court-martialed Specialist 
Michael 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 8 -->  New. Specialist New had refused to
wear a U.N. beret and  insignia when his unit was deployed on U.N. duty in
Macedonia,  maintaining that he swore an oath of allegiance to the U.S.
Constitution  and not to the U.N. However, under U.S. law, up to 1,000 U.S. 
soldiers can be deployed at any one time in U.N. missions. Specialist  New swore
an oath to follow all legal orders and was treated fairly,  but his case raises
the broader issue of U.S. participation in U.N.  military missions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Secretary General Boutros-Ghali in January 1996 mentioned  the
possibility that the U.N. might impose a tax on such activities  as
international air travel and currency exchanges to gain &quot;a  minimum of
independence&quot; from member nations. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><A NAME="RECORD">THE RECORD</A></B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration began with a great deal of  enthusiasm for the
United Nations. President Clinton and his team  believed that with the end of
the Cold War, the U.N. could be  reinvigorated and begin to live up to the lofty
language of its Charter,  which assumes a central role for the organization in
preserving peace  and international security. The Clinton plan was for America
to  provide considerable support for U.N. peacekeeping and other  activities,
including foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration initially embraced an  interventionist U.N. Under
the doctrine of &quot;assertive multilateralism,&quot; the  U.S. would advance
its security goals by working &quot;assertively&quot; with  the U.N. rather than
unilaterally or with allies. Central to this  approach was heavy American
support of U.N. peacekeeping. U.N.  Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali went
so far as to advocate  a 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 9 -->  standing U.N. army under his
control. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>President Clinton was forced to retreat from this doctrine after  the
failure of the U.N. operation in Somalia, where the U.N.  undertook an ambitious
nation-building mandate for which it was  unprepared. In support of this
mission, President Clinton deployed U.S.  Army Rangers who were assigned to
capture a Somali warlord for  the U.N. In October 1993, American soldiers were
drawn into a  street battle in Mogadishu during which 18 Americans were killed 
and 75 wounded. In May 1994, Clinton backtracked and issued  Presidential
Decision Directive 25 (PDD 25), placing restrictions  on U.S. participation in
U.N. peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The highlight of the Clinton Administration's U.N. reform  effort has been
to establish an Inspector General's office in New  York. For years, Congress has
been pushing this idea. Unfortunately,  this office has only limited scope and
has been characterized as a  &quot;disappointment&quot; by Representative Lee
Hamilton (D-IN) and  Senator Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), two Members of Congress who
 have long championed the U.N. Driven by budget constraints,  the Clinton
Administration in December 1995 announced the  long-overdue U.S. withdrawal from
the United Nations Industrial  Development Organization (UNIDO).
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The 104th Congress tried to restrict some of the more  egregious Clinton
policies toward the U.N. The House and Senate  passed separate bills in 1995
that would cut U.S. financial contributions  to U.N. peacekeeping and limit U.S.
forces deployed in U.N.  peacekeeping operations. Both bills embody provisions
of the  Contract With America. During negotiations with the Clinton 
Administration, language in the defense authorization bill that placed  limits 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 10 -->  on U.S. participation in U.N.
peacekeeping was dropped.  President Clinton claimed that these limits were a
challenge to his  authority as commander in chief and threatened to veto the
bill if it  contained any such language. Congress backed down and passed  a
defense bill without these restrictions in January 1996. The  President
subsequently signed the defense bill.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>On another front, Representative Joe Scarborough (R-FL) in  October 1995
introduced the United Nations Withdrawal Act. This  legislation would require
the U.S. to withdraw from the U.N. by  the year 2000, retaining its membership
only in the U.N.'s  independent and specialized agencies. Representative
Scarborough's  bill was referred to the International Relations Committee, where
 it remains under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration boasts frequently of its participation  in
U.N.-sponsored international conferences. Vice President Al  Gore went to the
Cairo Conference on Population and Development  in 1994 and accompanied Hillary
Clinton to the Copenhagen  Social Summit in 1995, and Mrs. Clinton and Health
and Human  Services Secretary Donna Shalala attended the 1995 Fourth Women's 
Conference in Beijing. These conferences have come under  heavy criticism, both
for their anti-Western agendas and for their  wastefulness.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In early 1996, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali floated the idea  of imposing
a U.N. tax on member nations. Republican  Senators Robert Dole (KS) and Jesse
Helms (NC) responded in January  by introducing legislation to bar U.S. payments
to the U.N. if it  tries to implement such a tax. The Clinton Administration
opposes  a U.N. tax.

<P><B>WHAT TO DO IN 1997</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To promote U.S. interests in the U.N. without sacrificing 
American sovereignty or effectiveness, and to ensure that America  does not get
dragged into unworkable peacekeeping operations, the  U.S. should: 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Limit its total non-peacekeeping contribution to no more  than
$500 million per year.</B> In 1995, America's assessed and  voluntary
contributions to the U.N. and its specialized agencies and  commissions totaled
some $1 billion. Approximately $260 million of  this amount went to the U.N.
administrative budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Stop paying assessed contributions to U.N. specialized  agencies.</B>
The few specialized agencies worthy of support, such as the  Universal Postal
Union and the World Meteorological  Organization, should be funded on a
case-by-case and voluntary basis from  the $500 million given to the U.N. This
dramatically reduced level  of spending will allow the U.S. to establish a
fundamentally  different relationship with a considerably scaled-back U.N.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never place U.S. troops under U.N. command.</B> The U.S.  may
choose to support some traditional peacekeeping operations,  such as the one in
Cyprus. However, U.S. forces should not be  placed under U.N. command. The U.S.
can provide support for U.N.  missions without operating in the U.N. chain of
command. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Never give the Security Council veto power over American  foreign
policy.</B> It may be diplomatically useful to gain U.N.  Security Council
support for U.S. military actions, as President Bush did  in 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  the Persian Gulf War when his
Administration won a  Security Council resolution supporting the expulsion of
Iraq from  Kuwait. However, this support should never be considered essential. 
The U.S. should never allow Security Council politics to keep it  from defending
vital American interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Eliminate funding for the United Nations Development  Program
(UNDP).</B> One of the bewildering array of specialized agencies  in the U.N.
system, UNDP is charged with &quot;contribut[ing] to a  sustainable expansion of
the world economy.&quot;  Essentially, it is a  foreign aid agency. Not only are
its programs unfocused and  duplicative, but foreign aid has proven
counterproductive in country  after country. Eliminating funding for this
specialized agency will  save the U.S. approximately $120 million a year.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     End funding for all U.N. international conferences.</B> These 
conferences, which cost millions of dollars, are long on rhetoric  and short on
achievement. The 1995 Social Summit, for example,  focused on &quot;Creating
Jobs&quot; and &quot;Building Solidarity,&quot; two  objectives well beyond the
capabilities of a one-time gathering of  national and international bureaucrats.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*      Reject any proposal to vest the U.N. with taxing authority.</B> 
Senators Dole and Helms have introduced legislation that would  have the U.S.
stop paying its dues if the U.N. tries to impose a tax.  The Clinton
Administration also has voiced its opposition to the idea  of such a tax. The
U.S. should continue to send a strong message  that this trial balloon, floated
by Secretary General Boutros-Ghali  in January 1996 and bound to resurface
within the U.N., is  unacceptable.

<P><B>Q. Isn't it isolationist to suggest that the U.S. reduce its role in 
the U.N.? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Opposition to a poorly managed and corrupt  international
bureaucracy in New York is not support for isolationism.  Conservatives support
NATO and other alliances, as well as limited  participation in the U.N. This is
not isolationist; it is international  engagement in support of American, not
U.N., interests.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why are you so opposed to the U.N.?  What right do we have  to impose
our will without first consulting with the  international community through the
U.N.? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> When deciding American foreign policy, the President  should
consult with his advisors and the Congress, not the U.N. We  don't need the
permission of the U.N. to protect American freedom  and interests. The U.N. is
plagued with corruption, and many of  its activities, including its foreign aid
programs, perpetuate  dependency throughout the developing world. Moreover, the
U.N.  is merely a collection of often opposing national interests. It is 
ridiculous to suggest that the 180-plus governments in the U.N.   many of which
are dictatorships  represent the democratic will  of the world community.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The U.N. is responsible for international peace and  security. How
can the U.S. promote international peace and security if it  is not involved in
U.N. peacekeeping? 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Despite its lofty objectives, the U.N. contributes only  margin
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 -->  ally to international peace and
security. Since its creation in  1945, it has been a bit player on the world
stage. The U.S. remains  the world's principal force for international peace and
security  by maintaining forces in Europe and the Pacific region and by 
participating in alliance structures like NATO. It is highly misleading  to
measure a nation's contribution to the world's security by  gauging its
participation in marginal undertakings like U.N.  peacekeeping. America and its
Western allies ended the Cold War by being  militarily strong, not by
participating in &quot;peace&quot; missions  sponsored by the U.N. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. An American soldier, Specialist Michael New, was  court-martialed in
January 1996 for refusing to wear U.N. insignia  and serve under U.N. command.
He maintains this violates his oath  to support and defend the Constitution of
the United States. Do  you support him?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> As a soldier, Specialist New is obligated by his oath to obey 
the lawful orders of his chain of command. However unwise as a  matter of
policy, New's orders were not illegal. Therefore, he  should face the
consequences of his disobedience. However,  Specialist New should not have been
placed in a position where he  was forced to choose between his duty and his
conscience.  American soldiers should not be placed in the U.N. chain of
command.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Secretary General Boutros-Ghali has floated the idea of  establishing
a U.N. tax on international commercial airline flights,  currency exchanges, and
other international transactions. What do  you think about this?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> It is ridiculous. The power to tax is a sovereign power of  gov

<P>Effective intelligence is as necessary today as during the  Cold War.
Despite the end of the Cold War, the world remains a  very dangerous and
increasingly unpredictable place. Threats  to America's interests are real and
growing. They can arise in  regions vital to the U.S. with little or no warning.
America needs a  robust 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  intelligence gathering capacity
both to enable its leaders to  understand these threats and to give them as much
warning of  approaching danger as possible. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>However, the U.S. intelligence community today faces  serious problems and
challenges. The morale of the Central  Intelligence Agency has been severely
damaged by the Aldrich Ames spy  case. Moreover, the CIA has failed to predict
crucially important  developments, most notably the collapse of the Soviet Union
 and Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. The intelligence  community, like the
Defense Department, has been forced to  finance much of the so-called peace
dividend through drastic reductions  in budgets and personnel. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many issues must be resolved if the U.S. is to maintain robust  and highly
capable intelligence assets able to meet the complex  challenges of the
post-Cold War era and the 21st century. Among  the questions facing policymakers
today:

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The U.S. intelligence community consists of the
Central  Intelligence Agency; the Defense Intelligence Agency; the  intelligence
units of the armed services; the National Security Agency,  which monitors and
analyzes worldwide radio-telephone and other  electronic transmissions; and the
National Reconnaissance  Office, which gathers and processes satellite imagery.
The CIA is  forbidden by law to conduct intelligence activities inside the U.S.;
 domestic intelligence and internal security are the responsibility  of the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. Overall coordination and  direction of foreign
intelligence is provided by the Director of  Central Intelligence (DCI),
although military intelligence operates  with a high degree of autonomy within
this structure. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The DCI is appointed by the President and confirmed by the 
Senate, which means the CIA is subject to a certain degree of  political
pressure from the White House. Ideally, however, the DCI is  objective and &quot;non-political,&quot;
since intelligence findings tailored  to fit political objectives can be
useless, if not actually dangerous  and misleading.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Most U.S. intelligence on foreign activities is derived from 
monitoring electronic emissions (radio and telephone traffic) and  from 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 18 -->  satellites orbiting high above
the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Information gained from satellites is vital, especially in 
wartime. Satellites allow the U.S. to detect and track missile launches;  to
track the movements of foreign ground, air, and naval forces;  and to monitor
compliance with arms control treaties. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     Although America's intelligence collection from satellites 
and signals intercepts is highly effective, the U.S. intelligence  community
relies heavily on high technology and neglects  intelligence from human sources
(HUMINT). There is no substitute for  the information provided by trained or
knowledgeable human  observers. People can enter underground or covered
facilities which  satellite sensors cannot observe. Only people can penetrate 
terrorist cells or drug networks, and only human agents can provide  some
assessment of an adversary's intentions.

</P>
<P>The Clinton Administration has failed to resolve these  fundamental issues,
or even to undertake any serious reappraisal  of America's intelligence needs.
Nor has Clinton been able to  improve CIA morale in the wake of the Aldrich Ames
disaster.  Instead, the Administration has presided over a reduction of 
intelligence agency budgets and personnel without any clear rationale  or
understanding of the changing role of intelligence in the  post-Cold 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 19 -->  War world. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The intelligence community is being downsized at a rate of  3-5 percent per
year, with some vital components losing as much as  80 percent of their
personnel. Moreover, the Administration has  failed to recognize that the
national intelligence mission has not  diminished substantially with the end of
the Cold War; it has  become broader and more complex. While reducing its
resources, the  Administration continues to impose on the intelligence community
 a growing range of tasks, such as supporting arms control and  other
international agreements being pursued by the White House  and monitoring
developments in trouble spots like Somalia,  Rwanda, Haiti, and the Balkans
where the Administration has  committed U.S. forces to peacekeeping and
humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>By demanding more of the intelligence community while  cutting its
resources, the Clinton Administration is in danger of  stretching America's
intelligence capabilities to the breaking point.  The President is jeopardizing
the intelligence community's ability  to provide strategic warning in the event
of conflict and to  furnish vital analysis to the national command authority in
time of crisis.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Another problem is that the Administration has politicized the  CIA by &quot;cooking&quot;
intelligence findings to support preconceived  positions. Perhaps the most
glaring example has been  the Administration's attempt to downplay the ballistic
missile threat  to the continental United States in order to justify its
opposition  to national missile defense<B>.

Administration and Congress should:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Stabilize the budget, personnel, and
technical resources of the  intelligence community.</B> Congress should direct
the  Administration to conduct a thorough assessment of the types of
intelligence  and levels of activity that are vital to national security, and
then to  base budget and manpower decisions on that assessment. So far,  this
has not been done.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Shore up the human side of espionage. </B> Because
America's  high technology is superior, the intelligence community has 
developed a strong technocratic bias. It often neglects the human side of 
intelligence gathering. Technical intelligence is valuable, but it has  its
limits. Only people can get inside an underground weapons  storage facility or,
more important, get inside the thinking of a  potential aggressor or penetrate a
terrorist cell. Improving human  intelligence will require institutional change
that assures career  advancement for officers who are aggressive in recruiting
and  &quot;running&quot; informants and operatives and that allows agency
officers to  use commonsense criteria in recruiting foreign operatives and 
informants. Common sense suggests that foreign informants  sometimes will be
unsavory characters. As long as these informants do  not harm Americans, the
U.S. should not assume responsibility for  all their actions merely because they
are informants or working  on contract. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Generate more innovation and creativity in the

 science. The problem with U.S. intelligence is not lack of data,  but lack of
imagination and creativity in concluding what the data  are 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 21 -->  saying, in discerning the
patterns and trends suggested by the  data. The CIA needs to reward agents in
the field for innovative  collection methods. It also needs to reward analysts
for foresight,  insight, and good judgment in drawing proper conclusions from
the  information collected. The DCI must not merely manage the  Agency but lead
it. That means ending the mindset of risk-averse,  bureaucratic caution that
dominates the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Strengthen the CIA's counter-intelligence  capabilities</B>. There must
be no more Ames-like penetrations of the CIA. This will  require an internal or
institutional change in thinking which  accepts the possibility that U.S.
intelligence agencies are targets for  foreign penetration and that,
regrettably, some Americans like  Ames can be recruited to betray their country.
Better congressional  oversight which demands accountability by CIA managers,
and  support by the DCI and the Agency for a vigorous  counter-intelligence
effort inside the Agency, are also necessary for improving 
counter-intelligence.

<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Better control the dissemination of intelligence not

to  share U.S. intelligence could cripple America's ability to collect

information. Congress should severely restrict, if not forbid,  the disclosure
of U.S. intelligence to non-alliance organizations  like the U.N.

<P><B>Q. Why do we need spies now that the Cold War is over?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America and its allies still face a variety of threats and  new
challenges to vital interests even though the Cold War is over.  The radical
downsizing of U.S. military forces makes it more  crucial than ever that America
have the best possible intelligence, both  to provide early warning of crisis to
the commander in chief and  to provide policy options for dealing with the
complex new  challenges of the post-Cold War world.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. With the end of the Soviet military threat, wouldn't U.S. 
intelligence assets be put to better use gathering information  on America's
competition in technology and trade?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. government needs to stay out of corporate  espionage.
Some argue that the U.S., while no longer engaged in a  military confrontation
with the Soviet Union, should see itself as  engaged in an economic war with
rest of the world. Such claims are  alarmist at least, and deceptive at best. If
American corporations want  to engage in the normal and legal gathering of
business  information, that is their choice. But diverting U.S. government 
intelligence agencies to spy for U.S. business risks discrediting  the
government's legitimate function. Recent allegations that the  CIA spied for the
United State Trade Representative's office  during automotive negotiations with
Japan are a case in point. Instead  of spying for American corporations, which
are private entities  not deserving of official support, intelligence agencies
should  be monitoring the sales of Russian nuclear weapons and the  movements of
Iranian submarines operating in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Why does the CIA use criminals and murderers as agents  in Latin
America and other Third World countries, even  including some allegedly guilty
of killing American citizens?
</B><!-- Generation of PM publication page 23 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Informants are not the same as field officers, or what  are
loosely termed &quot;agents.&quot;  No one would hold a New York  policeman
responsible for the actions of a drug dealer turned  informant, especially if
the offending actions have nothing to do with the  undercover operation. The
same is true regarding CIA  informants. However, under no circumstances should
the CIA protect an  informant or contract employee who harms a fellow American. 
When such cases come to light, the Agency should terminate the  relationship at
once and report the criminal to the proper authorities,  even if it means losing
a valuable source of information.

<P>America's foreign aid program is coming under increasing  scrutiny, not only
by the American public, but also in Congress.  Although the $12 billion a year
spent on foreign aid represents a  relatively small part of the federal budget,
more and more  skeptics argue that this program is a waste of taxpayers' money.
There  is little evidence to support the contentions of proponents that  foreign
aid is vital to America's national interest. There is even  less evidence that
this money actually helps alleviate poverty in  less-developed countries.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Why, then, has foreign aid proved to be one of the hardest  programs to cut
or eliminate?  The main reason is the way the  program is structured. The
foreign aid program has three major  elements. 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 24 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>First</B> is military and security assistance to promote
America's  national security abroad. Consisting of such undertakings as 
anti-narcotics efforts, joint military training exercises between U.S.  and
foreign forces, and grants to foreign countries to purchase  U.S. military
equipment, this program accounts for about 25 percent  of the overall foreign
aid budget. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Second</B> is humanitarian and disaster relief assistance to aid 
victims of natural disaster and prevent mass starvation. This program  accounts
for some 15 percent of the foreign aid budget.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Third</B> is economic and development assistance to promote  economic
growth in less developed countries. This program  consumes about 60 percent of
the foreign aid budget. 
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P>The debate over foreign aid often has centered on funding  levels for these
three major components. During the Cold War, the  U.S. funneled significant
amounts of military and security aid, as  well as economic and development
assistance, to its allies in the  fight against communism. Now that the Soviet
Union has  collapsed, however, critics of the program wonder why America needs 
to spend $12 billion a year around the globe. The Clinton  Administration argues
that the program is still needed to support  America's interests abroad.
Skeptics, many of whom questioned the merits  of the economic aid program even
during the Cold War, argue that  it makes even less sense today.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Many proposals have surfaced, from abolishing the Agency  for International
Development (AID), the agency in charge of  distributing America's foreign aid
dollars, to moving remaining  funding 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 25 -->  and programs into existing
departments like State and  Defense. Another &quot;reform&quot; proposal would
increase the budget to face  the new challenges of the post-Cold War era and
re-focus the  program on what is called &quot;sustainable economic development&quot;
of  poorer countries. This is the argument made by the Clinton  Administration.

<P>There is bipartisan consensus that foreign aid needs to be  reformed. The
Clinton Administration's own study on  reinventing government argues that AID
does not have a single, clearly  defined and articulated strategic mission.
Shortly after this study  was issued, Secretary of State Warren Christopher
announced his  proposal for an enhanced Department of International Relations 
in which AID and other agencies would be abolished and their  functions assumed
by the State Department.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The State Department authorization bill would have moved  USIA, the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency (ACDA), and  AID into the State Department. The
bill was derailed by  opposition from the Clinton Administration and Senate
Democrats, led  by Senator John Kerry (D-MA). The House of Representatives 
approved these consolidations in June 1995, and Senator Kerry  and Senate
Foreign Relations Committee chairman Jesse Helms  (R-
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 27 -->  NC) agreed to a plan to cut the
operating expenses of these  agencies. Consolidation proponents believe that
these cuts will  force the Clinton Administration to move these three agencies
into  the State Department. A House-Senate conference report awaits  approval by
the Senate and the President, who has threatened to  veto the bill.

<P>
</P>
<P>The 1996 appropriations bill for foreign aid has been passed  by both houses
of Congress and signed by the President. This  measure cuts foreign aid spending
from $14.3 billion in FY 1995 to  $12.1 billion in FY 1996. The 1996
appropriations bill also includes  language requiring AID to submit to Congress
a detailed report  outlining the relative levels of economic freedom of foreign
aid  recipients. This report will make it more difficult for AID to  continue to
give money to countries with economically unfree or  repressed economies.

AID is the main reason America continues  to waste so much money on foreign aid.
If Congress cannot pass  authorizing legislation that eliminates AID, it should
refuse to  appropriate any money for the agency's operating expenses until  such
legislation is signed into law. Moreover, international  development assistance
does not work. Countries receiving economic aid  for over 35 years are no better
off today than they were before.  Thus, not only should AID be abolished, but so
should the entire  development assistance program.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*     Require the President to certify to Congress that any security 
and military aid sent abroad is necessary to support U.S. national  security
interests.</B> The foreign aid account is more than just  development
assistance; it also includes funds for military and  security assistance. It is
widely claimed that this money directly  supports the national interest abroad
by enhancing U.S. influence in  international affairs. However, many of
America's foreign aid  recipients routinely vote against the U.S. in the United
Nations; the  voting records of the U.N. show that three out of every four
recipients  of U.S. foreign aid vote against America more than half the time. 
<B> </B>If Congress is asked to appropriate foreign aid for the purpose  of
promoting the national interest, it should get more than a  promise from the
White House that it will get the job done.  Congress should require the
President to certify that U.S. foreign aid  supports American interests abroad.
</P>

</P>
<P><B>*     Phase out funding for the World Bank, the International  Monetary 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 29 -->  Fund, and the other multilateral
development banks.</B> These  multilateral development banks (MDBs) have been no
more  successful at promoting economic growth in less developed countries  than
has AID. In fact, a strong case can be made that they have had  less success
than AID. Since the 1950s, the World Bank and the  IMF have disbursed over $350
billion to less developed countries.  Most of these countries are no better off
today than they were  before receiving their money. In fact, many are worse off.
The  U.S. should phase out financial support to these institutions.

<P><B>Q. How can you call for cutting aid to the poor at a time  when more
people are living in poverty around the globe than ever  before?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because most economic aid perpetuates poverty. The only  way poor
countries can break out of the poverty trap is to stop  depending on foreign
aid. In this day and age, poverty is not the  natural condition of mankind; it
is a condition imposed by corrupt  governments which repress their economies.
Foreign aid does not  help countries develop. Most long-term recipients are no
better off  today then they were 30 years ago. If poor countries do not  adopt
economically free policies, they will remain poor, no matter  how much money we
throw at them.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. You say foreign aid does not work. How come the  Marshall Plan, the
largest foreign aid program, is considered successful?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The Marshall Plan was not development aid. It was a plan  to
rebuild already developed countries. But underdeveloped  countries 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 30 -->  are not rebuilding an established
infrastructure; they are trying  to acquire one. They also do not have the
established  free-market economic foundations that post-war Europe had. Thus, 
while money spent in post-war Europe helped rebuild roads and  bridges, foreign
aid in the less developed world has done little good  because no amount of
foreign aid could provide the degree of  modernization and industrialization
which existed in Europe  before World War II.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. The Agency for International Development has been  extremely
successful in improving child mortality rates, providing  vaccinations, and
helping to feed those in immediate need of food.  How can you support cutting
funding for programs which help to  keep people alive?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Because Americans, as private citizens, are doing a better  job
than government in helping people. Americans spend some  $12 billion a year on
private overseas charities. AID spends less  than $100 million on disaster
relief and related programs. If  America has helped children and the poor in
less developed countries, it  is mainly because of the work of these private
charities.  Private charities are far more effective than AID, which is a 
bureaucracy that spends some 70 cents of every foreign aid dollar  within
America's borders. It is far better to give to private charities  than to waste
taxpayer dollars on American professors who, on  AID contracts, do nothing more
than write studies of foreign aid.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Isn't foreign aid necessary at least for countries trying to  develop
free markets?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No, but it can be useful if properly conceived, managed,  and 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 31 -->  targeted. Private foreign
investors spend some $18 billion a  year investing abroad. Those private
investments are much larger  than the $12 billion government dispenses each year
in foreign aid.  Foreign investment, not foreign aid, is necessary for  economic
growth. To attract foreign investment, governments must cut  taxes, privatize
business, eliminate regulations, and institute other  similar reforms. In most
cases, foreign governments do not need aid  to implement these reforms (the
obvious exceptions being  former Eastern Bloc nations, which can use it
constructively for  education and training to encourage the creation of market
institutions). 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P> <B>Q.Won't cutting foreign aid result in more Somalias and Haitis?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> No. Both Haiti and Somalia are long-term recipients of  foreign
aid. Somalia has been hooked on U.S. foreign aid for 40  years, receiving over
$750 million since 1955. Yet Somalia is  poorer today than it was in 1965. Haiti
has received almost $1 billion  in foreign aid over 51 years, and it also is
poorer today than it was  in 1965. If economic aid is so necessary to create
economic  development in poor countries, why has it not worked in these two 
countries?
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Doesn't the U.S. foreign aid program at least help  American
businesses?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Yes, it helps some businesses, contractors, and consultants.  But
this should not be the purpose of foreign aid. Choosing  winners and losers in
the market is not the proper business of  government. Rewarding special
interests with federal dollars will not help  poor countries abroad.

</P>
<P><B>Q. You may call it corporate welfare, but shouldn't Washington  be doing
all it can to help American businesses export?  After  all, exports mean jobs
for Americans. 
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> The U.S. is the largest exporter in the world and would  remain
so without government subsidies, which help only a few  of America's businesses.
Many now-subsidized trade deals would  be made without this government
financing. Yes, some  businesses seem to &quot;win&quot; from government
subsidies, but the losers are  the American taxpayers who pay for these
programs. This  money should be left in the hands of the people who earned it
rather  than given to those who happen to have powerful friends in  Washington.

</P>
<P>Public diplomacy is the means by which the U.S.  government communicates
directly to the peoples of foreign countries.  Essentially, it involves the
information and cultural activities of  the United States government. Public
diplomacy enables the U.S.  government to present its perspective to people in
other countries  and to provide accurate information about the U.S. to those who
 otherwise would never receive it, preferably in a manner other  cultures will
find credible. These efforts take place outside of the  standard channels of
diplomacy  specifically, outside the State  Department, which conducts formal
diplomatic relations with other  nations. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In this age of information, mass communication is rapid,  virtually 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 33 -->  global, and accessible with
unprecedented ease to a larger  number of people than ever before. Information
can affect mass  sentiment and public opinion in foreign nations, and therefore
the policy  decisions of foreign governments. In certain situations, ideas  and
imagery can have greater impact than bombs and bullets.  Thus, public diplomacy,
particularly the direct dissemination of  policy decisions and the rationale for
making them, remains an  important tool of foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>A prime example of the impact of public diplomacy is the fall  of the Soviet
Union. The Soviets could not compete in the  modern world without opening up
their captive empire to new forms  of information and communication technology.
Once that  happened, they no longer could isolate their people from Western
ideals  of democracy, free markets, and individual liberty. It was the 
communication and popularization of these ideals which eroded  the legitimacy of
Communism and, as much as Western  military strength, eventually brought the
Soviet structure crashing down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some liberals criticize public diplomacy as a form of  propaganda. They see
it as a camouflage for activities that are improper for  the U.S. government.
This position flows from the Left's  reflexive &quot;blame America&quot;
attitude. Those who hold this view  evidently believe that America's
institutions are deeply flawed, and  that America's founding principles are
irrelevant to nations  struggling to find their way in the chaotic post-Cold War
era.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Some conservatives are critical of public diplomacy as well.  They believe
that America should concentrate on solving internal  domestic problems like
out-of-control deficits and excessive  federal spending. These skeptics believe
that reaching foreign publics  with 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 34 -->  American ideals should be
subordinated to other, more  pressing needs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>While most Members of Congress support official U.S.  broadcasting, there is
no consensus in Congress or in the Administration  on how much the U.S. should
spend on public diplomacy. Nor is  there unanimity on how the official
components of public  diplomacy, such as the United States Information Agency,
should be  organized.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     The primary broadcasting arms of the U.S.
government are 1)  the Voice of America, which broadcasts to nearly 100 million 
people worldwide; 2) Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL),  which is heard
in areas once under Soviet domination; and 3)  Radio Mart&iacute;, which covers
communist Cuba. VOA broadcasts  world news as well as statements of official
U.S. government  policy. RFE/RL reports on events and activities inside the
former  communist countries, thus serving as a surrogate news service for  local
citizens. This vital role is unique because of RFE/RL's  credibility as an
independent, non-local government source of news and  information.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     The U.S. Information Agency conducts America's official 
information and cultural activities. For example, it maintains  libraries around
the world and hosts an extensive program of cultural  exchanges. It sponsors
foreign visitors who come to the U.S.  and have a chance to experience democracy
and free enterprise  firsthand. Its research bureau measures foreign public
reaction to  U.S. policies. Moreover, American spokesmen  not merely U.S.  gov

<P>
</P>
<P>Public diplomacy agencies and media have undergone  significant
reorganization since the Cold War ended. The Board for  International
Broadcasting was abolished at the end of 1995 by  presidential decision, and
funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio  Liberty, formerly handled by the Board,
will be disseminated  directly through the United States Information Agency
(USIA), an  independent executive branch agency. This emphasizes USIA's role  as
America's primary arm of public diplomacy. However, even  while public diplomacy
is being consolidated under USIA, its budget  has been severely curtailed. The
USIA budget in FY 1993 was  $965 million. The budget for FY 1995 was $520
million.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Neither Congress nor the Administration has provided  adequate support for
U.S. international broadcasting. For example,  the Voice of America (VOA), the
U.S. government's primary  broadcasting medium, has been severely slashed by
congressional  &quot;deficit hawks,&quot; resulting in the loss of 400 uniquely
skilled  professionals and the ability to broadcast in 20 foreign languages.
These  cuts in FY 1996 come on top of others mandated in the FY 1994 
International Broadcasting Act, which cut 900 staff employees at  Radio Free
Europe/Radio Liberty and 350 at the VOA.

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Adjust methods of information
dissemination to the post-Cold  War era.</B> The USIA's audience is considerably
different in the  post-Cold War era; foreign audiences increasingly listen to 
AM/FM radio and watch television, while the number of short-wave  radio
listeners is falling sharply. Therefore, there must be a stronger  investment in
AM/FM radio and television broadcasting, but  short-wave investments may be
reduced to more appropriate levels.  At the same time, the U.S. government must
maintain a &quot;surge  capacity&quot; to reach foreign audiences directly. It
cannot rely on  commercial media outlets to articulate U.S. policy around the
world.  Information dissemination through the Internet also must be  encouraged.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Emphasize reaching the populations of emerging
democracies.</B>  The U.S. has a vested interest in reinforcing the emerging 
democracies' commitment to freedom and both economic and political  reform. The
benefits would be greater security for the U.S., increased  trade opportunities,
and stronger international economies. Public  diplomacy can facilitate this by
providing ideas, information, and  practical experience in the form of
broadcasting, professional  exchanges, and training programs.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B><CITE>-</CITE>     Provide adequate funds for international
broadcasting.</B> Funding  for international broadcasting should be maintained
at current  levels. This requires at least $385 million for the VOA, $240
million  for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and $27 million for  Radio Mart&iacute;.

</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Now that the Cold War is over, isn't public diplomacy,  espe
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 37 -->  cially government broadcasting,
unnecessary?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> America still needs an effective voice to present democratic  and
free-market values in today's competitive global marketplace  of ideas. Other
nations, many of them unfriendly to America,  are speaking aggressively in this
marketplace. The revolutionary  regime in Iran is a notable example. America
needs to be there  as well, engaged in the vital war of ideas, in order to shape
the  kind of world we want.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. America's values can reach the world through CNN,  other broadcast
media, and many forms of popular entertainment.  Why do we need the Voice of
America?
</B></P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Much of the American popular entertainment that reaches  the
world  rock music and Hollywood films, for example     conveys a jaundiced view
of America, giving some countries one more  excuse to condemn the United States.
And CNN, while virtually  a global network, does not reach an audience nearly as
wide,  diverse, or strategically targeted as the audience for U.S.  government
broadcasting. Nor can CNN speak on behalf of the U.S.  government. We cannot
rely on Ted Turner to give our official  spokesmen the opportunity to tell
America's story, directly and  unfiltered, in a future world crisis. The United
States, as the  world's only remaining superpower, must retain this &quot;surge
capacity.&quot;   Pop culture and Hollywood shouldn't be the only broadcasters 
of American values abroad. America still needs an official voice  to explain its
policies.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Q. Should the functions of USIA be merged into the State  department?</B>
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 38 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>A.</B> Some have argued that this would reduce bureaucratic  duplication
and save money, but any savings are offset by the fact  that USIA's basic role 
reaching foreign publics directly  often  conflicts with the State Department's
role in negotiating with  foreign government officials.

<P><B>M</B>ost opinion polls show that Americans are not very interested  in
foreign policy issues. Indeed, a CNN/<I>USA  Today</I>/Gallup poll early in
1996 found that only 14 percent of Americans regard  foreign policy as a top
priority in forming their vote. Nonetheless,  the American people still demand
that America have a strong  foreign policy that fulfills certain expectations.
These expectations  include maintaining America's leadership in the world,
upholding the  respect of other countries for America, and protecting  America's
interests and the country's future. Therefore, even though  Americans may
express little overt interest in specific foreign  issues, they have a latent
expectation that Presidents fulfill certain  expectations. Disappointing these
expectations can prove to be  politically fatal for a President.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The American people are not isolationist; rather they are  largely
indifferent to foreign policy issues, focusing instead on more  immediate
domestic concerns. Isolationism implies America  must intentionally work alone
without allies, without concerning  itself with foreign matters at all.
Isolationism also implies trade  protectionism. Opinion polls show that
Americans are not  isolationist. They still want a strong America, although one
that relates  foreign policy problems to domestic concerns. Americans are 
worried about too much intervention abroad, but they understand the  need 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 2 -->  for the U.S. to remain engaged in
global affairs. 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>Since the end of the Gulf War, there has not been a  compelling issue to
ignite the latent interest of Americans in foreign policy.  If there were a
crisis with a clear impact on American security  and vital interests overseas,
foreign policy would return to the top  of political priorities in the polls.

</P>
<P>U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE Operation Joint Endeavor Fact Sheet December 7,
1995
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 12 -->  
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>This fact sheet provides information on the role and mission of  the
Implementation Force (IFOR) in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>Why The U.S. Must Play A Role In IFOR</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The United States has vital political, economic and security  interests in
Europe. The war in Bosnia threatens these interests.  We now have the first real
opportunity to end this war. To seize  this opportunity requires a commitment of
U.S. troops as part of  a NATO peace implementation force (IFOR). The risks to 
the United States of allowing the war to continue are greater than  the risks of
enforcing the peace.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What U.S. Forces Will Do At First</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>It will take approximately eight weeks for the entire U.S. force  of
approximately 20,000 soldiers to arrive in the northeastern  portion of Bosnia,
with a division headquarters in Tuzla. Most of  the troops will come from the
1st Armored Division in Germany.  They will travel to Bosnia mainly by road and
rail using routes that  are currently in use and clear of mines. A Nordic
brigade and a  reinforced Turkish battalion will also be located in the U.S. 
sector which will be under the control of the U.S. Army Major  General William
Nash, the commander of the 1st Armored Division.  Eventually a Russian brigade
will also be located in the U.S. sector.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>When this main body of U.S. forces arrives, they will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force
</P>
<P>-      Execute transfer of the U.S. sector from the United Nations  Protec
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 13 -->  tion Force (UNPROFOR)
</P>
<P>-     Establish Joint Military Commissions
</P>
<P>-     Establish a logistic network
</P>
<P>-     Expand the Tuzla airfield
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>What IFOR Will Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>There are two complementary aspects of the overall peace  implementation
mission  civil and military. The civil aspect  includes rebuilding the Bosnian
infrastructure, economic  development, elections, and refugee resettling  not an
IFOR mission.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The military aspect  the mission of IFOR  is to create a  stable environment
for the civil aspects to proceed. IFOR, including  U.S. forces, will:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     Protect the force by ensuring self-defense and freedom of
 movement for IFOR
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce required withdrawal of forces to respective territories
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Establish a man a zone of separation
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     Enforce the cessation of hostilities
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-      Provide a secure environment which permits conduct of  civil peace
implementation functions.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>NATO and U.S. forces will enforce a peace, not fight a war.  Robust NATO
rules of engagement reflect the philosophy of  sending in a heavy force,
authorized to use deadly force for self  defense, force protection, and to
enforce compliance with the peace plan.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 14 --> 
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>In contrast to the U.N. mission, there is no dual key in  NATO's rules of
engagement. Field commanders will have authority to  defend troops under their
command and to ensure compliance  with the military aspects of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFORs first task will be to oversee the withdrawal of  Federation and

this is done, IFOR will monitor and patrol a  four-kilometer (2.5 mile) wide

<P>Beginning when the peace agreement is signed in Paris on  December 14, the
parties to the agreement  the Bosnian Federation  and the Bosnian Serbs  have
specific time frames by which they  must meet specific obligations, as follows:
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>-     DAY 1 Begin withdrawing forces, removing mines from Zones

</P>
<P>-     DAY 30 Foreign troops (mercenaries, etc.) out of Bosnia.  Military
forces complete withdrawal behind cease fire lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 45 Complete withdrawal behind inter-entity boundary lines
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>-     DAY 120 Complete withdrawal of all heavy weapons and  forces to
cantonment/barracks areas

</P>
<P><B>What IFOR Will Not Do</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not patrol Bosnia's external borders.
According to  the peace settlement, supervision of Bosnia's external borders
will  be done by other organizations, most likely the International  Commission
on the Former Yugoslavia (ICFY), which currently  performs this function.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>     IFOR will not act as a police force. That function will be the
 responsibility of the civilian side of the peace implementation  operation.
IFOR personnel will have the authority to detain any  persons who interfere with
the IFOR mission or those individuals who  may be indicted for war crimes, but
they will not try to track  them down.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>*</B>      IFOR will not be involved in reconstruction, humanitarian 
relief, political reform, or human rights efforts. Other civilian  agencies and
organizations will be responsible for those tasks. IFOR  also will not be
involved in arming and training Bosnian  Federation forces, if that becomes
necessary to achieve equilibrium  with Bosnian Serb forces.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
</P>
<P><B>When IFOR Will Leave</B>
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>IFOR will deploy long enough to give the civil aspects an  opportunity to
take hold and start making an impact on the lives of  the people of Bosnia. With
high confidence, we believe the  military mission can be completed in
approximately twelve months  from 
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 16 -->  the start of deployment. (If
there were to be a complete  breakdown of the settlement, the President does
have the authority to  withdraw U.S. forces from Bosnia.)
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>The civil aspects will continue for many years. However, at  the time of
IFOR's withdrawal, conditions in Bosnia will be  substantially different and
more stable than they are today. The forces  will have been separated, the
territories will have been transferred,  and the cycle of violence will have
been broken. We expect the  newly-elected government to take root and economic
reconstruction to  be under way.

<h3>UNITED NATIONS DAY:  NO CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION</h3>
By Brett Schaefer<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 24, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	
	On Oct. 24, we all were expected to bear witness to the great achievements of the United Nations. The organization and its supporters scrambled to hide its misdeeds and dust off its few accomplishments. But they failed to conceal the truth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United Nations, despite the claims of reform by Secretary General Boutros-Boutros Ghali and the Clinton administration, remains rife with abuse, waste, fraud and ineffectiveness. Topping the list is wasteful spending on both materials and personnel. In a 1995 article, <i>Money</i> magazine revealed that U.N. employees commonly earn more than twice the pay of comparable positions in New York-based private-sector jobs. In addition to their salaries, the roughly 10,000 U.N. bureaucrats in New York receive an array of special perks including rent allowances and education grants for their children. To top it off, it's all tax free. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These lucrative positions are, for the most part, not even being filled with competent individuals. Vested interests regard U.N. jobs as opportunities for nepotism and high pay for little work. U.N. employees are not held to any realistic standards of employee evaluation. The U.N. bureaucracy is populated by individuals who fail to meet the basic requirements of an effective civil service. The evaluation system is so abysmal that the U.N. leadership has tried to reform it at least five times. Yet the current system, under which 90 percent of U.N. employees received "excellent" ratings in the recent past, continues with only cosmetic changes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Of course, such employees aren't anxious to have their work habits exposed. In 1995 the United Nations bought a $1 million turnstile security system for its New York headquarters, but never used it. The reason: The turnstile clocks would have recorded the arrival and departure times of U.N. employees. Heaven forbid: They would have had to work an entire day.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Unfortunately, the full range of problems remains hidden because, until 1995, the world body refused to establish an inspector general's office to root out waste, corruption and inefficiency. When it finally did appoint an inspector general, it did so reluctantly, under threat from the U.S. Congress to withhold funding. Moreover, U.N. officials weakened the office by having the inspector general serve under the authority of the secretary general and by failing to grant the office an independent budget.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This incredible commitment to waste and inefficiency has spurred the United States -- which provides 25 percent of U.N. funding -- to periodically withhold some of its dues. This has resulted in arrears of approximately $1.2 billion. Congress has refused to pay these arrears until the United Nations pledges to undertake reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The United States has chosen the proper course. The world body is in a perpetual state of financial crisis and is cash strapped. Withholding funding is the most effective way to get the U.N. bureaucracy's attention and encourage reform. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The first step toward reform must be an independent audit. The problems can't be fixed until we know in detail what they are. This can best be accomplished by an independent inspector general with a competent staff and budget immune to U.N. pressure. The U.N. system has resisted past reform efforts and will not refrain from using budget blackmail to manipulate the inspector general's office. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	It is also imperative that the inspector general have complete access to all U.N. and related agency records. A primary goal of this audit should be  not only to identify corruption, waste, fraud and abuse, but also to identify which of the United Nation's 70-plus programs are worth continuing, which should be eliminated, and which should be transferred to other organizations that can perform them better.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only when such an audit is completed and management and organizational reforms have been implemented should U.S. back dues be paid. For the United States to pay in full before reform is implemented would be like giving a child his allowance before he completes his chores. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Only after an independent audit has been performed and U.N. operations reformed  can Americans sincerely say "Happy United Nations Day."

<title>Drunk on Power - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>DRUNK ON POWER</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/thierer.htm">Adam D. Thierer</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	With the fall elections just weeks away, there's one issue far more important to many Americans than presidential debates, congressional mudslinging or the latest Gallup poll. It's beer.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Specifically, the beer tax. This may come as a shock, but every time one of America's 75 million beer drinkers picks up a six-pack of his favorite brew, 43 percent of the cost comes directly from taxes, according to a study by the economic consulting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill. To put this in perspective, a $5 six-pack actually costs only $2.85 -- until you factor in the tax.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The proper response of the American people to this punitive level of taxation should be clear: revolt. At least that's what another group of Americans did when the federal government levied an excessive tax on their liquor. It was the Summer of 1794. To protest an excise tax placed on their whiskey three years earlier, angry citizens in the Northeastern states rose up against their federal overlords, tarring and feathering government officials and burning down their homes. Before you try this at home, a word of caution: The feds had a pretty strong opinion about the "Whiskey Rebellion" protesters. They shot them.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Alas, it's not likely that we'll see today's overtaxed beer drinkers take to the streets. The reason: Beer drinkers have at best a dim understanding that they're even being taxed. The sales and excise taxes that apply to beer are largely "hidden." Consumers see only the final sales price of beer that rings up on the cash register, never realizing that their $15 case costs only $8.50 before taxes. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But just because beer taxes are hidden doesn't mean their effect isn't real, both on beer drinkers' wallets and on the economy. Consider: Since 1990, when beer taxes were boosted as part of a larger tax package, the beer industry has lost 60,000 jobs, according to The Beer Institute. When American brewers pay seven times more in taxes than they earn in profits, it's difficult to retain their workers. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To add insult to injury, the other taxes that were part of the 1990 package -- notably on yachts, private planes, jewelry and furs -- have all been repealed. This is great for people with disposable incomes of around, say, a million dollars, but it does nothing for the little guy who pays the beer tax (nearly two-thirds of all the beer sold in America each year is bought by households earning less than $45,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Fortunately, relief may be at hand. Rep. Phil English, R-Pa., has introduced legislation that would cut the beer tax in half -- back to its pre-1990 level. "Because they are concealed," English says, "these taxes engender little opposition from the taxpayers. But they contribute tangibly to the cost of living for hard-working Americans." No kidding. If you buy just one $5 six-pack a week, by the end of the year you've forked over $112 in taxes to the government. That's more than a full day's work for the average wage earner.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, English's proposal is sure to meet with opposition from those who think cutting the beer tax will lead to increased alcohol consumption. These folks -- let's call them liberals -- view the tax code as a powerful tool for bending human behavior to fit their preferences. And at the moment, beer drinking is one activity definitely frowned upon by the wine-and-cheese crowd.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The ironies are delicious. Not only do liberals, the traditional advocates of "progressive" taxation, wind up supporting a tax that falls disproportionately on lower- and middle-income Americans, but these self-styled champions of "the worker" also ignore the fact that the beer tax hurts an industry that employs 2.6 million people -- everything from assembly-line workers in bottling plants to delivery-truck drivers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it, the beer tax is a raw deal. But don't expect change anytime soon. Maybe it's their nature, but too many lawmakers are addicted to controlling people's lives through levies like the beer tax. In short, they're drunk on power.
<p>

<title>What Would George Washington Say? -- Heritage Commentary</title><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3>WHAT WOULD GEORGE WASHINGTON SAY?</h3>
By Matthew Spalding<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 12, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Imagine picking up your morning newspaper and reading the headline: "President To Resign; Issues Solemn Warnings To Nation." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	This startling news greeted readers of Philadelphia's largest newspaper on the morning of Sept. 19, 1796, when George Washington unexpectedly announced his retirement from the presidency of the United States. The nation would have been happy to see him continue.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	But our first president wanted to set an example for his successors, and as he left public life he offered the nation a document that is one of the greatest in American history. On its 200th anniversary, Washington's Farewell Address -- although remembered primarily for its advice on foreign affairs -- gives us much insight into how he might view America in the 1990s. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In it, Washington warned us of the dangers of Big Government. He told us to watch out for the tendency of government to encroach on individual freedoms and consolidate its power. What American can say this warning has not been justified by subsequent events? "A just estimate of that love of power, and proneness to abuse it, which predominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the truth of this position," Washington said. We could add: Any doubt that might be left can be put to rest by assessing the size and reach of the U.S. government in 1996. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Our only defense against an over-reaching, tyrannical government, Washington insisted, is the Constitution's strict limits on government power. Washington said that unless these limits were carefully adhered to -- that is, unless the federal government exercised only those functions specifically delegated to it by the Constitution and by the authority of the people, and no more -- the nation would become vulnerable to "cunning, ambitious and unprincipled men."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Could Americans' distrust of their elected representatives, their sense that government has overextended its proper authority, and that average citizens no longer have enough say in matters that affect them, be the result of disregarding Washington's warning? 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Washington warned of "the baneful effects of the Spirit of Party" and the notorious problem of faction. By this he didn't mean what me mean by "parties," but instead what we call "special-interest groups" pushing their own single-issue agendas at the expense of wider, more serious concerns having to do with the common good. He called partisan spirit "a fire not to be quenched; it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest instead of warming it should consume."  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	How many times in recent decades have Americans watched in despair as partisanship overshadowed principle in the nation's capital; as one special interest in Congress prevented another from passing a good law? Washington believed fundamental change in a free government comes about not through clever strategies, "hot button" issues or attack ads but by honest deliberation, patient persuasion, and a willingness to put principle above self-interest.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In his Farewell Address, Washington also told Americans that while their Constitution creates a framework for good government, it could only work if the people govern themselves rightly. In the absence of governmental restraints, the people would have to restrain their own passions and prejudices. Washington meant to encourage religion and morality as "indispensable supports" for political prosperity. He cautioned Americans never to expect virtue from their elected representatives if they were not moral, virtuous people themselves.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Two centuries later social scientists are just discovering what Washington always knew: that religious belief and moral education are the surest social inoculation against crime, drug abuse,  illegitimacy and practically every other social ill one can name. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	By ignoring much of Washington's advice, America has moved far down the path he said had "hitherto marked the Destiny of Nations." Today our government is virtually unlimited and out of control; politics is dominated by base factionalism and personal invective; our culture is adrift from the breakup of community and the family; we increasingly question our national purpose and role in the world.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Amidst these seemingly intractable problems, Americans would do well to look to the father of their country -- and the Farewell Address -- for guidance. His "counsels of an old and affectionate friend," as he called them, are as true in 1996 as they were in 1796.

<title>Don't Brake For Big Government - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h3>DON'T BRAKE FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Tyce Palmaffy<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	Americans have always looked on the Labor Day weekend as one last fling with summer. For most drivers, that once meant a lot of high-anxiety mileage, as they worried about keeping up with traffic while avoiding ticket-happy state troopers.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But no longer. Last year Congress repealed  the National Maximum Speed Limit of 55 mph (65 mph on rural interstates and freeways designed for high speeds).  Now states can set their own speed limits based on local driving conditions. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For more than 20 years, the Democratic leadership in Congress blocked all efforts to overturn this anachronism. In 1995, though, the tide changed. With their robust commitment to limited government, conservative House and Senate freshmen strongly pushed for a repeal -- and were finally successful when President Clinton reluctantly signed their bold legislation.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Since the repeal, more than 20 states have raised their limits, including seven within a week of the repeal's effective date. Four of those states -- Oklahoma, Wyoming, Nevada and Arizona -- posted a top speed of 75 mph, while Montana eliminated its daytime speed limit for passenger vehicles, reverting to its pre-1974 law requiring drivers to maintain a "reasonable and prudent speed."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The results? Highway patrolmen and state traffic engineers in Montana and in every other state I spoke with -- 11 in all -- report that average speeds have only increased one to two mph. Fatalities have actually decreased in some states. So much for safety advocates' apocalyptic predictions. 	Patrolmen and traffic engineers -- whose reputations depend on drivers' safety --resoundingly supported the repeal because it permits states to set more reasonable speed limits. According to engineers, the proper method of determining limits is to measure the speed of traffic under ideal conditions. The posted speed limit should be the speed that 85 percent of traffic is traveling. In effect, drivers set the speed limit.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On many highways, the federally mandated 55 and 65 mph speed limits were unreasonably low -- often five or 10, and sometimes 15 mph below this driver-imposed maximum. The feds, of course, set the low limits in the name of safety. Yet, when people drive at the 85th percentile speed, they "are least likely to be in motor vehicle crashes," according to engineer Tom Hicks of the Maryland State Highway Administration. "It's the people who drive much slower or faster who are most at risk."	Unreasonably low speed limits exacerbate the risk posed by these slower and faster drivers. Alan Soltani, the chief traffic engineer at the Oklahoma Department of Transportation, says when the driver-set maximum was 75 and the speed limit was set at 55, "drivers weren't comfortable -- some drove 55, some 65, some 75. There was so much variance that accidents increased." When the limit is raised to its proper level, the evidence shows, these dangerous variances in speed start to disappear. 	
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Efforts to enforce unreasonably low speed limits also undermine police effectiveness. In 1978, Congress started requiring the states to certify drivers' compliance with the 55 mph limit or face cuts in their federal highway funds. So highway patrolmen were told to enforce a law that the majority of motorists were breaking -- a law that threatened rather than improved safety. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Indeed, in a 1984 study of the effects of the 55 mph speed limit, the National Research Council found that 29 percent of highway patrol hours were devoted to rural interstates, where only 9 percent of traffic fatalities occurred. This means more dangerous roads -- such as undivided country highways, high-speed two-lane roads and highways running through congested commercial areas -- received less attention. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	By requiring states to prove they were enforcing the 55 mph speed limit, the federal legislation effectively reduced patrol presence on non-interstates while increasing the traffic on these roadways. This substantially endangered safety.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"People move off and onto interstates depending on the speed," says Bill Jackman, a representative of the American Automobile Association. "If the speed limit is only 55 or 65, they will move onto a country road that will get them there just as fast. The problem there is that the fatality rate is three times higher when you get off the interstates. Interstates are the safest highways we have." With repeal of the federal limit, states can post more realistic limits that will attract drivers to the safer interstates.	The repeal of the national speed limit may even signal new attitudes in Washington. Restoring the states' authority on this issue means trusting them to form safe and responsible policies. And if we can trust the states in this area, why not others?

<h3>LABOR PAINS</h3>

	This Labor Day the country will kick back, fire up the barbecue, and take a moment to celebrate the accomplishments of America's working men and women. But will those workers themselves have anything to celebrate?

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The answer is, sadly, not much. Despite a seemingly rosy employment picture -- more than 11 million new jobs since 1991 and an unemployment rate down to 5.4 percent -- the real outlook for U.S. workers remains rather grim. Scratch below the surface of these numbers, and the much-discussed economic anxiety felt by America's workers becomes perfectly understandable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For starters, job layoffs are continuing at a blistering pace. In the first six months of 1996, 271,000 Americans lost their jobs, the second-highest number this decade. Layoffs were 28 percent higher than during the first six months of 1995, and 6 percent higher than in 1993, the largest "downsizing" year of the decade.  So far this year, thousands of jobs have vanished in important industries such as telecommunications (43,000), computers (22,000), and automobiles (18,000). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What's more, even those workers able to find new jobs are taking it on the chin: Weekly earnings in their new positions are averaging 8.2 percent less than in their old jobs. For workers aged 45 to 55 -- those with home mortgages and kids in college to support -- the pay cuts are averaging an even higher 14 percent. And to add insult to injury, nearly one of every five displaced workers lands in a new job that doesn't even offer health-insurance coverage.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even these folks are better off than the large number of workers who can't find new jobs at all. The fact is, the long-term unemployment rate -- which measures the number of jobless Americans out of work for six months or more -- remains at a stubbornly high 18.5 percent. Compare this with the average of 10.3 percent during the three previous U.S. economic expansions.  Even out-of-work white-collar managers and other professionals have been having a rough time; nearly one in five is still unemployed after six months of searching.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What about those workers lucky enough to hold onto their jobs? Here, too, the news is less than upbeat. Adjusted for inflation, full-time workers' paychecks haven't increased for five years. For men, real weekly earnings have actually dropped by 5.1 percent, and for black and Hispanic men the drop has been even worse, 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent respectively.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The decline in weekly earnings can be partly explained by the disappearance of high-paying manufacturing jobs. Since March of 1995, the economy has shed more than 280,000 such jobs. In fact, fewer manufacturing jobs exist today than when the economic recovery began five years ago. In addition, the number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related jobs has dropped by 478,000 since 1992, the number working in administrative support and clerical positions has fallen by 298,000, and the number working in precision production, craft and repair occupations has declined by 13,000 (and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14 million reached in March of 1990). 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	What all this adds up to, predictably, is anxiety on the part of the American worker. Nearly 50 percent of Americans believe jobs are not very plentiful, according to the Conference Board's most recent survey of consumer confidence, and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse, according to a recent CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Let's face it: For many American workers President Clinton's declaration that the economy is "the healthiest it has been in 30 years" rings hollow. They seem to understand instinctively what many economists have been saying -- that the Clinton economy's growth rate of slightly more than 2 percent a year is not sufficient to produce a large number of good, stable, high-paying jobs.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The fact is, the economy can grow much faster than it has these past four years. We experienced growth rates of 3.5 percent for most of the 1980s, and the economy produced 19 million new jobs. But that was during a period of lower taxation and fewer regulations on business.  In the current era of high taxes and heavy regulation, 2 percent growth and sluggish job creation may be the best we can hope for.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And that's nothing to celebrate.

<title> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3> Women Don't Need Affirmative Action </h3>

By Sally C. Pipes and Michael Lynch<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
July 25, 1996
<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;


	A well-financed, pro-affirmative action propaganda campaign is underway to defeat the California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI), an amendment to California's constitution that would prohibit the state from granting preference -- or discriminating -- on the basis of race, ethnicity, religion or sex. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Much of this pro-affirmative action, anti-CCRI campaign is focused on women.  The obvious reason: Women are a bigger voting bloc than minorities, the usual target of such campaigns. If most women can be convinced that race- and sex-based preferences are fair, that could decide the battle. And this is a battle whose outcome could easily affect the lives of both men and women across the nation.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's why it is important to understand why women should reject race- and sex-based "affirmative action." There are at least four reasons.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	First, like men, women believe in equality before the law. They believe racial, ethnic and gender preferences violate the proposition that all men and women are created equal. Women know their advances in the workplace and voting booth have come not by departing from this creed, but by upholding it -- by showing that America wasn't living up to its own principles of equality. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Second, women are mothers, wives, daughters and sisters. No one is better placed than a woman to see the double-edged nature of racial and gender preferences. It is clear to a mother that an institutional preference for her daughter is institutional discrimination against her son. Susan Constantine, a mother of three boys, made precisely this point in a letter to the San Francisco Chronicle. "I find affirmative action and the like racist and sexist ... Just as I am opposed to racism and sexism, I am opposed to this form of unequal opportunity toward our sons."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Third, women themselves often are treated unfairly under affirmative action plans. Consider the case of Lydia Cheryl McDonald. A Los Angeles resident, McDonald grew up in a broken home and lived on welfare after her father abandoned her family. Yet she accumulated a grade-point average in high school of 4.5 -- on a four point scale -- due to credit for advanced placement classes. In addition to working 15 hours a week, McDonald wracked up an impressive list of achievements and awards, including high honors on California's prestigious Golden State Exam for geometry. She is exactly the kind of candidate the University of California at Berkeley claims to be looking for: high-achieving, well rounded, but poor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In March 1996, McDonald received a rejection letter informing her that "we sought an academically strong freshman class which includes students from a wide range of cultural, ethnic, geographic, racial and socio-economic backgrounds." In other words, "diversity" was more important than excellence. Had it not been for the intervention of a lawyer so outraged by McDonald's case that he offered his services pro bono and threatened the University with a lawsuit, Lydia would not be looking forward to spring admission.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, women know that their most significant advances in the workplace have not resulted from affirmative action, but from equality of opportunity and hard work.  A modern political mantra has it that white women have been the greatest beneficiaries of quota-based affirmative action. But academic analysis finds little conclusive evidence that women, on the whole, have benefited from such preferences.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Women have made progress in all segments of the work force in the last 30 years. As Anita K. Blair, executive vice president of the Independent Women's Forum recently pointed out, the most important reason is that women went to college. In 1960, only 19 percent of bachelor's degrees went to women. By 1995, women claimed 55 percent of B.A.s. During the same period, women increased their share of lucrative professional degrees -- M.B.A.s, M.D.s and J.D.s -- by more than 500 percent. The increase in college enrollment is a result not of affirmative action, but of changing personal choices.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Today, half of all professionals are female, and women hold nearly half of all managerial and executive positions. Women are starting their own businesses in droves. In 1995, according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners, women owned nearly 8 million businesses with more than $2.25 trillion in sales.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Those fighting the California Civil Rights Initiative are saying, in essence, that  women need the government's help in order to compete. But the facts do not support this view. Women should not fall for the sophistry and hypocrisy of organized interests who actually benefit from the perpetual racial and sexual strife caused by affirmative action. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	After all, a society where equal rights are protected by the full force of the law is as beneficial to women as it is to men. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>Restoring Religious Freedom to Public Schools -- Heritage</title>

<center>
<h3> RESTORING RELIGIOUS FREEDOM TO PUBLIC SCHOOLS</h3>
By Joe Loconte<br>
Deputy editor of  <a href="/heritage/p_review">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</a> <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 20, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;





	Parades, fireworks, barbecues -- it's that time of year when Americans celebrate their bold, 220 year-old experiment in democracy and political freedom. When it comes to religious freedom, however, many people will not be in a celebratory mood.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Consider: An Illinois school district recently banned any reference to God in student presentations at a commencement program. A California high school prevented students from distributing invitations to a Bible study group. A school principal in Virginia barred a student from reading her Bible on a school bus.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
While some Americans accept such bans as enforcement of the principle of separation of church and state, others are up in arms over what they consider outright religious persecution. Due to efforts by religious conservatives, Congress may soon unveil an amendment to the U.S. Constitution to prevent educators from muzzling permissible forms of religious speech. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But Charles Haynes, an authority on religion and education issues -- and a religious conservative -- isn't sanguine about adding a postscript to the First Amendment. Although he laments a widespread failure to take religion seriously in the classroom, Haynes says a constitutional amendment isn't needed to protect religious expression. Despite some mistaken judicial rulings, he says, court interpretations of the First Amendment still permit private religious speech by students as well as classroom instruction about religion. "Let's try the Amendment we have before we add another one," he says. "We still really haven't tried to make the First Amendment work." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Making it "work" means educating parents and teachers about the forms of religious expression still permissible under state and federal court rulings. Haynes, a scholar at Vanderbilt University, and Oliver Thomas, an expert on church-state law who has taught at Georgetown University Law Center, work district by district, getting educators and community leaders of different faiths to agree on three basic rules: (1) Schools must protect the religious freedoms of students of all faiths, or of no faith; (2) parents have primary responsibility for the education of their children; and (3) public debates must always be conducted with respect.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
School districts around the nation are signing up. Called the "Three Rs Project" (for Rights, Responsibilities and Respect), the program has been introduced in all of California's 58 counties. It has been endorsed by groups as diverse as the Anti-Defamation League, the American Civil Liberties Union, the Christian Educators Association International, and the California Teachers Association. And a growing number of states -- including Georgia, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, New York, Texas and Utah -- are moving ahead with the initiative.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, if the program can work in California, it can work anywhere. The student bodies in some California districts speak 90 different languages -- and almost as many ways to talk about faith in the classroom.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Haynes and Thomas have met with school officials and community leaders throughout the state. Their <I>modus operandi</I>: Encourage local school boards to approve the Three Rs Project, organize teams of parents and educators to attend seminars on the First Amendment, send teachers to curriculum workshops, and build community support. If  this sounds like an old-fashioned civics lesson, it is -- and it seems to be working.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In the Snowline School District in Southern California a few years ago, the stage was set for a church-state debacle: A teacher prevented a third-grade student from writing a report on Jonah and the whale; officials hesitated when a school board member donated books espousing creationism to the school library; a parent objected when a high-school student group wanted to start every meeting with prayer.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
But the community, trained in the Three Rs program, was ready. The district peacefully reached agreements on each flash point: The Jonah report was approved, books on creationism now sit on library shelves, and the student group agreed to begin meetings with a moment of silence, not prayer. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It's very clear that the student expression of religious values is almost never inhibited by the First Amendment," says Jan Vondra, assistant superintendent of curricula and education services at Snowline. Rather, it is the government's -- and hence, the public schools' -- religious speech that is restricted. "As long as their expressions are not disruptive, student freedoms are very, very broad," Vondra says.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Now there's a lesson in liberty: that neither pluralism nor separation of church and state need hush freedom of speech -- even religious speech -- in our public schools. <p>

<title>The Recovery of American Citizenship -- Heritage</title>

<h3> THE RECOVERY OF AMERICAN CITIZENSHIP </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/meyerson.htm">Adam Meyerson</a><br>
Editor of <a href="/heritage/p_review">Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</a> <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 20, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	When America's founding fathers talked about "citizenship," they meant people -- not political elites -- taking responsibility for themselves, their families, their communities. This Fourth of July, Americans should think about joining a movement that would restore the founders' vision of how Americans solve their problems.  
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
I'm talking about the "citizenship" movement, which aims to rein in Washington so the energy and effectiveness of state and local government and private alternatives to government can be explored to the fullest. One of America's core objectives during the next 20 years should be to recover this tradition of American citizenship. We must restore the link between freedom and personal responsibility, the two great themes of modern conservatism, and an increasingly attractive idea to liberals beginning to see the futility of government solutions. Our hope is that we can overcome much of the divisiveness and incivility that has characterized political discourse over the past several decades.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans come from all races, all nationalities, all religions. We are united in citizenship not by common ancestry but by a common commitment to the principles of the United States: the rule of law, the decentralized government promised by our Constitution, the rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Americans are united, too, by the common duties of citizenship: the obligation to protect our country from foreign enemies, to take care of our own families, to participate actively in civic life, to assist our neighbors and communities when they are needy, and, in turn, not to take advantage of others' generosity when we can take care of ourselves.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This distinctively American tradition of citizenship was best described by the Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville in "Democracy in America," his classic book of 1832. Tocqueville described America as the most democratic, most egalitarian, most religious, most prosperous, most charitable country on earth -- with limited national government and active citizen involvement in local government. It was an America of strong families and entrepreneurial business leadership, an America where voluntary associations of citizens were more important -- and more powerful -- than politicians in addressing the problems of their own communities. 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
This is not to say Tocqueville's America wasn't marred by some terrible evils -- most notably the scourge of slavery. But there also were many things of which Thomas Jefferson and James Madison could be proud. It was a republic of self-governing citizens, which is what the founding fathers envisioned when they declared independence from England and wrote our Constitution.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
To revive the founders' dream, it is essential to reduce the size and scope of the national government. But just as liberals must learn to accept this fact, conservatives must understand that merely tearing down the Washington establishment will not be sufficient. It is also essential to strengthen the families, voluntary associations, churches and other religious organizations, local governments and other institutions of civil society that will remedy the ills left untreated by failed federal-government programs.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Revivals of private initiative have happened before. The second half of the 19th  and the early 20th century saw the creation of the Red Cross, the Boy Scouts, YMCAs and YWCAs, and countless other voluntary organizations that strengthened character and addressed the failings of their communities. A similar wave of social entrepreneurship will sweep America in the next generation. 	
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The recovery of American citizenship is the most important unifying principle for Americans in the post-Cold War era. It appeals to libertarians with their emphasis on a free society of voluntary, non-governmental institutions. It appeals to those with religious values who emphasize faith and family and responsibility for the needy. It appeals to growth-and-opportunity conservatives who emphasize economic freedom. With its attention to the common obligations of citizenship, this idea appeals to nationalists who want to restore a strong sense of American cultural identity. And it appeals to liberals and their love for community activism.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"Without local institutions," wrote Tocqueville 160 years ago, "a nation may give itself a free government, but it does not have the spirit of liberty." It is time for all Americans to help rebuild the local institutions that will bring back our spirit of liberty.<p>

<title>Really Stand for Children: Fix Welfare -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">

<h3>
REALLY STAND FOR CHILDREN: FIX WELFARE</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a><br>
Senior Analyst for Welfare and Family Issues <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Recently, the nation's capitol was the  scene of  the "Stand for Children" rally organized by the liberal Children's Defense Fund. The rally's proclaimed goal was to call attention to the plight of the nation's children; its unstated goal was to defend the continuing growth of the welfare system and to criticize those in Congress who have sought reform. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While the rally was correct to call attention to the plight of many of  America's children, the irony is that children are suffering because of the governmental policies supported by the rally's organizers. Children are suffering because the liberal welfare state has carpet-bombed the moral foundations of  the inner city, toppling marriage, gutting the work ethic, and leaving a rubble of social pathology in its wake.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The failure of the War on Poverty stems from its flawed premise: a core belief  that "material poverty" is critically harmful to children. According to this view, welfare, by reducing material poverty, can  increase children's well-being and lifetime attainment.  Similarly, since poverty "causes" such problems as crime, school failure, low cognitive ability, illegitimacy, an eroded work ethic, and drug use -- greater welfare spending can readily reduce poverty and most social problems at the same time. From this simplistic logic has sprung a relentless 30-year effort to raise welfare benefits, expand welfare eligibility, create new welfare programs, and increase welfare spending. The "Stand for Children" rally repeated this tired theme.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But history refutes this naive belief in welfare. In 1950, nearly a third of the U.S. population was poor (twice the current rate). In the 1920s, roughly half of the population was poor by today's standard. If it were true that "material poverty" causes social problems, we should have had far more social problems in those earlier periods than we do today. On the contrary: Crime, family breakup and most other social problems were nowhere near the levels they are today.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	History and common sense both show that values and abilities within families -- not family income -- are what determine children's achievement. Successful families tend to have sound values concerning self-control, deferred gratification, work, education and marriage, which they pass on to their children. Attempting to raise family income artificially through welfare does little to benefit a child, but does a lot to destroy the very values that are key to a child's success.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The point many liberals refuse to recognize is that welfare has behavioral side effects. It engenders dependence and illegitimacy, both highly injurious to children's development. For example, among the nearly 5 million families currently receiving AFDC benefits, the total time spent on welfare will average nearly 13 years. A 1994 report by June O'Neill, currently Congressional Budget Office director, shows that increasing the length of time a child spends on welfare may reduce the child's IQ by as much as 20 percent. O'Neill makes clear that welfare dependence, rather than poverty, is what truly hurts children. <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
          	By paying women more money when they have children out of wedlock, welfare also plays a powerful role in promoting illegitimacy, a fact acknowledged by President Clinton but ignored by the "Stand for Children" organizers. Being born outside of marriage and raised in a single-parent home triples the level of behavioral and emotional problems among children; nearly triples the level of teen sexual activity; doubles the probability a young woman will have children out of wedlock; and doubles the probability a boy will engage in criminal activity and wind up in jail. 	
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We can't help America's children by continuing past mistaken policies. The current welfare system must be replaced; the automatic and rapid growth of welfare spending must be curtailed. In the future, welfare no longer should be a one-way hand out; adult recipients should be required to work for the benefits they receive. And steps must be taken to reduce future illegitimacy, beginning with restricting cash welfare to unmarried teen moms. 
 <p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	We must begin to focus on institutions with a record of success, not failure.  Religious institutions have been dramatically successful in reducing teen sexual activity, crime, drug use, and other problems among young people. One way to give the poor access to this fountain of hope would be to give poor parents education vouchers they could  freely use to send their children to private schools, including religious schools. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But Americans should remember that well-meaning, big-government liberals who call welfare reformers "anti-child" are the unwitting advocates of precisely what is hurting America's children: welfare.<p>

<h3>
JERRY-RIGGED FOREIGN POLICY</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a><br>
Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and Defense Studies <br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
June 6, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
.

	The Clinton administration is about to make the same mistake in Bosnia it made in Somalia, where 18 U.S. Marines died unnecessarily. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The White House recently announced it would expand the role of the U.S.-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia to include scouring the countryside for war criminals. This is something the administration specifically promised not to do, a role that was purposefully left out of the Dayton Peace Accords because of its divisiveness and its potential for indefinitely expanding the Bosnia mission and producing casualties.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why is the administration taking this step? It wants to apprehend Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and his military chief Ratko Mladic, both still exercising control over Serb-held territory. And no wonder: If these two are not apprehended, it will be difficult for the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe to sanction elections scheduled for September, as called for in the peace accords. 	
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Without elections, no stable government will be established in Bosnia. With no government, withdrawing U.S. troops, as President Clinton promised, may not happen. In other words, the house of cards the president set up in Bosnia could come crashing down. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, if by November election time it doesn't look like U.S. troops will come home soon, the president's Bosnia policy will be revealed for what it is: a jerry-rigged, politically tuned deal that puts U.S. forces at the mercy of events that can spin out of control at any time. To avoid this perception, the White House apparently is willing to risk substantial U.S. casualties -- both Karadzic and Mladic travel with 50 to 60 heavily armed escorts. But if Americans die, a la Somalia, the backlash could be even worse. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The whole mess is typical of the foreign policy ineptitude shown by this administration from the beginning. The Clinton team, influenced by its opposition to the Vietnam War, came into office confused about which situations warrant U.S. military intervention, and which do not. It became clear that the president believed  multinational peacekeeping was the wave of the future for U.S. foreign policy. The administration appeared more comfortable with the idea of "foreign policy as social work." This global utopianism led the president to commit America to dubious peacekeeping efforts in Somalia, Haiti and Bosnia, with sometimes tragic, never satisfactory results. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans realize how many gross errors and misjudgments have been made in foreign policy. Consider:<ul>
	<li>The White House has wasted precious years during which America could have erected global anti-missile defenses. For less than $3 billion it could have upgraded the Navy's Aegis fleet air-defense system as many experts have proposed, spending another $5 billion later on space-based sensors. Instead, the administration has done nothing in the face of CIA estimates that at least 20 countries already have or may be developing weapons of mass destruction and the ballistic missile systems to deliver them.	
	<p><li>The Clinton Pentagon determined that America needed to be able to fight two regional conflicts "nearly simultaneously." Yet the president has neglected to provide the funding needed to sustain this capability. 
	<p><li>The administration has zig-zagged on China policy, at times threatening, at other times appeasing, sending confused signals throughout Asia that have undermined U.S. credibility in the region and heightened tensions between China and Taiwan. 
	<p><li>The administration secretly tried to make a deal with Fidel Castro whereby Cuban boat people would be sent back forcibly to Cuba instead of being allowed into the United States. This betrayal of the Cuban people -- overturning 30 years of principled U.S. policy -- was only abandoned after Cuba shot down two U.S. civilian aircraft.   
	<p><li>The White House has organized a multi-billion-dollar deal that will give North Korea two nuclear reactors -- and still we don't know for sure whether Pyongyang has discontinued its budding nuclear-weapons program. 
	<p><li>In Haiti, America spent $2 billion to put in office an avowed Marxist  known for his hostility to the United States, all in the name of "restoring democracy." Whatever it is, the regime now in place is no democracy. 
<p>	<li>Finally, with no U.S. interests at stake, the White House sent U.S. forces to Bosnia, when it could have simply lifted the arms embargo on the Bosnian Muslims and allowed them to defend themselves. Now, worried that failure in Bosnia could threaten its standing in the polls, the White House is playing with the possibility of expanding and lengthening the mission, thus unnecessarily placing U.S. forces in even greater danger.</ul><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; 	This is no way to conduct foreign policy.<p>

HOW TO AVOID THE NEXT BUDGET CRISIS</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
Vice President for Government Relations<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	For months now, Congress has been in retreat after being blamed for two partial government shutdowns, the result of its battle with President Clinton over the fiscal 1996 federal budget. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Lawmakers are now scurrying to accommodate the president's spending priorities to avoid an election-year bruising over the 1997 budget, even as they try to preserve enough of their own agenda to save face. But no matter how hard they try, they are going to find themselves in yet another battle royal.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why?  Is America doomed to suffer government shutdowns year after year, depending only on how vociferously Congress and the White House disagree on budget priorities, tax and spending policy?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not at all. As it turns out, there is a perfectly good reason why Congress and the president seem perpetually at loggerheads over the budget: Because the law is written in a way that makes this inevitable.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Under the 1974 Budget Act, a Watergate-era attempt by Congress to limit the power of the executive branch, the president is excluded from the budget process until it's almost over -- a recipe for the kind of 11th-hour budget showdowns that grabbed the headlines for so many months.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Here's how it works. Each January the president sends a budget to Capitol Hill, which Congress promptly ignores. In the spring, Congress adopts its own budget resolution based on its own priorities. During the summer, Congress crafts the 13 detailed spending bills needed to meet the budget targets outlined in the resolution, as well as a reconciliation bill making changes in tax and entitlement policy. Finally, in the fall, usually just before the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year, Congress sends the budget bills to the president, who now has only one way to try to restore his spending priorities: veto the bills and force an end-of-the-year budget fight. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The result: With insufficient time to negotiate the details, the government shuts down over a dispute about whether or not Medicare premiums should rise by $6 a month.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	To make matters worse, the Budget Act also forces spending to go up even if Congress doesn't want it to. When members of Congress sit down to figure out how much to spend on a program in the coming fiscal year, the Budget Act mandates that they take last year's spending level and automatically add in the cost of population growth, anticipated inflation and other factors. This becomes the new "baseline" for spending, which means that even if Congress does not vote to increase the budget for a program, spending increases will happen anyway.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Any member of Congress who proposes to increase spending on a program by less than the baseline projection is accused of "cutting" the program. That's how Congress' plan to boost spending on Medicare by $100 billion over seven years became a "cut."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A reform plan proposed by Rep. Christopher Cox, R-Calif., would fix the problems created by the Budget Act of 1974. For starters, the budget resolution adopted by Congress in the spring would be a legally binding law, signed by the president, and would set a limit on how much the government can spend in the coming fiscal year. In addition, the resolution would have to pass by an early date, April 15, in Cox's plan.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As a result, Congress and the president would know more than five months before the start of the new fiscal year exactly how much money they have to work with.  This would give the two sides a strong incentive to get the big, controversial budget issues (like tax cuts and entitlement reform) out of the way first, greatly lessening the chance of a last-minute deadlock forcing a government shutdown.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The Cox plan also would purge the budget process of the pro-spending bias created by "baseline budgeting." Year-to-year spending totals would be compared in real dollars, not in the inflated dollars of the baseline. No longer would advocates of higher spending be able to call a spending increase a "cut." Spending hikes would be out in the open, rather than buried in the dark recesses of the budget process.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The United States has experienced numerous budget crises over the past decade -- in 1986, 1988, 1990, and again in 1995-96. Add to this the bias toward higher spending written into the Budget Act and it's clear the time has come for reform.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Why wait for the next budget crisis to expose (yet again) the flaws in the current system? If Congress wants to end the saga of government shutdowns and impose some real spending control, it should fix the system now.
<p>

Mason studies the problems that critics say have left Congress unresponsive to the taxpayers and beholden to special interests.  Under his direction, Heritage published The Ruling Class: Inside the Imperial Congress (1993), an assessment of pervasive institutional problems and solutions. He also directed Heritage's liaison program with the executive branch, and identified and recommended conservative candidates for key public policy positions. A former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense  and  eight-year  veteran  of  Capitol  Hill,  Mason  previously served as Staff Director to then-House Minority Whip Rep. Trent Lott, R-Miss.

<title>The March For Big Government -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h3>
THE MARCH FOR BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By Kenneth Weinstein<br>
Director of the Government Reform Project<br>
 <a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
May 23, 1996<br>
<hr width="50%"></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	On June 1, 1996, national attention will focus on the "Stand for Children" march on the Mall in Washington, D.C.  The theme of this march, ostensibly, is something that all Americans can support: "a day ... to celebrate children and those who struggle every day to raise them." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Organizers of the "Stand for Children" claim between 200,000 and 1 million people will gather at the Lincoln Memorial "in a non-partisan call to action."  Unfortunately, the principal "action" likely to be called for is an increase in federal spending. The reason: More than 100 of the sponsoring organizations are direct federal grant recipients receiving more than $392 million annually. The actual figure is assuredly higher, since that total excludes grants to many affiliate organization as well as all funds received from state or local governments. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	A slick public relations campaign has generated dozens of news stories hailing the Stand's call "to affirm our responsibility as families, individuals, communities, and as a national community for improving the quality of life of children."  But an examination of organizations endorsing the event makes it clear that the Stand for Children is not a non-partisan, pro-children march. It is a stand for government dependency and ought to be dubbed "The March For Big Government."  Consider:
<ul>
	<li>The event is being convened by the Children's Defense Fund (CDF) -- an organization once chaired by Hillary Rodham Clinton. The president of the CDF, Marian Wright Edelman, is a chief opponent of  the 104th Congress' efforts to reform welfare.  In 1973, Edelman admitted that because she no longer could stir up interest in government programs by speaking of "poor people," she would emphasize children.  "Children," after all, "might be a very effective way to broaden the base of change."
<p>	<li>Lobbyists appear to be a major constituency of the Stand for Children. Lobbying groups that push for greater spending on federal programs already costing more than $7 billion annually have endorsed the march. Among these are the National and Community Service Coalition (chief lobbyist for President Clinton's $400 million national service boondoggle, AmeriCorps), the National Head Start Center (lobbyist for the $2.2 billion Head Start program), and the National Association of WIC Directors (The Special Supplement Food Program for Women, Infants, and Children, a $3.6 billion federal program in fiscal year 1995). Families USA, a key lobbying organization for Bill Clinton's failed big-government health-care plan, is also a march endorser.
<p>	<li>At least 20 national organizations representing government employees, such as the U.S. Conference of City Human Services Officials and the National Association of School Psychologists, also will be participating in the march.
<p>	<li>The AFL-CIO, which is spending $35 million in mandatory union dues to defeat conservative members of Congress this year, is actively promoting the march. Thirty-three of its affiliated unions are serving as national endorsing organizations for the Stand for Children. At this past February's meeting of the AFL-CIO Executive Committee, when union leaders decided to launch their efforts to "take back the Congress" (take it back for whom?), two guests were invited to speak: one was Marian Wright Edelman, who spoke about the Stand for Children rally. Obviously, she got what she was after.
<p>	<li>At least 50 liberal organizations with no special focus on children, including the Americans for Democratic Action, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund, Greenpeace, the National Rainbow Coalition, and Zero Population Growth, are co-sponsors of the march.
 <p>	<li>As if to remove all doubt about the government-oriented nature of this event, one federal agency has even gotten into the act directly.  The Agriculture Department's $932 million Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Service has signed on as a national endorser of the Stand For Children under the guise of its outreach program, Families 4H and Nutrition. Also, the Freddie Mac Foundation, an arm of the federally chartered Freddie Mac Corp., has signed on to the march.
</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	In short, the Stand For Children is yet another a venue for groups that live off the taxpayer to lobby for more money. It is common practice for such organizations to use sympathetic symbols -- yes, even children -- as a "cloaking device" for efforts to expand big government and the welfare state. The fact that few Americans can believe anyone would be so cynical only makes the "cloaking" that much easier. In this case, they want to present their rally as a spontaneous, non-partisan, grassroots expression of altruism towards America's youth. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, nothing could be further from the truth.

<title>How Much Is $1.6 Trillion - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>HOW MUCH IS $1.6 TRILLION?</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/mason.htm">David Mason</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	With six kids and a single income, I am probably more aware than most where my paycheck goes. One thing I know for sure is that too much goes to government.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The federal government this year -- despite the much-ballyhooed "cuts" the Washington establishment has been bemoaning -- will spend some $1.6 trillion. The House of Representatives will begin debating spending targets for fiscal year 1997 during the first week of May. Make no mistake: Overall spending will go up, not down.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even though I have worked in the nation's capital for more than a dozen years, eight of them on Capitol Hill, two at the Pentagon, and six at The Heritage Foundation, where we routinely analyze programs costing tens of billions of dollars, I don't have the faintest idea how much $1.6 trillion really is. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For most of us, even a million is incomprehensible. Have you ever tried to count to a million? Think about it: If you counted non-stop without eating or sleeping it would take approximately 23 days to count to a million. To count to a billion literally would take a lifetime: 95 years. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Counting to a trillion, assuming we get started right away and don't waste any time, would take about 2,000 centuries -- 200,000 years.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Most of us can at least imagine counting for 23 days. A period of 2,000 centuries, on the other hand, is beyond human understanding. As is a trillion dollars.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Of course, government doesn't just count money, it spends it -- and it does so at a phenomenal rate: $4.5 billion a day. Enough to support my family and quite a few others for a very long time.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A lot of the money government spends is borrowed, more than half-a-million dollars per minute, $32 million an hour, or $768 million a day. This borrowed money gets added to the national debt.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite two very costly world wars, it took from the beginning of the American Republic until 1982 -- more than 200 years -- to amass the first $1 trillion in debt. By February 1996, however, the debt exceeded $5 trillion. On April 19, when I last checked, the "national debt clock" on the Internet stood at $5,147,684,202,607.46. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	That's five trillion, 147 billion, 684 million, 202 thousand, 607 dollars and 46 cents: More than $19,450 for every man, woman and child in the United States, a whopping $155,000 for the Mason family -- enough to purchase a new house and pay a year's worth of college tuition, with money left over.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The story doesn't end here, however. Unless something drastic happens, government spending and borrowing will get worse. Under the current budget, annual government spending will increase to $2 trillion by the year 2002 -- just six years down the road. The debt also will increase: by approximately $150 billion per year.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Moreover, this spending spree is now largely on autopilot. The cost of mandatory "entitlement" programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, already the largest portion of the budget, will increase 63 percent by the year 2002, while interest payments on the national debt will increase 16 percent. The remainder of the budget, meanwhile --  for national defense, law enforcement, environmental cleanup, maintenance of U.S. ports and parks and everything else -- will grow a relatively modest 14 percent.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Unchecked, this crowding-out effect would reach its destructive conclusion in 2010 -- the year my seven-year-old reaches the age of 21 -- when entitlement spending and interest on the national debt will consume 100 percent of the federal budget.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The next time somebody says government spending needs to be brought under control you'll know why. If you forget, just start counting. I'm sure you'll remember long before you reach 5 trillion, 147 billion.

<title>The Truth About Free Trade and Protectionism - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>THE TRUTH ABOUT FREE TRADE AND PROTECTIONISM</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan T. Johnson</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There's a notion afoot that free trade is hurting the U.S. worker, that it is causing corporations to downsize and lay off their employees, and that the answer is for the U.S. government to impose economic sanctions against foreign countries like Japan. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In reality, this would be very unwise. History and economic common sense show that the "trade wars" approach to the world marketplace simply doesn't work. Consider the following myths: 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	<b>Myth #1</b>: Free trade has allowed manufacturers to go overseas to obtain cheap labor, destroying America's manufacturing infrastructure and losing American jobs. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If U.S. manufacturing companies were moving overseas in droves, manufacturing as a percentage of the total U.S. economy would have suffered a steep decline. Instead, it has maintained a constant level of about 21 percent of the total economy for three decades. And if cheap labor were the big draw people like Pat Buchanan and H. Ross Perot say it is, U.S. companies would be invested up to their eyeballs in countries like Haiti, Somalia and the Dominican Republic. Obviously they're not, or these countries wouldn't be destitute. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #2</b>: We must protect high-paying manufacturing jobs from foreign competition.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: Not if such protection costs an even greater number of jobs in other industries and causes consumer prices to rise. Consider for example, U.S. import quotas on automobiles, which caused the price of new American autos to increase by 41 percent from 1981 to 1984. The auto industry claims these price hikes saved up to 22,000 jobs. But they also reduced sales -- by about 1 million cars. This drop forced some 50,000 layoffs by the late 1980s. In other words, even though protectionism saved some 22,000 jobs, it caused a net job loss of 30,000.  Some "protection."
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #3</b>: Free trade is causing America to lose its technological edge.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: America by far is the world's leader in technological innovation and is the world's largest manufacturer of computer microprocessors, semiconductors, advanced consumer electronics, health equipment, telecommunications equipment, computers and computer software, and host of other information technologies and high-tech products. Over time, competition from other nations like Japan is making us do better, not worse.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #4</b>: U.S. trade deficits -- especially with Japan -- mean America is becoming poorer while others become richer.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: If this were true, the United States wouldn't be the economic powerhouse it is today. The real reason the United States has a trade deficit with Japan is because there are twice as many Americans as there are Japanese. In order for America to have a trade "balance" with Japan, each and every Japanese would need to buy twice as much from America as Americans buy from Japan.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Myth #5</b>: Trade deficits cost jobs.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: History shows that as the U.S. trade deficit increases, unemployment actually decreases. For example, as the U.S. trade deficit leaped in 1983-84 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate plummeted. Conversely, when the trade deficit shrank, from 1989 to 1991, unemployment began to increase. The reason some major companies lay off large numbers of workers has nothing to do with trade deficits and everything to do with burdensome regulatory policies here at home.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
<b>Myth #6</b>: U.S. companies will go under unless the government limits competition from foreign imports and forces foreign governments to purchase more U.S. goods. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	<b>Reality</b>: U.S. companies who use this scare tactic to stampede lawmakers into passing protectionist policies are trying to protect themselves from competition, both foreign and domestic. If American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter? The U.S. auto industry -- so beat up by the Japanese years ago -- is now winning. It racked up $14 billion in profits last year and is making cars that are better built, have fewer flaws and are bigger sellers than many of their Japanese and European counterparts. They have free trade to thank, not government meddling. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, while it may be tempting to blame other countries when U.S. companies downsize or lay off  workers, there is no evidence that free trade is hurting us, or that "trade wars" are the answer. Rather, it shows that free trade is the road to prosperity.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<title>How Republicans Can Win the Environmental Debate - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h3>HOW REPUBLICANS CAN WIN THE ENVIRONMENTAL DEBATE</h3>
By John Shanahan<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
April 25, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Earth Day (April 22) was painful for Republicans. Unless they develop a new strategy on the environment, they will continue getting "gored" on the issue. Not because they failed to communicate their vision, but because they don't have one.
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The Clinton administration sent its troops to the congressional districts of vulnerable Republican freshman in Congress to blast them on their environmental record. "Green" activists similarly conducted a media blitz attacking the "anti-environment" GOP.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Liberals have been successful at portraying the new Republican Congress as "planet pavers" who want to "roll back" environmental protection laws, all to satisfy polluting industrialists who contributed to the GOP's political coffers.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Republicans, meanwhile, have been waging the environmental debate almost exclusively with  regulatory "horror stories"-- tales of real Americans suffering under oppressive environmental laws.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These anecdotes work, but only to a point.  For example, most Americans would react with anger to the story of Earl Miller, my own dry cleaner in Arlington, Va., who lost his family business after 30 years because he could not afford a new (and largely unnecessary) $40,000 machine required by the Environmental Protection Agency.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Republicans have relied too heavily on such stories. As much as Americans  want the government to stop harassing people, they fear (understandably) that if the "regulatory safety net" disappears, we would return to the days of billowing black smokestacks and burning rivers. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This is why the Republican message so far -- that we need to balance environmental protection with the demands of economic growth -- has fallen like a lead balloon. Many people are convinced the argument is just shorthand for rolling back environmental protections.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even though environmental regulations cost the U.S. economy an incredible $171 billion annually, balancing this cost against a child's life is a losing proposition. Unless  Republicans can show that their policies protect jobs, eliminate unfairness, and do a better job protecting the environment and public health than the big-government approach, environmental issues will continue to be their Achilles' heel.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The fact is, well intentioned liberal environmental policies can kill. For example, according to a Harvard University study, current regulatory policies cost 60,000 lives per year. Why? Because the government squanders huge sums of money guarding against minuscule risks -- the theoretical loss of life due to trace amounts of chemicals on fruits and vegetables, for example -- while it ignores much greater risks. Dr. John Graham of the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis calls this "statistical murder." 
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Superfund and property rights reforms before Congress provide excellent opportunities to improve the environment and save more lives. Under the hazardous waste "Superfund" cleanup program, created in 1980, only about 20 percent of the 1,374 sites on the list have been cleaned up. Lawmakers should let people know they want to accelerate cleanups that are now delayed because trial lawyers -- big allies of the White House -- soak up 21 percent of Superfund's money. More lives would be saved because of faster cleanups of the worst sites posing the most risk to Americans.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Similarly, Republicans should explain that protecting the rights of property owners can actually benefit threatened species. Right now, under the Endangered Species Act, regulators can financially ruin families by taking away their ability to use their land, without compensation. This is unfair and counterproductive. It creates an incentive for property owners to make sure no one finds out about endangered species that may live on their land. The bumper sticker "shoot, shovel, and shut up" tells the whole story.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans must recognize that the American people legitimately expect freedom from harmful pollution. That doesn't mean they should embrace the  environmentalist agenda, which opposes letting businesses find the best way to comply with environmental safeguards, and is hostile to free-market solutions. It does mean, however, that they must publicly acknowledge that polluting a neighborhood is not a conservative value. They should stress the need to prioritize risks and explain why market approaches often work better than regulations -- not only for preserving liberty and economic growth, but for the environment as well. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most people want more freedom, a stronger economy and a clean and healthy environment. Republicans can win the environmental debate if they meet this challenge, and give people all three. With a positive vision, they can do just that.

<title>Clinton's New Budget: And the Winner Is..Big Government - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center><h3>CLINTON'S NEW BUDGET: AND THE WINNER IS ... BIG GOVERNMENT</h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The new budget President Clinton released this week was supposed to attack big government. Big government won.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Over seven years, President Clinton's fiscal year 1997 budget proposes $358 billion in higher spending and $232 billion in higher federal tax revenues than the balanced budget submitted to him by Congress last fall, which he vetoed. That amounts to $3,580 in higher spending and $2,320 in higher tax revenue for every household in America. So much for "the end of big government."
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
And what about the deficit candidate Clinton vowed to slay within five years if elected? Compared to the 1995 Balanced Budget Act, the president's new budget adds $125 billion in new red ink through the year 2002.  That amounts to increasing the debt burden on every household by $1,250.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But give the president credit -- for some exceptionally brazen budget gimmickry. On paper, his fiscal year 1997 budget balances by 2002, but only by leaving the real work of deficit reduction to a future president and Congress.  Consider:  The White House budget purports to save nearly $600 billion over seven years, but only 40 percent of those savings would come during Clinton's second term in office, if he wins.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Simply put, it's a lot easier to balance the budget when some other president will bear the brunt of responsibility for deficit reduction. Under the 1997 Clinton budget, the first president and Congress of the next century would have to find 63 percent of the savings -- not just from political lemons like foreign aid, but from favored programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Not only does the president leave the spending mess for someone else to clean up, he hogs popular tax cuts for himself. Under his budget, middle-class families would get a tax credit for each child, increasing in value from $300 in 1997 to $500 by 1999. But in 2002, the deadline for a balanced budget, Clinton's child tax credit vanishes.  The result in that year: an $18 billion tax increase on families with children. But this doesn't worry the White House either, since some future president will have to deliver the bad news.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	What's more, the president's budget offsets these tax cuts with big tax increases.  All told, the White House budget contains $99.7 billion in tax cuts and $62.4 billion in tax increases.  New taxes exceed the president's proposed seven-year Medicaid savings ($59 billion) and surpass by half his proposed welfare cuts ($40 billion).  In the end, the net tax cut is $37 billion, or just 3 cents of every $1,000 taxpayers will send to Washington over the next seven years. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	And let's not forget: This is the same president who said he would work with Congress to craft some kind of capital-gains tax cut.  But not only does his budget propose no such tax cut, it calls for $4 billion in higher capital-gains taxes over the next seven years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Meanwhile, the president's budget treats entitlement programs such as Medicaid and Medicare -- the real engines behind uncontrolled spending growth -- with kid gloves. In fact, spending on entitlements steams ahead by $370 billion, or 50 percent, over seven years.  For all "mandatory" programs, spending would grow from 49 cents of every federal dollar today to 59 cents of every federal dollar in 2002.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This threatens not only the country's solvency, but the future of entitlement programs themselves.  In less than 15 years, spending on entitlements and debt interest will consume nearly every dollar in the federal budget, according to the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement Reform headed by Sen. Robert Kerry, D-Neb., and retired Sen. John Danforth, R-Mo.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The president's response? His budget proposes to slow the growth of Medicare spending by $124 billion over seven years -- not nearly enough to save the program from collapse.  For Medicaid, the situation is just as bad. If nothing is done to reform the program, runaway costs could force states to raise taxes or cut spending by $146 billion. And the president's proposed "reform" -- placing a cap on how much the federal government will spend per Medicaid beneficiary -- could slap $47 billion in new costs on already cash-strapped states.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is one area of the budget, however, where the White House does propose real change: spending on presidential "pork" gets a big boost. Clinton's budget outlines a sweeping agenda of new spending initiatives on priorities important to politically influential special-interest groups: education (teachers' unions), high technology (corporations) and the environment ("green" activists). Compared to Congress' balanced budget, the president would shovel an extra $106 billion over seven years to programs supported by such groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Let's face it. The president's budget -- while claiming, technically, to eliminate the deficit by 2002 -- is just more obfuscation, smoke and mirrors. It is not the end of big government, it is the embodiment of it.

<title>The Unfinished Agenda on Unfunded Mandates - Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h2>THE UNFINISHED AGENDA ON UNFUNDED MANDATES</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/antonel.htm">Angela Antonelli</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
March 21, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	One year after Congress passed a law to deal with the problem of "unfunded mandates," the results are not encouraging.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Few Americans have any idea that Washington forces all sorts of laws and regulations on state and local governments -- concerning everything from storm-water drainage to health care for illegal immigrants -- without giving states and localities so much as a penny to pay for them.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	State and local government officials and business leaders met recently in Washington to examine the preliminary recommendations of the Advisory Council on Intergovernmental Relations (ACIR). This is the body Congress assigned last year to examine how "unfunded mandates" are hurting state and local governments, as part of its <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/1?r104:./temp/~r104uCqz::+@1(S.+1)++">Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As the ACIR's recommendations show, unfunded mandates are still busting state and local budgets, diverting much-needed money from law enforcement, fire fighting, education and other activities people really need. In short, Congress accomplished little with last year's reforms. This should come as no surprise. After all, the <a href="http://rs9.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/11?r104:./temp/~r104YVpC::unfunded+mandates+reform+act+">
Unfunded Mandates Reform Act</a> of 1995  did absolutely nothing to address existing mandates -- except to have the ACIR study them. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	But the study is proving useful. Based on information from the National Governors' Association and dozens of other state and local governments and organizations, ACIR identified 14 mandates it sees as the biggest problems. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The report recommends that seven federal laws, including the Family and Medical Leave Act, the Occupational Safety and Health Act, and the Fair Labor Standards Act, no longer apply to state and local governments. Another seven laws, including the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act and the Clean Air Act, should be made more flexible or be funded more by the federal government instead of forcing state and local governments to pay.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of course, the report has its shortcomings. It doesn't say anything about how unfunded mandates affect the private sector and whether reforms should extend that far. There also are countless environmental, health and education mandates the report doesn't address. And while the ACIR acknowledges that laws like the Occupational Safety and Health Act may not have a legitimate scientific basis, the ACIR's report doesn't reach into whether the laws themselves should be changed. Asking Congress to exempt states and localities from laws that are ill-conceived in the first place sets a bad precedent and creates a double standard for treatment of the private sector.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In short, the ACIR report just scratches the surface of a huge problem. Costly requirements imposed by Washington are undermining the fiscal health of state and local governments. For example, every three years the Safe Drinking Water Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency to identify 25 new substances localities must test for in their water supplies -- forcing cities across America to bear the cost of testing for substances that literally have been banned for decades. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another example: A <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cb22.html">study</a> by The Heritage Foundation showed that state spending on Medicaid will increase from $32 billion in 1990 to $104 billion in 2002, a 325 percent boost, if there is no reform of the current program. States like California and New York will have to raise additional billions just to pay for their share of this program.  
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Unfunded mandates can force states to raise taxes; reduce spending on education, infrastructure, law enforcement or some other service; or both. For example, in September 1995, Fairfax County, Va. reported that half its non-school budget is being consumed by programs and mandates issued by Congress and the Virginia General Assembly, for which the county receives no funds. In February, the county executive was forced to propose one of the largest tax increases in the county's history, as well as dramatic reductions in education and social service programs.. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Despite their limitations, the ACIR recommendations should give states and localities hope. They confirm that the burden of unfunded mandates is real and significant. The ACIR's final report could create the foundation for a new round of legislative initiatives. These could range from full federal funding of mandates to outright repeal.
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	However, if state and local communities expect change, they will have to continue badgering Washington through legislation and the courts. Unless states and localities are vigilant in keeping Congress and the president focused on addressing the problem of unfunded mandates, there will be no reform at all. 
<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Washington will be all too happy to keep passing the buck.

<h3>WHY WE SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT RUSSIA </h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/cohen.htm">Ariel Cohen</a><br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
 February 29, 1996<br>

<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Russia has the potential to become a far more dangerous and unstable adversary than the Soviet Union ever was. Yet, as the April summit between President Clinton and Russian President Boris Yeltsin approaches, U.S. and international policy-makers seem oblivious to developments that daily make a future belligerent regime in Russia more likely.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Board of Directors of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is considering granting Russia a $10.2 billion loan, and the U.S.- run Export-Import Bank may provide an additional $1 billion to boost Russia's flagging civilian aircraft industry. President Clinton strongly endorses the IMF loan, hoping it will bolster Yeltsin's faltering presidency. But giving Russia a handout will only encourage Russia on its destructive course. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;If a hard-line communist like Gennady Zyuganov were to carry the presidential election this June, which looks increasingly likely, IMF credits would be going to precisely the kind of regime that could resume threatening the United States and Europe with nuclear weapons. There is a chance that these loans would never be repaid since, under a communist government, Russia could sever relations with the IMF and the World Bank.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Economic reforms in Russia are grinding to a halt. First Deputy Prime Minister Anatoly Chubais, the last remaining radical reformer in Yeltsin's cabinet, was forced to resign to appease Yeltsin's nationalist and communist critics, whose power and influence are gaining strength. Vladimir Kadannikov, Chubais' replacement, directed Russia's inefficient auto-making giant VAZ, whose low-quality products have long been the laughingstock of Europe.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, in 1995 Russia's inflation rate raged between 120 and 130 percent, budget deficits remain very high, and privatization has failed to raise the revenues to reduce them. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Leading Yeltsin administration officials such as Interior Minister General Anatoly Kulikov, along with communist deputies in the Duma, are seriously considering reversing privatization and stopping economic reforms in their tracks. Communists and their allies control the majority of the Duma's committees and the powerful Duma Executive Council.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Moreover, election pressures have forced Yeltsin to break budgetary constraints and promise billions of dollars in credits and payments to powerful industry groups.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;For example, about $4 billion was earmarked for the defense industry and $2.2 billion in back wages has been promised to public-sector workers. The notoriously inefficient Russian miners, who went on strike in December 1995, were promised another $2 billion; $3.3 billion has been pledged to the agricultural sector; half a billion dollars went to pensioners, and more than $1 billion will be paid to officers and soldiers in the armed forces. All of these are panic-driven political payoffs by a frightened regime fighting for its survival.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Instead of offering a handout to the Russian government, the IMF and the World Bank ought to be providing policy advice to Russian leaders on decreasing tax rates to boost private enterprise and encouraging investment to make the Russian economy more attractive for domestic and foreign entrepreneurs. Only when investment, both foreign and domestic, is able to create prosperity for the Russian people will the tensions tearing the country apart be eased.   
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Russia has become such an investment risk that more than $12 billion a year is leaving the country  to be deposited in foreign banks. Such capital flight -- the result of incoherent economic policies -- is starving the Russian economy of investment and taxable income and creating political unrest. Even as it asks the IMF for loans, Moscow is forgiving sizable debts owed to it: $8 billion owed by Libyan dictator Muammar Qaddafi; $3 billion owed by the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua; and $250 million owed by Ethiopia. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Meanwhile, Russia continues to prosecute the war against Chechnya. According to estimates by Russian economists, this war is costing more than $4.5 billion a year. The IMF should not subsidize such a war, or any other military ventures into which a future Russian hard-line president might drag the country.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Most ominous of all, the country may be on the brink of a takeover by Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of the unreformed communists who has promised to restore the U.S.S.R. "by voluntary means."  Leading in opinion polls, he is followed by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, who has declared he will restore the Russian empire and possibly expand it even further into the Middle East.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Clinton administration should not lobby the IMF on behalf of Russia. More money  is not what Russia needs. At best the money will be wasted; at worst, it could be abused by a future anti-Western leadership. Instead, President Clinton should take the lead in ensuring that all aid to Russia is conditioned on the adoption of free-market and democratic reforms. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Otherwise, the foundation for a Russia more dangerous than the Soviet Union will continue to be laid.

<title>Raising the Bar - Heritage Commentary</title>

<h3>RAISING THE BAR</h3>
By Nina Shokraii<br>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
February 29, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In the debate over affirmative action about to begin in Congress, opponents of racial quotas and preferences should be ready to offer a better way of creating opportunity for racial groups that have been victims of discrimination.  The answer is high academic standards for everyone.
<p> 
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The greatest tragedy of public education today is the low expectations it sets for poor children, especially blacks and Hispanics.  Racial quotas and preferences reinforce this defeatism by sending a message that blacks and Hispanics can succeed academically and economically only if they are held to a lower standard than Asians and whites.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But the experience of countless schools and teachers shows that when there are high expectations, black and Hispanic children can meet them.  Test scores for racial minorities can rise by quantum jumps without the ugly practice of "race-norming," where test scores are artificially raised to compensate for racial status.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Take, for instance, the experience of Rafe Esquith, a fifth- and sixth-grade teacher at Hobart Elementary School, located near the site of the 1992 riots in Los Angeles.  Most children at Hobart are poor immigrants from families that don't speak English; 80 percent are Hispanic, 16 percent Asian, 2 percent African-American.  But by the end of the sixth grade, Esquith's students have finished a year of algebra and classical literature -- including eight Shakespeare plays.  His junior thespian crew, the "Hobart Shakespeareans," have performed with Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company.  Their performance of "Measure for Measure" will open the World Shakespeare Congress in Los Angeles this June.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;How does Esquith bring out the best in his class?  The same way outstanding teachers always do.  He sets high standards and gives his students the help they need to meet them.  Esquith begins teaching his class at 6:30 a.m. and teaches straight until 5 p.m. (They even eat lunch in the classroom.)  By teaching his youngsters to solve difficult math equations and to read and perform Shakespeare early on, Esquith trains his kids to take on challenges that at first seem impossible.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The result: Last year, in the mathematics portion of the Comprehensive Test of Basic Skills (a test administered to the Los Angeles Unified School District), his fifth-graders achieved average scores in the 98th percentile while the school itself scored in the 64th percentile and the district in the 47th percentile.  On the English test, they produced similar results -- even though all of Esquith's students speak English as a second language. If not for his devotion, most would be written off as "slow" or "troubled."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;No one can attest to the success of a teacher like Rafe Esquith better than Barbara Lerner. A lawyer and psychologist, she was an outspoken advocate of the "minimum competence testing" movement in the late 1970s -- a grassroots movement demanding that no student be allowed to graduate from high school without first passing a test proving he or she had mastered basic skills in reading and math.  Lerner's 1983 testimony in <I>Debra vs. Turlington</I> (the case challenging Florida's minimum competence test) convinced the courts that minimum competence testing provided just the push these kids needed, pointing out that by the fifth attempt, more than 90 percent of them passed.  Lerner believes schools should make the minimum competence exam the standard for grade-school graduation and also should require children to pass an advanced competence test like the Scholastic Aptitude Test to graduate from high school.  
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;But lawsuits and policies challenging advanced competency abound, and efforts to make earning a high-school diploma contingent upon passing a stringent exam bear a heavy political risk -- because, at first, many students are likely to fail the tests.  According to a 1995 report by the North Central Regional Education Laboratory, only 17 states require all their high school students to pass some form of graduation test.  And of these 17 states, only New York  has made significant strides. Thanks to Ramon Cortines, former chancellor of New York City's public schools, standards and accountability were reinstalled as the centerpiece of education in New York City.  Although the results of the first year reveal a rise in course-failure rates among African-Americans and Hispanics, the number of minorities taking and passing the more rigorous courses increased greatly.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Opponents of affirmative action present myriad empowerment ideas, such as school-choice vouchers, when challenged to offer alternatives. But as the experiences of teachers like Esquith demonstrate, promoting high standards has proven to boost achievement in a way affirmative action never has and never will.  
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The best kind of affirmative action is that which will teach children the discipline they need to advance in the educational and professional arena.

Richard Weaver's seminal book "Ideas Have Consequences" could be our theme today, despite the fact that it was published almost 50 years ago. The remarkable growth of the Internet proves again the power of ideas to reshape how Americans communicate with each other, and the world. <p>
The Heritage Foundation's World Wide Web site was created to spread the ideas of free enterprise, limited government, individual freedom, traditional American values, and a strong national defense, the same ideas which caused a political revolution in the 1994 elections. As Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich declared just after the election: "Heritage is, without question, the most far-reaching conservative
organization in the country in the war of ideas, and one which has had a tremendous impact not just in Washington, but literally across the planet." 
<p>
As a leader in both the political and communications revolutions taking place today, The Heritage Foundation will continue to demonstrate the power of our ideas well into the 21st century.

<P>	<B><FONT SIZE="+2">T</FONT></B>he alienation of African-American men from the churches of their communities 
is perhaps the single greatest tragedy facing black America. "While 75 percent of the 
mosque is male, 75 percent of the black church is female," laments Jawanza Kunjufu, 
author of <I>Adam Where Are You?: Why Most Black Men Don't Go to Church</I>. It wasn't 
always so: In earlier generations, black men were much more involved in the church, and 
their religious faith bolstered their commitment to families and neighborhoods. The most 
effective way to reduce black crime, and to strengthen black families, may be to return 
African-American men to their spiritual roots.</P>
<P>	A church in Baltimore that is itself returning to its roots is making great headway 
in its ministry to men. Bethel AME Church, founded in 1785, is the second-oldest church 
in the African Methodist Episcopal denomination and a venerable institution squarely in 
the black political mainstream. Bethel hosted much of the NAACP's national summit last 
year. Its pastor, Frank Madison Reid III, is the son and grandson of AME bishops, and his 
step-brother is Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke. Reid was educated at Yale University 
and Harvard Divinity School. A veteran of the civil-rights movement, he served later as 
pastor of Ward AME Church, an important congregation in Los Angeles. He has earned a 
black belt in karate, a prominent image as a local television personality, and a position as 
an intellectual leader of the African-American church.</P>

<H3>A Growing Concern</H3>
<P>	When Reid, 43, was named pastor of Bethel in 1989, the congregation had 7,000 
members, 25 percent of them men. Today, its membership numbers 10,000, 40 percent of 
whom are men. Each week, 4,400 of the faithful attend one of the two Sunday services, 
and 45 percent of them are men. Secular agencies and politicians who want to improve 
urban life should take note of Reid's ministry. Black men in his congregation have 
reconciled with their wives, resumed responsibilities to their children and communities, 
committed themselves to becoming productive citizens, and dedicated themselves to God.</P>
<P>	Rare among traditional black churches, economic classes mix at Bethel. The 
church is located in the Druid Hill section of Baltimore, a historically working-class 
neighborhood now infested with drugs and dilapidated public-housing projects, but it 
draws its membership from middle-class suburbs as well as the surrounding 
neighborhood. At services, blue-jean-clad youths pray while holding hands with middle-
aged professionals and families dressed in their Sunday best.</P> 
<P>	Reid attributes the growth of his congregation to a return to its Methodist roots. 
The Methodist movement, started by Charles and John Wesley in England in the 18th 
century, was spread throughout America by preachers such as George Whitefield. When 
Richard Allen and other blacks were barred from praying in a Methodist church in 
Philadelphia in the late 1700s, they established the AME church. Early Methodism 
emphasized moral rectitude and discipline, revivalism, the study of Scripture in Bible 
groups, and personal conversion. The movement played a leading role in the national 
crusades against drunkenness and slavery. "We meet the spiritual needs of the people 
because of our focus on prayer and the mystical nature of connection between the 
individual human being and the Holy Spirit," says Reid.</P>
<P>	Worship at Bethel is boisterous; dancing and shouting infuse the atmosphere. 
Reid sees this as a return to the spirit of early Methodism, when religious intensity 
energized powerful campaigns for the betterment of society. Reid points with pride to the 
18th-century English Methodists who "went into the prisons and streets with a revival 
that saved England from the same revolutionary fate as France." And he cites as a model 
the 1870s revival at Philadelphia's Bethel AME Church, which prompted a moral uplift 
in the city's black population.</P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men is in the early Methodist tradition of vigorous outreach to 
the unchurched, wherever they may be found. As the pastor of Ward AME in the early 
1980s, Reid concluded that the church wasn't addressing the needs of young men on the 
street. He also wondered why black males were joining the Nation of Islam or Los 
Angeles gangs like the Bloods and Crips, but not the Protestant churches. "Jesus said, `I 
will make you fishers of men,' " he says. "But either the church wasn't using the right 
bait or the lines weren't strong enough to bring the fish into the church."</P> 
<P>	How does Reid reel the men in at Bethel?  His television services encourage men 
to visit the church.  Highly approachable, he invites men to attend his church when he 
meets them on Baltimore's streets in his daily travels.  His use of the term "brother" 
suggests kinship and inspires male members to actively urge their friends to accompany 
them to Bethel.</P>  
<P>	Reid also uses a four-step plan that relies on "respect" for black males, teaching 
the "roots" of Christianity, "reformation" of habits, and "resurrection" of lives.  At 
Sunday services, male visitors are welcomed with applause and hugs. "We want to 
express our joy for your presence in the Lord's house," Reid says from the pulpit.</P>   
<P>	 Reid recently invited Louis Farrakhan of the Nation of Islam to speak at Bethel. 
Reid disagrees with Farrakhan's theology and racial and religious separatism. But Reid 
wanted men who are attracted to Farrakhan to be exposed to a church that emphasizes 
Christian manliness.</P>
<P>	Men who visit Bethel also find an atmosphere that is masculine as well as 
feminine, unlike many of the churches they are used to. At age 13 or so, many black 
youths tend to drop out of church. "At that age, black males who were once drawn to the 
choir as youth no longer sing, because robes look like dresses," says Reid. "Their Sunday 
school teacher, superintendent, and youth adviser are women. Their reaction to the 
religious femininity of the church drives them out of the church and into the seduction of 
a gang."</P>
<P>	At Bethel, men as well as women occupy important board and teaching positions, 
and Reid makes sure that men won't have to leave the church to find opportunities for 
brotherhood. In addition to all-female Bible study and family Bible programs, Bethel 
offers weekly all-male Bible classes. There, stories from Scripture inspire men to talk 
freely about difficulties in their relations with women, and--Reid calls this a common 
problem among black men--the resentment they may feel toward absent, domineering, or 
abusive fathers.</P> 
<P>	Every November, Bethel hosts a month-long celebration of men. Last year's 
activities included a retreat, African martial-arts experts, scholarly lectures, a Men's Day 
with noted personalities like talk-show host Tony Brown, and a week-long revival service 
at which 67 men, including some substance abusers, joined the church. </P>
<P>	Reid also attracts men to Bethel by setting strict standards of individual moral 
responsibility. Foul language, lying, cheating, and adultery are simply not tolerated. No 
drinking, smoking, or blasphemy is allowed in the congregation. In his sermons, Reid 
cautions the men against excessive anger, spitefulness, and abusive behavior created by 
high stress and low self-esteem. He advises them to restrain their anger through a close 
relationship with Christ. "If men are unable to handle their emotions," he says, "then they 
become prime candidates for abusing their wives or girlfriends and children, as well as 
their friends and neighbors and, ultimately, the community."</P>
<P>	Reid is convinced that exacting standards of behavior do not drive men away, but 
attract them. Men are empowered by morality, he says; they gain courage and conviction 
when they know they are acting responsibly. He argues that the appeal of Malcolm X and 
Louis Farrakhan comes more from their moral authority than their religion. Christianity, 
too, must emphasize its firmness along with its love and compassion. "Jesus drew strong 
fishermen to him," Reid says. "His moral authority was a magnet."</P>
<P>	Reid challenges the males in his congregation to be men rather than boys. "You 
can be 65 and still be a boy," he preaches. "You can be 45, married with children, and 
still be a boy. The difference between a boy and a man is that a man loves God and takes 
responsibility for himself and others."</P> 
<P>	Many congregants fail to live up to the church's standards. But all men are 
welcome. No stigma is placed on former convicts and drug-abusers. At each service, Reid 
asks men who have been incarcerated to stand and be applauded. Reid preaches that 
everybody in the church is sinful, citing the biblical injunction, "We were born in sin and 
shaped in iniquity, and we all have fallen short of the glory of God." </P>
<P>	Bethel provides wrongdoers with encouragement coupled with discipline. Biblical 
passages are cited to show why the behavior in question is wrong. The church is firm in 
response to wrongful deeds, but forgiving. The man admits his error, and he and Reid 
discuss ways to make restitution and bring healing for the wrongs he has committed. Reid 
strongly emphasizes restitution, arguing that one has a responsibility to bring wholeness 
to that which one has broken.</P>
<P>	Changa Onyanga used to be a lieutenant in the drug culture. When he first entered 
Bethel to visit a former member of his gang, he had no respect for ministers like Reid. "I 
looked him up and down and pressed on." Onyanga says now. "I did not speak to him. 
Besides, preachers had a bad rap because they were not doing anything for people who 
needed a cause to champion."</P>
<P>	Reid noted Onyanga's "terrible disposition" and responded. "No one walks 
around this church and does not speak," Reid said to him. "We are friendly and we speak 
to one another as Christians should." Reid had Onyanga's friend talk to him and teach 
him about the decorum of his church. Onyanga has since joined Bethel.</P>
<P>	In preaching personal responsibility, Reid acknowledges his own errors. Happily 
married with two daughters, eight and two, Reid also fathered a son out of wedlock 
during an earlier pastorate in Charlotte, North Carolina. "I do not deny my 15-year-old 
son," says Reid. "He is a reality." Although his son lives with the mother, Reid remains a 
significant part of his life. He provides monetary and moral support and communicates 
regularly. Reid even has him stand up in the congregation when he comes to visit.</P>
<P>	Reid tells the men that he has been where some of them are. Once they see that 
their spiritual leader is not above temptation, he believes, the men in his congregation can 
grapple more easily with issues of manhood and sexuality. </P>
<P>	Reid argues that spiritual leaders must be honest with men about their own 
failings. Some black men resist attending church because they regard the preachers as 
hypocrites. Reid chides his fellow clergy for not practicing what they preach. "Just 
because they received the calling," he says, "does not mean they are above the struggle or 
the contradictions." Citing St. Augustine and other great religious teachers who have 
acknowledged their sinfulness, he says pastors must realize they are preaching to 
themselves as well as to their congregations. </P>
<P>	Reid's ministry to men includes working with women to restore male authority in 
the home. Men will be better fathers and husbands and will participate more willingly in 
church and community life, Reid argues, if they are allowed to exercise authority as head 
of the household. This does not mean tyranny or dictatorial control, but rather loving 
responsibility. Reid teaches men to be the protector, priest, provider, and partner of the 
household. The Old Testament instructs the man to be "watchman for his family."</P>
<P>	"We teach that the man should be the first person his wife goes to for prayer," 
Reid says. "If there is need for the pastor to come into the household, then it should be to 
pray for the family. But that can only happen if the man takes the leadership in making 
prayer a part of the household. The man should take the leadership for making sure Bible 
study is part of family life." Reid preaches that wives should submit to their husbands, 
but also that husbands must not abuse this authority. "Paul's letter to the Ephesians 
teaches us: `Woman, submit thyself if your man loves you as Jesus loves the church,' "  
he says. "If the husband does not love his wife as Jesus loved the church, then she has no 
responsibility to submit to him. We submit to Jesus out of the fact that he loved us." </P>
<P>	The principle of male headship does not mean that the husband must be the 
primary breadwinner. "We teach the men that wives' earnings should not bruise their 
ego," says Reid. "A husband should be thankful when a woman who earns more, or has 
more education, looks to him as protector and provider." The word "provider," Reid 
points out, comes from the Latin for "seeing." It means supplying a family's vision as 
much as providing its material sustenance.</P>
<P>	Reid also teaches women how to respond to men in the household. Annette 
Brown, for example, used Reid's sermon on "a loving God" to endure six years of 
estrangement from her husband, Kevin. "There were times when my husband was gone 
for four days without contact," says Brown, "but pastor Reid's message told me to look 
beyond his faults and see his needs." Annette and Kevin are back together, and their 
relationship is stronger. He has joined Bethel and resumed his role as father of their two 
sons. He has even begun to prepare for the ministry.</P>
<P>	Brown is the religious leader and disciplinarian of the household. He is also in 
charge of sex education. Brown settles family decisions after family prayer. Matters in 
which he reserves the final say include private school for their children, vacations, family 
transportation, his work hours, visits to relatives, and house-buying. But his wife controls 
the household finances. She submits to him because he submits to the church. "Kevin 
takes the authority in the household," she says. "When there is a decision, he makes the 
final decision." She reserves the right to veto any decision not in the family's best 
interest, but she adheres to Biblical scripture: Better to live on a corner of the roof than 
share a house with a quarrelsome wife. "I always uplift my husband," she says.</P>
<P>	Reid denies that this approach oppresses women. "I have not talked to a single 
African-American woman," he says, "who has said `no' when I have asked whether she 
would gladly submit to a man who loved Christ, who provided for her and her children, 
who would protect her, and was spiritual. They recognize that the submission would not 
be an oppressive submission, but a submission in partnership." </P>
<P>	Reid encourages men to marry or, if they are separated, to reunite with the 
mothers of their children. But he does not always counsel marriage. "It makes no sense," 
he says, "to push together a couple that does not love each other. If the mother has 
become pregnant for the wrong reasons--out of lust, for example, or to get welfare 
payments--then it may not be possible for the father to exercise loving authority as head 
of the household."</P>
<P>	"In an ideal world, it is easy to say, `if you make a baby, then marry the mother,' " 
Reid says. "But as a pastor, I have to deal with the hard facts of family conflict. What 
happens to the child who grows up in a home where the parents hate each other because 
you made them get married? The child will grow up with their hostility and take it out 
into the world."</P> 
<P>	Reid thinks public policy treats African-American men with illegitimate children 
too harshly. He is especially troubled by a court system that cuts fathers off from their 
children. Men are presumed guilty in disputes over child support; visitation can be denied 
at the mother's request. Reid says the system "tortures fathers, who often want to do the 
right thing for their children, and is unfairly slanted toward the mother."</P>
<P>	According to Reid, models of Christian manhood from African and African-
American history are essential in attracting black men to church. Before becoming full 
members of Bethel, men must spend an hour with the pastor, who teaches them about 
Africans in the Bible and African-American church history. In this portion of his 
ministry, which he calls "roots," Reid tries to dispel the notion that Christianity is a 
Eurocentric, slave masters' religion. He teaches about the Africans Simeon (also called 
Niger) and Lucius of Cyrene, who ordained the Apostle Paul and Silas. He talks about the 
black abolitionist David Walker, who in 1829 published an anti-slavery tract known as 
the Appeal. This seminal publication demanded the end of slavery and appealed to the 
"God of the Ethiopians." </P> 
<P>	Another of Reid's models of black Christian manhood is Bishop Henry McNeil 
Turner. Born a slave in South Carolina, Turner became the first black chaplain of the 
Union army, a member of the South Carolina Legislature, and an advocate for the black 
emigration to Africa in 1874. His status as a bishop in the African Methodist Episcopal 
Church allowed him to carry the African-American religious tradition to South Africa 
more than 100 years ago. </P> 
<P>	Reid also likes to point out to his African-American audience that Jesus may not 
have been as European-looking as Hollywood and other forms of  popular culture 
typically have portrayed him--white, blue-eyed, and fair-haired. He quotes a passage 
from the Old Testament book of Daniel that describes the Messiah, whose "feet were like 
burnished brass and his hair was like lamb's wool," and the New Testament book of 
Revelation, which similarly describes Jesus with feet "like bronze glowing in a furnace." 
Some church members, such as Charles Wiggins, say they were greatly affected by 
Reid's more raw, human portrait of Christ. "I had never heard a minister talk about Jesus 
who looked like me," says Wiggins, who joined in 1991. "I have found a home."</P>
<P>	Reid brings in guest lecturers to talk about African-American manhood. In a 
recent program, Na'im Akbar, a Florida State psychologist who is an expert on black 
male psychology, urged men at Bethel to learn from "the courage of Dr. King, the 
defiance of the honorable Elijah Muhammed, the economic strategy of Booker T. 
Washington, and the uncompromising integrity of Paul Robeson."</P>
<P>	Reid encourages the men to spiritually mold young males of the community. 
Through Project RAISE, they mentor teenagers from local schools. The men do not 
pressure them to join the church, but some do, attending Sunday services and Bible study 
with their mentors.</P>
<P>	After a small riot erupted at Booker T. Washington Junior High School just before 
Christmas last year, Bethel began a direct partnership with the school. To prevent a 
reoccurrence, Reid summoned 150 men to the school. They lined the street in front of the 
school and remained watchful for arsonists, gangs, and visiting troublemakers. At the 
request of the principal, the men recently returned to supervise the children in the 
morning and afternoon. The pupils' tranquillity prompted one teacher to comment that 
they were "acting like children again."</P>
<P>	Bethel assists men in running their households. In the class for new members, 
men are shown how to allocate their earnings. The 10-10-80 plan is a voluntary financial-
management procedure wherein 10 percent of the new member's yearly earnings is 
contributed to the church. Another 10 percent goes into a savings account, while the 
remainder is used for living expenses. </P>
<P>	Men who need additional help in managing their finances can attend classes on 
preparing tax returns, taught by a CPA who donates her time. Bethel has helped its 
members form food co-ops and investment clubs for pooling risk capital, purchasing 
bonds and mutual funds, and setting up funds for children's college tuition.</P>
<P>	Reid and members of the congregation also find jobs for men. Some have 
convictions for crack use, weapons possession, or other felonies, while others possess 
little or no high school or college education. But Reid and other officers at Bethel often 
vouch for the character of church members who might not look good on paper.</P>
<P>	Reid himself hires men as security guards for the church. The security team not 
only protects the church and its membership; it gives young men the opportunity to 
"soldier"--to wear a uniform, carry walkie-talkies, use one's physical strength, and 
become close friends with other men. Reid argues that these are the principal lures of 
being in a gang. So why not channel these male yearnings into structures that help build 
spiritual soldiers?</P>
<P>	The security guards are called the Mighty Men of God after the warriors who 
followed King David.  There is no better symbol than these men of Reid's teaching that 
Christianity is a manly as well as a womanly religion. The Mighty Men of God hold 
respected positions in the church, including the leader of Bible study, sexton, and security 
guard. They are responsible for the safety of the congregation and community, and 
combat random crime with periodic community patrolling. </P>
<P>	The M.M.O.G. play an important role in the safety of the children who attend 
Bethel's day school. They greet parents and students each morning as they arrive. During 
the day, they guard against intruders and drug sales. At the end of the day, a Mighty Man 
of God sees each child safely across the street.</P>
<P>	The regimen of the M.M.O.G. requires discipline. They meet for two hours every 
Tuesday and Saturday. Officers open the meetings with a personal inspection. They 
check for fresh haircuts, cleanshaven faces, and shined shoes. Members are not allowed 
to smoke or drink, so officers check for burns and yellow stains from nicotine or 
marijuana. M.M.O.G. maintain two uniforms: a suit and a security outfit for guarding the 
church.</P>
<P>	After prayer, they discuss local and international events. Drilling, marching, and 
commands soon fill the room. An inspirational message from Reid follows, and the group 
closes with hand-holding prayer.</P>
<P>	One member of the Mighty Men of God is Max Taylor. After joining Bethel at the 
age of 18, Taylor joined forces with local drug dealers and descended into the world of 
drugs, guns, and violence. He was responsible for preparing street corners for potential 
drug sales. "I cleaned street corners for drug dealers by any means necessary," says 
Taylor, 29. He reached a point, he says, when he realized that if he continued he would 
soon "be dead or behind bars for a long time if I was arrested."</P>
<P>	In 1992, Taylor rejoined the church with rejuvenated purpose. He walked through 
local housing complexes challenging drug dealers, his old friends, for territory. "I was 
extremely cold and ruthless," says Taylor, "but due to the power of Frank Reid and God, 
I have changed."</P>

outperform government in providing good job training.</P>
<P>	On 13 campuses from Atlanta to Los Angeles, more than 15,000 students--35 
percent of whom are black or Latino--are earning their bachelor's of science degrees at 
DeVry. Ninety-four percent of the school's graduates land jobs in their fields of study 
within six months, with an average starting salary exceeding $24,000 a year.</P>
<P>	DeVry's alumni enjoy cutting-edge technical careers. At Hughes 
Communications, the nation's largest satellite company, 22 of the 30 engineers 
responsible for orbit maintenance are DeVry graduates. KLA Instruments, which designs 
quality-control systems for the manufacture of microchips, boasts that a fifth of its 1,000 
employees graduated from DeVry. All this at an annual cost per student of $2,500 less 
than similar state-run programs.</P>
<P>	And DeVry posted a $12-million profit on revenues of  $211 million last year to 
boot.</P>

<H3>Selling Job Opportunity</H3>
<P>	Since its founding in 1931 by Herman DeVry, the inventor of the portable 
motion-picture projector, the institute has specialized in technical training that leads to 
lucrative careers. DeVry, which grants accredited bachelor's degrees, is a for-profit 
venture whose stock trades on the NASDAQ exchange. In short, it sells job opportunity.</P>
<P>	Five years ago, when Zaneta Rizzo graduated from a small high school in rural 
Louisiana, she "knew less than nothing" about computers, thought DOS was pronounced 
"dose," and was terrified of automatic-teller machines.</P>
<P>	After two years of bouncing among jobs in fast-food restaurants, Rizzo enrolled at 
DeVry's Dallas campus. Recently she graduated with a bachelor's degree in computer 
information systems and is deciding between several job offers with computer-training 
firms. Before DeVry, Rizzo's salary peaked at $760 a month. Her current offers are for 
$25,000 a year--a 275 percent pay hike.</P>
<P>	When Jeri Gomez graduated from high school near Fresno, California, she 
enrolled in a local community college to study the health sciences and dance, but classes 
were constantly being canceled, so she enlisted in the army. After serving in Desert 
Storm, Gomez enrolled at DeVry's Pomona campus. She is now deciding among several 
job offers in software programming that pay more than $30,000 a year.</P>
<P>	Rizzo's and Gomez's stories are typical of DeVry students, many of whom field 
multiple job offers before their commencement. In fact, more than 95 percent of 
engineering and accounting majors are placed in their fields within six months of 
graduation--a success rate many of the nation's top schools never approach. How does 
DeVry do it? By running the college like a business.</P>
<P>	Unlike most colleges, DeVry receives no direct government money or alumni 
gifts. Nearly all revenues, and therefore profits, come from tuition. And DeVry has found 
that the best way to attract more students--over half of whom are the first in their 
families to attend college--is to secure high-paying jobs for graduates. Dennis Keller, 
DeVry's chief executive officer, says the school avoids anything that doesn't help 
students find careers.</P>
<P>	To this end, DeVry maintains an enormous placement system with more than 100 
staffers and a database of thousands of employers. While most other schools in the 
country assign placement officers to handle a broad spectrum of careers, DeVry has 
found that employers prefer to communicate with staffers who understand their particular 
needs. For this reason, each officer is trained in a specific field. For instance, Motorola--
which is based near DeVry's DuPage County campus in northern Illinois--works closely 
with staffers specializing in telecommunications. The payoff has been tremendous. When 
the electronics giant was planning a major expansion in Illinois, it consulted DeVry 
placement officials in advance to secure an educated labor force.</P>
<P>	DeVry also edges out the competition by studying labor trends, nationally as well 
as in the local markets near each campus. DeVry does not depend on the federal 
government's research, which is mostly retrospective; its researchers analyze new and 
growing fields. Using data from interviews with small and large employers, annual 
alumni surveys, and more than a dozen local-industry advisory panels, DeVry graduates 
can target rapidly emerging areas that traditional schools miss. Relying on data from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics, for instance, most colleges until recently paid little attention to 
the cellular industry. DeVry officials, on the other hand, adjusted their 
telecommunications curriculum eight years ago to include this technology, and 
subsequently launched the careers of many graduates. "Health care is the next big one," 
says Norman Metz, a senior vice president at DeVry. "We are currently focusing on the 
medical-equipment industry that will handle the graying of America."</P>
<P>	Despite these unsurpassed placement results, the Clinton administration has 
frowned upon for-profit schools like DeVry, insisting the capitalist model leads to a 
useless education. At a 1993 press conference, Labor Secretary Robert Reich told 
journalists to be wary of these institutions, claiming that they mismatch thousands of 
students, and that there is no market for their degrees. Reich's warning was reiterated by 
the media, including the Cleveland Plain Dealer, which urged some for-profit schools to 
carry "warning labels" detailing prospective students' chances of finding employment 
after graduation. In fact, if many state schools had to publish such information, students 
would likely flock to DeVry.</P>

<H3>Blood, Sweat, and Jobs</H3>
<P>	Some for-profit trade schools, to be sure, are little more than diploma mills that 
give gullible students a shlock education. These schools usually go bankrupt when 
students catch on that their degree leads nowhere. But for an institution that is in business 
for the long haul, producing high-quality education for satisfied customers is essential to 
growth and profitability. Keller believes that every graduate represents the school: If an 
employer is unsatisfied with the quality of a single graduate's work, he is unlikely to hire 
from DeVry in the future. That would ultimately harm the bottom line.</P>
<P>	To that end, the school maintains a demanding curriculum that students call 
"brutal" and Keller calls "tough love." It is a no-frills, lots-of-sweat education. The 
rigorous process begins even before the classes start. Although the school accepts SAT 
and ACT test scores--applicants average at the 45th percentile--all students are required 
to take DeVry's admissions test in math. About 14 percent of the applicants fail the exam. 
Of the remaining students, about a quarter are admitted on the condition that they take 
remedial classes. Applicants are also required to take a College Board English test that 
determines their placement in humanities courses.</P>
<P>	From the first day, students follow the curriculum in lockstep. There are no 
electives. Students immediately choose a major from among five fields: electronics-
engineering technology, computer information systems, business operations, 
telecommunications management, or accounting. Each major requires eight or nine 
semesters, and can be completed in three years with summer school.</P>
<P>	Students and DeVry's senior management both prefer this inflexible system. Like 
a manufacturer, the school desires a reputation for providing a consistent "product"; 
students say they enjoy receiving firm direction. "This gets rid of a lot of the time-
wasting filler classes, like underwater basket-weaving, that people take elsewhere," 
recalls Rose Huening, a 1986 graduate.</P>

<H3>Heavy Lifting</H3>
<P>	Here there is no time to waste. Each term, DeVry students take at least four 
classes, plus labs, often exceeding a conventional courseload by four to six credit hours. 
The first-year courseload for computer information systems is typical: five computer-
science classes, four computer labs, two math courses and a math lab, two English 
courses with one writing lab, an economics course, a psychology course, and a business 
course. In addition, since many of the students have never before been pushed to work so 
hard, all freshmen enroll in a class on "success strategies," which teaches study skills and 
time-management techniques.</P>
<P>	George Dean, the vice president for educational planning, believes that many 
traditional colleges waste a great deal of energy embracing new teaching methods. DeVry 
doesn't mandate teaching methods--professors can choose whatever textbooks they 
want--but the level of academic expectations is set at the head office, and it's set high. 
"At the end of the course, the students have to be able to do x and y and z," Dean says. 
"If it works better at the Columbus campus to teach it z then y then x, it doesn't bother 
me."</P>
<P>	Dean is comfortable giving the professors ample latitude because they are 
required to gain real-world experience in their field, and so tend to prefer the most 
practical methods. Although some students earn money for tuition by assisting faculty 
members, they are prohibited from teaching, and are usually limited to grading papers.</P>
<P>	Unlike trade schools that teach specific skills (many of which become obsolete as 
technology changes), DeVry's curriculum focuses on teaching students how to reason. In 
many ways, DeVry offers the liberal-arts version of a technical education: students learn 
how to solve technical problems. They are drilled thoroughly on the basics, and required 
to spend countless hours in the lab to build an educational foundation. On exams, 
students are rarely asked straight-forward mathematical questions; instead, they are 
usually given detailed descriptions of real-world problems, including information they 
must recognize as extraneous. Dean claims that this education prepares students to 
operate efficiently in the business world. Furthermore, teachers will fail students whose 
lab reports are not written in proper English, regardless of the experiment's outcome. 
DeVry doesn't shortchange the humanities, because these non-technical abilities will be 
vital to the students' careers. Alumni routinely tell Dean that the technical skills get them 
hired and the reasoning skills get them promoted.</P>
<P>	 A student with a grade point average below a "C" is placed on academic 
probation, and prohibited from taking a relaxed schedule. If the student's g.p.a. remains 
below a "C" average the following semester, he or she is expelled. Every year, 20 percent 
of the student body flunks out. DeVry does not pamper its students en route to the 
diploma. "We have hard classes, but if that is not met with enough commitment to be 
successful, then it is detrimental to this company for that student to stay," Keller says. 
Huening's class is a perfect example: of the 325 students who started, only 94 graduated 
on time.</P> 
<P>	Just as auto manufacturers are constantly reviewing the efficiency of their cars, 
DeVry maintains strict quality control. About a decade ago, DeVry was reviewing each 
course every three years, which was considered swift compared to traditional schools. 
Now it rewrites each course at least once a year. During the summer term, faculty 
members visit hundreds of employers across the nation and find out what their needs will 
be in five to 10 years. Together with information offered by industry leaders on DeVry's 
dozen or so curriculum-advisory boards, the school sets new course requirements. For 
instance, a few years ago most computer-programming courses only taught a 
programming language called COBOL, but professors noted that firms near some of their 
campuses were switching from mainframes to desktop-based systems that require C 
language. After DeVry adjusted its curriculum, businesses responded by hiring more of 
its graduates. Although industry does not dictate DeVry's curriculum, the school must 
measure success and failure by its placement rate.</P>
<P>	The institute's educational audit is exhaustive. DeVry's central headquarters 
evaluates randomly selected writing samples from students on every campus twice a year 
in order to ensure that writing skills remain high. The institute also administers 
standardized tests in electronics to be certain that technical skills are not dropping. 
Finally, administrators also investigate courses with unusual grade distribution.</P>
<P>	The best evidence of the quality of DeVry's curriculum is the on-the-job success 
of its graduates. Bill Buglewicz, a senior manufacturing manager at KLA Instruments, 
recruits at six of the campuses every year. "DeVry students have a great work ethic, 
higher motivation, and initiative," Buglewicz says. "The courseload, in particular the 
exhaustive lab work, makes them wonderful thinkers and troubleshooters."</P> 
<P>	Gary Nuzzi, a 1983 graduate, says the lab work helped him and 1963 graduate 
Bill Blethen develop a revolutionary lighting system that won an Academy Award for 
technical achievement last year. The portable strobe light allows movie cameras to 
capture detail at high speed. "The education was, at times, very challenging, but very 
practical," Nuzzi adds.</P> 

<H3>The Bottom Line</H3>
<P>	Most remarkable, however, is that DeVry makes a profit. By defining its mission 
narrowly, the school has perfected its product and minimized waste. DeVry's cost-saving 
efforts are immediately evident. There are no ivy-laden academic halls or rolling greens. 
Rather, each DeVry campus holds its classes in an office building that is usually 
surrounded by a parking lot. In such a modern facility, little space is wasted, maintenance 
costs are moderate, and classrooms can accommodate professors from various 
departments. And the school runs three cycles of classes--morning, afternoon, and 
evening--to use the space more efficiently. The institute does not own any dormitories. 
Instead, DeVry leases housing near its campuses from local landlords and sublets it to the 
students at a modest profit.</P>
<P>	DeVry also holds down costs by maintaining a narrow academic focus. DeVry 
does not fund any sports teams or clubs that are not directly related to job placement; on 
some campuses, students independently run intramural leagues by securing outside 
sponsors. "We are not trying to be all things to all people," says Kathy Perdue, head of 
the accounting department at the Atlanta campus. "We figured out what we do best, 
concentrating on the academics to get jobs, not filling social needs."</P>
<P>	The school does not grant tenure to any of its professors, allowing it to respond 
quickly to fluctuating enrollments. Moreover, DeVry is not a research or publishing 
institution, so faculty members carry teaching loads two to three times that of other 
college professors. Finally, since the school operates at full capacity, even in the 
summers, professors are expected to work as they would in private industry: year-round.
<P>	DeVry maximizes tuition revenue by actively recruiting students through 
television and newspaper advertising, direct mail, and recruiters. A traveling sales force 
of 200 visits high schools and Army bases throughout North America, while another 100 
salespeople respond to applicants who call DeVry in response to advertising. DeVry's 
$15-million advertising campaign promotes its focus on careers, profiling graduates with 
senior positions in prominent companies like Coca-Cola.</P>
<P>	The individual cost-saving measures add up. The price tag of a DeVry education 
is $6,015 for two semesters, or $26,730 for the complete degree. By comparison, a four-
year degree at public, non-research universities in the same states where DeVry operates 
costs much more in tuition and taxpayer subsidies: $40,148 in California, for instance, 
and $35,440 in Georgia.</P>
<P>	As an accredited school, DeVry participates in all the same financial aid programs 
as public schools. DeVry's loan default rate is 17 percent--better than many for-profit 
trade schools and far below the government's intervention zone of 25 to 30 percent. 
Industry analysts note that the institute's job placement record and bachelor's degree 
program distinguishes it from trade schools.</P>
<P>	For-profit schools such as DeVry are a model for the future of university 
education. As more adults return to school later in life, they will find they prefer the no-
nonsense DeVry degree, which can be finished in three years. Currently the average age 
of DeVry students is 26. In addition, the number of high-school graduates is expected to 
keep rising through 2013. Combine that statistic with downsizing in the military, for-
profit education's top rival for high-school graduates, and DeVry seems to enjoy a rosy 
outlook. In fact, the results are already beginning to show: Enrollment was up 4 percent 
this year, and the company added two new campuses. "Frankly, the demand is growing 
quicker than our ability to supply it," says Norman Levine, DeVry's chief financial 
officer. And two other for-profit college-education companies announced initial public 
offerings this year.</P>
<P>	Despite DeVry's proven track record in securing jobs for working-class students, 
bureaucrats may prevent the school from expanding. In New York City, for example, the 
state's department of education has not yet approved DeVry's 1993 accreditation 
application. Once the department okays the school's academic standards, government 
analysts will determine DeVry's impact on established local schools. Every college in 
New York City will be invited to comment on DeVry's entrance into the market. If area 
schools fear DeVry will steal students from their tuition rolls, they can urge the 
department to reject the application. The Education Department's Bureau of Planning will 
also analyze whether the local job market can accommodate the future DeVry graduates. 
Department officials note that, due to understaffing, it normally takes several years for a 
school's 300-page application to be approved.</P>
<P>	Even skeptics of for-profit education concede that public schools and private non-
profits are unable to expand to meet the growing demand. Public universities would 
require greater tax subsidies to support a larger student base, and private non-profits 
would have to raise even more through alumni giving. "Time and time again, we have 
seen that the healthiest and best systems in the world involve private enterprise 
competing," says Keller. "We're the future of education."</P>

We must restore a balance between citizen and police responsibilities, [for] effective social control cannot possibly be achieved by hired hands alone.
</blockquote><p>

-- Herman Goldstein, <i>Policing a Free Society
</i><p>
	Americans live in fear. We live in the most criminally violent times in our nation's history. The level of street crime is between three and four times what it was in 1960, and the rate of violent crimes quadrupled between 1966 and 1990. People no longer feel safe walking to the corner store or letting their kids bike to the local park.
<p>	In healthy communities, individuals establish and enforce codes of conduct, both formal and informal. Litterers get a lecture. Speeders get yelled at. Unruly youths get a tongue-lashing. But in unhealthy communities, the fear of crime keeps people shut up in their homes (especially the elderly), cuts off commercial activity, alienates individuals from each other, and surrenders the streets to the very kind of disorderly activity that fuels crime in the first place. Community is eroded, and because individuals are afraid to maintain order, the community loses its lawful environment.
<p>	Until neighborhoods are safe again, they will not thrive economically or socially. Waiting for the government to make it all better is a losing strategy. People have to become more involved in ensuring their own security.
<p>	It is said that for every complex problem, there is a simple and elegant solution that is wrong. For crime, the simple answer is, "We need more cops and we need more prisons." Though extremely popular right now with politicians, this approach will ultimately do little to improve public safety. The best police force in the world cannot make safe a community in which people have no regard for the lives or property of others. Without question, swift and sure punishment of criminal activity is an important component of an effective crime policy. But the best defense against crime is not a thin, blue line, but a community of individuals respectful of others. 
<p>	There is a great deal that the government can and should do to improve public safety, but first it must recognize that it needs help. Restoring public safety demands a renewed partnership between the police and the community. Police must reacquaint themselves with the people in the communities they serve, and communities must recognize that the brunt of the task of policing a free society does not lie with the police, but with citizens themselves.
<p>
<b>Community Policing</b><p>
	From the time of America's founding, law enforcement has had a strong neighborhood foundation. In the early years of the Republic, male citizens in large U.S. cities were required to stand watch at night with no pay. Throughout most of America's history, in fact, citizens were expected to police their communities themselves -- at least part time -- as they went about their daily lives. The job of police officers was to support the community in keeping the peace.
<p>	Alexis de Tocqueville, who was particularly impressed by this, wrote, "In America, the means available to the authorities for the discovery of crimes and arrest of criminals are few. . . . Nevertheless, I doubt whether in any other country crime so seldom escapes punishment. . . . During my stay in the United States I have seen the inhabitants of a country where a serious crime had been committed spontaneously forming committees with the object of catching the criminal and handing him over to the courts. In Europe the criminal is a luckless man fighting to save his head from the authorities. In America he is an enemy of the human race and every human being is against him."
<p>	Direct community involvement doesn't mean vigilantes stringing up violators. Urban anthropologist Jane Jacobs explains, "The first thing to understand is that the public space -- the sidewalk and street peace -- of cities is not kept primarily by the police, necessary as police are. Rather, it is kept by an intricate, almost unconscious, network of voluntary controls and standards established and enforced by the people themselves."
<p>	Except in extremely small geographic areas, it is not economically possible to put a cop on every corner. No police department is large enough -- nor should it be -- to serve as an occupying army. A community must police itself. There is no way that New York City's 37,000 police officers can control the city's 7.5 million residents. The police are there to help. For much of America's history, this was understood.
<p>	In the 1960s, however, the public began to forget its role in controlling crime and grew increasingly dependent on the police. Police departments became more professionalized and shifted their primary mission from peacekeeping to crime fighting. Rather than regular beats, foot patrols, and informal pressure on the unruly, police forces increasingly used motorized patrols, radio dispatch, and rapid response as their main tools. In the terminology of television culture, the "Andy of Mayberry" model was replaced by the "One-Adam-Twelve" approach. 
<p>	Americans began to think of crimefighting as the job of police. The riots of the 1960s showed in violent detail how America's historic partnership between police and community had broken down. Police officers -- often in squad cars or behind desks at headquarters -- were spending more time with other officers than with citizens. The new policing methods had the effect of divorcing them from the community. The divorce was mutual: Many communities stopped policing themselves. <p>
	This alienation left everyone worse off. Americans are more dissatisfied with their police departments than ever before, and the police are straining under the weight of massive problems they are powerless to handle alone. 
<p>	Swift and sure punishment for criminals is important, but we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that the courts can make us safe, any more than the police can. We will never really get a hold on crime in America until we move back to a society where kids in trouble can be turned around before they get in more trouble and are sent away to prisons to become hardened criminals. "The total impacts [of public policy on crime] are not going to be that great in a free society," says James Q. Wilson. "A free society depends on the conscience and reputations of individuals and the social norms of communities to maintain order. That is what has collapsed in America."
<p>	To use an analogy from the manufacturing world, we can't afford to depend on an outside referee to detect and fix the defective products of our society; far better to create a system that isn't producing so many defects in the first place. From this perspective, product quality is no longer the exclusive responsibility of the inspectors in the quality department; rather, it's everyone's concern. Families come first, police and courts follow.
<p>	With its emphasis on crime prevention, community policing can be a part of the total picture. "We currently see ourselves as feeding the criminal-justice system," says police chief Daryl Stephens of St. Petersburg, Florida. "What if we saw our primary responsibility as starving it?"
<P>	At its heart, neighborhood policing recreates the partnership between the police and the community. In essence, the police tell the community, "We will help you do your job." Variations of the idea are being introduced all over the country, from Jacksonville to Madison to Seattle.
<p>	For community policing to work, the neighborhoods have to be willing to help themselves. Explains San Diego police officer Jim Coleman, "It is not the teacher's fault, it's not the police officer's fault, it's not the court's fault. The community has to recognize it has a responsibility for governing its own value standards. . . . People choose the way they want to live, and police can't remove that responsibility. The police can't come in and restore order if the community doesn't raise its own value standard."
<p>	San Diego has led the nation in embracing a partnership with neighborhood groups, citizen patrols, and volunteer "officers" (see <a href="#sandiego">sidebar</a>). To be sure, in America's toughest communities, where neighborhood control has been overrun by gangs, drug dealers, and a general sense of lawlessness, community policing of the San Diego model may not be enough. Community policing works best in the communities still controlled by law-abiding residents, not criminals. In the neighborhoods where criminals now hold sway, cops will be needed to help law-abiding citizens -- a majority in even the worst inner-city neighborhoods -- regain control and come out from behind their locked doors to augment the police presence. In the long run, however, community members themselves must take responsibility for making their neighborhoods unfriendly to criminals.
<p>
<b>Street Patrols
</b><p>	A key component of community policing is getting more cops back on the neighborhood beat. "Beat integrity," the practice of charging a small group of officers with responsibility for a small area, has hardly been seen since the 1950s. Patrols can be conducted on foot, on bike, in a car, or some combination of these. The beat system increases the connection between law-abiding citizens and the police and gives citizens opportunities to express their concerns. 
<p>	This sense of connection is evident in the community policing of officer Mike Elder, whose beat for the last two years has been a three-square-mile, lower-middle-class area on Indianapolis's south side. Elder's beat includes numerous vacant lots, some boarded-up buildings, and two of the city's worst public-housing projects. As in many cities, Indianapolis's urban sprawl makes it impractical for Elder to patrol his entire beat on foot. However, he makes up for this by spending a good part of each day walking around the housing projects and the neighborhood parks, checking in with store owners, and maintaining open office hours at his field office in the Clearstream housing project.<p>
	Elder is a reassuring presence to public-housing residents tired of living in fear. Before Elder set up shop at Clearstream, says one resident, "there would be gunfights in the project in the middle of the street in broad daylight." Another Clearstream resident, a single mother, says, "Before Mike came in, I wouldn't dare let my kids play outdoors because of the shootings and drug deals going down at all hours of the day and night. People living in projects want a normal life, too -- and we're getting there." After Elder started his beat, the number of service calls from the Clearstream projects to the police dropped from 1,500 in 1991 to 550 in 1993.<p>
	With an intense awareness of the neighborhood, community-based officers can stop crimes before they happen. The officer on the beat hears gossip from casual, informal contact with people. Elder knows most of the residents at his two housing projects. He can count on a dozen or so residents in each project to keep him informed of impending trouble by calling him on his beeper. If any drug dealing is taking place or any strangers are causing trouble, he'll know within a day.
<p>	Assigning officers to regular beats and emphasizing problem-solving can also prompt residents of troubled minority areas to look more favorably on the men and women in blue. Before Elder was assigned to their beat, residents of Clearstream didn't much trust the police. Residents only saw cops when they were responding to incidents, and viewed them as outsiders. With steady contact, Elder has built a relationship of trust. "If we tried to take Elder out of that beat, the residents would be marching on city hall within hours," jokes Michael Beaver, Indianapolis's director of public safety.
<p>	Most cops loathe beat patrols. Many police officers -- particularly those in middle management -- would prefer the safety of their desk jobs over venturing out onto the streets. Hitting the pavement is seen as a demotion by veteran cops, many of whom have worked hard to get off the beat and win an assignment to a specialty unit or to administrative work. 
<p>	Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler learned the hard way that the opposition to community policing can be intense. When he was elected in 1992, just one cop worked foot patrol in Jersey City; Schundler wanted 300. The force hardly embraced the idea. "Comfortable jobs in all city departments were given as a reward for political service and loyalty," wrote Schundler in <i>Policy Review</i> (Summer 1994). "The patronage system has made assignments to street patrol intolerable."<p>
	The new mayor found himself battling with Jersey City's police union. When Schundler learned that two police officers spent their days delivering interoffice mail, he had them reassigned to street patrol. The police union filed a lawsuit to prevent the move, citing a contract clause that states: "Police work cannot be diminished except through contract negotiation." Like most people, Schundler can't understand how having officers patrol the street diminishes police work. He is fighting the suit.
<p>	Schundler cites union contracts -- supported by state arbitration rules -- as his biggest barrier to successful policing. "Our crime problem is not the result of our spending too little on policing," he says, "but rather of our getting too little policing for our money -- and the root cause of this problem is non-local government interference in police department management."
<p>
<b>Combating Disorder
</b>

<p>	Many urban areas are marked by evidence of physical decay: boarded-up buildings, vacant lots strewn with litter, and graffiti-covered walls. This sense of community despair creates an aura of lawlessness that encourages criminal behavior.
<p>	In a 1982 <i>Atlantic Monthly</i> article titled "Broken Windows," James Q. Wilson and George Kelling argued that disorder in a community, if left uncorrected, undercuts residents' own efforts to maintain their homes and neighborhoods and control unruly behavior. "If a window in a building is broken and left unrepaired," they wrote, "all the rest of the windows will soon be broken. . . . One unrepaired window is a signal that no one cares, so breaking more windows costs nothing. . . . Untended property becomes fair game for people out for fun or plunder."
<p>	If disorder goes unchecked, a vicious cycle begins. First, it kindles a fear of crime among residents, who respond by staying behind locked doors. Their involvement in the neighborhood declines; people begin to ignore rowdy and threatening behavior in public. They cease to exercise social regulation over little things like litter on the street, loitering strangers, or truant schoolchildren. When law-abiding eyes stop watching the streets, the social order breaks down and criminals move in.
<p>	"Stable neighborhoods can change in a few months to jungles," declare Wilson and Kelling. Disorder also can have dire economic consequences. Shoppers will shun an area they perceive as being "out of control." One study analyzing crime in 30 different areas found that the level of disorder of a neighborhood -- more than such factors as income level, resident turnover, or racial makeup -- was the best indicator of an area's lack of safety.
<p>	For decades, most big-city police departments have devoted little effort to combating disorder. By allowing an accumulation of small infractions, this neglect creates an environment that generates big infractions.
<p>	The community-policing movement is beginning to change this. Community policing emphasizes giving neighborhoods a greater say in determining police priorities, a surefire way to bringing issues of physical and social disorder to the top of the police agenda. An important part of a community patrol officer's job is enforcing a community's norms of tolerable behavior and order. Beat officers can't impose their personal rules on a community, but they can help a community maintain its own standards. "You have to be given the latitude to enforce the laws in different ways in different communities," says Indianapolis's Elder.
<p>	Although calls for order maintenance have historically been associated mostly with white middle- and upper-class neighborhoods, today some of the loudest voices are coming from poor minority communities. Says Ace Backus, a Milwaukee community organizer, "In the nice white communities don't be drunk on the street, don't be throwing down litter, the cops will stop you. In the middle of the black ghetto you can do that and the police will drive past. It's reverse discrimination."
<p>
<b>Problems, Not Symptoms 
</b>

<p>	Conventional policing is incident-driven: A citizen calls 911 to report a crime and then the police show up. Much of the time, all officers can do at this point is take a report. By reacting to crime rather than trying to prevent crime, police treat only the symptoms, not the root causes of problems. The key to improving New York's subway was the emphasis on preemptive problem solving, an example of what policing experts refer to as "problem-oriented policing" (see <a href="#subway">sidebar</a>).
<P>	Former San Diego Police Chief Bob Burgreen frames the issue this way: "Random patrol duty is little better than sleeping on duty."
<p>	In one large city, for example, a trucking company had 32 trailers burglarized in less than 18 months. A predictable routine developed: The owner would report the crime, the police would visit the yard, take a statement, and then wait for the next call from the owner. In desperation, the owner finally threatened to move his $13-million company out of the city unless something was done to stop the stream of break-ins. 
<p>	This prompted the police department to abandon business as usual. An outside consultant was brought in, and police soon determined that the physical layout of the trucking yard was encouraging the break-ins. The officers talked the owner into improving the lighting and raising the fence. Police then worked with other city agencies to erect a barricade between the truck yard and the adjacent vacant city property that was being used as an escape route. Problem solved.
<p>	Some level of problem-solving occurs in every police department, but it is typically done in a haphazard fashion. San Diego is alone in making problem-solving a focal point of each police officer's daily duties. Because it depends on identifying recurring patterns of disruptive activity, problem-oriented policing depends on good information. 
<p>	San Diego's crime analysis unit has set up a sophisticated computer tracking system that officers can tap into to get information on 60 types of problems, previous attempts to solve specific problems, and recurrent problems in different geographical areas. While problem-solving gives police officers some tools and the analytical framework for approaching community safety problems, community involvement is still a key component. "There are no long-term solutions to problems unless the community is involved," says Nancy McPherson, formerly the city's neighborhood-policing coordinator.
<p>	As already noted, people tend to equate the frequency of crime in an area with how the external environment "looks" and "feels." Visible disorder sends warning signals to our brains of impending danger. Disorder is a sign that the social mechanisms of control that characterize healthy neighborhoods have broken down, which in turn encourages lawlessness. To build safer neighborhoods, individuals and communities must exercise control of the physical environment in which they live. 
<p>
<b>Empowering Landlords
</b><p>

 	Police officers appreciate the role that landlords can play in keeping a neighborhood strong and safe. Historically, landlords in low-income, working-class neighborhoods adhered to the neighborhood's set of norms and refused to rent to individuals who, in the landlord's judgment, would not be a positive force in the neighborhood. This is because landlords, for economic reasons, desire essentially the same thing as neighbors do for social reasons: responsible and conscientious tenants who will respect the property of others.
<p>	In recent years, government regulations, civil-rights laws, and court rulings have made it almost impossible for landlords to turn away dubious renters or to evict destructive tenants from their apartments. The unintended consequence? Many working-class neighborhoods have been ripped apart by rental units that become crack houses.
<p>	Giving homeowners control of their property can help reduce crime. Almost by accident, the city of Milwaukee came up with a simple yet effective way for government to assist, instead of frustrate, landlords who want to maintain neighborhood norms. Marty Collins, a 15-year city employee, was looking for a way to improve the city's drug-addiction prevention program. Knowing that most drug dealing in Milwaukee occurred out of rental properties, Collins reasoned that the only people that really could control the situation are the landlords. 
<p>	Collins surveyed Milwaukee landlords and found that 70 percent of them reported having had destructive tenants at one time or another, yet virtually no landlords were using tenant screening techniques. Why not? "For fear of getting their butts sued," says Collins. Milwaukee's landlords were largely unaware that legal methods were available to enable them to discriminate against prospective tenants with destructive histories. By taking simple precautions, such as requiring favorable recommendations from previous owners, running a credit check, and visiting the current home of prospective renters, homeowners can eliminate the bad apples and help keep their neighborhoods safe.
<p>	Most landlords were also unaware of three Milwaukee companies that provide a listing of all tenants who have been previously evicted from rental properties. Milwaukee now informs all landlords how to be more discriminating.
<p>	While Milwaukee deserves credit for giving landlords the legal leverage they need to protect their property, the city sometimes goes too far in holding landlords responsible for the actions of their tenants. If police receive two complaints about drug dealing at a rented property, Milwaukee undercover police will attempt a drug buy. If successful, the city sends a notice to the landlord instructing him or her to take actions to stop the property from being used for drug dealing. If the problem persists, the city takes the landlord to court and can ask for the property to be forfeited. 
<p>	In essence, Milwaukee is asking the landlord to control their tenants' behavior or risk losing their property. Empowering landlords by allowing them to choose to whom they will and will not rent is one thing. Asking them to be responsible for the actions of their renters is quite another. Providing landlords with the legal assistance to screen and evict disruptive tenants is a step in the right direction, but we shouldn't expect landlords to act as chaperones for their tenants.
<p>	This trend toward relying on landlords to discipline tenants is ironic, for in many cases the most irresponsible landlord of all is the government. Much of the worst crime in America takes place in or around government housing projects. When Reuben Greenberg became the police chief of Charleston, South Carolina, in 1982, he thought it ludicrous that the government routinely rented units to the lowliest criminals of society. "No other landlord has to rent to child molesters, robbers, rapists, and arsonists. Why should people in public housing have to live with them?" asked Greenberg.
<p>	Working with city housing authorities, Greenberg set out to make the city's public housing the last place criminals would dare to set up shop. Prospective tenants were screened for criminal records. Tenants who engaged in illegal behavior were swiftly evicted. Through mostly common-sense measures that any sensible landlord would take, Charleston's public housing projects are now "the safest places to live in Charleston," says department spokesman Charles Francis.
<p>
<b>Closing off Streets</b>
<p>	Americans like to control their space. With their long driveways, high walls, and security systems, wealthier neighborhoods have never been known for their accessibility to outsiders. Wealthy city-dwellers have "doormen" that provide security for their apartment buildings. Middle-class suburbs have their own ways of discouraging strangers, including myriad cul-de-sacs and white picket fences. Residential community associations (RCAs) have taken the concept of designing for safety one step further. The typical RCA has walls, gates, cul-de-sacs, security systems, and an endless series of speed bumps. 
<p> 	In contrast, poor city neighborhoods are typically laid out in a grid format. "By allowing for lots of through traffic, grids compromise a neighborhood's integrity," says Judy Butler, the city of Houston's neighborhood coordinator. The grid format, while pleasing to city traffic engineers, makes neighborhoods susceptible to drive-by shootings and random through-traffic. 
<p> 	While some criticize the suburbs and RCAs for having a "fortress mentality," these communities provide residents with the security they desire, providing physical barriers that give people greater control over their living environment. These barriers not only keep strangers out, they mark the physical boundaries that define communities.
<p>	"Why not try to redesign the urban area to recapture the quality of life in the suburbs?" asks Oscar Newman, a city planner and architect. Newman is the country's leading expert on and proponent of creating "defensible space" in urban neighborhoods by closing off streets. Street closures, Newman has found, give residents greater control over the security of their neighborhood. Closures also broadcast a distinct message to potential criminals: This community is profoundly serious about deterring crime and anti-social behavior.
<p>	St. Louis has a long tradition of street closures. Beginning in the late 19th century, many streets in the wealthiest neighborhoods were deeded to residents instead of the city. Each of the streets was represented by an association that often also owned the sewers and water mains. At the time, St. Louis had shoddy public services, so the private streets were a way of attracting homebuyers by assuring them of reliable services such as water supply and street lighting.
<p>	In the 1950s, St. Louis was in decline. Crime was rising, property values were falling, and much of the middle class was fleeing to the safer and cleaner suburbs. Left behind were poorer residents, less likely to be homeowners and more likely to be transient. To stop the flight of middle-class homeowners out of the city, the city began to revive its private street program. Neighborhoods of all income levels were allowed and encouraged to petition the city to convert their public streets to private ownership. Many middle-class neighborhoods took the city's offer: They formed homeowner associations, put up gates, and assumed the costs and responsibilities of maintaining the streets themselves. 
<p>	Since the mid-1970s, more than 1,000 St. Louis streets have been closed off and privatized. By making these neighborhoods more distinct, street closures have made it easier to identify intruders and keep out unwanted visitors. The result: lower crime rates and higher property values compared to adjacent neighborhoods, according to Newman. It also has made the neighborhoods more cohesive, as they become safe places for children to play and conduits for social activity. "With traffic flow limited to an occasional moving car, the street has become an extension of the front yards of the abutting houses: an area where children play and adults can meet and socialize," writes Newman. Street closures can restore the balance between mobility for cars and livability for residents. 
<p>	Until recently, St. Louis was about the only city that made use of street closures in urban settings. But the increasing levels of crime, gang activity, and drive-by shootings throughout urban America are prompting other cities to experiment with street closures. Cities as diverse as Dallas, Chicago, Houston, Dayton, and Fort Lauderdale are aggressively closing off streets. Though St. Louis is unique in allowing a transfer of ownership to residents, these urban enclaves are proving an effective way for a community to regain control of its environment.
<p>	Dayton, Ohio, is home to one of the country's most ambitious street-closure experiments. Like many aging urban communities, Five Oaks, an integrated, lower-middle-class neighborhood in Dayton, found itself in decline. Homeowners were leaving, rental properties were poorly maintained, and drug dealers and prostitutes had set up shop. Located near the freeway, Five Oaks was an ideal location for crack houses. Experts predicted that within two years much of the neighborhood would be a disaster area.
<p>	In 1992, desperate neighborhood leaders turned to street closures. The city called in Oscar Newman to assist. A year later, 34 streets and 26 alleys were closed off in Five Oaks. Neighborhood residents divided Five Oaks into ten mini-neighborhoods to enable law-abiding residents to confront the problems in their immediate area.
<p>	Only a year after the streets were closed, substantial improvement was visible. Cut-through traffic, previously a big problem in the neighborhood, fell by two-thirds. Automobile accidents and traffic speed levels also declined dramatically. After dropping the previous two years, housing sales surged 55 percent, while the average purchase price of a home increased 15 percent. Violent crime was cut in half; overall crime plunged by 26 percent. Most importantly, Five Oaks residents felt much safer and in control of their immediate surroundings. "I have four little kids," said one neighborhood homeowner. "My kids can now play out in the yard. It's been a blessing for my family."
<p>
<b>Reclaiming Public Parks</b> 
<p>	Another problem of "space" in many cities (and some suburbs too) are local parks. Instead of serving as a place for kids to play and families to picnic, many parks have become gathering places for gangs and drug dealers. Instead of serving as a common area that knits the community together, many neighborhood parks are tearing communities apart. 
<p>	City officials refer to such parks as "orphan" parks because there is no real or perceived "ownership" of the park, and so no one takes care of it. City hall cannot possibly provide the same level of attention as the people who use the park every day. Local involvement is needed to make small parks a positive force in the neighborhood; only neighborhood residents, the people who use the park, can provide this. 
<p>	The inspiring story of San Antonio's Lee's Creek Park proves the point. "It's not every 41-year old that can leave a legacy for his children," says San Antonian Bill Lucas as he looks over the plans for Lee's Creek Park, a project that engrossed him for over a year. Lucas does not work for the city planning or recreation department -- he is a sales manager for Bekins Moving Systems. <p>
	Donated by the Lee family to the city, the park is located in a declining area of the city with swelling gang problems. After 10 years, it was still little more than a vacant lot. Then along came Bill Lucas and the local chapter of Optimist Club International, the 75-year-old "friends of youth" organization. In conjunction with around 35 neighborhood families, the Optimist Club transformed the weed-infested vacant lot into a thriving community parkwithout the aid of taxpayer money. Creating Lee's Creek Park was a true volunteer effort. A bridge over the creek was a gift from an Optimist Club member in memory of his wife. A running track was donated by a construction company. The sweat to clear the lot and plant the trees was contributed by neighborhood residents and even some nonresidents, including Mrs. Lee herself. "All we are doing is recreating in a small way neighborhood involvement like it was in the 1800s in America when people used to pitch in and help build their neighbors' houses and barns," says Lucas.<p>
	When the park was finished it was turned back over to the city, which agreed to maintain it. Lucas is confident the park will not fall victim to "orphan park" syndrome. "Our idea is for the neighbors to create ownership opportunities for themselves," he said. To do so, ownership committees were created and vested with control of certain blocked out sections of the park that they are responsible for beautifying and maintaining. The sense of ownership is critical. "If the park were given to us we wouldn't respect it," says Lucas. "We can see it in our own children. Make them earn it, and they own it." 
<p>	Turning over partial ownership or management of city parks to nonprofit groups and neighborhood associations is often the best way to ensure they remain a public asset. New York City's Neighborhood Open Space Coalition has assumed control of hundreds of abandoned lots and parks in this way, turning many dangerous eyesores into gardens. Nearly one-fourth of the city's nearly 1,500 public parks are now cared for by community associations under the Operation Green Thumb program.
<p>	Private groups usually have more success ensuring the park is in constant use, which is the key to keeping a park safe. The nonprofit Central Park Conservancy has raised more than $100 million for New York City's Central Park since its founding in 1980. It has taken over the care of trees, lawns, and plants and provides more than half of the park's operating costs. By 1989, 72 percent of Central Park users said the park felt safer after the conservancy got involved. Crime dropped 59 percent and robberies plummeted 73 percent. The drop in crime is attributed to the large increase in park activities put on by the conservancy. Good uses drove out the bad uses.
<p>
<b>Crisis Point</b> 
<p>	What is the future of public safety in America? One possibility is that we will continue to ask police to attempt the impossible: To create safe communities without the communities' help. Under this scenario, there will be more cops, more prisons -- and more crime.
<p>	The other possibility is more appealing. We can learn from America's most innovative public-safety models -- San Diego's problem-oriented, neighborhood policing; New York's subway-disorder reduction; Milwaukee's landlord empowerment policies; and Dayton's Five Oaks street closures -- to develop a new vision of policing America's neighborhoods and downtowns where police departments are closer to the communities they serve and citizens and communities take a more active role in protecting their safety. 
<p>	Under this scenario, America could see a future with fewer police and more security. We are fast approaching a crisis point in our country as crime and fear of crime paralyze our nation. How we respond will go a long way in determining what we become as a nation.

<a name="sandiego"></a><b>San Diego's Trailblazing Example (sidebar)</b>

<p>	Community policing demands that both police and citizens accept responsibilities. The community's contribution can take many forms, from setting up community watches and getting landlords to screen potential renters to cleaning up vacant lots, reporting suspicious behavior, and making sure teenagers don't roam the streets. If citizens don't take responsibility for the safety of their own community, the police can do little to help. 
<p>	San Diego's bold effort to involve citizens in public safety is unheard of among big cities. One San Diego official related this story: "I told a group of our officers that we were planning to have civilian volunteers take crime reports and collect evidence in cases of petty thefts. About three-quarters of them were nodding their heads, saying, 'Yeah, that makes sense.' If I tried that in New York or Chicago, they'd laugh me out of the room."
<p>	At San Diego's Eastern Division police headquarters, a group gathers around a conference table regularly to discuss better ways to patrol a certain neighborhood. But these blue-shirted peacekeepers aren't police officers. They are gray-haired volunteers of the Retired Senior Volunteer Patrol (RSVP), a major component of San Diego's commitment to neighborhood policing. 
<p>	"The partnership between the community and our department really works," says police captain Dan Berglund. In addition to 272 sworn officers, Berglund's division relies on 115 senior volunteers, 20 reserves, and 40 other resident volunteers. "Their influence in their own community has been extremely beneficial," says Berglund. 
<p>	Neighborhood policing requires a fundamental change in the department's operating philosophy. The police shift their attention from rapid response to putting more officers out on regular beats, where they can help the community solve public-safety problems. Neighborhood policing also entails much greater use of volunteers and soliciting the concerns of the citizens. In the language of Tom Peters, neighborhood policing means "getting close to the customer." 
<p>	San Diego uses volunteers in a wide range of nonconfrontational situations, such as towing cars, collecting evidence (including fingerprinting), and checking on the homes of absent neighbors. Instead of assigning a uniformed officer to spend, say, 45 minutes writing a report for a petty theft, San Diego uses volunteers trained at the police academy. This frees up officers for problems that require their special skills. "So long as volunteers are given meaningful work, and welcomed as a partner in the process, I will have an unlimited number of people in any community in this city to do that," Berglund said. 
<p>	The SDPD is unusual in its openness to citizen input and volunteer assistance. Admittedly, San Diego is blessed with many retirees. Although it's the sixth-largest city in America, San Diego's police force has a small-town feel. In most big cities, powerful police unions would oppose the use of community volunteers for police work. But San Diego welcomes them. 
<p>	This tolerant culture, which took years to develop, is due partly to Police Chief Jerry Sanders's deep commitment to community policing. San Diego is the first large city to adopt a department-wide approach to community policing. Nearly every SDPD police officer belongs to a team assigned to a discrete geographical area and charged with developing a close relationship with that neighborhood. "We are using persuasion rather than coercion to get people on board," says Nancy McPherson, who served as San Diego's neighborhood-policing coordinator before moving on to the Seattle police department.
<P>	Police departments customarily resist community policing because cops fear they will become social workers rather than crimefighters. The department dispelled that idea early on. After getting to know the residents on their beat, two San Diego cops trained in neighborhood problem-solving learned that a gang had taken over a particular section of an apartment complex. Through close relations with the building's law-abiding residents, they gathered the evidence needed to obtain search warrants. The bust that followed -- complete with SWAT teams and swarms of patrol cars -- put an end to the worry that neighborhood policing was soft on crime.

<p>

<a name="subway"></a><b>New York City's Subway (sidebar)</b><p>

	For years litter, graffiti, vagrants, and panhandlers had been turning New York City's subway into a vaguely sinister netherworld. The transit agency's first reaction to this problem was standard public-sector misjudgment: Add more "inputs." Additional police officers were assigned to patrol the transit system. The results were unimpressive, and riders remained frightened.
<p>	In the mid-1980s, David Gunn, the new transit authority president, decided to wage a war on the graffiti that covered nearly every square foot of every city subway car. Vast amounts of time and money had already been invested in increasing patrols and surveillance to reduce graffiti -- to no avail. Regardless of how many "taggers" were caught, there were always more. The overburdened courts never gave taggers more than stern lectures.<p>
	A deeper analysis of the graffiti problem revealed that taggers got a thrill from viewing their markings on future trips. Denied the satisfaction of beholding their "art," Gunn figured, many taggers would simply stop. He made the removal of graffiti from subway cars a top priority. The strategy worked. On May 12, 1989, five years after the launch of the Clean Car Program, the last of the graffiti-covered cars was removed from service. The Big Apple's notorious subway cars were among the cleanest in the world.<p>
	But removing the graffiti only solved part of the problem. New Yorkers still feared the disorderly people who always seemed to be hanging around the subway.
<p>	In 1990, the city hired William Bratton (now the city's police commissioner) as the new chief of transit police. "We understood early on that the problems of crime, disorder, and fare evasion were deeply interrelated," Bratton says, "and that therefore we would have to form a coherent strategy to deal with them." Bratton discovered that fare-jumpers not only cost the transit system more than $120 million a year in income, but also committed much of the crime and unruly behavior in the subway. He organized plainclothes "sweep teams" of four to six officers to catch fare-evaders. Says Bratton, "The sweeps produced some interesting results. One of every six fare-evaders we stopped either was carrying a weapon or was wanted for another crime on an outstanding warrant. That was an incredibly high statistic, and it made us realize that by fighting fare evasion, we were also making an impact on crime."
<p>	At the same time, Bratton set out to reduce the intimidating behavior of panhandlers and homeless people in the subways. Monthly ejections from the subway went from 2,000 to 16,000. In Bratton's first two years, the number of felonies in the subway fell 30 percent.

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.  
<p>

<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>

is considered along with wage

<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.  This occurs because higher-income groups receive a greater share of their earnings from capital income, which is exempt under the flat tax.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government
<p>

<hr width="50%">
<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.

Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<h3>The Environmental Benefits of Capitalism</h3>

<b>Policy Review</b><br>

<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</I></center>

<p>

	Profit and the environment are supposed to be enemies. Remember that the next time you visit Yellowstone National Park, one of the crown jewels of the national park system and a popular attraction for tourists, backpackers, and amateur botanists, zoologists, and geologists. Yellowstone boasts some of the most breathtaking sights in all of North America. It also boasts an interesting capitalistic pedigree.
<p>	It was the Northern Pacific Railroad, a private corporation, that funded early expeditions to the Yellowstone region and helped establish the Yellowstone National Park in 1872. "Because it provided the main form of transportation to the region," report economists Terry Anderson and Donald Leal, "the railroad could profit from preservation of this scenic wonder and therefore had an incentive to preserve it." Many other Western parks were promoted and protected by private railroad and development companies for the same reason.
<p>	More recently, some private timber companies have found that, by exploring other uses of the forest lands they own, they can increase their profits. In International Paper's commercial forests in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas, company biologist Tom Bourland implemented a fee-based recreation program to make money from not harvesting trees. His program charged hunters for access and leased small tracts of land on which families could park their motor homes and enjoy the woods. After three years, International Paper saw its revenues from the program triple, constituting 25 percent of its total profits from the area. Since this valuable use of private land relied on beauty and diverse wildlife rather than ease of harvest, the company had an incentive to preserve habitat for white-tailed deer, wild turkey, fox, squirrel, quail, bald eagles, and red-cockaded woodpeckers.
<p>	Deseret Land and Livestock pursued a similar strategy when its cattle ranch fell on hard times. The firm's managers decided to invest in wildlife habitat, charging hunters for the right to hunt elk and other animals. Herds of elk and mule deer -- now a valuable commodity -- on Deseret land actually grew, and the company thrived. The 1,289-square-mile King Ranch in south Texas now makes 60 percent of its income from business activities other than cattle -- including revenues from hunters and nature lovers.
<p>	Within the corporate social-responsibility movement, there is no more important issue than environmentalism. Often, the call for corporate responsibility and the exhortation to "save the planet" from a host of environmental problems seem virtually to be the same thing. The firms most often honored for their responsibility -- such as the Body Shop, Patagonia, and Ben and Jerry's -- usually exhibit some sort of (highly publicized) commitment to environmental goals. "Corporations, because they are the dominant institution on the planet, must squarely face the social and environmental problems that afflict humankind," states Paul Hawken, a founder of Smith and Hawken catalog company. "How," he asks, "does business face the prospect that creating a profitable, growing company requires an intolerable abuse of the natural world?"
<p>	The notion that profit and ecology must be at loggerheads, and that businesses must place environmental obligations above economic ones, is but one viewpoint among social-responsibility advocates. A different notion, championed most famously by Vice President Al Gore, is that doing business in an "environmentally friendly" way is also to increase the profitability of firms. "We can prosper," he wrote in his book <i>Earth in the Balance</i>, "by leading the environmental revolution and producing for the world marketplace the new products and technologies that foster economic progress without environmental destruction."
<p>	When you think through the complex issue of corporate environmental responsibility, however, neither Hawken's "win-lose" proposition nor Gore's "win-win" proposition ultimately satisfies. Both have merit, but ignore the most important characteristic of environmental ethics: uncertainty. For Hawken, the fact that the world is headed for catastrophe is scarcely debatable. Only if you buy his apocalyptic predictions about overpopulation, global climate change, deforestation, and depletion of natural resources does his recipe for a low-growth, heavily regulated, "sustainable" economy make any sense. 
<p>	In Gore's case, he makes no conceptual distinction between profiting from innovation and profiting from regulation. Throughout much of his book, he argues that governments should make environmental regulations more strict, repeating many of the doomsday scenarios of which Hawken is fond, but then concludes that American firms can make money designing technologies to meet the higher standards. This is no doubt true, but it ignores the firms -- actually shareholders, workers, and consumers -- who clearly lose when regulatory standards change.
<p>	Innovative compliance might reduce the cost of regulation, but it doesn't eliminate it. For example, a state might decide to require that only cars fueled by electric batteries will be sold within its borders. This might well lead to the development of better, cheaper electric cars, as firms struggle to capture as much as they can of the new automobile market, but that's not the only consideration. Under the mandate, consumers would lose access to the products they prefer. Some individuals and businesses would leave the state entirely. The resulting costs and dislocations would far exceed the environmental benefits of lower auto emissions, which are questionable in any event. (The generation of electricity for the cars, for example, would still produce some air or water pollution.)
<p>	Gore, in other words, is essentially arguing that it's worth building a better mousetrap, regardless of how many mice you think may be actually running around in your house. But what if the more pressing problem you face in your home is termite infestation? Then the mousetrap doesn't help you.
<p>	In a different sense, though, Gore is on exactly the right track in charting a course for corporate responsibility on environmental matters. Corporations are not governments. They are not charities. They are unlikely to be successful if they pursue the same sorts of strategies that governments and philanthropic organizations use to protect wildlife habitats and promote clean air and water, such as setting and enforcing standards of health and safety for the public. Corporate America's unique contribution to solving real environmental problems will come from innovation -- finding new ways to produce goods and services, package and deliver them to consumers, and dispose of or recycle the wastes generated by their own production or by consumption.
<p>
<b>Pollution and Profits</b>
<p>	Corporate innovation in the pollution-reduction area is already widespread. The "Pollution Prevention Pays" program begun by Minnesota-based 3M in 1975 has reduced the company's emissions by more than a billion pounds while saving $500 million.
<p>	"At our company, we view a good portion of the environmental problems most talked about today as symptoms of an underlying disease," said 3M chairman Livio D. DeSimone. "That disease is waste -- the wasteful and inefficient utilization of our resources."<p>
	Similarly, Dow Chemical and Westinghouse have implemented waste reduction strategies that have saved millions of dollars since the mid-1980s. One Westinghouse plant in Puerto Rico reduced "dragout" -- the contamination accidentally spread as chemicals flow from one tank to another -- by 75 percent by shaking the tank to remove solids before releasing the chemical on to the next tank. Chevron saved $10 million in waste disposal costs and reduced hazardous waste by 60 percent in the first three years of its "Save Money and Reduce Toxics" (SMART) program.<p>
	Over the past few decades, timber companies have found that "sustainable-yield forestry" -- including preventing fires, spraying for pests, and quickly replanting harvested areas -- produces less waste and higher profits while also preserving habitat for wildlife. In addition, they have reformed their manufacturing processes, for example by using leftovers from lumbering to make paper pulp and to generate steam for paper mills. International Paper saved about $100 million in disposal expenses between 1988 and 1995 by recycling and reusing its manufacturing wastes.
<p>To be successful both at saving money and "saving the planet," however, corporate waste-reduction programs can't be based on rhetoric or ideology or guesswork about what is or isn't environmentally friendly. One of the greatest myths propagated by the corporate social-responsibility movement is that the most environmentally friendly way to produce goods and services is already known, and that all corporate executives need do is embrace the environmental ethic. This is untrue. Often, the consequences of corporate decisions are ambiguous in terms of overall affect on species, health, air, and water quality, and the global environment. In some cases, the very practices advocated by environmental activists harm the environment.
<p>	Consider the historical example of the automobile. Given the attention paid to air pollution and oil spills, one might believe that the environment would be better off if cars had never been invented and mass-produced for widespread use. But such a judgment would be hasty. Although cars created a new source of air pollution, they also virtually eliminated one of the oldest sources of air and water pollution known to man: animal dung.
<p>	A horse, for instance, produces about 45 pounds of manure each day. In American cities before the advent of automobiles, massive amounts of horse manure collected daily on streets, sidewalks, and public property. The resulting mess fouled the air, and contaminated water and food. It had to be collected and dumped or buried, often at great expense. And the horses died. In the late 19th century, New York City had to dispose of some 15,000 dead horses a year. Sometimes this difficult task wasn't performed as quickly as it should have been, resulting in outbreaks of disease.
<p>	In 1885, a British writer described London in the supposedly pristine days before the car. "It is a vast stagnant swamp, which no man dare enter, since death would be his inevitable fate. There exhales from this oozy mass so fatal a vapor that no animal can endure it. The black water bears a greenish-brown floating scum, which forever bubbles up from the putrid mud of the bottom. . . . It is dead."
<p>	Fred Smith, the president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, in Washington, D.C., and a former environmental regulator, notes that the automobile swept away many of these environmental problems. Besides reducing the need to deal with horse and draught-animal wastes and corpses, the car "encouraged developments that reduce air pollution," he observed in Reason magazine. Before the automobile, most urban homes and businesses were heated with coal, an extremely dirty source of energy that spewed sulfur dioxide, particulates, and toxic ash into the air. As the demand for gasoline stimulated oil exploration, heating oil and natural gas became cheaper and more readily available.
<p>	Did the inventors and early manufacturers of the automobile perceive its potential environmental benefits? Have General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler been run by environmental activists for the past half-century? Hardly. Their environmental records are mixed. Nor have all the environmental problems created by the human need for transportation and fuel been "solved" -- particularly in those unique areas, such as southern California, where topography and climate make auto emissions, regardless of how numerous their source, a continuing problem. The automobile example shows only that economic decisions, motivated by an insatiable demand for higher productivity, lower costs, and bigger profit margins, can have unforeseen benefits for third parties and the environment.
<P>
<b>It's Not Easy Being Green</b>
<p>	One problem for corporate managers is that years of apocalyptic rhetoric and breathless media coverage have created environmental illiteracy among many Americans, including potential consumers and employees. When McDonald's first began to research whether its plastic "clamshell" hamburger boxes posed a significant waste-disposal problem, company scientists came to the conclusion that paper wrappers would actually be harder to recycle. But in a well-publicized 1990 decision, the restaurant chain nevertheless switched to paper.
<p>	The reason wasn't sound environmental policymaking, but public relations. A letter-writing campaign organized by environmental activists and teachers had schoolchildren across the country telling their favorite fast-food outlet (and their parents) that they wanted paper rather than plastic to "save the planet." McDonald's complied. Subsequently, a study in <i>Science</i> concluded that the plastic alternative was less environmentally harmful, once all the relevant costs -- such as the energy expended to make the paper wrappings -- were factored in.
<p>    Not only did McDonald's appear to make the environmentally "wrong" decision, but the company also nipped a promising business venture in the bud. Before the paper-packaging decision was announced, Dow Chemical and seven other plastic manufacturers had formed the National Polystyrene Recycling Company to recycle polystyrene from 450 McDonald's restaurants. The switch to paper nixed the deal, which would have advanced plastics recycling.
<p>	The effect of corporate decisions on the environment are, in other words, extremely difficult to predict with accuracy. Corporations pursuing profit have as much chance of generating environmental benefits as regulators or environmental activists do -- particularly when they are faced with prices for waste disposal that are as close to cost as possible.
<p>	For natural resources over which property rights are relatively easy to establish, such as oil, minerals, or timber, prices serve as an early-warning signal to companies about scarcity. If the price is rising, that suggests more demand for the resource than can be met by available supply. Companies then have a financial incentive either to find new supplies or to reduce its need by developing alternatives or ferreting out waste. This market process amounts to a sort of ongoing environment research project seeking an answer to this question: What is the most efficient and least resource-depleting method of producing the goods and services people need?
<p>	A good example of how this process works can be found in the development by Bristol-Myers-Squibb of a new way to make Taxol, a treatment for ovarian and breast cancer. Taxol had been made from the bark of the endangered Pacific yew tree, but the process killed the tree. Responding to the mounting cost of obtaining Pacific yew bark, the company found a way to make Taxol from the needles and twigs of the more common Himalayan yew tree, thus assuring a continued supply of Taxol while reducing the need to harvest the endangered species.
<p>	For resources over which property rights haven't been established, either because of technical difficulty or because of bad public-policy decisions, the pricing system doesn't work as well. When governments relieve corporations of the need for pay the full cost of disposing of waste, for example, by operating and subsidizing waste collection, landfills, incinerators, and recycling programs, they reduce the incentive for those corporations to find alternative methods that produce less waste.
<p>	
<b>Environmental Surprises</b>
<p>	Some ecological benefits come from surprising places. Man-made pesticides and the companies that produce them, for example, are often reviled for the risks they supposedly pose to humans and habitats. But according to Dennis Avery, the director of global food issues for the Hudson Institute, the Herculean efforts by American companies and researchers to make farming more productive -- by introducing insecticides, herbicides, crop-breeding, and genetic engineering -- have reduced the need for farmland in the United States and other countries. Besides lowering the real price and improving the quality of the foods consumers buy, this happy result has had the side-effect of protecting forests and other sensitive habitats from being cleared for agriculture. "Today's typical environmentalist worries about how many spiders and pigweeds survive in an acre of monoculture corn without giving environmental credit for the millions of organisms thriving on the two acres that didn't have to be plowed because we tripled crop yields," Avery comments.
<p>	Actually, reducing the price and improving the quality of agricultural produce has had its own salutary effects on human health. Throughout human history, most people in most societies have had little to eat. Starvation has until recently been the typical state of much of the Earth's population. Only within the past century, and especially since the early 1900s, has agricultural productivity increased rapidly enough to guarantee a plentiful supply of food at affordable prices in developed countries. 		Much of this productivity is due to the invention and production of agricultural chemicals and the development of new farming practices by American entrepreneurs. Even today, herbicides and pesticides make fruits and vegetables cheaper and more attractive. One study by Texas A&M University researchers found that without pesticides, potato yields would drop 50 percent, orange yields by 55 percent, and corn yields by 78 percent. Prices for these commodities would rise tremendously without pesticides.
<p>	Companies introducing these agricultural innovations have clearly advanced the interests of their shareholders, too. The Monsanto Co., founded in 1901 to produce saccharin in competition with German firms, has since diversified into chemicals, fibers, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. Two of its most profitable products for the past 30 years have been the popular herbicides Lasso (introduced in 1969) and Roundup (1973), one of the best-selling agricultural products of all time. Monsanto continues to introduce new products to increase agricultural productivity, such as Posilac, which boosts milk production in cows and reduces per-unit consumption of feed grains.
<p>
<b>Plastic Pleasures</b>
<p>	If anything symbolizes the irresponsible corporation in the minds of many theorists, it is the manufacturer of that epitome of 20th-century wastefulness, plastic. Typically made from oil, a nonrenewable resource, plastic has come to represent everything that is wrong with American commercial life and our "throwaway culture." But is plastic really a significant environmental problem? Does it provide no benefits to human health and safety or the environment that need to be weighed?
<p>	William Rathje, a professor of archeology at the University of Arizona, has spent years studying solid-waste disposal patterns. His excavations of landfills have found that plastics make up about 7 percent by weight and 16 percent by volume of the typical landfill -- much less than paper or yard waste. Polystyrene plastic, used in drinking cups and those "clamshell" hamburger containers McDonald's abandoned, makes up only 1 percent of landfill volume. Fast-food packaging amounts to no more than one-third of 1 percent. Of course, environmentalists fault plastic for much more than taking up space in landfills. They point out that plastic manufacturing relies on extracting and transporting oil. But since less than 2 percent of the world's petroleum is used to produce petrochemicals of all kinds, from fertilizers to plastics, the impact on oil consumption of using plastic to make consumer products is negligible.<p>
	Consider, on the other hand, the benefits of plastic. Even something as banal as plastic wrap has been a tremendous boon for Americans' health and safety. A hundred years ago, grocery stores had little in the way of prepackaged foods. At the turn of the century, paper packaging began to enter food retailing, but it had limitations. Meat, for example, was still often shipped in the form of whole carcasses only 50 years ago. Consumers would request particular cuts of meat from butchers, who kept carcasses until they were all sold or completely spoiled. The meat was expensive, particularly because butchers spent so much time carving it.
<p>	During the 1950s, however, the advent of plastic packaging began to change food delivery. Dow Chemical of Midland, Michigan, was an industry leader, not only in supplying plastic products to businesses but also by introducing its first major consumer product, Saran Wrap, in 1953. Plastic packaging allowed grocers to sell smaller portions at lower prices, and consumers to store food more efficiently and effectively. One study estimates that the modern system of packaging lowers the price of beef by about 40 cents a pound, while improving its quality.
<p>	Furthermore, the use of plastic and other types of packaging for foods seems to have reduced, not increased, total household waste. When Rathje took his garbage-archeology team to Mexico City in 1990, they found that the average household there discarded 40 percent more refuse each day than the average U.S. household, because Mexicans ate more whole fruits and vegetables and thus had more rinds, peels, and other food debris. In America, food processors sell prepackaged fruits and vegetables in cans, bags, or microwaveable plastic containers. From an environmental standpoint, this has the effect of accumulating the food debris in a central location, thus making it easier to dispose of in the form of compost, animal feed, and other products.
<p>	Today, the American plastics industry is one of the most innovative in the world. By finding new ways to manufacture, package, and store products that cost less, last longer, require fewer resources, and reduce harm to the environment, the industry is constantly improving the way we live. Since World War II, innovations in the manufacture, design, and use of plastics have yielded tremendous benefits for the public in terms of safety, health, economy, and quality of life. Consider these examples:
<p>	Plastic tubing made possible the first disposable, ready-to-use hypodermic needles. Initially introduced for combat use in the 1940s, the disposable needle soon made it possible to conduct safe and effective mass inoculations against disease in America and throughout the world.
<p>	In 1945, Earl Tupper introduced the first flexible plastic storage containers to replace glass, earthenware, and metal containers for storing food and other perishables. His product, Tupperware, vastly improved the freshness and quality of stored food.
<p>	Plastic siphon tubing made mass irrigation possible in the 1940s and 1950s, thus contributing to the Green Revolution that increased agricultural productivity and eliminated famine in much of the world. In the 1960s, plastic pipes began to replace other forms of piping for water distribution and drainage, because they were lighter and easier to install and resisted corrosion better than alternatives.
<p>	Plastic innovations during the past three decades by such companies as Phillips Petroleum, Union Carbide, and Shell Chemical have made possible such life-saving and life-enhancing products as artificial organs, comfortable prosthetics, body armor for law-enforcement personnel, unbreakable but light children's toys, and many automotive parts.
<p>	Cheap, all-temperature performance, flame-retardant, high-impact-resistant plastic parts made the first home computers -- manufactured by Apple Computer and Tandy -- viable products.
<p>	Lingering environmental controversies such as the risks of dioxin -- which many view as a potent human carcinogen -- are being resolved by plastic designers who, just in the past few years, have developed products that reduce or eliminate these real or perceived environmental problems. GE Plastics, for example, developed a new flame-retardant product that doesn't produce dioxin and that is also easier to make and costs no more than the plastic it replaces. Apple Computer is using the product in its Macintosh line of personal computers. Waste-to-energy plants, which dispose of about 60,000 tons of refuse each day and supply electricity to nearly a million Americans, also employ a series of technologies that reduce dioxin emissions to almost immeasurable levels.
<p>
<b>The Recycling Conundrum</b>
<p>	An article of faith among environmental advocates is that recycling will help American business conserve natural resources and demonstrate its environmental responsibility. This assumption doesn't account for the potential costs, including environmental costs, of pursuing recycling regardless of whether it is truly profitable.
<p>	For example, curbside recycling programs usually require more collection trucks. That means more fuel consumption and engine emissions. Some recycling programs produce high volumes of wastewater and use large amounts of energy. When researchers have tried to examine every aspect of the recycling equation -- from energy use to production costs -- they have found that sometimes recycling makes sense from an economic and environmental standpoint, while other times it does not.
<p>	Aluminum cans are a clear example of a commercial package that should be recycled. It takes 10 percent less energy to recycle aluminum than it does to make it from mined bauxite. So aluminum recycling is profitable -- and commonplace. Steel is also relatively economical to recycle. Virtually all products made with steel contain at least 25 percent reclaimed steel. On the other hand, recycling fruit-juice containers probably doesn't make economic or ecological sense. Filling disposable cardboard boxes takes half as much energy as filling recyclable glass bottles. For a given beverage volume, transporting the empty glass bottles requires 15 times as many trucks as does transporting disposable boxes. Transporting the containers once they are filled also costs less when using disposable boxes. Juice boxes don't break like glass bottles can, they are easily packed or frozen, and they seem to encourage juice consumption among the young, with whom they have proven to be popular.
<p>	For some commodities, such as newsprint, it seems that the only way to make recycling profitable is to force manufacturers to use them. Many states have laws requiring that newspapers contain a certain percentage of recycled paper, thus artificially creating a demand for newsprint. Even mandates sometimes fail to make recycling work: In Germany, laws requiring plastics recycling have resulted in a glut of collected plastics with few economical uses. Advocates for such laws point out that market prices don't capture all the costs of alternatives to recycling. But prices nevertheless contain important information. When forest stocks become scarcer, for example, the price of virgin timber rises, thus making recyclables more attractive. Similarly, as long as landfills are run to at least break even, then as they fill up their tipping fees will rise, again encouraging diversion of waste products into recycling or reuse. These price mechanisms already exist to a significant degree, and yet paper and plastic recycling often makes no sense absent government mandates.	

<p>For corporate managers trying to make heads or tails of the economic and environmental issues surrounding recycling, the answer may well be to trust an imperfect system of market prices over an even more imperfect attempt to guess at the ecological impact of various waste-reduction and recycling strategies. In everyday decisionmaking, this means weighing costs and benefits while maximizing shareholder return.
<p>

	Ford saved millions in 1994 when it converted several components of its automobiles into 100 percent recycled plastic. Chrysler is using completely recycled plastic in the interior trim of its popular minivans. Both car companies have made increasing use of these recycled plastics, made by companies such as Washington Penn Plastics and AlliedSignal, because of their cost and performance advantages over "virgin" plastic, not because of an attempt to meet some vague environmental goal. The savings "go straight to the bottom line," said Tony Brooks, Ford's special recycling coordinator. "Ford's position is that we will do everything we can to use recycled materials in our cars, but they can't cost more than virgin and they must perform at least as well as virgin."
<p>
<b>Problem, Innovation, Solution</b>
<p>	Most environmental issues in America today represent not only public-sector controversies but also private-sector opportunities. For companies that can identify a problem and devise a solution, the potential profits are significant.
<p>	In the case of plastics, profit-seeking corporations are experimenting with edible food packaging that offers better protection, lower cost, and few environmental considerations. ConAgra, Inc., the processed-food giant, is working on an edible bag in which to package products such as frozen entrees that currently used plastic bags. "If you could make a boilable, edible bag, you could replace the plastic with something that is part of the food -- ultimately eliminating a source of package waste," says the company's packaging director, Brian Hopkins. Other companies are working along similar lines. Quaker Oats is testing edible coating for breakfast cereals. RJR Nabisco is working on a film made from milk protein that could be used to coat frozen fish products and baked goods.
<p>	These innovations aren't being pursued simply to reduce package waste. Food manufacturers also want to improve food preservation to enhance the taste and freshness of their products. Instead of having consumers buy whole fruits and vegetables, for example, and then slicing or dicing them at home, manufacturers could prepare large quantities of fresh produce -- such as pre-sliced onions or oranges -- and then preserve them with edible coatings. The cost of the foods would be lower, consumers could enjoy the convenience of pre-sliced ingredients, and waste peelings -- currently spread out over the entire population of homes -- would be centralized in manufacturing facilities and thus easier to dispose of. The resulting boon to human health would be significant. "Consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables could be higher if this service were provided," says Attila E. Pavlath, a food scientist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
<p>Other corporations are focusing their innovative energies on hazardous waste spills, hoping to profit from creative solutions to this most serious of environmental dangers. Whether it is the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989 or Superfund sites or underground leakage of cancer-causing chemicals, the topic of hazardous waste often generates passionate feelings and great concern about environmental damage. But is the answer to spills to be found in banning substances or jawboning industry to reduce its dependency on them? Many entrepreneurial U.S. companies say no.

<p>The answer, they suggest, is to find new ways to clean up spills quickly, easily, and effectively. Bioremediation -- using bacteria or fungi either found in nature or engineered in laboratories to clean up hazardous wastes -- is a promising technology that offers the prospect of a cleaner economy without sacrificing the modern industrial processes that make our so economy productive. In Seattle, UNOCAL is using petroleum-eating bacteria to clean a six-acre patch of dirt where an oily residue of gasoline and disease fuels had accumulated over 65 years of leaks from its Seattle Marketing Fuel Terminal. Once the site is clean, UNOCAL expects to sell it for a significant price to commercial or residential developers.
<p>	Bioremediation isn't exactly a new idea -- municipal water systems have long used bacteria to purify sewage and paper companies have used them to remove organic matter from industrial sludgesbut a bustling new industry of bioremediation enterprises promises to clean up such hazardous materials as DDT, wood preservatives, toxic petrochemicals, and radioactive waste. Corporate pioneers in the area include Amoco and Du Pont, but most of the new technologies are coming from small, start-up firms such as Remediation Technologies of Concord, Massachusetts, Alpha Environmental in Austin, Texas, and Envirogen of Lawrenceville, New Jersey. Ironically, many bioremediation approaches have come from a close observation of how Mother Nature herself deals with waste. In searching for microbes to clean up oil spills, Alpha Environmental president Eugene Douglas said, "we went to where there are natural oil seeps in the Mediterranean, Central Asia, and North America, but where there isn't what you'd call pollution. Over time, microbes at these sites have evolved the ability to ingest that oil."
<p>	Bioremediation isn't the only solution profit-seeking corporations are working on. For the problem of oil spills, for example, Sea Sweep, Inc. of Denver, Colorado has developed an oil-absorbing, floating material, made from heating sawdust and woodchips, that will absorb 3.5 times its weight in oil. If administered to a spill, Sea Sweep will absorb the oil and then float to the surface for easy collection, after which it can be burned as fuel. Wyoming-based Centech has developed a centrifuge that generates relatively clean water and marketable oil from oil sludge, which is a serious problem around crude oil storage tanks and pipelines. In the area of industrial wastes, Tennessee's Olin Corp. has developed a process for dramatically reducing absorbable organic halides (such as dioxin) from the paper pulp-bleaching process. Martin Marietta Energy Systems, Inc. has a process for dechlorinating wastewater streams.
<p>	It would be impossible to list all of the environmental innovations and inventions one can find in just a single year, ranging from simple reuse technologies at plant sites to machines and acids that remove virtually all known pollutants from energy plant emissions. Some of these technologies have been developed, as Gore suggests, in response to regulatory mandates. Others have come about as companies seek to reduce their waste disposal costs, improve the efficiency of their production processes, or find new areas of opportunity in a growing, constantly changing economy. It is through innovation and productivity gains, not through corporate munificence or a commitment to a theoretical environmental ethos, that American business will make its most important contribution to a cleaner world and the health and safety of the public. 
<p>	For corporate decisionmakers, true responsibility entails a recognition of the uncertainty that often accompanies environmental controversies and an unwillingness to put the interests of shareholders at risk by accepting environmental "truisms" at face value. It is by no means clear that simply recycling more, or substituting paper for plastic, or abandoning profitable enterprises because they require nonrenewable resources will necessarily serve environmental ends. Ultimately, such ends are determined and valued by human beings who also value healthful and reasonably priced foods, high-quality consumer goods, and job opportunities. The chances of making a poor decision are higher when corporate managers try to act like public policymakers or conservation experts.
<p>	Instead, as much as is practicable, corporations should let prices guide their decisions. In most cases, wasteful industrial practices impose measurable costs on firms, be they for waste disposal, raw-materials purchases, or lost customer revenue. Thus firms have every incentive to find alternatives. "For all environmental issues, shareholder value, rather than compliance, emissions, or costs, is the critical unifying metric," said McKinsey & Co. management consultants Noah Walley and Bradley Whitehead in their noted 1994 essay on corporate environmentalism in the <i>Harvard Business Review</i>. "That approach is environmentally sound, but it's also hardheaded, informed by business experience, and, as a result, much more likely to be truly sustainable over the long term."
<p>	An example of how truly responsible companies might make decisions about environmental issues is the case of Eco-Foam pellets, a substitute for Styrofoam peanuts in packing boxes or other containers. Texas-based American Excelsior Co. makes Eco-Foam out of corn starch and markets it as environmentally friendly. "The biggest benefit is that it's manufactured from renewable resources instead of petroleum products," says one local distributor. Should responsible companies concerned about the global environment use Eco-Foam instead of Styrofoam, then? Probably not. Managers need not evaluate all the pros and cons of the two products. They need only watch the price. In early 1995, Eco-Foam cost 25 percent more than Styrofoam. If we ever really start running out of oil, the price of petroleum products, including Styrofoam, will rise -- making alternatives competitive. Until then, the environmental benefits of switching to corn starch won't be worth the cost.
<p>	Public policymakers will continue to develop more efficient ways to regulate waste and pollution, and scientists will continue to gather information about the environmental risks from various substances or practices. As they do, pricing structures will evolve that communicate even more accurate information to manufacturers and entrepreneurs about the true cost of commercial activities and the potential rewards from innovative solutions to environmental problems.
<p>	There are many promising trends in environmental thinking and regulatory policy, from markets for emissions permits to the increased use of cost-benefit analysis to establish public priorities. Once ecological and economic ends are brought closer together, the perceived clash of interests between American business and Mother Nature will largely disappear. For corporations, the complex issues of environmental responsibility will always be challenging. But dealing with them requires no redefinition of the core profit-seeking purpose of economic enterprises.

<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center><p>
	Two competing paradigms of education reform have emerged in the United States in recent years, and the differences between them are growing sharper. One, commonly termed "systemic reform," assumes that reform efforts should be led by government and imposed from the top down. Its advocates believe that state (or federal) authorities must set standards not only for student learning, but also for teacher training, pupil assessments, textbooks, and school resources. Though undertaken in pursuit of higher standards and better results, systemic reform relies on uniform strategies to ensure that "inputs" everywhere are equal and all schools undertake similar activities. Government resources and bureaucratic regulation are, of course, its preferred mechanism for making this happen. Much of Goals 2000 embodies this approach.<p>	The second reform paradigm, which we call "reinventing education," embraces decentralized control, entrepreneurial management, and grassroots initiatives, all within a framework of publicly defined standards and accountability. Under this approach, public officials establish standards, make assessments, and hold schools accountable for meeting performance goals but do not themselves run the schools. Public officials also retain the power to cancel charters and school-management contracts on grounds of consistently poor performance, but they do not directly supervise or control the means by which schools pursue those ends.<p>	Under this paradigm, education may be delivered through charter schools (licensed by public authorities such as a state, city, or local school district), "opt out" schools that secede from their local education agencies and run themselves with what amounts to a "block grant" of public funds, "contract schools" (in which a performance contract is negotiated between private educational managers and a public agency), and "choice" programs (in which students use scholarships or publicly-funded vouchers to attend the schools of their choice). In all such situations, the continuing responsibility of public authorities is to establish standards for educational and fiscal performance and monitor progress in relation to those standards. (Those who reject this degree of public accountability may, of course, turn to wholly private schools or home schooling.)<p>	The "reinvention" approach welcomes diverse strategies and schools organized and run by various entities such as teacher cooperatives, parent associations, private corporations, religious institutions, and community-based organizations. It assumes that students and families are different and should be free to match themselves to the schools that suit them best. It requires little bureaucracy and few regulations because it rejects the proposition that schools must be centrally managed according to a single formula.<p>	We strongly favor the "reinvention" paradigm, provided that it contains one key element borrowed from the "systemic" approach: standards and accountability. It is our conviction that only clear and high standards for performance will ensure accountability, both to the marketplace (that is, to families making informed choices among schools) and to whatever public body authorizes the schools to operate.<p>	These standards need not be national, they need not be highly detailed, they should not prescribe pedagogy or resource use, and they need not cover the entire curriculum. (Indeed, the ability of schools to add their own features to the "core" described in the standards is part of what will make them different from one another.) But only when such standards are in place -- and accompanied by good tests and a steady flow of performance information -- can parents make informed choices among schools and public authorities determine which schools deserve to retain their "charters," contracts, or accreditations.<p>	These two approaches are now competing with each other, not only in Washington, D.C., but also in the states. Systemic reform remains the favored strategy of the Clinton administration and of some educators (especially in state departments of education and teachers unions), but the "reinvention" alternative is preferred in many other quarters -- including by many elected officials, business leaders, and parents, as well as by teachers and principals who welcome the possibility of breaking free from the stifling grip of bureaucracy. <p>	The reinvention impulse has even reached Capitol Hill, where the past year saw stirrings of the first major push in memory to "devolve" centralized activities to states, communities, and families and to lift restrictions on the use of federal aid. This impulse arises partly from the quest for better education, but also from a reaction against the regulatory burden of federal regulations and unfunded mandates.<p>	This is the motive behind recent congressional activity concerning "block grants" in areas as diverse as welfare, school lunches, and job training, as well as education aid. To be sure, turning categorical programs into block grants and devolving control to states and communities will not automatically foster reinvention. Indeed, recipients may not do much of anything. But doing away with "Washington-knows-best" approaches and removing strings from federal dollars at least permits reform-minded states and communities to experiment with new strategies for education and other public servicesand closes the easy route of blaming Uncle Sam for poor results.<p>	The federal government is so hamstrung by special interest groups that getting it out of the way of change-minded states and communities may be the most we can expect from Washington on the "reinvention" front. Certainly, all efforts by Uncle Sam to foster such reforms directly have proven halfhearted at best and fraudulent at worst. The so-called "Improving America's Schools Act" of 1994, for example, banned any use of federal aid for privately managed public schools and created a school "choice" program so laden with preconditions and constraints that it must be termed phony. It enables members of Congress to say they "voted for school choice" while ensuring that there is none.<p>	Even rigorous accountability based on testing was discouraged by explicit prohibitions in the Goals 2000 legislation on the use of federal funds for this purpose. Those who believe that such reforms are the main hope for serious educational improvement are learning that Washington is the wrong place to look. But much is happening elsewhere in the nation under the "reinvention" banner.
<p><b>Potemkin Charters</b><p>	The charter school idea has picked up tremendous momentum, as have variants, such as a flock of new, miniature high schools in New York City that are not called charters but share many of their characteristics. Those qualities include a large measure of operational independence from headquarters in return for a promise to achieve certain results over a stated period of time. (New York City's quasi-charters, however, have not agreed to any educational performance goals, and their quasi-independence relies on waivers by the local teachers union, waivers that do not even apply to the schools' many other employees.)<p>	By summer 1995, 19 states had enacted explicit "charter" school laws, including eight during the most recent legislative session (Louisiana, Arkansas, New Hampshire, Texas, Alaska, Wyoming, Delaware, and Rhode Island). Several hundred such schools were scheduled to be open this fall. Charter schools are no panacea -- not in a country with 85,000 public schools -- but this movement is the second-most-exciting development on the educational reform front.<p>	Not all charter laws are created equal, however, and several enacted in recent months are so weak that they are unlikely to do much good. We think of them as "Potemkin" charter programs with an impressive facade but no substance. Some of these laws were supported by people who actually oppose charter schools on principle and had decided to undermine support for them by promoting a bill that pretended to create them. This is currently happening in New Jersey, where the state teachers union is supporting a weak charter bill in the state assembly, although a stronger, competing bill supported by the state education commissioner, the state senate, and Governor Christine Whitman may yet prevail.<p>	Weak charter laws generally suffer from at least one of three serious failings:<p><ul><li>	They require the prior assent of too many "stakeholders," such as a majority of teachers currently teaching in the affected schools, and contain no mechanism for creating new charter schools that do not already possess such stakeholders. Of course, it would be wonderful if existing schools converted to charter status with the support of a majority of teachers and parents working together, and that is sure to happen in some places. But there are also situations in which parents and community leaders want to start a new school, and they should be allowed to do sowith the staff they want to teach in it. (Currently, California's charter law requires the approval of a majority of teachers, as do those in Georgia, Hawaii, and New Mexico.)<p>
<li>	They place local school boards in sole charge of granting charters. (Wyoming, Louisiana, and Texas have recently enacted such laws.) Though such a limitation is invariably a key political goal of school board lobbyists, it can be fatal for charter schools, because the uniform policies of a benighted local board and risk-averse superintendent are usually what charter-seekers are keenest to escape. That is why strong charter laws either lodge the authority to issue charters with a different entity (such as a state superintendent or state board) or -- better yet -- create multiple windows or appeal mechanisms so that no single entity has the absolute power to deny a charter application. In Michigan and Minnesota, state universities have the authority to issue charters. In Arizona, besides vesting this authority in both local and state school boards, the legislature created a new "charter school" board exclusively for this purpose<p>.<li>	They neglect to exempt charter schools from enough of the statutes, regulations, and contractual provisions that burden conventional schools. Thus, the charter school is not truly free to chart its own course. The whole point of such a school, after all, is to gain autonomy of action in return for accountability for results. The only regulations that charter schools should be expected to comply with are those governing health and safety and protections against racial discrimination. But many states leave numerous other rules in place. If a state still requires that U.S. history be taught in the 11th grade, that a school's pupil-teacher ratio cannot exceed 25:1, that 40 minutes a day must be spent on math, that certain textbooks must be purchased, and if there is no respite from seniority rules, salary schedules, or tenure requirements, then we see little point in calling an entity so regulated a "charter school." Such a charter is unlikely to be worth the paper it is printed on -- and few will go to the bother of seeking such a document.</ul><p>
	Why have so many states created these Potemkin charter programs? The explanation, of course, has to do with power and politics, catalyzed by the education establishment's fierce resistance to changes that threaten its monopoly. Though many teachers and principals crave opportunities to "opt out" of the system and run their own schools without the incessant oversight, time-wasting regulations, and innumerable mandates of the bureaucracy, their professional organizations seldom see it this way. Thus teachers unions, school-board associations, and superintendents, if they cannot defeat the charter bill altogether, generally do their utmost to weaken it. So do other advocacy groupsfor example, special educationwhose stock-in-trade is rule-bound uniformity rather than diversity. In fact, the Southwest Regional Laboratory recently leveled a novel criticism: that charter schoolsprecisely because many of them demand a high degree of parent involvementare unfair to children with bad parents!<p>	Obtaining a charter does not end the hazards that await these schools. Most also encounter practical problems when they first launch. One perennial challenge is finding a place to operate a charter school. To our knowledge, no state provides charter operators with buildings or capital financing. Though this is no huge burden for existing schools that convert to charter status, it poses a great obstacle to the creation of new charter schools. Another problem is that many charter school founders and managers have little prior experience in matters such as financial management, purchasing, and marketing.<p>	Our hunch, however, is that these are birthing and growing pains associated with a feisty, infant reform strategy that will, in time, turn into a strapping youth. We doubt that opponents will be able to halt its growth. In England, where "grant-maintained" schools have been in place for several years -- and where almost a fifth of all secondary schools have "opted out" into this independent status -- even the Labor Party is having to come to terms with their continued existence. Indeed, party leader Tony Blair now sends his own child to a grant-maintained school.<p><b>Gains for School Choice</b>
<p>	There was major progress on the choice front in 1994-95, centering on Milwaukee and Cleveland. In Wisconsin, Governor Tommy Thompson succeeded in persuading the legislature to pass his proposal to expand Milwaukee's voucher experiment to include many more children and to permit attendance at church-affiliated schools. As revised, and assuming the courts eventually assent, up to 15,000 low-income Milwaukee children (nearly all of them minority) will be able to attend any school within the city limits.<p>	In Ohio, the legislature agreed to a proposal by Governor George Voinovich to initiate a voucher "pilot" in 1996 for children in Cleveland. That city's catastrophically bad school system was "taken over" by the state under a federal court order in early 1995. Here, too, church-affiliated schools will be eligible recipients of voucher-bearing youngsters -- up to 2,000 of them. And here, too, the primary beneficiaries of this reform will be low-income minority youngsters.<p>	Court battles have already begun, and we do not doubt that choice's foes, having lost two significant political battles, will now throw vast resources into the effort to get vouchers thrown out as a violation of the "Establishment Clause" of the First Amendment. In August, the Wisconsin Supreme Court issued a temporary injunction against the Milwaukee plan. But the governors and legislators of Wisconsin and Ohio deserve hearty applause from those who believe, as we do, that no child should be forced to attend a bad public school against his and his parents' will when a better school -- public, private, or hybrid -- is available close by. Because the families of poor children often lack the wherewithal to exercise such a choice on their own, it is the obligation of elected officials to make it possible for them, as they have historically done in higher education. That this will now happen in two major U.S. cities is a development of immense significance to American education. <p>	A number of other states stepped up to the "choice" plate in 1995 but struck out. In Texas, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Illinois, and Arizona, variations on the voucher theme failed to pass, and New Jersey delayed consideration of Mayor Bret Schundler's Jersey City plan until at least autumn of this year. The original Ohio choice bill, to encompass a broader area than Cleveland, was chopped down by the legislature. Another setback was the ruling by Puerto Rico's Supreme Court that the voucher program there violated the commonwealth's constitution.<p>	Nothing, of course, elicits tougher opposition from defenders of the public-school status quo than voucher schemes (and similar ventures that go by different names), even when such plans are aimed precisely at those disadvantaged children who are most likely to drop out of public school. But the idea is not going away. Meanwhile, privately-funded voucher projects also continue to multiply, from New York's Student/Sponsor Partnership, to the Golden Rule program launched in Indianapolis in 1991. Today 23 programs reach more than 10,000 students. <p>	We believe that it is just a matter of time before children from needy families in most parts of the country will be able to carry their vouchers (or scholarships or whatever they may be called) to any accredited school. We understand that some private schools fear government regulation, and may decline to participate. We recognize that public aid should be targeted toward those students in greatest need (as is now the case in higher education); and we acknowledge that the Supreme Court will have to sort through the constitutional questions posed by inclusion of parochial schools. (Recent Supreme Court decisions in this domain have encouraged voucher supporters.)<p>	Still, it must be noted that, in the meantime, primary and secondary schooling is becoming increasingly anomalous as vouchers come to prevail in most other domains of U.S. domestic policy. Even President Clinton has endorsed vouchers in job training and in public housing. Moreover, much of the rest of the world -- from Australia to Chile to the Netherlands -- treats publicly-subsidized private-school attendance as routine and normal.<p><b>Contract Management</b><p>
	Paul Hill's superb new book <i>Reinventing Public Education</i> sets forth a comprehensive vision of how this approach could work in the future -- and why it is apt to work better than direct operation of all schools by the school system's central office. Meanwhile, Educational Alternatives, Inc. (EAI) continues to manage a number of schools in Baltimore and recently added Hartford, Connecticut, to its portfolio. The superintendent of schools in the District of Columbia has tried to revive his plan to engage EAI to run some of D.C.'s troubled schools. A private management firm is functioning as "superintendent of schools" in Minneapolis.<p>The Edison Project opened its first four schools in 1995, with others due to follow if these succeed. And at least two other companies are already active in this field in the United States. Sabis is an international group that has been running a school in Minnesota and recently added a second (charter) school in Springfield, Massachusetts. Nashville-based Alternative Public School Strategies has reached an agreement with little Wilkinsburg, Pennsylvania, to run one of three elementary schools in that community -- a school in which 78 percent of students receive free or reduced-price lunches. (The future of this contract, however, is shadowed by ambiguity in the laws of Pennsylvania as to the legality of such an arrangement.) More companies and communities will surely follow, probably including big corporate guns such as Disney, which is creating a school in Florida that many view as a prototype.<p>	Unfortunately, not all the blossoms in this garden are healthy. EAI's relationship with a school in Dade County, Florida, has ended. Baltimore mayor Kurt Schmoke -- whose strong support is the main reason EAI has been able to withstand intense establishment pressure in that city -- has voiced dissatisfaction with student performance in the EAI-run schools after three years and has suggested that the arrangement may need to be rethought. And EAI's bold plan to alter budget priorities in Hartford kicked up such a storm from vested interests -- imagine shifting funds from surplus staff to areas such as technologythat the company and school board have decided to scale back most of the changes, at least for now, from the entire district to six schools that have "volunteered" for the full treatment. <p>	The difficulties of EAI in Baltimore and Hartford suggest that contracting will probably work best with new schools and with existing schools that are receptive. It is difficult to graft a new management program onto a school whose staff is determined to defeat the new managers. Perhaps private management should begin with a single school or manageable number of schools that want to be changed. Otherwise, the new managers will be forced to maintain all the elements of a system that currently does not work for children. And if they do, they will be doomed to fail.<p>	As for Edison, there is incredible pressure on its first four schools to be nearly perfect -- educationally, organizationally, and budgetarily -- from the very outset. The venture's future hinges on how well it meets these immense expectations. Every education journalist and researcher in the Western world is knocking on the Edison schools' door, probing for defects or missteps. No conventionally-run public school in America is likely to be subjected to the same degree of scrutiny or held to the same standards of perfection.<p>	In our view, contract management of public schools holds considerable promise, and these trials should be encouraged. We should also expect bumps along the road as these schools get their bearings; some may even fail. It is well to bear in mind, however, that we currently keep failing public schools open and even reward them when they should be closed down. Therefore, when a poorly run contract school or charter school is terminated, we should see such an action as a victory rather than a setback for the reinvention strategy. If and when that happens, it will prove that school authorities are willing to be held accountable for poor results.<p>	Meanwhile, beware the word "privatization," which is widely used by supporters of the current system to block all movement toward contract management. True "privatization" means selling or otherwise transferring a public asset to private owners who henceforth bear sole responsibility for its existence and are accountable to no one save their shareholders.<p>	That is what is happening to certain big, state-run factories in Eastern Europe, for example, but it is not what firms such as EAI and Edison are doing with the U.S. schools they manage under contract. Those schools remain public in every sense that a student, parent, taxpayer, or voter could think important: They are open to the public, financed by the public, and educationally and fiscally accountable to public authorities for their continued existence (and for the retention or termination of their private managers). Here is a sure test of whether an organization has been privatized: If public authorities can cancel the contract or withdraw the charter, the transaction is not privatization. It is a management contract on behalf of the public, not a transfer of public goods to private ownership.<p><b>Governance Changes</b><p>	The century-old governance structure of American public education is showing signs of change. As a recent <i>Education Week</i> headline put it, "Fervor spreads to overhaul state agencies."<p>	This year, it appears, 30 states carried out or at least considered reorganization or reduction of their education departments, mirroring the popular political trends of reducing government, pushing authority to local officials, and giving power to the elected officials whom the voters are apt to hold responsible at the polls for the effective use of their tax dollars. (Education spending is the largest or second-largest budget item in every state.)<p>	Texas offers a dramatic example. Now the second most populous state, Texas has been long known to have perhaps the most highly regulated school system in the country, with an immensely detailed education code and an all-powerful state education agency. Early this year, the legislature agreed with Governor George W. Bush Jr. that significant changes were needed. In effect, they repealed the entire education code and started afresh.<p>	The authority of the Texas Education Agency has been limited to six basic functions, including recommending education goals, granting campus charters, managing school funds, and administering federal programs. Several new categories of schools and school systems have been authorized, including "home rule" districts that are freed from most state mandates and charter schools that may be organized by individuals or groups outside the existing school system. (Unfortunately, as we noted earlier, almost all Texas charters must be issued by the local school board, and these boards are not likely to welcome dissenting approaches.) Texas also created a new network of alternative schools and made it easier to remove disruptive students from regular classrooms. And it created a powerful new state board for educator certification, to be named by the governor.<p>	Other states have taken different approaches. Minnesota abolished its department of education and merged these functions into a new department of children, families, and learning. Wisconsin took virtually all duties and powers away from its independently-elected state school superintendent, an office that was widely perceived as a captive of the education establishment, and turned them over to a new agency answerable to the governor. New Jersey's governor "froze" the regulatory process and directed the education commissioner and his colleagues to propose a comprehensive overhaul.North Carolina -- another highly centralized, heavily regulated state -- is shrinking its department of education by half and rewriting laws and regulations to give local districts far greater flexibility. The state has established annual performance standards for the state's almost 2,000 public schools based on "reasonable progress" in reading, writing, and math and with various interventions, sanctions (including suspension of principals and teachers), and rewards for success or failure to meet those standards. In other words, the state is moving from a regulatory compliance strategy to one based on standards and results.<p>	Illinois also made a radical change, though it affects only the city of Chicago, whose troubled and deficit-plagued schools have been the object of innumerable reform efforts in recent years. The legislature gave unprecedented control to the mayor, who has appointed (and can remove) all members of a small newly created "board of trustees" and a management team that includes a chief operating officer and fiscal, purchasing, and educational officers. The new law also places school principals in charge of all school employees (previously they had no authority over custodians) and authorizes them to set their own school hours and staff schedules. The Chicago Teachers Union is barred from bargaining over many nonsalary issues such as class size, staff assignments, academic calendar, hours and places of instruction, pupil assessment policies, privatizing services, and decisions over charter schools. It is also forbidden to strike for the next 18 months.<p><b>Will Unions Get with the Program?</b><p>	Chicago is not the only place where teachers unions have run afoul of public authorities. Largely because of their efforts to block state and local reforms, the unions are coming under more intense scrutiny and challenge. School boards, legislatures, and governors are promulgating policies and proposing legislation to abolish tenure, redefine collective bargaining rights, repeal "fair-share" agreements, and otherwise change laws and practices that sustain union interests and undergird their power.<p>	In Indiana, for example, the "fair share" law has been repealed. This law had authorized unions to extract fees from nonunion members in return for "services" performed for them by the unions, regardless of whether the individuals wanted those services. (An obvious example is a wage increase that affects all teachers in the district.) By repealing this law, the legislature made it illegal for unions to negotiate such arrangements with school districts. In another, more localized blow to the Indiana State Teachers Association, the legislature passed a reform bill for the Indianapolis schools that limits collective bargaining to the issue of wages only in that city. <p>	In neighboring Michigan, the state also erased collective bargaining over certain nonsalary issues, empowered school boards to put teachers' health insurance out for competitive bidding (rather than compelling purchase of this benefit from the Michigan Education Association's insurance subsidiary), instituted steep fines against teachers who go on strike, and forbade the union to deduct political contributions from teachers' paychecks without their permission.<p>	Such developments are apt to continue as long as unions throw sand in the reform gears. When education is reshaped around standards and performance rather than inputs and processes, just about every established routine will be affected, including personnel practices. No aspect of a school's management is more crucial to its effectiveness than how it handles staffing, and nothing is more fatal to performance-based innovation than attempts to preserve staffing rules that disregard performance.<p>	In New York City, for example, the contract with the United Federation of Teachers allows a school, if 75 percent of the staff agrees, to be included in the "school-based option transfer plan," which lets it (among other union-rule waivers) select its own teachers rather than having staff assigned on the basis of seniority. Sixty schools, including most of the struggling new, small high schools, have opted to be included in the program.<p>	In the city's 1,000 other public schools, however, which enroll 99 percent of the children in the system, transfers to vacancies continue to be based strictly on seniority. Junior teachers can be "bumped" by more senior teachers from other schools, no matter how much a school may want the junior teacher or how little it wants the more senior teacher. Such practices, of course, make it impossible for a school's staff to develop its own ethos, which is essential to the staff's effectiveness and its ability to work together as a team with shared goals.<p>	The Educational Excellence Network has had a long history of successful association on important projects with the American Federation of Teachers at the national level, and the authors of this report admire AFT head Albert Shanker's defense of high standards and high stakes, his international work on behalf of democracy, and his good sense about curricula issues. His staff has also produced some terrific products, and several AFT locals have pioneered (or at least tolerated) some promising reform strategies.<p>	At the state and local levels, however, far more often than not, the AFT and NEA are the most potent protectors of the status quo. In principle, they could change, abandoning their tired industrial model of unionism and turning to the flexible, responsibility- and accountability-seeking, participatory, professional approach to organizational behavior that modern organizations need, and that many other organizations have. We do not know whether, if only for self-preservation, they will prove willing and able to take such a step. We certainly hope they will.

<h3>Will Conservative Welfare Reform Corrupt Religious Charities?</h3>
<hr size=3 width=50%>
<b>Amy L. Sherman</b><br>
<b>Policy Review</b><br>
<i>Fall 1995, Number 74</i></center>
<p>	Welfare reform, says Governor John Engler of Michigan, is not "just about reforming a broken system, but about reforming what is broken in the human character." Engler is one of a growing number of policymakers who seek to shift responsibility for helping the poor from government bureaucracies to civil institutions -- particularly religious ones -- that can address the underlying moral and cultural aspects of chronic welfare dependency. Indeed, amidst the flurry of federal and state initiatives to scale back the welfare state, religious nonprofits are becoming the new provider of choice for funding and delivering social programs.<p>Engler has approved a multimillion-dollar contract with the Salvation Army to care for the state's homeless population. Mississippi governor Kirk Fordice has established a "Faith and Families" project in which state social-service agencies work with churches to "adopt" welfare families. The federal government provides some 350 grant programs for social-service nonprofits, many of them with religious roots. U.S. Senators John Ashcroft and Dan Coats have proposed legislation allowing individuals a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for donations made to charities, including religious groups, that serve the poor.<p>The enthusiasm for religion-based providers is well-deserved. Christian-based substance-abuse recovery programs, for example, reportedly boast a 70 to 80 percent success rate, whereas secular therapeutic programs report an average success rate of 6 to 10 percent. Research by Roger Freeman of Harvard University shows that black inner-city youth who attend church are 47 percent less likely to drop out of school, 54 percent less likely to use drugs, and 50 percent less likely to engage in criminal activities than those without religious values. Columnist William Raspberry of the <i>Washington Post</i> recently asserted that the most successful social programs "are those that are driven -- even if only tacitly -- by moral or religious values."<p>So it's beginning to look like th
e secular state wants some old-time religion. But what impact will increased state funding have on religion-based programs? Will more money allow them to help more needy people, or will it dilute -- or pollute -- their ability to exert the moral and spiritual influence that makes them uniquely successful? <p>In Michigan, where Engler has aggressively collaborated with religious nonprofits, the results are mixed. State agencies tend to treat these nonprofits not as equals, but as subcontracting functionaries doing the government's bidding. State contracts almost always come with conditions -- regulations that sometimes diminish a religious group's best assets: its personal involvement, its credibility with the community, and its commitment to addressing not only physical needs but spiritual ones as well<p>Moreover, religious nonprofits that contract with the state may, as a result, shift their purpose from the transformation of lives to the mere delivery of services. The most effective groups challenge those who embrace faith to live out its moral implications in every significant area of their lives, from breaking drug or alcohol addictions and repairing family relationships to recommitting themselves to the value of honest work. But state social-service contracts aren't mainly concerned with such outcomes; they focus on the number of meals served, beds available, and checks cashed. <p>
<b>Engler Calls in the Army</b><p>The aim of his welfare-reform efforts, Engler says, is to smash the entitlement mentality, promote the idea that aid entails responsibility, and empower the private sector (particularly the religious community) to deliver welfare services. To accomplish the first two goals, Michigan in 1992 began requiring recipients of Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) to sign a "social contract" with the state that committed them to work, job training, or volunteer service for at least 20 hours per week. To accomplish the third goal, Engler has increased collaboration with and funding of religiously based social-service groups.<p>Some public-private partnerships in the state are still too young to afford solid conclusions about their effects. Nonetheless, the most formal and visible partnership in social welfare in Michigan -- the state's annual $9.5 million contract with the Salvation Army to assist the homeless -- sheds some light on the deficiencies of public-private collaboration.<p>In December 1991, the Michigan Department of Social Services (DSS) awarded the Salvation Army a $3 million grant to provide emergency shelter and two meals per day to homeless individuals, either in its own facilities or by "subcontracting" with other private shelter operators. The partnership resulted from the expectation that homelessness would increase following Engler's most dramatic welfare reform: terminating the state's General Assistance (GA) program. Until October 1991, the GA program had provided about $240 million annually to childless, able-bodied, nonworking adults. Critics charged that without assistance, many of these individuals would become homeless. State officials wanted an inexpensive but effective initiative to prepare for such a contingency.<p>	The scale of this partnership is impressive. In the first year, the Army provided over 680,000 "nights of service" (a bed and a meal) to the state's homeless. The initial grant of $3 million has increased each year to reach $9.5 mi
llion in 1995. This works out to $10 per day per client and allows the Army a modest administrative overhead of 3 percent. From the time GA was terminated until March of this year, the Army and its subcontractors provided nearly 2.9 million nights of service to homeless individuals.<p>	From the state's perspective, this partnership has been, in the words of Rusty Hills, Engler's public-affairs director, "absolutely magnificent." In one fell swoop, Engler saved the taxpayers millions of dollars, dealt a significant blow to the entitlement culture, encouraged thousands of individuals to leave the dole and find jobs, and provided homeless people food and shelter far more cost-effectively than ever before. Despite the increase in homelessness that followed the GA cuts, state officials say, the Army and its subcontractors have risen to the challenge. Shirley Nowakowski, the director of energy, housing, and emergency programs for Michigan's DSS, says the Salvation Army partnership is a success because "everyone who wants a bed has a bed." Jerry Miller, the state's director of social services, agrees, noting that the Salvation Army is providing services far more cheaply than the state could.<p>	Leonard Krugel, the Army's director of divisional services and the point man in the Army's contract with the state, is also pleased with the collaboration. He explains that the Army would have had to confront an increased homeless population anyway, and having state dollars helped pay the bills. More importantly, Krugel argues that the partnership has provided the Army "regulatory relief." <p>	For example, city officials in Detroit recently passed a new ordinance requiring homeless shelters to provide, among other things, dietitian-approved menus, quiet study rooms for schoolchildren, and expensive fire-suppression sprinkler systems. The ordinance already has put some private shelter operators out of business, and critics say the regulations are excessive and unrealistic. But for the Army, Krugel explains, "all of [these reg
ulations] are outside the sphere of this contract."Just Send the Checks?<p>	Former Army staffers and outside observers, however, are less sanguine about the partnership. The Army has a long history of providing emergency shelter. But it also knows a lot about how to help the homeless break the cycle of dependency. Salvation Army chapters in Michigan offer drug rehabilitation programs, educational services, and job-training seminars. Nearly every Army center has a chapel on site, and Bible study classes and spiritual support groups are common. <p>   The state contract, however, is limited to emergency services only. It includes neither the practical nor spiritual functions that have distinguished the Army over the years. With state-supplied funds, the Army subcontracts with shelters and certifies that they meet minimum standards of health and safety and provide the basic services of food and shelter. The Army neither provides consulting services to the subcontracting shelters nor assists them in designing programs to serve the homeless. It simply acts as a conduit for state funds, distributing money to 116 shelters (including religion-based ones) throughout the state.<p>	The contract represents an enormous missed opportunity. On the one hand, state officials seemed to focus nearly exclusively on the cost effectiveness of turning over care of the homeless to the Army. On the other hand, Army staffers failed to insist that their emphasis on moral renewal be implemented in participating shelters.<p> 	"The Salvation Army has taken a very myopic approach to its role, that of being a fiduciary -- not a program monitor, just a 'pass through,'" says Dan Piepszowski, the Army's former director of social services in eastern Michigan who is now with the Catholic Archdiocese of Detroit. "I don't think the Army was able to fully integrate their church ministry agenda into the operation of the contract." Piepszowski says, for example, that there has been no clear ministerial role for core officers -- the heart of the Arm
y's religious leadership -- at the shelters. <p>	"They've got to figure out who they are in this collaboration," Piepszowski says. "Do we want to send the checks or do we want to work our magic? They've opted to send the checks."<p>	It appears that the Michigan DSS also had a too-limited vision of what it wanted out of the partnership. Leonard Krugel, for example, does not know why the state chose to work with the Army rather than some other entity. When asked the same question, Shirley Nowakowski of the DSS said that the state selected the Army because it has corporate offices in several Michigan counties. She seemed unaware that the Army, as a religion-based provider, might address moral and behavioral problems underlying chronic homelessness more effectively than typical secular programs. Neither did state welfare director Jerry Miller. He said the fact that the Army is a religious organization never entered his thinking. Rather, according to these officials, they wanted to ensure that every Michigan citizen who needed emergency shelter would get it -- and they believed the Salvation Army could deliver.<p>	Sam Chambers, the director of social services in Wayne County (which includes Detroit), complains that the state was never interested in a genuine partnership in which the Army could pursue its holistic approach to homelessness. "Case planning wasn't part of [the partnership]. Rebuilding people's lives wasn't part of it. . . . All that was bought by the state was direct emergency services -- a 'cot and a hot.'" Critics say the Army's involvement is not helping Michigan transform homeless individuals into productive citizens, but is simply feeding and sheltering a dependent homeless population more efficiently. All that has changed, they maintain, is who signs the checks for the individual shelters.<p><b>The Dole and the Soul</b><p>The drawbacks of state funding go deeper than the loss to welfare recipients of the benefits of a spiritual ministry. The nonprofits themselves risk losing their unique cap
acity to help the needy. For example, a nonprofit's credibility in the eyes of its beneficiaries may be tainted by its association with state agencies. Rev. Eddie Edwards, who oversees a community-development organization in east Detroit called Joy of Jesus, explains: "When we are working with people in the community, helping them become self-sufficient, helping them get off welfare, it would be extremely difficult to tell them to get off welfare if we were on some kind of public assistance."<p>	Other problems, though, exist largely because of the way public-private partnerships are now conducted. The impact of public funds on REACH, Inc., another church-based ministry in Michigan, illustrates several pitfalls into which such groups can stumble.<p>	REACH began as the brainchild of several lay members of Detroit's 12th Street Baptist Church, who started an outreach to senior citizens in the surrounding neighborhood. The group established a day-care center, purchased and rehabilitated crack houses, and even opened up a local restaurant. Rev. Lee Earl pastored the church, and REACH's offices were housed in the church building. As the group's vision for community renewal expanded, some members wanted to pursue government funding. In its early years, church members and private companies had financed the ministry's work. Earl says he was not sure that "the benefits of government funding outweighed the challenges," but his was a minority voice. <p>	In the early 1990s, the church won grants from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Small Business Administration, and the city government to expand its housing-redevelopment efforts and small-business training. But with the dollars came headaches. For one thing, bureaucratic sluggishness delayed their redevelopment program. Earl describes how government bureaucrats held up the processing of contracts because they lacked computer skills. "Their turnaround time might be a month and your turnaround might be a day," Earl says. "But you've got to move by
 their timetable." <p>	Local government officials overseeing REACH's work also lacked "street sense," Earl says. When REACH rehabilitated homes with private money, it negotiated only with the city's building authority. "The building authority was flexible to the realities of rehabbing," he says. "For example, the houses have to have gutters and doors and other parts made of aluminum. But you can't put that stuff on until the house has people in it, because the crack heads will steal the aluminum and sell it for drugs." Building authorities typically approved the inspection as long as the materials were purchased and ready to be put on. Once the home was approved, the family could move in, and church volunteers put on the aluminum within 24 hours. <p>	Once REACH received local, state, and federal funds, other agencies, including the community development department, assumed various responsibilities for oversight. According to Earl, the officials there did not understand the realities of rehabilitation in the inner-city. "They wanted [the aluminum] on the house before they would even come out and inspect it," Earl says. "They said, 'Put it on the house and we'll be out within seven working days.' Well, it wouldn't stay on the house for seven working hours!"<p><b>Up Close and Impersonal</b><p>	One attraction of religion-based social-service groups is that they tend to be more personable than their secular counterparts. Workers in the religion-based providers often come from the local neighborhood and can relate well to clients. Moreover, ministry staff are often volunteers or are underpaid; they are there because they view their work as a calling rather than a job. Nearly everyone in social service agrees that a friendly, supportive environment stimulates improvements in behavior among welfare recipients. Consequently, the "impersonalization" or "bureaucratization" of a ministry can severely undercut its effectiveness.<p>	The process of "impersonalization" unfolds in a variety of ways. Ministries complain th
at government funding brings enormous paperwork that steals time away from face-to-face ministry. In addition, government often dictates that groups receiving public funds hire only staffers with specific educational degrees, such as a masters of social work (M.S.W.), or with certification in professional substance-abuse counseling programs. Such "professionalization" can undermine the informal, relational style that once prevailed between staff and recipients of care.<p>	"Part of the criticism of us now is that we're too professional, too polished; that we can't relate to the things that [local residents] are going through," says Linda Smith, a REACH staff member since its inception. In the organization's early years, says former executive director Charlene Johnson, about 70 to 100 volunteers participated in various aspects of the ministry. Today, REACH's office "volunteers" number three -- all from the federally funded Americorps program. REACH's current director, Pamela Martin Turner, says the organization is "developing personnel policies, formalized job descriptions with job titles and salary ranges, and other things that happen when you become more bureaucratic."<p>	Gary Bayer, who used to oversee a Detroit homeless shelter serving substance abusers, argues that ex-clients who have overcome their addictions make some of the best employees. They have walked the same streets as the drug abusers they now serve; they have the authority to challenge them, and teach them how to get off drugs and stay off them. But under the government's credentialing requirements, such "homegrown" leaders often aren't eligible for employment as counselors.<p>	While credentialing requirements are appropriate in certain kinds of social-service work (no one wants volunteer "doctors" providing them medical care), they may be unnecessary elsewhere. In Detroit, DSS director Sam Chambers and his friends in the religious social-service sector are trying to design more creative programs with a greater role for paraprofessionals and v
olunteers. Unfortunately, such collaboration seems to be exceptional.<p><b>Organizational Drift</b><p>	At its heart, a religion-based service provider aims to transform lives. Such a goal can be difficult to measure by objective, quantitative data. That's why program leaders, when conferring with supporters in the private sector, typically tell stories. Progress in personal transformation is often judged by such things as changed language, faithful attendance in education/training programs, increased punctuality and personal responsibility, willingness to work, improved social relations with staff, reaffiliation with family, avoidance of drugs, commitment to financial accountability, greater reliability, and increasing initiative and enthusiasm. These often intangible and "qualitative" changes are the very ones credited with permanent socioeconomic improvement. <p>	Government, by contrast, focuses on objective statistics, usually to measure the number of commodities provided to a needy person or neighborhood. Consequently, nonprofits receiving government funds start counting numbers and recording statistics. And to ensure continued receipt of state dollars, they may start investing more effort in programs that produce easily quantifiable results rather than in holistic ministry that produces qualitative change.<p>	REACH's Linda Smith reports that the tone of the group's programs has changed. Before receiving major government grants, the ministry emphasized "human development," with great attention to moral and spiritual matters. "Our experience showed that if we didn't do this, we could move people into a house, but they'd trash it and not make the mortgage payments," says former director Johnson. Now the ministry's help is more "commodified" (providing people material goods such as houses) and its work is more project-oriented than relationship-oriented. Under Johnson's tenure, the ministry's largest annual budget was $1 million, distributed across youth, family, and economic-development programs. Today, 
the thrust of REACH's energy is on housing rehabilitation and construction, programs for which they can obtain major federal and state grants. REACH recently secured a $1.7 million grant for a major housing initiative.<p>
"Government funding will not realistically finance your Christian, holistic, or evangelistic purpose. You can't use it for that," says Virgil Gulker, a guru of the religion-based service community who has founded numerous projects in Michigan for the poor. "So you end up evaluating quantitative things -- how many houses did you build, how many meals did you serve, how many jobs did you find -- that will have no impact on your organization's original purposes, other than to diminish that original purpose or mission."<p>
<b>Secularization</b><p>	Gulker's insights touch on the crux of the issue of government funding of religion-based providers: the potential danger of secularization. REACH's current executive director, Pamela Martin Turner, admits quite openly that REACH has "evolved into a more secular, more ecumenical organization than in past years. . . . To some large extent, the work of the past was primarily based on faith, on a commitment to spiritual and religious values. Whereas now, on the staff level, there may be some internal spiritual value that compels people to come to work, but that's not the explicit understanding. People come to work because it's their job and they're expected to do a good job."<p>	The de-emphasis on the spiritual comes with a cost: REACH staffers are less likely to bring their religious convictions to bear in addressing, confronting, and meeting the needs of the needy. "We do not talk about the spiritual needs at all," says Smith. "When we worked out of the church, I knew every day, without a doubt, why I was there." Now, she says, "some days I come to work and people come in and I feel like I can't help them because they need more than to just talk about putting them in a house. It's a struggle for me."<p>	People of faith, of course, are concerned about the threat of secularization. But others ought to be worried as well, for the dilution of a ministry's religious distinctiveness may remove the very element that makes it so effective in addressing social problems. <p>	Even ministries known for their spiritually integrated approach are susceptible. The Detroit-based Joy of Jesus accepts no government funding, but financial problems led it to incorporate a separate, not explicitly religious, nonprofit partner organization called R-3 that solicits state funds. These are used principally in the organization's housing-redevelopment program. The ministry also moved its job training program to R-3 because private donations were insufficient to maintain it. Instructor Kevin Feldman reports that 
he used to integrate biblical principles in the training curriculum and pray with his students, but had to stop once the organization received government funding. In Feldman's view, the result has been that "our success rate has dramatically declined." Fewer individuals are completing the program and fewer are finding and retaining jobs. <P>	After reviewing this ledger of potential pitfalls, some faith-based groups in Michigan have decided that accepting government funds is too risky. "In general, there's a need for collaborative effort between the public and private sectors," says Joel Samy of American Family Hope, a Michigan nonprofit that helps the working poor. "But it's in the best interests of a church-based ministry to have minimal involvement with government at the funding level." Like Virgil Gulker and others, Samy worries that religion-based providers will exchange their original mission -- with its emphasis on spiritual awakeningfor a governmental agenda. <p><b>Exceptions to the Rule</b><p>	Although the problems afflicting religious nonprofits in their collaboration with the state of Michigan are serious, they do not seem to be inevitable. Some religious agencies have been able to work with government entities, accept tax dollars, and avoid the pitfalls identified above. If Michigan builds on these successful examples of collaboration rather than replicating its faulty models, then Engler's goal of transforming lives by cooperating with nonprofits in social welfare could be advanced.<p>	Detroit Rescue Mission Ministries (DRMM) provides substance-abuse programs and emergency shelter for homeless men and women. It enjoys excellent relations with Wayne County's Sam Chambers and has collaborated for decades with the county department of social services. Chambers has established a community-wide planning board, including several religion-based providers, to discuss policy. Chambers welcomes input from the religious nonprofits. These groups, he explains, are closer to the needs, more "user-friendly,"
 and less bureaucratic and intimidating. Noting that Detroit has 4,000 churches but only 33 welfare offices, Chambers says it is obvious he can meet needs more effectively by tapping into the religious sector. Such groups "do a better job because they tend to treat the whole man," he says.<p>	Aware of the church-state issues involved, Chambers says his evaluations of the religious nonprofits his department works with are "outcome-based." His office enforces health and safety regulations and conducts financial audits, but does not interfere with ministries' internal policies and procedures. There is no attempt to force groups to change their holistic approach or extirpate their religious sensibilities. Chambers says he works with DRMM because the ministry's track record is stellar: It has helped turn around the lives of some of the toughest clients in the welfare system.<p>	This partnership works not only because the approach Chambers takes is one of genuine, respectful, and pragmatic collaboration, but also because DRMM has a clear vision for its ministry and strong leadership. Its president, Don DeVos, says he'll refuse any government grant that compromises the ministry's commitment to holistic ministry. So far, it seems, he has.<p>	In Grand Rapids, Bethany Christian Services works with the Kent County Department of Social Services to provide foster care for at-risk children and residential care for abused and neglected children and juvenile sexual offenders. Its relationship with government is, like DRMM's, cordial and long-standing. John Cole, the program manager for the local DSS, is the ministry's principal government contact. Like Chambers, Cole takes a results-oriented and respectful approach to the partnership. Cole says he "doesn't implement any policy without first developing it in draft form and asking the private groups what they think about it." His staff meets with BCS staff monthly, and he meets personally with BCS leaders quarterly to discuss policy design and implementation. <p>	Unfortunate
ly, according to Cole, this kind of genuine and broad-based collaboration is rare in Michigan. He says that, despite the governor's strong support for privatization, most county welfare offices are biased against purchasing welfare services from private nonprofits. Because of the entrenched state bureaucracy, Cole explains, "There's a preference for county departments to provide their own services." And even when local welfare departments do purchase services from nonprofits, they do not do so as part of a broad, genuine, partnership. "They may purchase services but I don't think they really believe that that's the way they ought to go. I've been in meetings where they [government officials] are very critical of the [private] agencies," Cole says. And at the state level, he says, "the arrangements are very much businesslike and one-sided," even "adversarial" at times.<p><b>Redefining the Relationship</b><p>	Some of the most fruitful state collaborations with religion-based social welfare groups in Michigan appear to rest largely on the goodwill of certain government officials who treat nonprofits as equals and are more interested in enabling religiously based organizations to transform lives than they are in rigorously enforcing a church-state divide. This is a shaky foundation for the partnerships, since such individuals could be replaced by less sympathetic officials. Clearly, a stronger foundation for public-private partnerships is needed. And it must be built soon, before, in our zeal for welfare reform and "devolution," a whole superstructure of arrangements between government and nonprofits is erected. <p>	Some religiously rooted groups will, of course, continue to avoid any involvement with state contracts as they offer help to the needy, and their effectiveness bolsters the case for others to do likewise. But some ministries believe that relying on public funds through state and federal agencies is desirable and potentially beneficial. My investigation into private non-profits in Michigan suggests s
everal steps that both government and faith-based providers could take to guard the integrity of groups that seek out government grants and contracts.<p>	To start, state lawmakers and agency officials need to listen more attentively to the good Samaritans on the front lines. When big government imperiously issues decrees from on high, its private "partners" bust their budgets trying to conform. Genuine collaboration would mean, at best, that ministries would have some say in designing the regulations. Or, at least, that government entities would allow their grassroots partners flexibility in achieving the intentions of the regulations, if not the letter of the law. Otherwise, "working together" means that ministries accomplish less with the "help" they receive from government than they would have in the absence of a state contract.<p>	Politicians must redefine "public-private partnership" to go beyond the "delivery system" model, which is principally concerned with saving money, not transforming lives. In this model, the state decides what services will be offered and then pays private groups to deliver them. Some recent initiatives by Engler suggest he is on the right track. For example, Engler's "Clergy Summit" in October shows an awareness not only of the cost-effectiveness of outreach by the religious community, but also of that community's moral authority in low-income neighborhoods. At the meeting, state officials are expected to solicit the help of pastors in publicizing welfare services. Says an Engler spokesman, "If we can tap into the moral authority and trust that the pastors have, we are much more likely to reach people than if we just hope that some bureaucratic edict from the impersonal state government is suddenly going to make things happen." Absolutely right.<p>	In addition, state officials are now discussing how to broaden their arrangement with the Salvation Army. Social service director Jerry Miller says the state now recognizes the partnership should go beyond the provision of emergency 
services: "We need to work to get [the homeless] into transitional housing" -- and, eventually, permanently off the streets. It remains to be seen whether the Army can conduct this additional work in a way that takes full advantage of its strengths as a religion-based provider of social services.<p>	The Engler administration can go even further. It can hold up the work of officials like Sam Chambers and John Cole as examples of a smart way to develop genuine, effective partnerships with religious organizations. It's not enough for Engler to praise collaboration with these nonprofits. His administration must clearly define the kind of collaboration that is desirable -- and it should look more like the partnership between Wayne County and the Detroit Rescue Mission than the current partnership between Lansing and the Salvation Army.<p>Finally, government officials must acknowledge the value of a religion-based, holistic approach to serving the needy, and take the necessary actions to ensure that ministries agreeing to work with the state do not thereby stumble into the traps discussed. The government welfare system has failed, not only because it is a poor deliverer of the standard package of welfare benefits, but because the package itself is flawed. Cash and commodities are not the things that transform poor people's lives. Religious welfare providers have a better record in changing lives not only because they deliver services more effectively, but because their services are different. They provide "goods" like love, emotional support, spiritual instruction, trust, accountability, moral authority, hope, character training, and basic life skillsall in the context of personal relationships with the poor. They suffer with and walk alongside needy people until those people are able to walk out of the underclass.<p>	Any arrangement with state agencies that fails to give this level of autonomy to religiously grounded outreach efforts may serve the interests of government bureaucrats or certain activists for the 
poor. But it will not, in the long run, help the needy to help themselves.<p><b>AMY L. SHERMAN</B>, <i>a visiting fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, is writing a book on urban ministry</i>.

John, 10, is one of America's children who waits. He waits for
a home, and he has been waiting nearly all of his life. When John
was a toddler, his drug-addicted mom lost her parental rights,
and claimed not to know who the father was. John has been legally
free to be adopted since he was three, but instead has lived in
state-run foster homes and group homes. While his childhood slips
away, John's social workers debate his best interests and the
programs they hope will address them. But this skinny kid who
loves baseball knows better: &quot;I'm all wrapped up in programs,&quot;
he says. &quot;What I need is a mom.&quot;  

<P>Across the country,
there are 50,000 foster children like John, who no longer live
with their mother or father and have been declared by courts as
free to be adopted, but who languish for months or years in state-run,
state-funded substitute care. On any given day, nearly 400,000
other children-none of them eligible for adoption-can be found
in government foster homes, group homes, and shelters. Many of
them are kept there by absentee parents clinging to the legal rights
to their children. 

<P>Foster care and adoption in America have sunk
to a state of near-catastrophe. 

<P>
According to the American Public
Welfare Association, the population of children in substitute
care is growing 33 times faster than the U.S. child population
in general. During each of the past 10 years, more children have
entered the system than exited. Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot;
from foster care by turning 18 with no permanent family; 40 percent
of all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.  

<P>
What was for most of America's
history an entirely private endeavor has become a massive, inefficient
government system. State agencies consistently fail to recruit
enough families for the children eligible for adoption every year;
potential parents often are turned down because of racial considerations,
or turned off by protracted and unnecessary waiting periods; cumbersome
state regulations extend to private adoption agencies and can
even prohibit private attorneys from handling adoptions. The result
is that tens of thousands of children are now free to be adopted
but have nowhere to go. 

<P>
This is the dirty little secret of the
welfare state: Every child is adoptable, and there are waiting
lists of families ready to take in even the most emotionally troubled
and physically handicapped children. Government adoption policies
are utterly failing in their most basic purpose-to quickly place
children who are free to be adopted into permanent homes. 

<P>
The
problem lies not with the children. What keeps kids like John
bound to state care are the tentacles of a bureaucratic leviathan:
a public funding scheme that rewards and extends poor-quality
foster care; an anti-adoption bias that creates numerous legal
and regulatory barriers; and a culture of victimization that places
the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being of their
children. 

<P>
I can identify with these kids. I was a foster child
in a family that cared for 110 children. That family-my family-adopted
me in the early 1970s. Years later, as a student at Harvard, I
happened upon a book of statistics on children in state care.
I was stunned to learn that decades of research, policymaking,
and government funding had only intensified the system's failures.
I was one of the lucky ones, but luck will not stem the tide of
parentless children. By the year 2000, well over a million children
will enter foster care, and tens of thousands of kids will become
eligible for adoption. Unless the government apparatus of foster
care and adoption is dismantled, these children could spend their
childhoods wishing for what most people take for granted: stability,
a family that will last longer than a few months, a last name.

<P><CENTER><B>Subsidizing</B></CENTER><BR>
Failure For years the rallying cry of many children's activists
has been: &quot;More money!&quot; The National Commission on Family
Foster Care, convened by the Child Welfare League of America,
says that &quot;family foster care and other child welfare services
have never been given the resources necessary&quot; to meet federal
standards, and calls for a &quot;fully funded array of child and
family welfare services.&quot; When it comes to child welfare,
rare is the research article that does not call for more money
and further research. 

<P>
America already is spending $10 billion
a year on foster care and adoption services through public agencies.
Federal dollars now account for nearly a third of all foster care
funding, with most of the rest coming from state coffers. California
alone spends at least $635 million a year on substitute care;
the District of Columbia spent $53 million last year on a system
that was so poorly run it recently was taken over by a federal
court. 

<P>
According to the ACLU, a year in foster care costs about
$17,500 per child, including per-child payments to foster families
and administrative costs of child welfare agencies. That does
not include counseling and treatment programs for biological parents
or foster parent recruitment and training. The <I>San Francisco
Chronicle</I> reports that per-child costs for foster home or
group home care have increased more than fourfold in the past
decade. 

<P>
The problem with foster care is not the level of government
spending, it is the structure of that spending. The funding system
gives child-welfare bureaucracies incentives to keep even free-to-be-adopted
kids in state care. State-social-service agencies are neither
rewarded for helping children find adoptive homes nor penalized
for failing to do so in a reasonable amount of time. There is
no financial incentive to recruit adoptive families. And as more
children enter the system, so does the tax money to support them
in substitute care.  

<P>
By contrast, private adoption agencies are
paid to find suitable families quickly, even if it means going
out of state. The public social-service bureaucracy, nearly overwhelmed
by other urban problems, has little to gain by devoting extra
resources to adoption. Private adoption agencies are free to focus
on finding homes for kids and are financially motivated to do
so. Private adoption agencies are paid according to the number
of successful placements; public agencies, in a sense, are paid
for the number of children they prevent from being adopted. 

<P>
There
is a similar reward for foster parents to keep kids in state care.
By law, adoption subsidies cannot exceed foster care payments,
and in practice they are almost always lower. According to the
National Foster Parent Association, foster families in 1993 received
anywhere from $200 to $530 a month for each child under age 10,
plus additional money from states and counties. The subsidies
are tax free, and foster parents receive more money as the children
under their care get older. So the longer the system fails to
find permanent homes for kids, the more money flows to those fostering.


<P>
In some states, payments to foster parents caring for four kids
equal the after-tax income of a $35,000-a-year job. The money
is tax free. It doesn't take much imagination to see that paying
people to parent can lead to mischief. Parents are not held accountable
for how they spend their federal and state allocations; for too
many foster parents, the children in their homes are reduced to
mere income streams. If foster parents don't wish to adopt the
children under their care, what incentive do they have to alert
other parents hoping to adopt?  

<P>
Let me be very clear: There are
many dedicated and compassionate people in the foster care system,
serving as case workers, counselors, and foster parents. My own
experience in foster care was a positive one. But I have seen
and heard of too many that were heartbreaking failures.

<P><CENTER><B>Special-Needs
Stigma</B></CENTER><BR>
I have heard perhaps a thousand times that the children
who wait cannot be adopted because they have &quot;special needs.&quot;
Of course they do-they need parents. They require love and nurturing
that endures. But the &quot;special needs&quot; referred to by
advocates come with federal dollars attached. In 1980, Congress
started offering states matching funds to assist the adoption
of children with special needs, which included children of various
ages, ethnic backgrounds, and those with severe mental and physical
handicaps who may require expensive care. The subsidy was to become
available only after a state determined that it could not reasonably
expect to place a child without it. 

<P>
As with so many other federal
subsidies, states quickly expanded their slice of the government
pie by broadening the criteria for receiving money. Today, nearly
two- thirds of all foster children qualify. In some states, special-needs
children include kids who have a sibling; are black, biracial,
Hispanic, or Native American; are &quot;older,&quot; as defined
by the state; or have been in foster care longer than 18 months.


<P>
Two leading adoption organizations report that there are no national
figures available that break down the type of need, or indicate
the number of children who have physical or emotional handicaps
that would require extra expenses by their new parents. This leaves
the door wide open to all sorts of graft and fiscal abuse.  

<P>But
there are other unintended and unconscionable consequences of
this masquerade. One is that the needs of very vulnerable children
are downplayed. The plight of a teen-age girl in a wheelchair
who requires constant attention is trivialized when she is included
in the same group as children whose &quot;needs&quot; are that
they are eight years old. Another result-one I see often-is that
local social-services departments discourage families from adopting
by telling them, &quot;Oh, these kids aren't for you. We only
have <I>special-needs</I> children.&quot; This emphasis on kids
with the most challenging emotional and physical handicaps unwittingly
contributes to the false notion that foster children are &quot;unadoptable.&quot;
Ironically, the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980
that established special-needs matching funds warned that children
must not be &quot;routinely classified as 'hard-to-place.'&quot;
Government funding has had just that effect, and it is helping
to delay the placement of children ready for adoption.  

<P>
I am convinced
that the entire incentive structure for foster care and public
agency adoption helps perpetuate the system's failure. It is a
failure rooted in the notion that government funding is the panacea
for family disintegration. The National Commission on Family Foster
Care claims the foster care crisis is &quot;the logical result
of two decades of national neglect in providing funding and services
for children, youths, and their families.&quot; On the contrary,
as long as these children come with tax money attached-with little
in the way of accountability-those invested in perpetuating the
system will do little to reform it. As one foster child put it:
&quot;Everywhere I go, somebody gets money to keep me from having
a mom and dad.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Anti-Adoption Bias</B></CENTER><BR>  
Government funding schemes
and inefficiencies that prevent adoption exist within a larger
framework: a steadily growing bias against adoption. Despite all
the sociological evidence of the benefits of adoption, the conviction
that a child does best in a permanent, loving, and stable home
is all but missing from the ethos of state-run substitute care.
How can this be? 

<P>
In both the popular and elite media, a deep suspicion
of adoption is all too evident. Marvin Olasky, a professor at
the University of Texas at Austin, has noted that a New York Times
series on adoption included such headlines as &quot;The Ties that
Traumatize&quot; and &quot;Adoption is Getting Some Harder Looks.&quot;
And what do <I>Playboy</I>, <I>Mirabella</I>, and <I>Good Housekeeping
</I>have in common? As Olasky says, each has joined the offensive
with an article that warns readers against the &quot;distasteful
&#133; bartering of lives&quot; that supposedly is adoption. 

<P>
Television
writers would have us believe that adoption has no happy endings.
TV portrays adoption as shady, risky, and shameful. Over the last
year, a dozen programs featured adoption in their plots, and in
every case the adoption agency was depicted as callously profit-driven.
The adopting families were white, middle-class couples who kept
secrets from the authorities or from each other. Birth mothers
were unfairly portrayed as selfish or disturbed. The programs
paid little attention to the well-being of the children. 

<P>
Groups
such as Concerned United Birthparents (CUB) help give legal expression
to this bias. CUB was behind the &quot;Baby Jessica&quot; case
that led to the removal of a two-year-old from her adoptive family.
Groups like CUB claim that adoption is a feminist issue, that
only the outmoded ideal of a two-parent family makes the notion
of adoption palatable. As Olasky notes, Joss Sawyer's book <I>Death
by Adoption</I> calls adoption &quot;a violent act, a political
act of aggression toward a woman.&quot; 

<P>
Perhaps more significant,
however, is the battle against transracial adoption that has been
waged by the National Association of Black Social Workers (NABSW)
for more than two decades. Its 1972 position paper reads: &quot;Black
children belong physically, psychologically, and culturally in
Black families in order that they receive the total sense of themselves.&quot;
Otherwise, the group claims, black children &quot;will not have
the background and knowledge which is necessary to survive in
a racist society.&quot; Our institute has received letters from
adoptive families in many states who have been barred from adopting
transracially. According to the North American Council on Adoptable
Children, state adoption laws may allow for race-matching, but
 &quot;their preferencing policy isn't written down.&quot; 
 
<P>When
it comes to transracial adoptions, there is no longer much doubt
that current policies are bringing the greatest harm to the very
community they were intended to help: African Americans. Just
consider the numbers: Though black families adopt at very high
rates, black children represent nearly half of foster kids waiting
to be adopted. Fifteen percent of all children in America are
black; but 40 percent of the children in foster care are black.
State delays in finding homes for black children, as case workers
search for &quot;culturally consistent&quot; placements, can keep
kids languishing in state care for years. 

<P>
&quot;These policies
are seriously harmful to black children, requiring that black
kids who could get good homes be left in foster care,&quot; Harvard
law professor Elizabeth Bartholet told the <I>New York Times</I>.
&quot;There is not an iota of evidence in all the empirical studies
that transracial adoption does any harm at all.&#133;There is
plenty of evidence that delay in adoption does do harm.&quot;


<P>
Such policies reveal a profound misunderstanding of the nature
and effects of adoption. To insist that successful adoption means
placing a child in a family of his  racial or ethnic heritage
is to overlook what every adopted child understands intuitively:
Adoption is not easy. No matter how much a child's family looks
like him, it does not alter the fact that someone gave him up.
Having the same skin color as the people in his household doesn't
automatically erase that. Only love does. As someone who grew
up in a multi-ethnic family, I find it incomprehensible when people
tell me that I cannot love my siblings the way I could if our
skin color matched.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Fallout</B></CENTER><BR>  
Attitudes against adoption, whether
racially motivated or not, share at least two flaws. First, they
ignore all the best evidence indicating that adoption leads to
positive outcomes for kids. Last year, the Search Institute of
Minneapolis released the largest study ever of adopted adolescents
and their families (see table above). The study, in which 881
adopted children and 1,262 adoptive parents were surveyed, found
that children who were adopted fared as well as or better than
a national sample of non-adopted adolescents in self-esteem, mental
health, school achievement-even the amount of time spent each
week helping others. Adopted adolescents were more likely to agree
or strongly agree with the statement &quot;There is a lot of love
in my family&quot; than were non-adopted children. 

<P>
Sociological
studies of transracial adoptions are equally encouraging. Rita
Simon of American University has conducted a 20-year longitudinal
study of transracial adoption. She found that such adoptions cause
none of the problems alleged by the NABSW. Rather, black children
adopted into white families typically &quot;grow up with a positive
sense of their black identity and a knowledge of their history
and culture.&quot; And such children, Simon says, often possess
&quot;special interpersonal talents and skills at bridging cultures.&quot;


<P>
Second, the anti-adoption movement fortifies the legal and bureaucratic
obstacles that are keeping children from finding permanent homes.
There are numerous state laws that needlessly complicate or block
the process. In Minnesota, for example, if filing deadlines and
other technical requirements of state adoption law are not precisely
met, parents can be prevented for months or years from finalizing
a child's adoption. Thanks to horror stories of baby-selling,
four states have laws that ban independent adoptions (though exceptions
are permitted). Despite this, more than 45,000 adoptions in 1992
were conducted through private agencies or independent agents-the
vast majority of them successfully. 

<P>
My office receives numerous
letters from people eager to adopt but frustrated by laws and
bureaucrats. One woman recently wrote: &quot;My husband and I
decided we would like to adopt a little girl, thinking we had
a lot of love, nurturing, and stability to give a child who had
been abandoned or abused. Almost immediately I hit a brick wall.&quot;
Her local department of social services-in a state with more than
5,000 foster children free to be adopted-told her it was &quot;not
taking new cases&quot; of families willing to adopt foster children.
A couple wrote that of their three adopted children, &quot;two
[had] lingered in foster care, one of whom we were not able to
adopt until he was age 18.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Adoptable You</B></CENTER><BR>  
There is at least
one other mistaken notion that feeds the legal and cultural bias
against adoption-the idea that many of the children in foster
care are simply not adoptable. My own experience suggests otherwise,
as I was an older child when my foster parents adopted me. And
my experience with parents in and outside the foster care system
tells me that every child is adoptable. 

<P>
For every child who is
ready for a permanent home, there are families waiting. It is
time to shatter the myth that adoptive parents are interested
only in &quot;healthy white babies.&quot; There are waiting lists
to adopt white children, black children, Hispanic children, infants
and teens, children with Down's syndrome and with AIDS. Private
agencies for years have found families for all types of children.
Adopt a Special Kid, a California-based service, receives more
than 1,500 inquiries annually from families interested in adopting
children with disabilities. The National Adoption Center maintains
a computerized listing of 650 qualified families waiting to embrace
disabled &quot;older&quot; children. The center reports that infants,
even the most severely disabled, are adopted almost immediately.


<P>
Outside of the thousands of families who have successfully completed
home studies and have registered with with their states, there
are no hard figures for the number of parents able and willing
to adopt. Certainly there are families who would come forward
if public agencies recruited more aggressively. Beginning in November,
1993, Massachusetts stepped up its recruitment efforts with public-service
announcements, an aggressive media campaign, adoption &quot;open
houses,&quot; and community-based recruitment. Such efforts helped
increase foster child adoptions by 47 percent in one year. 

<P>
Most
people know someone who has gone to heroic lengths to adopt. Americans
adopted more than 7,300 children from other countries in 1993,
according to the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service.
The INS estimates that the 1994 figure exceeds 8,000. Others have
spent their life savings to offer permanence to a child; domestic
adoption through private agencies or independent attorneys can
cost more than $30,000. It is not unusual for foster parents to
adopt two, five, or even 10 children under their care. Clearly,
the barriers to adoption are neither the characteristics of children
who wait nor the parents who want to care for them.

<P>
<CENTER><B>The Route toFoster Care</B></CENTER><BR>
In addition to the 50,000 children who today are
legally free to be adopted, there are hundreds of thousands more
who drift for days, months, or years within the state-run system-a
system that too often guarantees a parentless future for some
of society's most vulnerable members. 

<P>
Children enter foster care
for a variety of reasons. Mom abuses or neglects one of her kids,
dad is using drugs or is arrested for a felony, or perhaps the
parents are just having a hard time coping with the responsibilities
of parenthood. The American Public Welfare Association reports
that 70 percent of foster children enter the system because of
abuse, neglect, or &quot;parental conditions&quot;-including drug
addiction, incarceration, illness, or death. More than 600,000
kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute care, up from
434,000 in 1982. 

<P>
A profile of children in state care belies the
stigma that foster children are mostly &quot;unadoptable&quot;
troubled teens. Researchers at the Chapin Hall Center for Children
at the University of Chicago studied five states whose foster
care children make up about half of the U.S. foster care population.
They found that from 1990 to 1992, nearly 25 percent of all first
admissions to foster care were babies less than one year old.
Between 1983 and 1992, the proportion of 12- to 15-year-olds entering
substitute care in those states declined. The American Public
Welfare Association cites similar trends.   

<P>
Sadly, the youngest
children remain in the system the longest. The University of Chicago
study revealed that, after controlling for other factors, children
who enter foster care as infants remain in the system 22 percent
longer than other young children.  

<P>
The fact remains, however,
that foster care is failing children of all ages. The ACLU reports
that one in 10 foster children remains in state care longer than
7.4 years. At least 40,600 foster children have been in care for
five years or longer; another 51,300 have been in care between
three and five years. System kids, on average, live with three
different families, though 10 or more placements is not uncommon.
&quot;Every new placement is a loss,&quot; says Michael B. Pines,
a psychologist specializing in attachment disorders. &quot;The
result is that these kids begin not to trust anyone.&quot; 

<P>
<CENTER><B>Paidto Parent</B></CENTER><BR>
One of the reasons that foster care tends to ensnare
children in a legal and emotional limbo is that its bureaucracy
and incentive system attract parents who are unable or unwilling
to adopt or help find homes for the children in their care. 

<P>
Whether
adopting through private or public adoption agencies, would-be
parents must undergo a home study.  Private agencies, which must
successfully place children in homes to stay in business, are
free to set higher standards for parents than public agencies
do. Christian or other faith-based adoption agencies typically
emphasize tough standards of behavior. But this is not so for
state-run substitute care. In many states, adults who fail the
adoption home study get a consolation prize: They can become foster
parents. Deemed unworthy to serve as legal adoptive parents, these
adults are then paid handsomely to raise children in state care.

<P>
Foster homes, group homes, and public orphanages share another
vice: Their government money comes with regulations attached.
This often guarantees confusion and conflict. Private orphanages
always have been driven by a mission:  keep girls from getting
pregnant, keep children in school, expose children to the Christian
faith, and so on. They use a combination of rules and rewards,
discipline and love to fulfill their mission. Often, this isn't
allowed in a state-run group home, where it may be against the
law to hug a child, or to lock the door after midnight, or even
to advertise for a married couple to serve as housemasters.  

<P>
If
a permanent, loving family is the surest route to producing happy,
well-adjusted children, then what effect does the foster care
system, at its worst, have on countless kids? The result of the
system's delays, incentive structure, and regulatory grip is that
many former foster children ultimately remain dependent on state
services. They are wildly over-represented among welfare recipients,
the homeless, and in juvenile and adult prison populations. In
Los Angeles County, 39 percent of homeless youth are former foster
children. In New York, 23 percent of the homeless were once in
foster care; in Minneapolis, the figure is 38 percent. According
to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, former foster children make
up nearly 14 percent of America's prison population.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Culture ofVictimization</B></CENTER><BR>  

The financial disincentives to adoption and the
legal and societal biases against it do not exist in a vacuum;
they are rooted in the soil of victimization. More than half of
the children who enter foster care were abused or neglected in
their families of origin. But the current system grants &quot;victim
status&quot; to these parents. It often allows them to cling to
their parental rights as they move in and out of social service
programs. As a result, tens of thousands of children remain trapped
in foster care, never free to be adopted into stable, loving homes.


<P>
Take the case of Halie (not her real name), a two-year-old girl
who one day wouldn't eat her dinner. Her mother and mother's boyfriend
tied her to an electric heater. Hours passed, until Halie's face,
chest, and arm were disfigured. Her mother then threw her into
a cold shower, dressed her, and took her to a hospital-claiming
the child had spilled hot water on herself. After weeks of hospitalization,
Halie entered foster care. For the next 10 years, her biological
mother-coached by the local department of social services-maintained
her legal rights to the child. Case workers helped Halie's mom
to toe the official line to prove she somehow was still capable
as a parent: She married her boyfriend and had a child with him.


<P>
When Halie was 12, her case workers and a judge approved overnight
and extended visits between Halie and her biological mother. Halie's
mother rejected a judge's offer to regain custody. She didn't
want to raise Halie, but didn't want to let her go, and the state
gave her all the legal and financial help she needed. Halie spent
her teen years in group homes and foster homes. She turned 18
in foster care. 

<P>
Most states give biological parents every possible
chance to prove they are fit-while their babies grow up in state
care. A family recently wrote me about their two-year-old foster
daughter: &quot;She is precious beyond belief, and her parents
are being given chance upon chance to clean up their lives-at
her expense, as we see it. She is so adoptable by the right family,
but the system will keep her under lock and key for years if necessary
for her parents' benefit.&quot; 

<P>
In our social-work schools, counseling
centers, and government-funded research, the culture of victimization
insists that the most despicable behavior by abusive parents has
its causes in economics, racism, broken homes-anything but the
consciences and moral choices of men and women. We have devised
a foster care system that puts a vogue pop psychology ahead of
the well-being of children. This helps explain why roughly a third
of all the foster children who are reunited with their families
of origin soon return to state care. Indeed, it is the only explanation
for some of the bizarre attempts I have seen to reunite a foster
child with a parent who is clearly unwilling or unfit. 

<P>
Under federal
law, states cannot obtain federal funds for foster care unless
&quot;reasonable efforts&quot; are made to keep members of the
family of origin together (&quot;family preservation&quot;) or
to reunite the family ( &quot;family reunification&quot;). But
the federal government nowhere defines &quot;reasonable efforts,&quot;
and only a few states have specific statutes. It's a classic Catch-22:
Children are not free to be adopted until every reasonable effort
is made to return them to their biological parents. But almost
no one seems to know what constitutes a reasonable effort, that
is, what services must be offered to parents who need outside
help. 

<P>
When, for example, a public agency reports to a judge that
a mother has failed her drug-treatment program, the judge is likely
to insist that the mom enter every drug treatment program available.
So biological parents are given multiple chances to fail at parenting,
while children may bounce between state care and their family
of origin. The Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) admits
that the inability to meet &quot;reasonable efforts&quot; standards
is the primary barrier to foster child adoption. 

<P>
From my own experience
in foster care, the most difficult part was watching my brothers
and sisters return to biological parents who had burned or beaten
them, or put out cigarettes on their children's bottoms. I felt
like an accomplice. It must have been hard for my parents, who
could do nothing to stop it. 

<P>
Most foster parents, at one point
or another, must relinquish a child to a home situation that is
precarious. One foster mother of five years wrote: &quot;I have
been seriously reconsidering my position as a foster parent because
when we started this it was to try to help these children, and
I am finding out that I am not able to do that. The pain and heartbreak
of not being able to protect these children is a heavy burden
to bear.&quot; Until the system is reshaped, it is a burden that
every one of us carries.

<P>
<CENTER><B>Assignment: Adoption</B></CENTER><BR> 
It is one thing to
tolerate inefficiencies and bureaucratic delays in other areas
of public life-public toll roads, for example. Such inefficiencies
don't cost children 18 years of their lives. We do not need another
study, or blue-ribbon commission, or congressional subcommittee
hearing. When I was four years old, it didn't matter to me that
someone was getting a research grant to study the effects of foster
care on childhood development. What I wanted was a last name.


<P>
I am convinced that there are more parents willing to adopt than
there are children ready to be adopted. But the market for adoption
is frustrated by the regulatory system now in place. To create
a more efficient system, one with incentives to help rather than
abandon innocent children, we must get Big Government out of the
business of parenting. I do not mean we should create a market
in babies. I am not talking about baby-selling. I am talking about
serving babies and children by removing the barriers to their
enjoyment of stable, loving homes.  

<P>
Where parts of foster care
and adoption are privately run, competition and incentives have
led to better outcomes for children. In Michigan, where two-thirds
of foster care management is privatized, private providers spend
less per child, yet have achieved better social worker-to-child
ratios than those of state-run agencies. Adoption is, in fact,
the ultimate form of privatization: wresting authority over children's
lives from the state and allowing children to be free, to be raised
not by government but by parents.  

<P>
We must reform, state by state,
our system of transferring parental rights-from the government,
which can never be a parent, to parents who are eager and able
to bring these children into their hearts and lives. Congress
recently has taken interest in adoption reform by proposing a
$5,000 tax credit for adoptive parents. But will that tax credit
get children out of foster care more quickly? No. Does it stimulate
a market in private adoptions? No. Does it allow independent adoptions
in states where they are now outlawed? No. 

<P>
Tax credits might make
adoption a little easier for some parents, but they will not make
adoption work. To do that, we need reform at the federal and state
levels-bureaucratic reform that will shatter the incentive structure
that traps kids in foster care, and legal reform that will free
children who already have spent years in substitute care. In Massachusetts,
we call it &quot;Assignment: Adoption,&quot; a comprehensive plan
that our institute is bringing before federal lawmakers and state
governors: 

<P>
<B>Hold states accountable for reporting their progress
in finding homes for children in foster care.</B> Here is one federal
mandate that states ought to be obliged to take on. Washington
should require that states make publicly available, within 30
days of the close of each fiscal year, the following information:
(1) the number of foster children in state care; (2) the number
of foster children free to be adopted and still in state care,
but not in pre-adoptive placements; (3) the number of state-recruited
families with completed home studies. 

<P>
Most conservatives right
now wouldn't touch a federal mandate with a 10-foot pole. I would
prefer to see an entirely private system that includes a strong
charitable element. Until that happens, a few basic requirements
on the states are in order. We're talking about giving children
a mother and a father. And until we know the depth of the problem
in each state, until the number of kids waiting for homes becomes
part of our thinking and vocabulary, state agencies are unlikely
to change. There are people in our state departments of social
services who know these numbers, but we're not hearing them. 

<P>
<B>Prohibit
race-based delays in adoption.</B> Congressional attempts to outlaw
race-matching in adoption have yet to free tens of thousands of
children of color from foster care. This summer, the U.S. Senate
will consider a welfare-reform bill that prohibits race-based
delays in adoption. Even if Congress approves the bill, its impact
could be minimal. 

<P>
Recall that the Multiethnic Placement Act of
1994, sponsored by former U.S. Senator Howard Metzenbaum, had
a similar goal, but it was watered down. Under guidelines released
by HHS in April, the new law allows adoption agencies to consider
the child's &quot;cultural, ethnic, and racial background.&quot;
As reported by the Washington Post, the guidelines &quot;stopped
far short of requiring that adoption must be colorblind.&quot;


<P>
It is at this point that the discrepancies between legal precedent,
public policy, and social-work practices become painfully clear.
The HHS guidelines have not overturned any state laws requiring
that race be considered in adoption. And with vaguely written
state statutes, case workers will continue to have a lot of power
over whether a child will be adopted or languish in long-term
&quot;temporary&quot; care. 

<P>
Suppose every state had adoption policies
that were truly colorblind. We at the Institute for Children are
challenging governors to remove any and all restrictions to adoption
based on race. What would happen if thousands of children of color
grew up in white or mixed-race families? It would produce an amazing
generation of young people who, instead of growing up without
a last name or a permanent home, were raised by loving parents
in a diverse, multicultural environment. Why are some black leaders
so afraid of that? If their real agenda is the well-being of children,
then the evidence is in. Children are infinitely better off in
a loving, interracial home than as virtual orphans in foster care.


<P>
<B>End government funding that creates incentives to keep children
in substitute care for longer than 12 months.</B> Part of the problem
is that government money extends indefinitely, with no sanctions
enforced against  bureaucratic delays. The Adoption Assistance
and Child Welfare Act of 1980 required a &quot;permanency plan&quot;
for every child within 18 months of entering foster care. This
means that case workers decide whether to reunite a child with
his family, place him in long-term fostering, an independent living
arrangement, a group home, or make him  free for adoption. Adoption
is the permanency plan for 100,000 foster children, but no one
knows how often these plans result in permanent homes for children.


<P>
Deadlines for permanency plans come and go, court dates are postponed,
files are lost as children are shuffled among foster families.
A federal study reveals that children spend, on average, 30 to
42 months in foster care before adoption is even decided on as
a permanency plan. Once that happens, the state files a petition
to terminate parental rights; the filing can take another six
months or more. A report by HHS admits that in some states &quot;children
had an official plan of adoption for more than three years, but
no petitions had been filed.&quot;  

<P>The result is that in probably
every state there are children who have been in foster care longer
than 10 years. Meanwhile, the money to support children in state-run
care keeps coming, with no consequences to the state bureaucracies
that fail to place children.  

<P>
<B>Require that states find adoptive
homes for children within 30 days after the termination of parental
rights.</B> The foster child who is freed for adoption typically has
been in the system for at least two years and has had a permanency
plan of adoption for at least one year. Yet, as children become
legally free to be adopted, states claim to need more time to
find families for them! Our institute recommends a 30-day window:
If the state does not have a qualified family waiting, one who
has met the child and is ready to proceed with the adoption, then
state officials must contract out the adoption process to a private
agency. Qualified families exist in large numbers, and private
adoption agencies are pretty good at finding them. Three years
ago, Michigan launched a carrot-and-stick program with public
and private adoption agencies to get kids into permanent homes
more quickly. Since then, total adoptions are up, and the number
of black children adopted has increased by 121 percent-about 700
kids in the past year alone. 

<P>
Critics call this baby-selling and
claim that government should not act like a business. As someone
who has seen the machinery of the state from the inside, I argue
that government could promote children's well-being much more
effectively if it acted more like a business. I am not alone in
noting the failure of foster care management. The director of
the ACLU's Children's Rights Project recently wrote, &quot;If
the foster care system were considered a business, with its profit-and-loss
statements judged in terms of unnecessary human suffering inflicted
by mismanaged systems, in terms of misspent dollars, or even in
terms of how far these systems depart from their own goals, it
would have been forced into bankruptcy long ago.&quot;

<P>
<CENTER><B>Getting
Kids Out of Limbo</B></CENTER><BR> 

All of the above reforms are aimed at getting
the children now eligible for adoption into permanent homes as
quickly as possible. But there are more than 600,000 children
in foster care at some point during the year. Most of those kids
are happily reunited with their parents. Many of them, however,
become trapped in the state-run system-children who are never
free to be adopted, but who will not or should not return to their
biological parents. There are at least three steps every governor
could take to rescue these children from the worst effects of
foster care and help them find a home: 

<P>
<B>Make entrance requirements
for foster families as stringent as those for adoptive families.</B>
In the wake of a wave of child deaths in foster care, people are
beginning to speak out about the need to raise the standards for
being licensed as a foster parent. As one advocate put it, to
be a foster parent &quot;all you need is a clean criminal record
and an extra bed.&quot; People who have failed an adoption home
study can sign up with the state as foster parents. Foster children
deserve better than that. 

<P>
Critics argue that if we raise the requirements
for foster families, there won't be enough qualified people to
take care of the kids. I have more confidence in the generosity
of the American people. I think if you raise the requirements,
you'll see more foster parents and better care. Look, for example,
at private schools with higher requirements and lower teacher
salaries than public schools; they  continue to attract excellent
teachers and deliver a quality education. By maintaining a separate
set of standards for foster parents than those for adoptive parents,
we are saying to a half-million kids that it is not important
where they spend the most formative years of their lives. 

<P>
But
this is not the only disgrace in foster-parent licensing and training
procedures. In state-sponsored training courses, foster parents
are admonished, &quot;Do not get too close to your foster children.
Do not form a bond.&quot; Foster parents are instructed that their
main task is to facilitate a child's return to his or her biological
parents. From day one, good foster parents are discouraged from
adopting. 

<P>
Certainly there is a stigma attached to being a foster
parent-the system has created it. It is that stigma that discourages
many capable and loving people from fostering. If the entrance
requirements for fostering were as high as those for adopting,
foster children would be better cared for. The anti-adoption establishment
wouldn't like it, because it would ruin the standard argument
that foster parents are not adequate to adopt. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than
12 months for biological parents to prove their fitness to resume
custody of their children.</B> This may be the most difficult law
to pass at the state level, but it also may be the most desperately
needed. State laws can be so vaguely written and so easily assailable
that termination of parental rights is always a last resort and
can take years of court hearings. There are many in the field
who believe it is almost always better to send children back to
their natural parents. The Child Welfare League promotes the notion
that &quot;no one can truly substitute for the family of origin.&quot;


<P>
I agree that nature provides every child with two protectors-a
man and a woman-and that we're meant to be with our biological
parents. But nature didn't design women's bodies to endure crack
cocaine; it didn't design children to be shaken until they suffer
cerebral hemorrhages. Family preservation doesn't work in these
cases because there is nothing left to preserve. 

<P>
State governors
should take the lead in setting tough sanctions against parents
who neglect or abuse their kids. By setting a deadline for parents
to get their lives together-to get off drugs, get out of jail,
find a place to live, and even get a job or go to school-we remind
them that they really are responsible for their actions. But the
deadline must be final and incontestable; otherwise, irresponsible
parents will continue to imprison their children in a labyrinth
of legal battles and parentless foster care. The 12-month limit
has yet to be adopted by any state and is indeed a radical departure
from the years it can now take to legally separate a child from
unfit parents. 

<P>
<B>Allow no more than 30 days from the birth of the
child for biological fathers to formalize paternity.</B> The &quot;Baby
Jessica&quot; and &quot;Baby Richard&quot; cases have demonstrated
the law's allowance for biological fathers who come out of the
woodwork to claim their children after they've been adopted. In
the now pending &quot;Baby Emily&quot; case, a little girl born
in 1992 was soon placed for adoption after the father's rights
were terminated for abandonment (he was doing jail time for a
rape conviction). But now the father is out of prison and has
sued for custody of his daughter. The adoptive family's finances
have been completely exhausted as the case awaits adjudication
in Florida's supreme court. 

<P>
Governor William Weld of Massachusetts
has sent to the legislature a proposal that, if passed, will prevent
such tragic cases in Massachusetts. The proposal requires every
unwed biological father to formalize paternity within 30 days
of the child's birth, and to maintain contact with the child and
provide financial support to the best of his ability-or forfeit
his right to contest the child's adoption. Ideally, that would
mean no appeals, no hearings, no state officials pulling children
out of their adoptive homes. The legislation, if not severely
amended, could serve as a model for state reform.

<P><CENTER><B>A Life That Matters</B></CENTER><BR>
A teenage girl-we'll call her Sarah-who worked for our institute
last summer was a system kid; she had turned 18 in foster care.
This was her first job and she was surprised when she noticed
that taxes had been taken out of her paycheck. She asked me what
the government would do with her money. In my usual non-partisan
spirit, I explained how the federal government would spend the
$300 withheld from her summer earnings. She actually started to
cry. She looked at me and asked, &quot;Will it go to pay for foster
care?&quot; She said it hurt her that she had worked so hard only
to help the government keep some other child from being adopted.
 

<P>
That's what the system is doing to our children. Though my own
experience in foster care was a good one, it opened my eyes to
the real hardships of countless children. My foster brothers and
sisters who might have gone back safely to their families of origin
too often and for too long were delayed from doing so. Others
lived the saddest stories of rejection-they had been burned, beaten,
sodomized or battered, left in a doorway or in a fruit field,
but later sent &quot;home&quot; to their abusers. Like foster
children everywhere, many who could have been adopted were denied
the chance to be loved and cherished by a family who would always
be there. 

<P>
Let's be honest: Adoption is no fairy tale. It is a
risk. Kids don't always go home and live happily ever after. But
every parentless child knows the alternative: the feeling that
there is no one to whom her &quot;case&quot;-that is, her life-really
matters.  

<P>
When parents adopt, they can accomplish something government
cannot: They can convince a child she matters. That's what makes
adoption such a great gift, an expression of unconditional love
and compassion. Don't we, as a society, owe that gift to our children?

At least 90,000 children have been in foster longer than three
years. One in ten foster children remains in care longer than 7
years.
<P>
The population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the overall U.S. child population. Every year, 15,000
foster children turn 18 with no permanent family.
<P>
A year in foster care costs taxpayers $17,500 per child. Last year,
California spent $635 million on foster and group home care.
<P>
More than half of all foster children were abused or neglected
by their biological parents.
<P>
Fifteen percent of all children in America are black,but 40 percent
of the children in foster care are black.
<P>
More than 600,000 kids will spend all or part of 1995 in substitute
care - up from 434,000 in 1982.
<P>
After Massachusetts launched an aggressive pro-adoption campaign, foster
child adoptions increased by 47 percent.

<p>
Suppose you are 20 years old and earning $10,000 a year. You and your employer are paying $1,240 a year in Social Security taxes. That's 12.4 percent of your hard-earned income, for benefits that you will never see.<p>
Suppose instead you could invest that same $1,240, as well as an additional $2.50 a week. By the time you are 65, thanks to the magic of compound interest, you would be a millionaire. You would be assured a comfortable retirement.<p>
This isn't a game-show fantasy. This isn't a lottery jackpot. It is a realistic goal. But unlocking this economic opportunity means revolutionizing Social Security. Every American who earns $10,000 a year or more can become a millionaire over the course of one working lifetime45 years. By the year 2000, there will be over 100 million Americans who fall in this category.<p>
In a recent survey, Americans between the ages of 18 and 34 reported they are more likely to see a UFO (46 percent) than their Social Security benefits (28 percent). They're right. The Social Security trust fund starts running out of money, under current projections, in the year 2013. If you're 20 today, that's when you turn 38. By the year 2030, when you turn 55, the fund will be short $200 billion a year and be unable to meet one quarter of its obligations. By the year 2042, when you turn 67 and reach your so-called normal retirement age, the fund will have an accumulated debt of $4.7 trillion. I'm not making this up. This isn't science fiction. These numbers come from the 1994 report of the trustees of the Social Security system.<p>
You could get all your benefits, of course, if there were an enormous tax increase for your children and grandchildren. According to the Social Security trustees, honoring existing promises for Social Security and Medicare benefits will require a rise in payroll taxes from the current level of 15.3 percent to 25.7 percent in 2030. But that simply isn't going to happen. Americans are already overtaxed. Do you think they'll put up with 25 percent payroll taxes, and federal income taxes, plus state and local taxes on top of that?<p>
Some politicians will tell you not to worry: Social Security is building up a big trust fund that will take care of all those promises. By the end of this year, the trust fund will have $475 billion in assetson paper. By 2020, there will be $3 trillion on paper. The trouble is, when the program needs the money, the money will already have been spent on everything the federal government spends money on. To redeem its IOUs to the trust fund, the federal government will have to borrow money or raise taxesby over $36,000 per familyjust as if the trust fund had no assets at all.<p>
So you and your employer are now paying one eighth of your income to pay for the Social Security benefits of current retirees, and to build up an illusory trust fund. Meanwhile, your own retirement is in jeopardy.<p>
No wonder younger Americans fear they are on a treadmill. No wonder there is so much trepidation about the future of the country. No wonder we have a savings crisis: our savings are being spent. No wonder most Americans now say their children will enjoy less opportunity than they do. <p>
It doesn't have to be this way. Social Security can be saved without raising taxes, and without lowering the benefits or cost-of-living adjustments of existing retirees. Social Security can be saved in a way that will open up opportunity for younger peopleso that their standard of living will be better than that of their parents and grandparents. If we use the principles of democratic capitalism to reform Social Security, the 20-year-old making the minimum wage can become a millionaire by the time he or she retires.<p>
Most Americans are on a treadmill because they have but one source of income: wages. The way to get ahead is to earn income from capital. Money makes money. With capital, you can retire in comfort and bequeath a nest egg to your children.<p>
Here is the beauty of capitalism. Any American currently earning $12,580 or more pays $30 a week, or $1,560 a year, into Social Security. Imagine that, beginning at age 20, you invest that $30 a week at market rates. When you retire, you'll be a millionaire. Whoever earns at least the minimum wage can become a millionaire in 45 years.<p>
The secret is compound interest. Let's assume a long-term return on your investments of 8 percent a year. (This is a prudent assumption; the annual return on the Standard & Poor's 500 over the past 70 years, including the Great Depression, is actually 10.19 percent.) If you can save $30 a week ($1,560 a year), after 10 years the value of your portfolio is $29,000. After 20 years, it is $110,000. After 30 years, it is $318,000. Forty years$822,000. And 45 yearsthe normal working lifetime$1.3 million. After 50 years, if you work until age 70, the value of your portfolio crescendoes to an estimated $2 million.<p>
You wouldn't exactly be a millionaire in today's dollars. If we adjust for inflation of about 4 percent a year, your portfolio of $1.3 million after 45 years would be closer to $230,000. That's still a larger nest egg than most working Americans even dream of. With that amount of capital, you could purchase an annuity at age 65 that would give you $18,256 a year (in today's dollars) during your retirement years.<p>
The way to save Social Security is to make the magic of compound interest work for its beneficiaries. I've been developing a proposal that will save Social Securityand enable 100 million Americans to become millionaires. The plan keeps Social Security as a mandatory, redistributive savings program, but it converts the program from the current pay-as-you-go system to a funded system, in which individuals own retirement portfolios at Social Security and choose private investment managers. Individuals would be allowed to set aside portions of their Social Security payments, together with additional voluntary contributions, in their own personal accounts. They could use their accounts for retirement income and pass on the capital tax free to their children. The plan has four basic elements:<p>
Pay existing obligations to all current retirees. Social Security benefits would be paid to all existing retirees, as promised, without changes, and without reductions.<p>
Divide Social Security into two tiers. If you are working now, you and your employer would continue to pay existing Social Security taxes of 12.4 percent on the first $61,200 of your income. Some of that would go to pay the benefits of existing recipients. Some of your payments would go into your own personal account. Payroll taxes would not rise from their current level. They would be cut by 2 percentage points around the year 2040.<p>
The benefits of current retirees would be paid out of the first tiercurrent payroll taxes. When they retire, current workers would draw benefits from two Social Security sources: income from future payroll taxes and income from their personal retirement accounts.<p>
Create personal investment and retirement accounts for the second tier of Social Security. Every worker who earns at least $4,000 would have his own IRA-like account with Social Security. (Unlike an IRA, you could use your account only for retirement, and could not withdraw from it earlier.) The first $500 that you and your employer pay into Social Security every year would be automatically deposited in your personal retirement account. You could increase the deposit in your personal retirement account by up to $3,000 per year by making voluntary contributions that would be matched by Social Security taxes you are already paying. The size of the match would vary according to income.<p>
Here's an example: If you earn $10,000 a year and you contribute $1,240 per year, the first $500 of this money would be paid into your personal account. If you add a savings match of $130, the Social Security program will deposit an additional $610 of tax money you are already paying into the fund into your personal retirement account, for a total of $1,240 per year. In 45 years, your portfolio will be $1,026,524 and you're a millionaire.<p>
If you are making $50,000, you might wish to put the maximum of $3,000 per year into your personal account at Social Security; $1,500 of the $3,000 comes from taxes you are already paying, and $1,500 comes from additional funds you save from your income, that is, from a personal-savings match. In 45 years, your portfolio would be $2.5 million.<p>
This money would be in your name, you would own it, and you would be in charge of picking an investment manager to invest it for you. Social Security would set up a corporation whose only purpose is to certify and approve private-sector money managers. (Criteria would include performance and experience in money management, years in business, and certfiably good character.) You would pick your investment manager from this list, and could switch to a different one any time you wanted. This sort of system is already working well in Chile.<p>
Use your capital account to increase your retirement income, and pass on your assets tax free to your children. When you retire, you would have two attractive choices of what to do with your capital account. One would be to use income from your capital (5 percent a year) for your retirement benefitsand then, when you die, to pass on your entire capital account tax free to your children or heirs. The second would be to purchase an annuity with your capital account, and receive higher retirement benefits during your lifetime but not pass any assets on to your children or heirs. <p>
Based on current life-expectancy charts, when you reach 65 you can expect to live, on average, to age 83, an additional 18 years. With an annuity you could currently receive an estimated 7.9 percent return per year.<p>
If you have a small portfolio when you retire, your Social Security benefits would be paid as promised out of the income from your capital (5 percent a year), as well as payroll taxes from future workers. Suppose, for instance, you have $100,000 in your personal account, and promised Social Security benefits of $10,000 a year. You would receive $5,000 in Social Security income from your capital, and $5,000 through the regular payroll-tax base. When you die, you would then be able to pass your retirement assets on to your children or heirs.<p>
As portfolios grow through compound interest, however, tens of millions of retirees would have the opportunity to increase their benefits. Twenty-year-olds today earning $10,000 a year will retire at age 65 in 2040. If the wages keep up with expected inflation, their final wages will be $15,236. Their promised present-law Social Security benefits will be $9,121 per year (a 59.9 percent replacement level). If payroll taxes are not increased, Social Security benefits would be reduced 24.4 percentfrom $9,121 to $6,892 per year.<p>
Under the Beard system, these retirees would have $1,026,524 in their personal accounts with Social Security ($182,769 in today's money). If they choose an annuity, their Social Security benefits will be $14,511 per year$5,390 higher than present-law Social Security promises. If they wish to pass the $1,026,524 tax free onto their children or heirs, their benefits will be $9,138.<p>
It would be enormously expensive to move from a pay-as-you-go to a funded Social Security system. Annual deposits into personal capital accounts would begin at over $100 billion per year and climb to over $200 billion per year (in today's dollars) by 2040. And this would be in addition to the massive deficits already projected for Social Security beginning in 2013. How can America possibly afford these expenses? The money would come from five sources. <p>
Over time, the largest increase in Social Security revenue would come from the income of the new capital accounts. By 2040, after 45 years in operation, the estimated value of retirees' capital accounts in today's dollars would be $8 trillion, almost double the current value of the private pension system. If we assume 5 percent income from capital to pay retirement benefits, retirees would receive over $400 billion every year from their capital (in today's dollars).<p>
Social Security payroll taxes currently exceed payments by about $25 billion a year. This surplus would go into the personal capital accounts. So would the $475 billion in assets that have supposedly accumulated in the Social Security trust fund. Those assets don't really exist, but workers have paid extra taxes on the federal government's promise that the surplus would go to a trust fund. Amortized over 20 years, the trust fund could be drawn down at the rate of $30 billion a year. In practice, this will mean that other federal expenditures will have to be cut by the same amount, bonds of $30 billion will have to sold to the public, or taxes will have to be raised by $30 billion.<p>
Some $60 billion a year would be saved through a special debt instrument we call the Liberty Bond. The Liberty Bond would be a voluntary 30-year interest-paying instrument. After 30 years, heirs and designees would receive principal and interest tax free. It would be marketed to retirees who do not need all their benefits to enjoy a comfortable retirement, and would gladly forego some of their benefits if they were sure this would help their children.<p>
I anticipate that five to 10 million Americans would purchase Liberty Bonds. Millions of retirees would gladly set aside $1,000 per year to create a $25,000 tax-free education fund for their children and grandchildren. Many would even set aside their full benefits$10,000 to $15,000 a year for their remaining lifetimeto build a nest egg for their children. The government could create a cap of $95 billion per year on the sale of Liberty Bonds, so that no more money is deferred than necessary.<p>
To make the numbers work, benefits will also have to be reduced for future retirees. There are two fair ways to do this. One is to raise the normal retirement age from the current 67 to 70, a change that can be phased in gradually. We are all living longer and we are in better health as we age. It is fair to extend the normal retirement age as our own lifetimes are extended. And in any case, with individual capital accounts in Social Security and the power of compound interest, Americans will want to work longerbecause they'll have the opportunity to build up even larger nest eggs.<p>
The second way to reduce Social Security benefits fairly is to reduce indexation for real wage growth. It is important to index Social Security for inflation. Once you retire, the cost of living continues to rise as a result of inflation. Without cost-of-living adjustments, the purchasing power of your benefits will decrease an estimated 4 percent per year. But Social Security is indexed again for real wage growthabout 1 percent a year. This is icing on the cake for retirees. It is not necessary, and it could be reduced by 50 percent.<p>
The current pay-as-you-go system is an economic, political, and cultural dead end. It will force us to raise taxes, and then raise taxes again to pay promised benefits, or to cut benefits and then cut benefits again to avoid mammoth tax increases. It will create no new capital opportunities. It will drain a growing amount of America's resourcesour savings and investmentout of the private sector. A shrinking private sector damages our ability to create new jobs and new industriesour future strength.<p>
The current system is also a recipe for conflict. If America is a shrinking pie, the young generation and older generation will fight over the crumbs. <p>
Under a funded, two-tier system, we would cut payroll taxes 2 percentage points in 2040 and then cut them again. As the system matures, we would increase retirement benefits by 25 to 35 percent. We would create 100 million millionaires. We would amass unprecedented savings and investment in America by opening the doors of capital ownership to most Americans. We would create a capital pool that no other nation in the world can equal, and use this investment to finance the high-paying jobs and new industries of tomorrow.<p>
By making every American a capitalist, a funded Social Security system would unleash new economic growth, raise the standard of living of our children, and return America to its historic role as the country of tomorrow, with its best days yet to come.

<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."

<b><a name="Tragic Irony">A TRAGIC IRONY</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.  
<p>	 
And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.  
<p>  
<center>
<b><a name="Flat-Tax">THE FLAT-TAX OPTION</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<p>
As members of Congress consider legislative proposals that will lead us into the next century, it is important that we understand the demographic composition of the districts they represent. This book does just that. We have used 1990 Long Form Census information, and ranked the Congressional Districts in numerous key categories, including the total amount of public assistance districts get, the total amount of farm income, the number of people who have a mortgage, just to name a few. In all we have 97 different categories to look at.<p>The layout of these reports is straightforward. <p>



<pre>
              People Over 65 -- Percent
       Congressional District Average:	12.5%

		State	CD	%	Deviation

	1.	FL	22	31.1%	5.49
	2.	FL	13	30.9%	5.44
	3.	FL	19	28.1%	4.62
	4.	FL	10	26.2%	4.03
	5.	FL	05	25.7%	3.88
	6.	FL	14	25.6%	3.87
	7.	FL	16	23.9%	3.36
	8.	FL	09	21.7%	2.70
	9.	AZ	03	19.7%	2.13

</pre>





<ul><li>The ranking is simply where the Congressional District is in relation to the other 434 and the District of Columbia.<p><li>The CD identifies each district with the two letter state abbreviation, and the Congressional District number within the state. 
<p>
<li>The # or % is the actual information. For example, the % of Asians in a district.
<p>
<li>The deviation is a little more complex. This is to show how far from the average a particular district is. It answers the question of whether the district is just slightly different from the national average, or significantly different. It also allows you to see the difference between two districts more clearly as well. 
<p>
<li>For more information on the U.S. Census Bureau, visit their web page, at <a href="http://www.census.gov/">http://www.census.gov/</a>

</ul><p>
We hope this book will give readers a better understanding of all the Congressional Districts and what issues members might be concerned about.

	As any working parent knows, having children can be a costly adventure. But has anyone put a figure on what the average costs per child are in 1995 as compared with 1960?  Of course!  Your hard tax dollars are at work once again.  The US federal government, and a few other sources,  have come up with a few statistics that any expecting parent or current parent needs to know:

<li> Roughly 17% of family income is spent on an infant under one year, as compared with 21% of family income in 1960.  (And day care wasn't even part of the spending equation in 1960!)
<p>
<li> Day care now accounts for 14% of total spending on an infant under one year.
<p>
<li> In 1960, average family income was $30,120  -- that was back when the usual family only had one parent working.  Of that salary, $6,203 was spent on an infant under one.  Today, the average family income -- with two parents working -- is $44, 800.  Of that amount, $7,610 is spent on an infant under one, according the Agriculture Department.
<p>
<li> In 1995,  the majority of spending per infant was spent on child care and food, with clothing and health care following.  In 1960, the majority was spent on food (Remember: day care was not even a consideration then), with health care and clothing following.
<p>
<li> According to Lifestyle Change Communications, here's a specific breakdown in first-year costs:
<P><table border=0 cellpadding=7 cellspacing=7>
<tr>
	<td><b>diapers</b></td><td><b>$570</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>nursery</b></td><td><b>$1,200</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>furniture</b></td><td><b>$995</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>bedding/bath</b></td><td><b>$223</b></td></tr>
	<tr>
	<td><b>toys</b></td><td><b>$199</b></td></tr></table>
</ul><p>
	Even though 48% of women are in the work force, as compared with 27% in 1960,  their families are still spending less in the first year, in terms of family income, than their parents spent on them back in 1960.  Any way you look at it, babies really are big business!

 <P>



Karen Czarnecki Miller is the Director of Executive Branch Liaison at <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>, one of the country's leading public policy research institutes.
<p>
A conservative research foundation, Heritage provides policy analysis in several broad areas of study: domestic and economic policy, and foreign policy and defense.  Some of the more specialized departments within the foundation concentrate on <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/asian.htm">Asian Studies</a>, the <a href="/heritage/library/index/g7.html">United Nations</a>, and <a href="/heritage/library/index/h2.html">Congressional reform.</a>  
<p>
Miller is primarily responsible for maintaining contact with the Clinton Administration, educating the presidential campaigns on important policy issues, and overseeing The Heritage Foundation's <a href="/heritage/jobs/jobs.html">Job Bank.</a>  She also serves as a spokesman for the foundation on Heritage proposals and research findings in all areas of the Foundation's study.  She has been a featured commentator on numerous radio and television shows including "CNN & Co.", PBS' "This is America with Dennis Wholey," and <a href=" http://net.fcref.org/">NET NewsTalk Television.</a>  
<p>
Miller previously served as the foundation's director of <a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.htm">lectures and seminars</a> for three years, where she organized all public events for the foundation from welfare and education reform to ballistic missile defense.  If one of your favorite pastimes is watching C-Span, you may be familiar with Heritage's lectures and panel discussions.  
<p>
Prior to her work for the foundation, Miller worked in the Bush Administration as a special assistant for domestic policy and public liaison for Vice President Dan Quayle.  She was also a staff assistant in the Reagan Administration, where she assisted in the compilation of research data on the major domestic and foreign policy events which shaped the Administration.  This project served as the basis for President  Reagan's memoirs, and are on display at the <a href="/townhall/hall_of_fame/reagan/preslib.html">Reagan Presidential Library</a>.
<p>
A native of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, Miller is married to a Civil War buff from North Carolina who insists she has "southern traits."  Her husband, Matt, works on Capitol Hill, and they have two daughters. The first, Reagan Lee Miller, is named after President Ronald Reagan, the reason they both entered politics.
<p>
Miller has her B. A. and J.D. from The Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C.

<H1><CENTER>By Design: A Whitworth professor takes a controversial stand
to show that life was no accident</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="newbar.gif" WIDTH="409" HEIGHT="10" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="0"></CENTER>
<P><B>The year was 1952.</B> In a laboratory at the University of Chicago,
a young graduate student named Stanley Miller set up an experiment that
would profoundly affect the way scientists thought about the most vexing
and factious of scientific questions: How did life begin on Earth? Using
a flask of boiling water, some tubing and a couple of electrodes, Miller
began exposing a mixture of reduced gases - methane, ammonia and hydrogen
- to an electrical charge. When he popped the top off his flask a week later,
he found something astonishing. In addition to the yellow-brown &quot;tar&quot;
that had formed on the inside of the flask, the reaction had produced some
amino acids - the organic building blocks of protein molecules, which are,
in turn, the building blocks of life.<BR>
<IMG SRC="meyerclass.jpg" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="136" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" 
ALIGN="left"><HR WIDTH="92%">
<H2><I>In class, Meyer uses the simplest of visual aids to convey the complexity
of a living cell.</I></H2>
<H3><HR WIDTH="92%"></H3>
When Miller published his findings the following year, the mainstream press
heralded his work as a monumental step in explaining how life on a primordial
Earth could have sprung forth from a lifeless sea of chemicals. It was that
same year that James Watson and Francis Crick at Cambridge University in
England ushered in the era of molecular biology when they elucidated the
DNA strand and showed how genetic information was stored and transmitted.
Science, it seemed, was well on its way to answering the colossal questions
posed by life itself.<BR>
<BR>
But 40 years after Miller performed his historic experiment, scientists
are not appreciably closer today to discovering how a lifeless pool of chemicals
could have possibly organized itself into even the most primitive single-celled
organism, said Stephen Meyer, a Whitworth College philosophy professor who
has staked out a very controversial position in the origins debate. In fact,
Meyer said, the materialistic theories of life's origin that Miller's experiment
nourished and the accompanying neo-Darwinian view of evolution exhibit all
the symptoms of a theoretical research paradigm in distress. As Meyer describes
it, making the leap from a few simple amino acids stuck on the side of a
flask to a living, functioning, self-replicating cell is the equivalent
of trying to take a young child's first syllables and rearrange them into
Stephen J. Hawking's A Brief History of Time. And no one has been able to
get past the first steps in the process, Meyer said. <BR>
<BR>
But if nature isn't capable of generating life by its own devices, as Meyer
maintains, how did we get here? According to Meyer, nature had some help.
To the consternation of many scientists throughout academe, Meyer and a
group of up-and-coming young scientists and philosophers across the country
espouse a theory called &quot;intelligent design&quot; to explain the origin
of life. In the process, Meyer has become one of the central players in
the newest twist of an age-old debate. <BR>
<BR>
Simply stated, intelligent design theory argues that life on Earth arose
via the purposeful act of an intelligent agent, which people might choose
to view as a deity. At some point when the planet was young, say 3.5 billion
years ago, there was an intervention by an intelligent agent that somehow
provided what was needed - sequenced information, organic material, energy,
etc. - for life to spring forth on a lifeless planet. Furthermore, and this
is key to the theory, proponents of intelligent design maintain that evidence
of design in even the simplest living organisms is scientifically detectable
by applying new mathematical and informational theories.<BR>
<BR>
In the last two years, Meyer's opinion pieces and columns on the origins
debate have appeared in such publications as The Wall Street Journal, Insight
magazine, and many scientific and philosophical journals. Meyer has helped
organize origins symposia, presented papers, contributed to books, and engaged
one of the most divisive issues of the scientific enterprise with dogged
prolificacy. He has spoken at origins conferences from the University of
California-Berkeley to Cambridge University, where he gave a plenary address
at the &quot;Cosmos and Creation&quot; symposium last summer. At 36, his
vita is as thick as those of scholars many years his senior. Currently,
with grant support from the Pascal Center for Advanced Studies in Science
and Religion, Meyer is writing a book about design with Bill Dembski, an
expert in math and complexity theory, and Paul Nelson, who recently received
his Ph.D. in evolutionary biology from the University of Chicago.<BR>
<H3>Skepticism evolves</H3>
A 1980 Whitworth College graduate who majored in physics and geology, Meyer
took a job out of college as a geophysicist with Atlantic Richfield. Meyer
said that throughout his undergraduate years, he had always reconciled his
scientific work and religious convictions by believing that evolution and
theism were not incompatible. &quot;I was quite comfortable accepting the
standard evolutionary story, although I put a bit of atheistic spin on it
- that (evolution) is how God operated.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
While working for ARCO and living in Dallas, Meyer attended a conference
that brought together top philosophers, cosmologists and origin-of-life
biologists to debate the religious implications of contemporary scientific
findings. &quot;I remember being especially fascinated with the origins
debate at this conference. It impressed me to see that scientists who had
always accepted the standard evolutionary story were now defending a theistic
belief, not on the basis that it makes them feel good or provides some form
of subjective contentment, but because the scientific evidence suggests
an activity of mind that is beyond nature. I was really taken with this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Although he enjoyed his work in the oil industry, Meyer had always wanted
to go to graduate school. He applied for a Rotary International Scholarship
to Cambridge University but finished runner-up to the former Miss Texas.
A year later, when oil prices took a plunge and his level of job security
followed, he again applied for the Rotary Scholarship, received it, and
was off to Cambridge University. There he studied the philosophy of science,
wrote his dissertation titled &quot;A Methodological Interpretation of Origin-of-Life
Research,&quot; and earned his Ph.D. Meyer returned to Whitworth College
in 1990 as an assistant professor of philosophy and was named the1993-94
recipient of the Dean's Award for Junior Faculty Achievement. This fall
he was promoted to associate professor. In addition to his philosophy courses,
he is a member of the teaching team for CORE 350, an interdisciplinary course
that explores the scientific tradition and its impact on the world. <BR>
<H3>Purposefulness vs. purposelessness </H3>
It was in 1859 that Charles Darwin's Origin of Species rocked the scientific
and theological worlds by declaring that life, in all its diversity, complexity
and splendor, had evolved from the simplest of life forms over billions
of years. Human beings were not the handiwork of a divine creator, but rather,
in the words of the late Har-vard evolutionist G.G. Simpson, &quot;Man was
a result of a purposeless process that did not have him in mind.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
&quot;The biggest question at the root of the origins debate is purposeless
chance versus intelligent design or guidance,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;Is
life the result of purposeless or purposeful causes? At the most basic,
most fundamental level , you see incredible evidence for intelligent design.
It's becoming clearer and clearer that the ordinary processes of nature
that we see in operation now do not produce the kinds of structures and
complexity that we see at work in a cell.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer argues that by using modern information and probability theory, evidence
of design in the form of non-random information sequencing in living organisms
is detectable. He points out that astrophysicists are already using a similar
technique to search for evidence of intelligence in another realm. The $100-million
Search for Extraterrestrial Life project, or SETI, is essentially a giant
interstellar microphone that monitors the cosmos for non-random messages.
The purpose of the project is to detect evidence of intelligent life in
the universe. <BR>
<BR>
Meyer said the same mathematical approach can be applied to biology to probe
for intelligent design. Within each living cell there is a chemical code
or language that exhibits non-random, aperiodic complexity. To Meyer and
his colleagues, the non-random sequences of these chemical messages strongly
suggest design. Even the simplest single-celled organisms show daunting
complexity and organization, Meyer said. These organisms exhibit a functional
integration of parts, information storage and transfer mechanisms, regulatory
and feedback loops, hierarchical levels of organization. &quot;If we were
to see these kinds of features in any other artifacts, we would immediately
infer that they were designed.&quot;<BR>
<H3>Horse heads in the clouds</H3>
But Meyer's critics, who would constitute the bulk of the scientific community
at research universities around the world, say Meyer has hopped the fence
that separates science from philosophy and theology, and has dressed up
an antique creationist theory as science. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There's a feeling of deja vu here - we've been through all that and
it's plowed ground,&quot; said Richard Dickerson, professor of biochemistry
and geophysics at UCLA, and former director of the Molecular Biology Institute
there. &quot;Intelligent design is a disguised form of creationism. To say
that a life form arose because of a designer goes beyond science. That's
philosophy. It's religious apologetics, which is not necessarily a bad thing
so long as it's not done in the name of science.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Ken Kardong, an associate professor of zoology at Washington State University
who teaches evolutionary biology, agrees that intelligent design is an incarnation
of an idea that has its roots in the early 19th century, and the same flaws
apply. &quot;These kinds of views are fun to discuss and play with, but
I would be very reluctant to see these old arguments recirculated,&quot;
said Kardong, who said he has his own problems with some aspects of neo-Darwinism,
but believes that the theory will evolve to solve more and more riddles
of the origins debate. &quot;When you start calling something in nature
'designed,' it is an inference, not a fact. It steps outside of the context
in which scientists do their work.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Kardong likens intelligent design theory to looking at a bank of white fluffy
clouds. When you see a cloud that's shaped like a horse head, does that
mean it's been designed; does that mean a purpose can be inferred? No, said
Kardong, not if you want to stay within the realm of science. The problem
with intelligent design is the same because it does not start with a neutral
point of view. &quot;If you look at enough clouds, you're going to see a
horse head.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lee Anne Chaney, associate professor of biology at Whitworth, also offers
a dissenting view of intelligent design theory. &quot;As a Christian, part
of my belief system is that God is ultimately responsible. But as a biologist,
I need to look at the evidence. Scientifically speaking, I don't think intelligent
design is very helpful because it does not provide things that are refutable
- there is no way in the world you can show it's not true,&quot; she said.
&quot;Drawing inferences about the deity does not seem to me to be the function
of science because it's very subjective.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Yet Meyer disputes the demarcationist argument that intelligent design is
inherently unscientific. &quot;Scientists make design inferences all the
time,&quot; he said. &quot;No geologist, for example, would attribute the
origin of the faces on Mount Rushmore to wind and erosion, nor would an
archaeologist insist that the inscriptions on the Rosetta Stone are the
result of purely natural causes. In the case of the Rosetta Stone, we infer
design because we know that only intelligent agents have the capacity to
produce the encoded information that the inscriptions contain. There is
an important and clear difference between a &quot;picture&quot; in a cloud
and an encoded message. And modern probability theory entirely supports
this conclusion.&quot; <BR>
<H3>Secular high priests</H3>
Beyond the weighty issue of how life originated, the origins debate raises
big questions about the nature and philosophy of science. Just what is science,
and when it comes to the issue of origins, what delineates science from
philosophy and theology? Is science only concerned with the material universe
and the laws of nature, the observable, the physical, the empirical, the
falsifiable? Or with the contentious question of life's origins, where direct
observation is not possible, can science make room for something more?<BR>
<BR>
According to Meyer, no case better illustrates the politics of origins than
the plight of San Francisco State University Biology Professor Dean Kenyon.
Although his supporters and critics disagree as to the value of his work
in the discipline, Kenyon co-authored the 1969 textbook, Biochemical Predestination,
which was considered one of the most authoritative explanations of how a
living cell could have organized itself from lifeless chemicals in the &quot;primordial
soup.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But by the 1980s, Kenyon had begun to have his doubts about the dominant
scientific paradigm he had worked hard to advance, and he began to share
those doubts, along with information about intelligent design, with his
students. In 1992, following complaints from several students that Kenyon
was teaching creationism, the head of the biology department at SFSU removed
Kenyon from the classroom. The Kenyon case became something of cause celebre
for Meyer and others working on intelligent design. After Meyer did an op-ed
piece about Kenyon's case in The Wall Street Journal, and pressure from
SFSU's Academic Freedom Committee and the American Association of University
Professors mounted, Kenyon was reinstated. Nevertheless, the biology department
at SFSU has proposed a ban on further discussion of intelligent design theory
because it is &quot;unscientific.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Kenyon case teaches us a lot about who de-fines the rules of the
debate,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;Kenyon was silenced not because any of his
data were inaccurate, or because his students didn't like him. He was silenced
because his dean sought to impose a definition of science that made Kenyon
fall out of bounds.&quot; <BR>
In order to justify this kind of thinking, many in the scientific establishment
use self-serving definitions of science to justify excluding intelligent
design, Meyer said. But the &quot;rules of science&quot; that exclude intelligent
design are applied selectively. &quot;Dean Kenyon was accused of violating
the canons of the scientific method because he had inferred an unobservable
entity - an intelligent designer. Yet scientists, including evolutionary
theorists, routinely infer the existence of entities that cannot be seen,
such as fields, forces, quarks and past mutations, to name a few.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer said that, in any case, attempts to draw a rigid line separating science
from philosophy or religion do not work. &quot;Origins theories invariably
have religious and philosophical implications one way or the other. There's
a lot more going on here than just a debate over data. There is also a power
struggle over who will get to tell the creation story for our culture. For
years, materialistic-minded biologists have functioned as a secular high
priesthood. They have defined what the questions are, what the rules are,
and what answers can be considered. Now, as more scientists are realizing
that nobody really has any idea how nature could have produced the complexity
and information in the first cell, many are challenging the authority of
that elite. Unfortunately, some in the scientific establishment are resorting
to intimidation to stifle dissent.&quot;<BR>
<H3>The insect and the elephant</H3>
In a recent edition of Insight magazine, Meyer debated these issues with
Eugenie Scott, director of the National Center for Science Education in
Berkeley, Calif. Scott, who also believes that intelligent design is dressed-up
creationism, gave her appraisal of Meyer's place in the origins debate.
Scott likened Meyer to an insect next to the elephant - &quot;a minor annoyance
if it's noticed at all.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer said that ad hominem comments aside, he realizes that as a proponent
of intelligent design theory, he is vastly outnumbered in the scientific
world. But that is starting to change as more scientists begin to look for
an alternative to strictly materialistic theories, he said. &quot;There's
tremendous optimism and enthusiasm - a whole network of people are working
on this.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
And indeed, intelligent design does appear to be catching on in some circles.
At the Cambridge University conference last summer, several senior scientists,
including biochemist Michael Behe of Lehigh University, cell biologist David
Shotton of Oxford University and polymer scientist Walter Bradley of Texas
A&amp;M University gave sympathetic papers in a seminar that Meyer had organized
on &quot;Detecting Design in Creation.&quot; Recently, Princeton University
plasma physicist Robert Kaita gave intelligent design theory favorable mention,
calling it &quot;eminently reasonable&quot; in a Wall Street Journal piece
on the origins debate.<BR>
<BR>
In fact, Meyer and other scientists and philosophers who are pursuing intelligent
design theory have started their own E-mail bulletin board on the Internet,
where they exchange ideas, critique each other's work, and chart out a new
theoretical research program to test their hypothesis. Today there are more
than 130 scientists and other academicians contributing to the E-mail network.
It's like talk radio for the scientifically disenfranchised.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;In the history of scientific revolutions, numbers don't mean much,&quot;
said Meyer. &quot;Very few people can cause meaningful changes if they have
the goods and can deliver them. Right now we're in the very early stages
of a new approach to things.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But what is Meyer's place in the origins debate? Is he just an insect next
to the elephant? Definitely not, said Phillip Johnson, the Jefferson E.
Peyser professor of law at the University of California-Berkeley, author
of Darwin on Trial, and initiator of the E-mail bulletin board. Johnson,
who also supports intelligent design theory, said Meyer is on the leading
edge of an effort that is attracting more and more researchers and could
ultimately lead to a paradigm shift in the scientific world. &quot;Right
now the intellectual ground is being plowed for a critical debate whose
time has come. Steve and his colleagues are raising some tremendously important
issues,&quot; Johnson said. <BR>
<H3>Young Earth creationists - NOT!</H3>
As important as it is for Meyer and his colleagues to articulate precisely
what their views are in order to establish some credibility in the mainstream
scientific community, it may be equally important for them to establish
firmly what their views do not represent. That may be the greatest obstacle
they face - not being grouped with the marginal characters of the origins
debate.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;It's interesting - when I first came to Whitworth, some people thought
I must be one of those people from the young Earth creationist camp, which
is simply not true,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;We're not absolutists, we're
not fundamentalists in the sense that we want to commit to a certain story
and we're not young Earth creationists, We're fairly minimalist. What we
want to say is that however life arose, design is certainly detectable from
the things we see.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Meyer does not dismiss all aspects of evolutionary theory; he says it's
clear that over time life has evolved and diversified. &quot;That's microevolution
and no one disputes that,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;The big question involves
macroevolution, the origin of new structure, the origin of new information,
the proper sequencing of that information, the origin of major body parts
and functionally integrated systems. Those are unsolved questions. And yet
we have this great extrapolation from very little data, and it is promulgated,
pushed and advertised to the culture as what science has discovered.&quot;<BR>
<H3>Purposeful tension</H3>
It is no accident that Steve Meyer has taken up shop at Whitworth College.
It is a place where faculty purposefully integrate their Christian faith
into the disciplines they teach. But it is also a place with a solid academic
reputation where faith and the pursuit of knowledge do not stand in the
way of one another, he said. That purposeful tension allows Meyer to vigorously
pursue an alternative approach to the origins issue without fear of reprisal
or of being relegated to the fringe.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Whitworth doesn't have the reputation of being a stridently fundamentalist
school and it does have a strong academic reputation,&quot; Meyer said.
&quot;It's a place where I can speak on these issues and not bring immediate
scorn and eye rolling. A lot of my colleagues at secular universities could
not have spoken out on the Kenyon issue.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
How do his colleagues at Whitworth view Steve Meyer? Several faculty members
said that Meyer is a razor-sharp intellect, a great teacher, a dynamic lecturer
who energizes his students, and a prolific writer and researcher who has
vigorously engaged the most challenging issues of his discipline. Yet his
unabashed advocacy of a controversial theory does not come without some
intellectual discord. Some faculty members also said Meyer can be too polemical
and that he tends to turn the scientific method on its head. <BR>
<BR>
Meyer knows that there will never be a shortage of people to disagree with
him. &quot;Howard Stien (professor emeritus of biology) and I used to go
around and around on this issue,&quot; Meyer said. &quot;People thought
we were great enemies and that we didn't like each other, but we were actually
great friends. Howard was just more willing to wait for the Darwinists to
solve the problem while I was looking for another approach.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Lois Kieffaber, professor of physics and one of Meyer's CORE teaching partners,
finds herself a bit torn when asked about intelligent design theory and
its philosophical implications for the scientific world. &quot;I do not
rule out the possibility that a supernatural or design event could leave
a footprint in the materialistic world that could be interpreted and read,&quot;
she said. &quot;However, whenever you try to put forth a theory like this
to explain what's happened in the past, you have no way of proving it false.
It's both exciting and scary to think about the boundaries of science being
pushed back. Can the material world give evidence of the immaterial world?
That would be a dramatic change in the way science works.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Hans Bynagle, Whitworth's library director who holds a Ph.D. in philosophy
from Columbia University, said he believes Meyer is fighting an important
philosophical battle on an issue that challenges the governing rules of
science. And Bynagle believes science needs to open up if it seeks to find
elusive truths. &quot;We divide up knowledge into boxes for the sake of
organization and convenience. But we can't assume because we draw those
boxes that when we look at reality, everything is going to fit neatly in
those boxes; nor can we rule out certain things because they don't happen
to fit neatly into those boxes.&quot;<BR>
Whether they agree or disagree with him on the origins issues, students
taking a class from Meyer can be assured of lively, thought-provoking discussions
that force people to think through their assumptions about the world. Perhaps
Forrest Baird, professor of philosophy at Whitworth, puts it best. &quot;Steve
brings diversity to Whitworth and he brings a very important kind of diversity
- diversity of ideas.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For Meyer, this debate is just beginning. Discussion of these issues is
taking place on a level that would have been unthinkable 10 years ago, he
said. The pinhole is becoming a crack. &quot;We are trying to create space
in those branches of science that are concerned with ideologically charged
questions,&quot; said Meyer. &quot;We want to show that there is an evidential
basis for intelligent design and that the evidence is there. The next 10
to 15 years are going to be very interesting.&quot;<BR>

<H3>A Review of Michael Behe's <I>Darwin's Black Box</I><BR>
(The Free Press, 1996, 307 pages, $25)<BR>
<I>By Nancy Pearcy<BR>
</I></H3>
<IMG SRC="newbar.gif" WIDTH="406" HEIGHT="15" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=
"BOTTOM">&quot;When light strikes the retina, a photon is absorbed by a
molecule<BR>
called cis-retinal, which causes it to change to trans-retinal.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Such scientific jargon was unfamiliar terrain for a Washington, D.C., think<BR>
tank, and the audience grew hushed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The change in retinal forces a corresponding change in the protein<BR>
rhodopsin, which allows it to interact with another protein called<BR>
transducin.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Glances shot around the room, as members of the audience furtively sought
out<BR>
others who were equally mystified.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Transducin dissociates from a small molecule called GDP and binds<BR>
to a different molecule called GTP, and this complex binds to a<BR>
protein called phosphodiesterase. . . .&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For several minutes the polysyllabic mysteries piled up, until finally<BR>
embarrassed laughter broke out. But <A HREF="behe.html">Michael Behe</A>
had made his point: Speaking<BR>
to a group of educated non scientists, he had walked them through the complex<BR>
molecular interactions required for vision in way they will never forget.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's book <I>Darwin's Black Box</I> does the same thing for readers, painting
a<BR>
vivid picture of the cell's complexity. But his purpose is not simply to
give a<BR>
charming exposition of popular science, it is to challenge the Darwinist<BR>
hegemony in biology. Behe's thesis is that life depends on a host of molecular<BR>
systems that are irreducibly complex, a phrase he coins to mean that such<BR>
systems consist of several interlocking parts that must be in place before
they<BR>
can function. And since Darwinian processes kick in only _after_ there is<BR>
minimal function, the origin of an irreducibly complex system is out of
reach of<BR>
standard Darwinian explanations.<BR>
<BR>
As an analogy, Behe invokes the humble mousetrap: You can not start with
a<BR>
wooden platform and catch a few mice, add a spring and catch a few more
mice,<BR>
add a hammer, and so on, with gradual improvement of function. To function
at<BR>
all, a mousetrap requires a minimum number of interacting parts assembled
from<BR>
the outset. By the same token, an irreducibly complex organic system like<BR>
vision must come together all at once. It cannot appear gradually, piece
by<BR>
piece.<BR>
<BR>
But the heart of Darwinism is precisely such a gradualist scenario. Darwin<BR>
obligingly offered a way to falsify his own theory, writing: &quot;If it
could be<BR>
demonstrated that any complex organ existed which could not possibly have
been<BR>
formed by numerous, successive, slight modifications, my theory would absolutely<BR>
break down.&quot; Behe's point is that the cell is chock full of molecular
systems<BR>
that could not possibly have formed by successive, slight modifications.
Ergo,<BR>
Darwinism has broken down.<BR>
<BR>
To be fair to Darwin, he proposed his theory when scientists knew next to<BR>
nothing about biochemistry. Living things were &quot;black boxes,&quot;
their inside<BR>
workings a mystery. The cell itself was thought to be nothing more than
a blob<BR>
of jelly like protoplasm. It was easy to draw large scale scenarios about
fins<BR>
gradually turning into legs, or legs into wings, since no one had a clue
how<BR>
limbs and organs work from the inside. As Behe writes, it's as though someone<BR>
asked how a stereo system is made and we answered, &quot;by plugging a set
of<BR>
speakers into an amplifier and adding a CD player, radio receiver, and tape<BR>
deck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Today that kind of answer won't cut it, Behe insists. The &quot;black box&quot;
of the<BR>
cell has been opened and biologists are intimately familiar with its inside<BR>
workings--its nuts and bolts. Any successful explanation of the origin of<BR>
living things must deal with molecular systems.<BR>
<BR>
Consider the origin of vision, a problem Darwin said made him shudder. Richard<BR>
Dawkins, a contemporary Darwinist, brushes it off as no problem whatsoever:
We<BR>
merely begin with a light sensitive spot, Dawkins writes, move to a group
of<BR>
cells cupped to focus light better, and continue through a graded series
of<BR>
infinitesimal improvements to a true lens.<BR>
<BR>
The sequence is quite persuasive on the surface. But what about _under_
the<BR>
surface? To function, Behe argues, even Dawkins's initial light sensitive
spot<BR>
requires a cascade of factors, starting with cis-retinal and rhodopsin.
About<BR>
these complex molecular systems Dawkins is silent. As for those cupped cells,<BR>
dozens of proteins are involved in controlling shape and structure. About
these<BR>
complex proteins Dawkins says nary a word. It's the old strategy of telling
us<BR>
that stereos are made by plugging in speakers and a CD player.<BR>
<BR>
What we really want to know is whether Darwinism can explain how the speakers<BR>
and CD players themselves were assembled. Behe argues that it cannot, and<BR>
offers two types of arguments. On one hand, Behe has combed the scientific<BR>
literature and announces that there are virtually no professional papers<BR>
proposing detailed, testable hypotheses about the evolution of complex molecular<BR>
structures. Explanations simply do not exist.<BR>
<BR>
And the reason they are non-existent, Behe says, delivering his second punch,
is<BR>
that a Darwinian explanation of an irreducibly complex system is logically<BR>
impossible. At the heart of the book are five chapters that drive the point<BR>
home by describing different types of irreducible complexity. Some systems<BR>
consist of interdependent parts that must be assembled all at once, like
a<BR>
mousetrap. An example is the hair-like cilium, which functions like an oar
and<BR>
requires the interplay of more than 200 different proteins. Other systems
are<BR>
sequential, like a Rube Goldberg machine. An example is the blood-clotting<BR>
mechanism, in which numerous steps are exquisitely timed by a series of<BR>
catalysts to ensure that blood clots at the site of a wound and at no other<BR>
place or time. Still other systems depend on delicate recognition signals.<BR>
Certain molecules in the cell act as transport vessels that must recognize
the<BR>
right &quot;pick-up&quot; and &quot;drop-off&quot; zones, as well as the
right materials to carry.<BR>
<BR>
These examples are described in lively prose, sprinkled with vivid<BR>
illustrations. Any reader who follows Behe's descriptions will find it<BR>
difficult not to agree that the complexity of these molecular systems is
indeed<BR>
irreducible--that they could not arise by any step-by-step, Darwinian process.<BR>
<BR>
What alternative does Behe offer? Intelligent design theory. Structures
that<BR>
consist of interacting, co-adapted parts, he argues, are evidence of a<BR>
purposeful, intelligent agent. At this point, many readers may balk, objecting<BR>
that science is not equipped to deal with anything outside nature. To which<BR>
Behe replies: Catch up with the late-twentieth century. It was sixty years
ago<BR>
that the Big Bang theory was proposed, and cosmologists had to confront
the idea<BR>
of an ultimate origin of the universe--no matter how philosophically &quot;repugnant&quot;<BR>
(Eddington's word) they found that idea because of its implication of a
personal<BR>
creator. Now it is biology's turn to recognize that its data may likewise
have<BR>
discomfiting implications.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe is careful to limit his own discussion to the data itself. Thus
he<BR>
denies that from design we can infer the existence of the Christian God.
All we<BR>
can say is that a natural object exhibits the characteristics of intelligent<BR>
manufacture. In Behe's words, &quot;inferences to design do not require
that we have<BR>
a candidate for the role of designer.&quot; We might select a candidate
based on<BR>
philosophical or theological grounds but not on scientific grounds.<BR>
<BR>
Behe's tight focus on scientific data means he treats historical and<BR>
philosophical issues only gingerly. Except for brief (though illuminating)<BR>
discussions of Paley and Socrates, we hear little about the history of the<BR>
concept of design. Apart from a quotation from St. George Mivart, we learn
next<BR>
to nothing about the history of the Darwinian controversy. No mention is
made<BR>
of Georges Cuvier, who in the nineteenth century developed a similar notion
of<BR>
irreducible complexity (calling it &quot;the correlation of parts&quot;).
Nor is any<BR>
acknowledgement made of contemporary proponents of design theory, such as<BR>
Michael Denton (_Evolution: A Theory in Crisis_) or Thaxton, Bradley, and
Olsen<BR>
(_The Mystery of Life's Origin_).<BR>
<BR>
This narrow lens may be frustrating to some readers, but adopting it was<BR>
probably good strategy. Behe is an associate professor of biochemistry at<BR>
Lehigh University, and he stays squarely within his own field of expertise.
He<BR>
crafts one basic argument, and crafts it well.<BR>
<BR>
Nevertheless, a few points may leave readers puzzled. Is Behe acreationist?
He<BR>
explicitly eschews the term. Though a Roman Catholic, he accepted Darwinism
for<BR>
many years without sensing any contradiction with his faith, and still accepts<BR>
common descent. The conclusion of design is drawn from the data itself,
he<BR>
insists, and &quot;not from sacred books or sectarian beliefs.&quot; It
is significant<BR>
that his book came out from a major New York publisher, not a religious<BR>
publishing house.<BR>
<BR>
Yet Behe may protest a bit too much. He rejects the label creationist only
by<BR>
narrowly restricting the term to those who accept a young earth and flood<BR>
geology--disqualifying a host of people who describe themselves as creationists<BR>
but do not hold to those geological theories. Similarly, Behe accepts common<BR>
descent only by giving _that_ term a highly atypical definition. His idea
is<BR>
that an original one-celled organism contained the information for all<BR>
subsequent biological development, which advanced through multiple, coordinated<BR>
changes in sudden, large leaps (akin to Goldschmidt's &quot;hopeful monster&quot;
theory<BR>
except that the monsters appear not by luck but through the unfolding of
an<BR>
implicit design).<BR>
<BR>
It might have been better if Behe had simply said, Sure, I accept creation,
and<BR>
it's time to stretch that category to acknowledge that creationists come
in many<BR>
stripes. Be that as it may, Behe's book is a powerful contribution to the<BR>
literature on the Darwin controversy. The black box has been opened.<BR>
Biologists had better get ready to face the implications of what they find<BR>
there. <BR>

</H4>
<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">D</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">URING the summer of
1932, Oxford don C. S. Lewis traveled to Ireland to vacation at the home
of childhood friend Arthur Greeves. Lewis had grand plans of writing an
allegory during his stay that would explain the intellectual journey leading
to his religious conversion.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">1 </FONT><FONT FACE="Times">Thirty-three
years old, Lewis had converted to Christianity less than two years earlier,
and he was eager to share his newfound faith with the world. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis initially had tried to tell his story in verse.
He struggled with the poem for several months before giving up on it as
a failure, which is perhaps just as well. Lewis&iacute;s first two books&oacute;both
poetry&oacute;had been commercial flops (his last volume had sold only 126
copies in the first three months after publication).</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">2</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Now Lewis decided to start his allegory afresh by writing it in prose. Lewis
eventually titled his work <I>The Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress,</I> and as the
title suggests, the work consciously echoed Bunyan&iacute;s <I>Pilgrim&iacute;s
Progress.</I> In fact, Lewis later described his own allegory as &quot;Bunyan
up to date.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">3</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Like the pilgrim Christian in Bunyan's tale, the pilgrim
in Lewis's story also seeks the celestial city. He just does not realize
that fact for most of the book. In the process of seeking personal fulfillment,
he stumbles into all kinds of intellectual, spiritual, and moral errors.
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis wanted his story to satirize the false ideologies
and &quot;isms&quot; then rampant in western culture, especially the ideology
of materialism.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">4</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
The reigning philosophy of twentieth century science and culture, materialism
decreed that everything--animals, human beings, moral beliefs, even reason
itself--could be explained as the result of purely physical processes and
properties. The roots of materialism reached back into into aniquity, but
the fearsome modern strain was born less than a century-and-a-half ago with
the writings of Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche
and others.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">5</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Darwin was crucial, because he offered a scientific framework that promised
to explain morality and even reason as the product of purely natural processes.
He didn't really succeed in his grand design, but he set the research agenda
for those who came after him. Marx, in fact, wanted to dedicate <I>Das Kapital</I>
to Darwin, though Darwin declined the honor.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">6</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Ideas have consequences, and materialism's consequences
for western culture were particularly extensive and particularly poisonous
-- as the world was finding out even while Lewis started to write his book.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">M</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">ORE than a thousand
miles away from where Lewis was on vacation, an old man stood weeping at
a train station. Desperately clutching his large sack filled with bread,
he pleaded with the station-master to let him on the train.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;You can go on the next train,&quot; the official
told the man, &quot;but not your bundle. Law is law--no bread can be transported
without a license.&quot;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;But how can I return to the village with empy hands?&quot;
cried the man. &quot;How shall I face the village? They await my return
and their bellies are empty.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">7 <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The place was the Ukraine, where an eery emptiness was
settling on the villages and fields as famine spread during the summer of
1932. By the end of the next year, more than 7 million peasants had died
from starvation.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">8</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
This was a disaster made by man, not nature. The deaths were the result
of Joseph Stalin&iacute;s policy to subjugate the Ukrainian peasants and
force them into government-run collectives. Even while the peasants starved,
the Soviet government placed huge quantities of grain in domestic reserves
and exported an additional 800,000 tons of grain to other countries.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">9</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
As the famine worsened, villagers were prevented from travelling outside
their villages to seek help, turning the once-bountiful Ukraine into a giant
extermination camp.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The ruthless utopianism exhibited by Stalin was a natural
outgrowth of the materialist understanding of human nature. So were the
policies of the new regime rising in Germany. Even as the Ukrainian famine
reached its peak, German cabinet ministers were enacting sterilization laws
designed to weed out the &igrave;unfit&icirc; among their nation&iacute;s
citizenry.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">10</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Within six years, the Nazis would set up killing centers to eliminate the
chronically ill and people with disabilities. It was in these euthanasia
centers that the techniques used to exterminate the Jews were developed.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">11<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Nor was the United States immune from the corrosive effects
of materialism. In 1932, Americans elected a buoyant new President who declared
in his subsequent inaugural address that &quot;There is nothing to fear
but fear itself.&quot; In the same inaugural speech, Franklin Delano Roosevelt
asked Congress to grant him extensive new executive powers and warned that
if Congress did not, he would unilaterally take the powers upon himself.
FDR&iacute;s subsequent &igrave;New Deal&icirc; gave hope to millions of
Americans suffering during the Great Depression, but it also layed the foundation
for a mammoth welfare state administered by experts from the social sciences&oacute;experts
who were increasingly dismissive of both moral absolutes and personal responsibility.
The impatience of social scientists with traditional morality could be seen
in the work of anthropologists like Margaret Mead, who had already published
her (now discredited) study of sexual mores in Samoa.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">12</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
The denial of personal responsibility among social scientists was perhaps
most notable in the field of criminology. One criminology textbook published
in 1932 baldly stated: &quot;Man is no more 'responsible' for becoming wilful
and committing a crime than the flower for becoming red and fragrant. In
both instances the end products are predetermined by the nature of the protoplasm
and the chance of circumstances.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">13
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis's attack on materialism thus came at a critical
juncture in world history. The time was ripe for someone to challenge the
materialist menace. Amazingly, Lewis finished a draft of <I>The Pilgrim&iacute;s
Regress</I> by the end of his two-week vacation. It was finally published
in May 1933, the same month Hitler held a midnight bonfire in Germany for
20,000 books that went against the Nazi party line.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">14</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
It is unlikely that Lewis's book was among the books burned, but not because
Hitler would not have found it offensive. The Nazis show up in <I>Pilgrim&iacute;'
Regress</I> as dwarves who are vassals of Mr. Savage, a Nietzschean superman
who sits on a high chair &igrave;dressed in [animal] skins&icirc; and who
wears &igrave;an iron helmet on his head with horns stuck in it.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">15</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
That this was an unflattering portrait of national socialism is undeniable,
but the Nazis first had to know about Lewis&iacute;s book before they could
burn it, and I doubt they even had heard of it. Only 1,500 copies of Lewis&iacute;s
<I>Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress</I> had been printed, and alas, even these did
not sell very well. A few weeks after the book&iacute;s publication, Lewis
joked to Arthur Greeves that he expected <I>Pilgrims Regress </I>to be at
least as big a failure as his last book of poetry.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">16</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
After three successive flops, Lewis must have wondered about his future
career as a writer.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Yet he kept writing. Eventually, he even became successful
at it, and he became one of the twentieth century&iacute;s most powerful
and prophetic voices on behalf of cultural sanity. Like Winston Churchill,
who stood alone against the Nazis when many turned a blind eye to their
evil, Lewis was one of a handful of voices in the wilderness to mount a
credible defense against the materialist onslaught during the first half
of our century. The argument he began in <I>Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress</I>
he continued in such books as <I>That Hideous Strength, The Abolition of
Man,</I> and <I>Miracles,</I> as well as in essays such as &quot;Behind
the Scenes,&quot; &quot;The Poison of Subjectivism,&quot; &quot;Bulverism,&quot;
&quot;Transposition,&quot; and &quot;Is Progress Possible? Willing Slaves
of the Welfare State&quot; The observations made in these writings are as
relevant for us today as when they were first written. Hitler and Stalin
may be dead, but the materialist philosophy that gave birth to them and
their regimes is not. Indeed, western society is still in the grip of at
least four of materialism&iacute;s most damning cultural legacies: the rejection
of reason and objective truth, the debunking of objective morality, the
denial of personal responsibility, and the encouragement of coercive utopianism.
Lewis has something to tell us about all four.<BR>

Truth</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">M</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">ATERIALISM'S first
deadly legacy is the rejection of reason and objective truth. Nineteenth-century
materialists depicted our thoughts as the irrational products of environment
or heredity or brain chemistry. As a consequence, the intellectual classes
became convinced that only the reality was material, and thus the only true
explanations were reductive. If you wanted to explain a flower, you described
its cell structure, not its beauty. If you wanted to explain human beings,
you looked not to their greatest achievements, but to the raw materials
that made them up. As Leo Strauss put it, modern thought tried to &quot;understand
the higher in terms of the lower: the human in terms of the subhuman, the
rational in terms of the subrational&#133;&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">17
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">One possible result of the denial of reason is that people
will become so skeptical that they will believe in nothing. But most people
cannot live without <I>something</I> to give meaning to their lives. Thus,
the ultimate consequence of denying reason is not nihilism but a leap into
irrationality. The philosopher Nietzsche foresaw this at the end of the
last century. If objective truth was dead, the only thing that could save
us from the abyss according to Nietzsche was to create our own meaning by
a sheer act of willpower. We <I>will</I> ourselves into believing something
that will give us meaning. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In the Nietzschean cosmos, what is prized is not truth,
but creativity, freshness, and power: Whoever is strong enough or creative
enough to impose his vision on other people is the hero. In many respects,
we live in Nietzsche&iacute;s universe. The highest praise of a work of
art or a piece of scholarship in today&iacute;s society is not that it is
true, but that it is &igrave;fresh&icirc; or &igrave;original.&icirc; When
one looks at what passes for scholarship today&oacute;the paradigm approach
in the sciences, deconstruction in literature, and the more extreme forms
of ethnic and gender studies&oacute;it becomes readily apparent that most
scholars have given up even the pretense of seeking objective truth. What
they are concerned about is power&oacute;how long their particular ideology
will control the terms of debate. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The first step to extricating ourselves from this morass
is to understand the fallacies of the materialistic reductionism led to
it, and Lewis can help us do this.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis&iacute;s first sustained attack on reductionism
came in<I> The Pilgrim's Regress. </I>The core of his critique comes in
book three, &quot;Through Darkest Zeitgeistheim,&quot; which literally means
through the darkest abode of the Spirit of the Age. In the book, John&oacute;the
name of Lewis&iacute;s pilgrim&oacute;is arrested by the flunkies of a giant
who symbolizes the materialistic reductionism that was the Spirit of the
Age. John is subsequently jailed, leading to a nightmarish sequence. Lewis
relates that the eyes of the giant had the property of making whatever they
looked on transparent: &quot;Consequently, when John looked around into
the dungeon he retreated from his fellow prisoners in terror, for the place
seemed to be thronged with demons. A woman was seated near him, but he did
not know it was a woman, because, through the face, he saw the skull and
through that the brains and the passages of the nose, and the larynx, and
the saliva moving in the glands and the blood in the veins&#133; And when
he averted his eyes from her they fell on an old man, and this was worse
for the old man had a cancer. And when John sat down and drooped his head,
not to see the horrors, he saw only the working of his own inwards&#133;
and suddenly he fell on his face and thrust his hands into his eyes and
cried out, &euml;It is the black hole&#133; I am mad. I am dead. I am in
hell for ever.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">18 <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">John is ultimately rescued from this dungeon by a towering
woman in blue -- Lady Reason, who slays the materialist giant with her sword.
Lady Reason tells John that the giant had deceived him about the real nature
of human beings: </FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times"></FONT><FONT FACE="Times">&igrave;He
showed you by a trick what our inwards <I>would</I> look like if they were
visible&#133; But in the real world our inwards are invisible. They are
not colored shapes at all, they are feelings. The warmth in your limbs at
this moment, the sweetness of your breath as you draw it in, the comfort
in your belly because we breakfasted well, and your hunger for the next
meal&oacute;these are the reality; all the sponges and tubes that you saw
in the dungeon are the lie.&icirc;<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&igrave;But if I cut a man open I should see them in
him,&icirc; replied John.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;A man cut open,&quot; returned the Lady, &igrave;is,
so far, not a man: and if you did not sew him up speedily you would be seeing
not organs, but death. I am not denying that death is ugly: but the giant
made you believe that life is ugly.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">19<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis's point was that reductionism really doesn't explain
that which is <I>human</I> at all. In fact, in the name of explaining man,
reductionism explains him away. As Lewis later wrote: &quot;You cannot go
on 'seeing through' things for ever. The whole point of seeing through something
is to see something through it&#133; If you see through everything, then
everything is transparent. But a wholly transparent world is an invisible
world. To see through all things is the same as not to see.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">20
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In a wonderful 1956 essay titled &quot;Behind the Scenes,&quot;
Lewis articulated his own view of the proper relation between man and his
material components. He likened life to a stage play. In one sense, nothing
in the play is real. It is all imaginery. It is not really set in the countryside,
the people on stage are not really who they pretend to be. The only realities
are the physical sets and costumes and lighting. The play is &quot;appearance&quot;
and the sets are &quot;reality.&quot; Yet, as Lewis points out, &igrave;in
the theatre of course the play, the appearance, is the thing. All the backstage
realities exist only for its sake and are valuable only in so far as they
promote it.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">21<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis here was calling us back to a teleological view
of the universe of the sort offered by Aristotle. According to Aristotle,
you understand something not by what it came from, but by what it has become.
We understand what an oak trees is not by dissecting an acorn but by examining
a fully grown oak tree. Similarly, we understand human beings by who they
are as an integrated whole, not by trying to break them down into their
material or psychological building blocks. When we do look at the subrational,
we ought to judge it in light of the overall purpose of a whole human being.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times"></FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The materialist may scoff at this approach, but as Lewis
relished in pointing out, the materialist has his own problems: For the
materialist who debunks everyone else&iacute;s ideas as the subrational
products of their brain chemistry or environment cannot avoid being debunked
himself. If he is honest, says Lewis, the materialist will have to admit
that his <I>own</I> ideas are merely the &igrave;epiphenomenon which accompanies
chemical or electrical events in a cortex which is itself the by-product
of a blind evolutionary process.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">22</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
The point Lewis is driving at is that if all thoughts are merely the products
of non-rational causes, this includes the materialist&iacute;s own thoughts.
In other words, there is no reason according to materialism for materialism
itself to be regarded as true.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Even people who try to water down their materialism by
granting that reason can be a valid way to truth have a problem, according
to Lewis. For if the universe is how the materialist describes it, it is
not at all likely that reason should have ever developed. &igrave;People
who take [the materialist view],&icirc; explained Lewis, &igrave;think that
matter and space just happen to exist, and always have existed, nobody knows
why; and that the matter, behaving in certain fixed ways, has just happened,
by sort of a fluke, to produce creatures like ourselves who are able to
think. By one chance in a thousand something hit our sun and made it produce
the planets; and by another thousandth chance the chemicals necessary for
life, and the right temperature, occurred on one of these planets, and so
some of the matter on this earth came alive; and then, by a very long series
of chances, the living creatures developed into things like us.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">23</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In sum, materialists have no ground to stand on if they
deny the reality of reason outright, and very little ground to stand on
if they claim to accept reason in part.<BR>
</FONT>
<H3><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">The Debunking of</FONT><BR>
<FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">Objective Morality</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">C</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">LOSELY related to
materialism's attack on reason is its debunking of objective morality, which
is its second sorry legacy. Materialists early in our century denied the
existence of objective standards binding on all cultures, claiming that
environment dictated our moral beliefs. Such relativism was uncritically
adopted by much of the social sciences, and it still undergirds much of
modern economics, political science, psychology, and sociology. In the words
of a college sociology text popular in the 1980s, &igrave;We must recognize
that judgments about good and bad, moral and immoral, depend very much on
who is doing the judging; there is no universal standard to appeal to.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">24
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The triumph of moral relativism has been particularly
evident in our colleges and universities, many of which are populated by
social scientists who berate us for our rampaging &quot;ethnocentrism,&quot;
our unmitigated arrogance in believing that our &quot;values&icirc; might
somehow be &quot;right.&quot; <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Gone is the old undergraduate curriculum with its heaping
doses of the Bible, of Plutarch's <I>Lives</I> and Aristotle&iacute;s <I>Ethics;</I>
in its place is an unrelenting parade of the horrors culled from the cultures
of barbarians. Students used to study the great moments in the history of
Western civilization; now they learn about the cannibalism of tribes in
South America, or the sexual proclivities of some obscure race in the South
Pacific. The point of such lessons, of course, is to &igrave;broaden&icirc;
students&iacute; horizons sufficiently so that they will no longer believe
that their &igrave;values&icirc; are sacrosanct. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Exposed to this message for four years, even the most
sturdy students are apt to become infected. And those who do not succumb
from the disease will likely find themselves incapacitated. I recall having
breakfast with a friend who was about to obtain a degree in one of the social
sciences from a large secular university. Our discussion was wide ranging,
but when the subject of morality came up she became curiously bewildered.
Taught for years that moral beliefs are a function of culture and personal
predilections, she maintained that there were no objective grounds to justify
moral judgments against other cultures. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">&quot;What about the Nazis?&quot; I asked.&quot;Surely
we have an objective basis to condemn what <I>they</I> did?&quot; She thought
a moment, looked more bewildered than ever, and then answered to the effect
that she was personally revolted by what the Nazis did&oacute;but she could
still find no objective basis for her revulsion.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis attacked moral relativism in his opening chapters
of <I>Mere Christianity,</I> where he pointed out that all people&oacute;even
criminals&oacute;appeal to a universal standard when trying to excuse their
own behavior. And even those who claim that right and wrong are mere conventions
will hotly protest when someone wrongs them! Lewis&iacute;s line of argument
here is similar to that presented by Augustine in his <I>Expositions on
the Book of Psalms</I>.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">25</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
However, Lewis&iacute;s most sustained assault on moral relativism comes
not in <I>Mere Christianity</I> but in <I>The Abolition of Man, </I>a small
incisive volume based on lectures he delivered at the University of Durham
in the early 1940s. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In <I>Abolition of Man,</I> Lewis pointed out that we
cannot escape making moral judgments. Every action presupposes a goal toward
which the actor acts, and the goal (no matter how clinically it is expressed)
represents a judgment of value. We cannot exist without making moral judgments,
argued Lewis. The only question is what those judgments will be. Speaking
within the western natural law tradition, Lewis proposed that at the foundation
of all moral judgments is one set of ethical first principles shared by
all human beings. These first principles include obligations to treat other
people justly and to keep one&iacute;s promises. It from these first principles
that all other moral judgments and ethical systems are derived. Strictly
speaking, these first principles cannot be demonstrated themselves, for
they are the first principles from which everything else is demonstrated.
One recognizes them in the same way that one intuitively knows that 2+2=4,
or that if a=b, and b=c, then a=c. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">But what about the social scientists&iacute; claim that
different cultures have had radically different moral codes? In the face
of these differences, how can Lewis maintain that human beings have access
to a moral common ground? Lewis responds with typical candor in an essay
titled &igrave;The Poison of Subjectivism&icirc;:<BR>
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">The answer [to the claim that cultures radically
differ on their moral codes] is that this is a lie&oacute;a good, solid,
resounding lie. If a man will go into a library and spend a few days with
the <I>Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics</I> he will soon discover the
massive unanimity of the practical reason in man. From the Babylonian <I>Hymn
to Samos,</I> from the Laws of Manu, the <I>Book of the Dead,</I> the Analects,
the Stoics, the Platonists, from Austrialism aborigines&#133; he will collect
the same triumphantly monotonous denunciations of oppression, murder, treachery,
and falsehood, the same injunctions of kindness to the aged, the young,
and the weak, of almsgiving and impartiality and honesty&#133; There are,
of course, differences. There are even blindnesses in particular cultures&oacute;just
as there are savages who cannot count up to twenty. But the pretence that
we are presented with a mere chaos&oacute;though no outline of universally
accepted value shows through&oacute;is simply false&#133;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">26
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Those who want to explore this topic further can read
the appendix to <I>The Abolition of Man,</I> where Lewis has helpfully compiled
many of the common moral maxims held across cultures and across history.

<H3><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">The denial of personal responsibility
</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">I</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">F materialism has
been hard on reason and morality, it has been equally destructive of personal
responsibility, which is its third poisonous legacy. By claiming that human
thoughts and actions are dictated by our biology and environment, materialism
undermined personal responsibility. The results can be seen in our criminal
justice system, our civil justice system, and even our welfare system. Ever
since sin entered the world, human beings have sought excuses for their
behavior, but materialism handed us an inexhaustible supply of excuses.
No matter what we do, it can be attributed to a cause other than our own
choices: our social environment, our subconscious drives, our brain chemistry.
An article a few years ago titled &igrave;Roots of Crime&icirc; told about
a researcher who was testing juvenile delinquents&iacute; hair in order
to prove that their violent behavior was the result of vitamin deficiencies.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">27</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
In this new scheme of things, even Hitler can be excused for his crimes,
for in the words of one historian, he &igrave;was a prisoner of his pathological
unconscious drives.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">28 <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Against this modern ethic that no one is responsible,
Lewis strove to make people aware of just how responsible they really are.
Lewis&iacute;s defense of personal responsibility was undergirded by his
commitment to Christianity. The Christian gospel proclaims salvation only
to those who recognize themselves as guilty people in need of divine forgiveness.
But materialism offers modern man a whole slew of methods to avoid facing
our guilt. If nothing is our fault, then what is there to be guilty about?
Lewis countered this mentality not so much by direct disputation, but by
trying to place a miror in front of us that would cause us to recognize
the evil in our own souls. This is most apparent in his fictional works,
where there are key moments of self-revelation when major characters realize
that they are really to blame for the fix they are in.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In the novel <I>That Hideous Strength</I>, Mark Studdock
is a young sociologist who has spent his life cravenly currying favor with
others in order to promote himself. When he subsequently finds himself in
the middle of a totalitarian conspiracy, he first wonders what bad luck
put him there. &igrave;Why had he such a rotten heredity?&icirc; he whined
to himself. &igrave;Why had his education been so ineffective? Why was the
system of society so irrational? Why was his luck so bad?&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">29</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Finally hitting bottom, he suddenly sees with brutal clarity who he really
is and how his own choices led him to the mess he was in. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">One cannot read Lewis&iacute;s fiction without being
convicted of the fact that we are more accountable than we would like to
think. Lewis calls us to responsibility by reminding us that every action
has a consequence, and that no wrong choice&oacute;however small&oacute;is
insignificant. As Uncle Screwtape tells his demon nephew Wormwood in <I>The
Screwtape Letters</I>: &igrave;The safest road to Hell is the gradual one&oacute;the
gentle slope, soft underfoot, without sudden turnings, without milestones,
without signposts.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">30<BR>

<H3><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Helvetica">The proliferation of coercive
utopianism</CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER></FONT></CENTER>
<P><FONT SIZE=5 FACE="Times">T</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">HE fourth legacy
of materialism is coercive utopianism. Although the belief that all thought
and behavior are predetermined by material causes would seem to deny the
power of human beings to reshape their world, materialism in fact inspired
a fierce strain of coercive utopianism. Claiming either that they were merely
the servants of the forces of materialism&oacute;or with Nietzsche, that
they could overcome materialism by a sheer act of will&oacute;materialist
reformers tried to create secular utopias in Russia and Germany. In America,
meanwhile, significant parts of the cultural elite began to believe that
we could engineer the perfect society through social science and planning.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">The coercive utopians in Germany and Russia were both
targets of Lewis&iacute;s scorn. Unlike many intellectuals of his time who
hated one form of totalitarianism only to embraced another, Lewis abhorred
both facism and communism as the poisonous fruit of the same evil tree.
Both ideologies were totalitarian; both led to the deaths of innocent millions;
and so both were to be regarded with equal contempt.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">31</FONT><FONT SIZE=2 FACE="Times">
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">But fascism and communism were far from the only forms
of coercive utopianism about which Lewis was concerned. Tyranny comes in
many forms, most of which are more subtle than Stalin&iacute;s gulag or
Hitler&iacute;s death camps. Lewis knew this, and his most compelling writings
for us today focus on these more subtle forms of oppression. In particular,
Lewis feared that the modern welfare state would become ever more intrusive
as government planners allied themselves with the tools of materialist social
science.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">If people act because of environmental and biological
necessities, as the materialists claim, the government no longer need deal
with them as free moral agents. Under the new system, preemption replaces
punishment as the preferred method of social control. Instead of punishing
you for making the wrong choice (which was the traditional method), the
state simply eliminates your choice. Instead of laws telling us to wear
seat-belts, we have passive restraints that automatically strap us into
the car seat. Instead of simply being told to pay our taxes, our taxes are
automatically deducted from our paychecks. Instead of holding us responsible
for the correct use of any number of helpful&oacute;but potentially hazardous&oacute;products,
the government simply prevents those products from reaching the market.
In the hands of the social planners, the nation is their laboratory.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis&iacute;s painted a grim portrait of this kind of
despotism in his novel <I>That Hideous Strength. </I>There the spirit of
modern social science becomes incarnate in something called the National
Institute for Coordinated Experiments&oacute;NICE, for short. Of course,
there is nothing nice about NICE; its social scientists are exactly the
type of technocrats that Lewis feared. In the name of science and humanity,
they claimed the right to remake society without bothering to obtain society&iacute;s
consent&oacute;let alone the consent of the individuals involved.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">While we are a long way off from the nightmare vision
depicted by Lewis in <I>That Hideous Strength,</I> we certainly should be
able to understand some of what he&iacute;s getting at. For public policy
decisions in our country are increasingly made precisely by the type of
unelected experts that Lewis talked about. During the past three decades
our legislators have transferred much of their authority to a vast array
of independent regulatory agencies staffed by unelected experts who are
largely unaccountable to average citizens. Environmental policy is a good
example. Decisions about how&oacute;and whether&oacute;to save certain endangered
species are made not by elected officials, but by government biologists
and bureaucrats. Decisions about whether we can have fires in our fireplaces
are made not by elected officials but by professional bureaucrats specializing
in air quality. Now some of these decisions we may well applaud; some we
may not. But the fact remains that we&oacute;and those we elect&oacute;have
very little to say in the matter. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">But, you may ask, what&iacute;s wrong with that? Surely
it is better for experts to make decisions about these things than the average
voter or politician? After all, don&iacute;t today&iacute;s increasingly
complicated problems demand that we hand over the reins of power to the
experts?<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis didn&iacute;t think so. He did not dispute that
technocrats have plenty of knowledge; this knowledge may even be necessary
for good public policy. But it is not <I>sufficient</I> for good public
policy. Political problems are preeminently moral problems, according to
Lewis, and technocrats are not equipped to function as moralists. &igrave;I
dread specialists in power,&icirc; he said, &igrave;because they are specialists
speaking outside their special subjects. Let scientists tell us about sciences.
But government involves questions about the good for man, and justice, and
what things are worth having at what price; and on these a scientific training
gives a man&iacute;s opinion no added value.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">32<BR>

after the publication of <I>That Hideous Strength, </I>more than six decades
after the publication of <I>Pilgrim&iacute;s Regress,</I> and more than
thirty years after C. S. Lewis&iacute;s death, we still live in the shadow
of what George Gilder calls &igrave;the materialist superstition.&icirc;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">33</FONT><FONT FACE="Times">
Lewis was a prophet, but it takes more than a prophet to make a revolution.
Yet a prophet can prepare the way for a revolution, and Lewis helped do
that.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">At the end of <I>The Abolition of Man,</I> Lewis called
for a new natural philosophy that would understand human beings as they
really are, not try to reduce them to automatons or guinea pigs. &quot;When
it explained,&quot; said Lewis, &quot;it would not explain away. When it
spoke of the parts it would remember the whole. While studying the <I>It</I>
it would not lose what Martin Buber calls the <I>Thou.</I>&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">34
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">Lewis was not quite sure what he was asking for, and
-- being a realist -- he certainly was not convinced that the revolution
would actually come about. Yet during the next decade it just might. We
live during an era of tremendous and tumultuous change, and nowhere is the
tumult more evident than in the sciences. Recent developments in biology,
physics, and cognitive science are raising serious doubts about the most
fundamental assumptions of materialism. In biology, scientists are discovering
such irreducible complexity in biological systems that the only reasonable
explanation seems to be a non-material designer. In physics, our understanding
of matter is becoming increasingly non-material. In cognitive science, efforts
to reduce mind to the physical processes of the brain have failed repeatedly.
Even in social sciences such as psychology researchers are beginning to
question their materialist assumptions and rebuild their disciplines on
foundations more conducive to human dignity and personal responsibility.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Times">35
<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT FACE="Times">In other words, for perhaps the first time since the
materialist onslaught we have an opportunity to bring about the collapse
of materialism and to re-found the sciences along the lines envisioned by
C. S. Lewis more than half-a-century ago. For the sake of cultural sanity
--and survival -- let us hope that we succeed.</FONT><BR>

<FONT SIZE=2>Biological origins can be one of the most captivating subjects
in the curriculum. As a biology teacher, you have probably already seen
how the topic excites your students. The allure of dinosaurs, trilobites,
fossilized plants, and ancient human remains is virtually irresistable to
many students. Indeed, many prominent scientists owe their interest in science
to an early exposure to this topic.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The subject of origins, however, is not only captivating. It's
also controversial. Because it touches on questions of enduring significance,
this topic has long been a focal point for vigorous debate &shyp;&shyp;legal
and political, as well as intellectual. Teachers often find themselves walking
a tightrope, trying to teach good science, while avoiding the censure of
parents or administrators.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To complicate things, the cultural conflict has been compounded
by controversies within the scientific community itself. Since the 1970s,
for example, scientific criticisms of the long&shyp;dominant neo&shyp;Darwinian
theory of evolution (which combines classical Darwinism with Mendelian genetics),
have surfaced with increasing regularity.</FONT><FONT SIZE=1> </FONT><FONT SIZE=2>In
fact, the situation is such that paleontologist Niles Eldredge was driven
to remark:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If it is true that an influx of doubt and uncertainty actually
marks periods of healthy growth in science, then evolutionary biology is
flourishing today as it seldom has in the past. For biologists are collectively
less agreed upon the details of evolutionary mechanics than they were a
scant decade ago.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Moreover, many scientists have advocated fundamental revisions
of orthodox evolutionary theory.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Similarly, the standard models explaining chemical evolution&shyp;&shyp;the
origin of the first living cell&shyp;&shyp;have taken severe scientific
criticism. These criticisms have sparked calls for a radically different
approach to explaining the origin of life on earth.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Though many defenders of the orthodox theories remain, some
observers now describe these theories as having entered paradigm breakdown&shyp;&shyp;a
state where a once&shyp;dominant theory can no longer explain many important
data. Science historians Earthy and Collingwood, for example, have described
neo&shyp;Darwinism as a paradigm that's lost its capacity to solve important
scientific problems. They note that both defenders and critics find it hard
to agree even about what data are relevant to deciding scientific disagreements.
Putting it more bluntly, in 1980 Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould
pronounced the &quot;neo&shyp;Darwinian synthesis&quot; to be &quot;effectively
dead, despite its persistence as textbook orthodoxy.&quot; <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In this intellectual and cultural climate, knowing how to teach
biological origins can be exceedingly difficult. When respected scientists
disagree about which theories are correct, teachers may be forgiven for
not knowing which ones to teach. <BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>An Opportunity<BR>
</FONT></B><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Controversy is not all bad, however. For it gives teachers
the opportunity to engage their students at a deeper level. Instead of filling
young minds with discrete facts and vocabulary lists, teachers can show
their students the rough&shyp;and&shyp;tumble of genuine scientific debate.
In this way, students begin to understand how science really works. When
they see scientists of equal stature disagreeing over the interpretation
of the same data, the students learn something about the human dimension
of science. They also learn about the distinction between fact and inference&shyp;&shyp;and
how background assumptions influence scientific judgement.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is against this backdrop of challenge and opportunity that
the publisher offers this supplementary text, <I>Of Pandas and People: The
Central Question of Biological Origins</I>. The purpose of this text is
to expose your students to the captivating and the controversial in the
origins debate &shyp;&shyp; to take them beyond the pat scenarios offered
in most basal texts and encourage them to grapple with ideas in a scientific
manner.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas </FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2>does this in two ways. First,
if offers a clear, cogent discussion of the latest data relevant to biological
origins. In the process, it rectifies many serious errors found in several
basal biology texts.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Second, <I>Pandas</I> offers a different interpretation of
current biological evidence. As opposed to most textbooks, which present
the more&shyp;or&shyp;less orthodox neo-Darwinian accounts of how life originated
and diversified, <I>Pandas</I> also presents a clear alternative, which
the authors call &quot;intelligent design.&quot; Throughout, the text evaluates
how well these different views can accommodate anomalous data within their
respective interpretive frameworks. <I>Pandas</I> also makes the task of
organizing your lessons and researching the scientific issues much easier.
Pandas provides the scientific information you need, and provides it in
a way that coordinates well with your basal text.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the spirit of good, honest science, <I>Pandas</I> makes
no bones about being a text with a point of view. Because it was intended
to be a supplemental text, the authors saw no value in simply rehashing
the orthodox accounts covered by basal textbooks. Rather, its presentation
of a non&shyp;Darwinian perspective, in addition to the standard view, is
intended to stimulate discussion and encourage students to evaluate the
explanatory power of different theories &shyp;&shyp; which, after all, is
what science is all about.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By using this text in conjunction with your standard basal
text, you will help your students learn to grapple with multiple competing
hypotheses &shyp;&shyp; and to maintain an open but critical posture toward
scientific knowledge. As students learn to grapple with competing views,
and become active participants in the clash of ideas, you may be surprised
at the level of motivation and achievement displayed by your students.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>The Status of Evolution as a Fact</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Despite the great value of presenting opposing viewpoints,
the popular debate over origins has fostered several misconceptions about
evolution, design, and science itself. To get the most benefit from this
supplement, teachers should understand these misconceptions and be prepared
to face them in an open and fair&shyp;minded manner when they arise.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>One misconception concerns the status of evolution as a fact.
In the origins debate, it is common to hear the assertion that evolution
is not merely a theory, but an indisputable fact. Educators who take this
view argue that it is futile and misleading to present non&shyp;Darwinian
views as serious alternatives to Darwinian evolution.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The factual status of evolution, however, depends critically
on what the word &quot;evolution&quot; means. Yale biologist Keith Stewart
Thomson points out that scientists have used the term in at least three
different ways.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The first meaning he identifies is &quot;change over time.&quot;
In this sense, to say that evolution has taken place is to say that change
has occurred and that things are different now than they were in the past.
The fossil evidence, for example, reveals different organisms from one geological
period to the next.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>When the word is used in this sense, it is hard to disagree
that &quot;evolution&quot; is a fact. The authors of this volume certainly
have no dispute with that notion. <I>Pandas </I>clearly teaches that life
has a history and that the kinds of organisms present on earth have changed
over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The second meaning that Thomson identifies is descent with
modification &shyp;&shyp; the idea that all organisms are &quot;related
by common ancestry.&quot; Evolution in this sense is a theory about the
history of life. In Darwin's view, that history can best be depicted as
a single branching tree &shyp;&shyp; a geneaological tree &shyp;&shyp; in
which life diversifies over time.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Many people assert that evolution in this second sense is a
fact, just as gravity is a fact. But the two situations are hardly analogous.
The fact of gravity can be verified simply by dropping a pencil &shyp;&shyp;
an experiment anyone can perform. The &quot;fact&quot; of common anscestry,
however, is on an entirely different level. We can no more &quot;see&quot;
evolution in the fossil record than paleontologists of Darwin's day could
&quot;see&quot; creation events. The best we can do is infer what might
have happened by piecing together circumstantial evidence from many different
fields.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin, for example, sought to establish common descent by
examining evidence from several different areas: paleontology, biogeography,
comparative anatomy, and embryology. Others have relied, in addition, on
evidence from genetics, molecular biology, and other disciplines.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The problem with this kind of historical detective work, however,
is that it seldom produces a conclusion that forecloses other alternatives.
As philosopher of biology Elliot Sober points out, there may be any number
of plausible explanations&shyp;&shyp;or &quot;past histories&quot;&shyp;&shyp;that
can account for the same evidence. Sober's observation recalls the insightful
warning of fictional detective Sherlock Holmes. &quot;Circumstantial evidence
is a very tricky thing,&quot; said Holmes. &quot;It may seem to point very
straight to one thing, but if you shift your point of view a little, you
may find it pointing in an equally uncompromising manner to something different.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To use another analogy, consider the picture in Figure X. What
do you see? A tired old woman or an attractive young lady? Depending on
what you're looking for, you can probably see either one. The drawing hasn't
changed. The only thing that's different is the way you look at it.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The point is, unless we can eliminate plausible competing explanations,
it's presumptuous to call descent with modification a fact. As most people
understand the term, a fact &quot;</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier">is supposed
to be distinguished from transient theories as something definite, permanent,
and independent of any subjective interpretation by the scientist.&quot;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2>
By this definition, descent with modification simply doesn't warrant the
status of a fact. Far from compelling a single conclusion, the evidence
may legitimately be interpreted different ways, leading to several possible
conclusions. None of those conclusions warrant the status of a &quot;fact.&quot;</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>As zoologist Thomas Kemp warns:<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[A]ll attempts to understand the diversity of organisms rely
upon empirically untestable assumptions either about evolution or about
natural patterns. There is nothing wrong with making assumptions or seeking
to justify them of course. It is the very stuff of science. What is unforgivable
is to forget that they are assumptions and behave as if they were known
certainties when they are no such things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, calling descent with modification a fact only closes
off debate and blurs the distinction between fact and inference. That, in
turn, makes us particularly vulnerable to the illusion that we know more
than we really do. In the preface to his best selling volume, <I>The Discoverers</I>,
historian Daniel Boorstin tells the reader:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The obstacles to discovery&shyp;&shyp;the illusions of knowledge&shyp;&shyp;are
also part of our story. Only against the forgotten backdrop of the received
common sense and myths of their time can we begin to sense the courage,
the rashness, the heroic and imaginative thrusts of the great discoverers.
They had to battle against the current &quot;facts&quot; and dogmas of the
learned.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is precisely why a book that questions the Darwinian notion
of common descent is so necessary. By presenting a reasonable alternative
to evolution in this second sense, <I>Pandas</I> helps students learn to
work with multiple perspectives, to distinguish those perspectives from
facts, and to guard themselves against the illusion of knowledge.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The final meaning of evolution that Thomson identifies concerns
the mechanism of biological change &shyp;&shyp; the particular explanation
of how evolution in the first two senses occurred. Here the term &quot;evolution&quot;
refers to random variation and natural selection. In Thomson's words:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Although many biologists act as though [the mechanism] were
the whole meaning of evolution, it obviously is not. The first and second
meanings could be explained by several different theories, and both had
a serious intellectual history before 1859, while the third meaning is currently
confined to a particular explanatory hypothesis, Darwinism.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Evolution in this third sense asserts that the cause or mechanism
of biological change is purposeless, non&shyp;intelligent, and completely
naturalistic. Oxford zoologist Richard Dawkins defended this view in his
best selling book, <I>The Blind Watchmaker</I>. Like Darwin himself, Dawkins
acknowledges that biological organisms appear to exhibit remarkable design.
Yet both men claim that this appearance is an illusion, produced entirely
by random variation and natural selection. Blind nature mimics intelligent
design.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This &quot;blind watchmaker&quot; thesis is often touted as
a fact, but it is not. For one thing, Darwinists have never demonstrated
empirically that natural processes can create the complex structures that
characterize living organisms. Like common descent, the blind watchmaker
thesis is based on indirect evidence. It accounts for hypothetical transformations
by extrapolating small observed changes over immense periods of time. Thus,
the blind watchmaker thesis is not a fact, but an inference. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, the blind watchmaker thesis &shyp;&shyp; at least
in its neo&shyp;Darwinian form &shyp;&shyp; may not even be a warranted
inference. As we mentioned at the beginning of this essay, neo&shyp;Darwinism
has come under increasing attack from scientists and philosophers alike.
Scientists have increasingly questioned the ability of mutation and natural
selection to generate new organs, limbs, or body plans. A host of other
problems have led biologists Mae-Wan Ho and Peter Saunders to say:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Until only a few years ago, the 'synthetic' or 'neo&shyp;Darwinist'
theory of evolution stood virtually unchallenged as the basis of our understanding
of the organic world....</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Today, however, the picture is entirely different. More and
more workers are showing signs of dissatisfaction with the synthetic theory.
Some are attacking its philosophical foundations....Others have deliberately
set out to work in just those areas in which neo&shyp;Darwinism is least
comfortable, like the problem of gaps in the fossil record or the mechanisms
of non&shyp;Mendelian inheritance....Perhaps most significantly of all,
there is now appearing a stream of articles and books defending the synthetic
theory. It is not so long ago that hardly anyone thought this was necessary.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<I><FONT SIZE=2>Pandas</FONT></I><FONT SIZE=2> gives students a much&shyp;needed
opportunity to explore the evidence and arguments that have caused some
scientists to doubt contemporary Darwinism. It examines evidence from such
fields as biochemistry, genetics and paleontology--evidence that casts doubt
on the sufficiency of purposeless processes to explain the appearance of
new biological forms.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Going a step further, <I>Pandas</I> helps students understand
the positive case for intelligent design. Following a growing number of
scientists and philosophers, the authors argue that life not only <I>appears</I>
to have been intelligently designed, but that it actually was. Drawing on
recent developments in molecular biology, the authors show that even simple
organisms bear all the earmarks of designed systems.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The authors will also discuss what theorists have learned by
applying mathematics and information science to biology. Those insights
suggest that there are ways to distinguish natural systems from intelligently
designed ones--and have led some scientists to conclude that the &quot;coded
genetic information&quot; (or sequence specificity) of DNA, proteins, and
the like, reflects the activity of a pre-existent intelligence. While that
conclusion is still controversial, a growing minority of scientists see
it as a plausible alternative to the blind watchmaker thesis. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>By presenting the case for intelligent design the authors demonstrate
that there are alternatives to the blind watchmaker thesis--and that evolution
as a purposeless process is neither an indisputable fact, nor the only inference
supported by biological data.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In sum, then, only in the most trivial sense&shyp;&shyp;change
over time&shyp;&shyp;can evolution be considered a fact. Far from being
a legitimate reason for avoiding alternative views, the alleged &quot;fact
of evolution&quot; underscores precisely why a book like <I>Pandas </I>is
so necessary. If students are to achieve true scientific literacy, they
must learn to distinguish fact from supposition. A curriculum that blurs
this distinction serves neither the students nor society.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Science and the Laws of Nature</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second misconception revolves around the question of what
makes a concept or explanation &quot;scientific.&quot; In particular, some
scientists and philosophers assert that the concept of intelligent design
is inherently non-scientific. According to this view, science must explain
things by using natural laws&shyp;&shyp;not by invoking an the special action
of an intelligent agent. Thus, we no longer explain the orbit of a planet
by saying that an angel pushes it through the heavens. We explain it with
Newton's law of universal gravitation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the same way, design is ruled out&shyp;of&shyp;court because
it invokes an intelligent agent, rather than natural laws. Philosopher of
science Michael Ruse, for example, has said:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Science attempts to understand this empirical world. What is
the basis for this understanding? Surveying science and the history of science
today, one thing stands out: Science involves the search for order. More
specifically, science looks for unbroken, blind, natural regularities (<I>laws</I>).
Things in the world do not happen in just any old way. They follow set paths,
and science tries to capture this fact. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>There are serious problems with this view, however. One problem
is that it ignores areas of scientific investigation where intelligent design
is a necessary explanatory concept. The search for extraterrestrial intelligence
(SETI) is one example. At the time of this writing, radio telescopes are
scanning the heavens, looking for artificial radio signals that differ from
the random signals generated by natural objects in space. If we were to
limit science to the search for &quot;unbroken, blind, natural regularities
(laws)&quot; we would have to say that SETI is unscientific&shyp;&shyp;by
definition.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Archaeology would meet the same fate. Archaeologists routinely
distinguish manufactured objects (e.g. arrowheads, potsherds) from natural
ones (e.g. stones), even when the differences between them are very subtle.
These manufactured objects then become important clues in reconstructing
past ways of life. But if we arbitrarily assert that science explains solely
by reference to natural laws, if archaeologists are prohibited from invoking
an intelligent manufacturer, the whole archaeological enterprise comes to
a grinding halt.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A second problem with limiting science to blind, natural regularities
is that it confuses <I>laws </I>with <I>explanations</I>&shyp;&shyp;an error
that philosopher of science William Alston calls &quot;a 'category mistake'
of the most flagrant sort.&quot; Laws and explanations are often two different
things.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Scientific explanations often invoke not only laws, but causal
events and actions. For example, consider the field of modern cosmology.
Most cosmologists explain the features of our universe not only by reference
to the laws of physics, but by reference to a single event: the Big Bang.
The Big Bang, for example, helps explain why galaxies throughout the universe
seem to be receding from each other. It also explains the presence of low
level radiation that seems to permeate space. These phenomena cannot be
explained solely by reference to physical laws, or natural regularities.
Rather, the critical explanatory feature is a one-time event that established
the conditions responsible for the phenomena that we now witness.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Taking this idea a bit farther, sometimes it seems that scientific
laws are hardly relevant to our explanations at all &shyp;&shyp; such as
when we try to explain why things turned out one way rather than another.
For instance, Newton's law of universal gravitation may tell us why the
earth has a Newtonian orbit rather than a non&shyp;Newtonian one. But it
doesn't explain why the earth follows it's present orbit, instead of some
other orbit that's equally compatible with Newton's law. That kind of explanation
requires something else &shyp;&shyp; namely, information about how the earth
attained its present position and velocity.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A similar example can be drawn from the field of historical
geology. If a historical geologist wanted to explain the unusual height
of the Himalayas, invoking natural laws would be of little use. Natural
laws alone cannot tell us why the Himalayas are higher than, say, the Rocky
Mountains. That would require discovering antecedent factors that were present
in building the Himilayas, but not in other mountain&shyp;building episodes.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Thus, scientific explanation not only involves laws, but may
also involve past causal events. If scientists could never invoke past events
and causes, they could not explain many important phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Why is this important? Because ignoring the role of causal
events in scientific explanation has created a false dichotomy between agency
&shyp;&shyp; or intelligent design &shyp;&shyp; and the laws of nature.
The fact that scientific explanations may invoke laws doesn't mean that
agency is somehow ruled out. Rather, intelligent agents can alter causal
events and other contributing factors. Although intervention may alter the
course of subsequent events &shyp;&shyp; sometimes in novel and unexpected
ways &shyp;&shyp; it does not violate natural laws.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, the actions of intelligent agents are themselves causal
events. Therefore, citing the action of agents may be necessary to explain
many present phenomena. Imagine trying to explain Mt. Rushmore without reference
to sculptors. Law-like explanations involving only natural processes would
completely miss this critical explanatory factor. That is why archaeologists,
forensic scientists and historians often find it impossible to avoid postulating
intelligent agency.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The notion that science explains solely by reference to natural
law suffers from yet a third problem. In addition to confusing laws with
explanations, it assumes a cookie&shyp;cutter view of science, in which
all disciplines ask similar questions and use the same &quot;scientific
method.&quot; This belies the rich diversity of methods that scientists
use to understand the natural world.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Several philosophers, for instance, have argued that a clear
distinction exists between the &quot;inductive sciences&quot; and the &quot;historical
sciences.&quot; These two broad categories ask different kinds of questions,
and use different kinds of methods. The inductive (or nomological) sciences,
on the one hand, ask questions about how the natural world operates. Hence,
a virologist may try to discover how a particular enzyme helps a virus infect
its host. Or a crystalographer may try to determine the effects of weightlessness
on crystal growth. In each case, scientists seek to uncover the regularities
that characterize natural phenomena.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The historical sciences, on the other hand, ask different kinds
of questions. Rather than trying to understand how the natural world operates,
the historical sciences seek to understand how things came to be. One example,
of course, would be the historical geologist who was seeking to explain
the unusual elevation of the Himalayas. Another would be an evolutionary
biologist seeking to explain the origin of giraffes. Still another would
be the archaeologist seeking to reconstruct an ancient culture. Note that
in each case, the goal is not to find new laws or regularities, but to reconstruct
past conditions and events.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The importance of this distinction to our present discussion
is that although postulating intelligent intervention is completely inappropriate
in the inductive sciences, the same is not true in the historical sciences.
In the inductive sciences, the whole point is to discover how the natural
world normally operates on it's own, i.e., <I>in the absence of intelligent
intervention</I>. Postulating an intelligent agent would thus be contrary
to the stated goal of research.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In the historical sciences, however, the goal is to reconstruct
past events and conditions. Thus, there is no need to impose such restrictions.
Quite the reverse. As we have seen, the explanation of certain artifacts
or features may require reference to intelligence. Intelligent agents may
have left traces of their activity in the natural world. The historical
scientist need not turn a blind eye to them.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Hence, when investigating the origin of the living world, it
is perfectly acceptable to hypothesize an intelligent designer if the evidence
warrants.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Observability</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A third misunderstanding concerns the scientific status of
unobservable objects and events. Some philosophers and scientists claim
that intelligent design is not scientific because it invokes an unobservable
intelligent designer. To be scientific, they claim, a concept or idea must
be testable. Because an intelligent designer is unobservable it is not testable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence not scientific.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>It is by no means clear, however, that something is untestable&shyp;&shyp;and
hence unscientific&shyp;&shyp;simply because it is unobservable. If this
were the case, many accepted theories and concepts would have to be declared
unscientific as well. Chemist J.C. Walton observes:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The postulation of...external intervention [into nature by
a designer] indoubtedly restores order, harmony and simplification to the
data of physics and biology. [Yet] at present there is no unambiguous evidence...for
the existence of the external entity, but this should not be regarded as
a drawback. Many key scientific postulates such as atomic theory, kinetic
theory of the applicability of wave functions to describing molecular properties
were, and still are, equally conjectural. Their acceptance depended, and
still depends, on the comparison of their predictions with observables.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Also falling in this category are almost all theories in the
historical sciences&shyp;&shyp;theories that postulate conditions and events
that occured in the unobservable past. The Big Bang is one such theory.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Another, ironically, is Neo&shyp;Darwinism. Although Neo&shyp;Darwinism
explains many observable features of the living world, it postulates unobservable
objects and events. For example, the mutational events that allegedly produced
reptiles, birds, mammals, and even humans, have never been observed &shyp;&shyp;
nor will they ever be observed. Similarly, the transitional life forms that
occupy the branching&shyp;points on Darwin's tree of life are also unobservable.
Transitional forms exist now only as theoretical entities that make possible
a coherent Darwinian account of how present&shyp;day species originated.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The unobservable character of Darwinism becomes especially
plain when proponents try to reconcile the fossil evidence with their theory.
As paleontologists now admit, the fossil evidence looks a good deal less
&quot;Darwinian&quot; than they had previously acknowledged. Indeed, as
Harvard paleontologist Stephen Gould points out, the two outstanding features
of the fossil record are &quot;sudden appearance&quot; and &quot;stasis.&quot;
At any given location, species tend to appear &quot;suddenly,&quot; fully
formed, and exhibit no directional change during their stay on earth.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The standard neo&shyp;Darwinian explanation for these features
is the imperfection of the fossil record: Because fossilization occurs only
under special circumstances, fossils give us only a rough sketch of evolutionary
history. More recently, some have proposed that evolutionary change occurs
rapidly, and in small, isolated populations of organisms. Both explanations,
however, invoke unobserved circumstances (how can one observe a non&shyp;fossilization
event that happened 100 million years ago?) to explain unobserved fossil
organisms.<BR>
</FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Darwin himself realized that much of the evidence for his theory
was indirect. Indeed, he spent long hours defending his practice of inferring
the unobservable from the observable.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>I am actually weary of telling people that I do not pretend
to adduce direct evidence of one species changing into another, but that
I believe that this view in the main is correct because so many phenomena
can be thus grouped and explained.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>If we accepted the principle that unobservable entities are
inadmissable in science, we would have to reject not only Darwin's theory,
but his entire approach to scientific investigation.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>To be fair, some opponents of intelligent design would argue
that the real problem is not unobervability, but flexibility. The concept
of an intelligent designer is simply too much of a &quot;wild card&quot;:
it can explain anything. Put another way, the concept of an intelligent
designer cannot be falsified.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>On the contrary, however, intelligent design is not so flexible
that it cannot be falsified. The concept of intelligent design entails a
strong prediction that is readily falsifiable. In particular, the concept
of intelligent design predicts that complex information, like that encoded
in a functioning genome, never arises from purely chemical or physical antecedents.
Experience will show that only intelligent agency gives rise to functional
information. All that is necessary to falsify the hypothesis of intelligent
design is to show confirmed instances of purely physical or chemical antecedents
producing such information.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>What's more, intelligent design is not unique in its flexibility.
We have already seen how Darwinists handle the problem of the fossil record
(i.e. in the way they account for unobserved fossil forms by invoking unobserved
geological processes). Indeed, the history of science shows that scientists
have often offered <I>ad hoc</I> explanations to save a cherished theory.
This problem is particularly pronounced in the historical sciences, where
investigators must draw conclusions from incomplete or sketchy evidence.
If flexibility is an issue, therefore, it should be an issue for every scientific
theory, not just intelligent design. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>Religion and Intelligent Design</FONT></B> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>A final misconception you may confront is that intelligent
design is simply sectarian religion. According to this view, intelligent
design is merely fundamentalism with a new twist &shyp;&shyp; and teaching
it in public schools violates the separation of church and state.</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This view is wide of the mark. The idea that life had an intelligent
source is hardly unique to Christian fundamentalism. Advocates of design
have included not only Christians and other religious theists, but pantheists,
Greek and Enlightenment philosophers, and now include many modern scientists
who describe themselves as religiously agnostic. Moreover, the concept of
design implies absolutely nothing about beliefs normally associated with
Christian fundamentalism: such as a young earth, a global flood, or even
the existence of the Christian God. All it implies is that life had an intelligent
source. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Indeed, sectarianism is more a matter of form than content.
It is marked by a certain narrowness and exclusivity that entertains no
debate and tolerates no opposing viewpoints. Given the broad appeal of intelligent
design (even Richard Dawkins, a staunch Darwinist and author of <I>The Blind
Watchmaker</I>, acknowledges &quot;the appearance of design&quot; in the
living world), it is perhaps more accurate to conclude that the real sectarians
are those who villify design as &quot;fundamentalist religion.&quot; Such
name&shyp;calling is merely another way to avoid debate and keep the real
issues off the intellectual field of play.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Even if the design hypothesis were religious, however, criticizing
it on that basis begs the question of whether it's scientifically warranted.
In science, the origin of an idea is supposed to be irrelevant to its validity.
What matters is not the source, but the whether the idea is logically consistent
and empirically supportable. If it is, what justification is there for excluding
it from the classroom?</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>In its landmark ruling on the Louisiana Balanced Treatment
Act, the United States Supreme Court did not try to shield the classroom
from dissenting viewpoints. Indeed, it affirmed that teachers already had
the flexibility to teach non&shyp;evolutionary views and present scientific
evidence bearing on the question of origins:</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Act does not grant teachers a flexibility that they did
not already possess to supplant the present science curriculum with the
presentation of theories besides evolution, about the origin of life. Indeed,
the Court of Appeals found that no law prohibited Louisiana public schoolteachers
from teaching any scientific theory. </FONT><BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>Neither did the Supreme Court choose to limit that flexibility:</FONT>
<BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>[T]eaching a variety of scientific theories about the origins
of humankind to schoolchildren might be validly done with the clear secular
intent of enhancing the effectiveness of science instruction.</FONT> <BR>
<BR>
<FONT SIZE=2>This is not only consistent with good science, it's consistent
with the highest ideals of a democratic society. As John Scopes, who was
tried 1920s for teaching evolution, said at his own trial, &quot;Education,
you know, means broadening, advancing, and if you limit a teacher to only
one side of anything the whole country will eventually have only one thought,
be one individual. I believe in teaching every aspect of every problem or
theory.&quot;<BR>

When we finally find some evolutionary change, however slight it may seem,
the &quot;typostrophic&quot; sort of affair the <I>Phacops rana</I> lineage
seems to show in the Midwest poses a choice between two unappetizing alternatives:
either you stick to conventional theory despite the rather poor fit of the
fossils, or you focus on the empirics and say that saltation looks like
a reasonable model of the evolutionary process--in which case you must embrace
a set of rather dubious biological propositions. Paleontologists are rather
well known for taking that latter course--adopting <I>ad hoc</I>, <BR>

<H5>&quot;As important as it is for Meyer and his colleagues to articulate
precisely what their views are in order to establish some credibility in
the mainstream scientific community, it may be equally important for them
to establish firmly what their views do not represent. That may be the greatest
obstacle they face - not being grouped with the marginal characters of the
origins debate.&quot;</H5>

<H5>&quot;When most of us think of the controversy over evolution in the
public schools, we are likely to think of fundamentalists pulling teachers
from their classrooms and placing them in the dock. Images from the infamous
Scopes &quot;monkey&quot; trial of 1925 come to mind. Unfortunately, intolerance
of this sort has shown itself in California in the 1990s as a result of
students complaining about a biology instructor.&quot;<BR>

</H1>
<BLOCKQUOTE>C. S. Lewis is perhaps the most widely known and read Christian
intellectual of the 20th century. His various works continue to sell more
than a millioin copies each year. He is best known for his theological and
fictional writings, but Lewis also was an articulate defender of representative
democracy, limited government, property rights, and the moral principles
upon which free societies are based. As Americans today seek to apply their
religion beliefs in the public arena in a constructive manner, there is
much they might be able to learn from Lewis.<BR>
<BR>
Accordingly, the purpose of Discovery Institute's project about Lewis and
politics is to use Lewis's writings to help American's better understand
the connections between faith and public life. The project includes public
conferences, books, scholarly colloquium, and published writings by Discovery
Fellows.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><B>The Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) Project</B> <BR>
<BR>
The idea for an Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) came from a solution proposed
by Peter F. Harter in an essay he wrote and submitted to The New York Times
for publication in their Op-Ed page. Although this submission is, as of
the date of this presentation, still under consideration and despite the
youth of this ILTF idea (less than two weeks old), it has gained support.
The idea for an ILTF was unveiled publicly on 12 April 1995 at the Internet
Society Summit, in San Diego, California. In addition to the initial sponsors
listed in this memorandum, additional supporters have agreed to work together
as part of an ad hoc &quot;ILTF formation and steering committee&quot;:
Prof. Hank Perritt of the Villanova Center for Information Law and Policy;
David Johnson, Chairman, Electronic Frontier Foundation; Bob Collett and
Ron Plesser of the Commercial Internet Xchange; Jeffrey Ritter, Executive
Director of OARNet and founder of the Electronic Commerce, Law, and Information
Policy Strategies project; Jerry Berman, Executive Director, The Center
for Democracy and Technology; Lance Rose, Esq.; Jan Constantine, VP and
General Counsel, Delphi Internet Services; David Maher, Esq., and Co-Chair
of the Internet Task Force of the International Trademarks Association;
Prof. David Post. In addition, David Johnson has agreed to co-chair the
steering committee with Peter Harter in order to determine what shape ILTF
should take.

<BR>
<B>I. Introduction.</B> <BR>
<BR>
An Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) can be the legal policy and norms forum
for the Internet. An ILTF must be a large, open, international body consisting
of practicing lawyers, in-house corporate counsel, legislative professionals,
academics, business professionals, technologists, researches, network operators,
publishers, system administrators, and other interested parties. All involved
should be concerned with the evolution and growth of the Internet as a global
electronic community that balances terrestrially bound and geographically
defined interests with the decentralized and transborder nature of internetworked
computer communications that is the Net. <BR>
<BR>
The ILTF shall be an analog to the IETF (the Internet Engineering Task Force)
so that constituents of the Internet and its related industries and communities
can remain self-regulating by determining and promoting legal policies that
reduce risk and liability. If effective, an ILTF can reduce the need for
governmental entities to regulate the use and operation of the Internet.
Like the IETF, the ILTF can succeed by attracting the active and regular
participation of professionals from around the world and by reaching out
to as many cultures and nations in the world as possible in order to avert
conflicts of law and to attain comity amongst disparate electronic communities
and various computer networks rooted in different and distant countries.
<BR>
<BR>
An ILTF can be begun formally and publicly at the Internet Society's upcoming
Summit in San Diego, California, on April 12, during and or after the legal
panel presentation. At that time an acting advisory committee may be formed
so that an ILTF can be properly constructed. This memorandum is only a sketch
-- a starting point from which the idea for an ILTF can be launched. <BR>
<BR>
The National Public Telecomputing Network (NPTN) wishes to work with other
organizations and individuals to promote and further develop self-regulation
and accountability within the collection of users and operators of the Internet.
The Internet Society has agreed to help launch this idea with NPTN and has
offered to form a secretariat and to seek funding. Ameritech Advanced Data
Services and America Online have agreed to be the initial sponsors of the
concept of an ILTF. Other organizations are invited to become initial sponsors.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>II. Why Create an ILTF?</B> <BR>
<BR>
Due to increasing scrutiny by mass media and by legislators and government
officials in the U.S., Canada, and other countries, as well as in states,
provinces, and other terrestrially based jurisdictions, the Internet is
at risk of being Balkanized by inconsistent and ill-thought attempts at
rule making and control. Recently, a Bill introduced in the U.S. Senate
known as the Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S.314) and now likely to
gain passage in that legislative chamber, threatens to impose liability
on those least able to control indecent communications; it ignores the fact
that users are held accountable for their actions already in varying formats
by their system administrators and or network service providers. Users self-regulate
their electronic communities and work with network operators to sustain
the vitality of their networks. S.314 is also embarrassing: It blindly attempts
to regulate a medium that is inherently international in design and destiny.
For S.314 to try and control communications on the Internet assumes that
the U.S. can impose its values on others from around the world and strips
citizens of electronic communities of their right by contract to define
what the acceptable uses of their communities shall be. <BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, there are possible alternatives to S.314. On April 7, 1995,
Senator Leahy introduced the &quot;Child Protection, User Empowerment, and
Free Expression in Interactive Media Study Bill&quot; (S. 714). Leahy's
Bill directs the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Commerce
Department's National Telecommunications and Information Administration
(NTIA), to conduct a study to address technical means for empowering users
to control information they receive over interactive communications systems
such as the Internet, commercial online services, independent BBSs, and
future interactive media. <BR>
<BR>
S.314, however, is not the first nor will be the last attempt at regulating
the Internet; however, it drove one Internet lawyer to start pamphleteering
about the issue. In an essay submitted on 29 March 1995 to The New York
Times for publication in their Op-Ed page, Peter Harter of NPTN reasoned
that if standardization and regulation of the Internet is to occur, it should
come from the bottom-up -- just as the technical standards for the Internet
evolve via the IETF. After some online consultation with Tony Rutkowski
of the Internet Society, it was agreed that an ILTF was an idea worth considering
-- a concept whose time has come. <BR>
<BR>
It is the desire of the creator and founding members of an ILTF that it
form not to impose rules as a super-legislature. Instead, an ILTF must endeavor
to educate elected officials and governmental entities so that they may
better understand the technical and cultural nature and diversity of the
networks that make up the Internet. ILTF must serve as a coordinator to
and communicator between existing Internet law and policy efforts; ILTF
must not aim to duplicate or displace such existing efforts. In doing so
the ILTF can look to the IETF for structure and lessons as the IETF has
had over thirty productive and substantive working meetings since 1986.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>III. Modeling the ILTF After the IETF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B>A. Meetings.</B> The ILTF should meet at least twice a year initially
and perhaps more frequently (i.e., the IETF meets three times a year). It
is proposed that the first public meeting of the ILTF be held, perhaps,
on or near Bastille Day, and outside the U.S., so that the inaugural meeting
may be inspired by the relevant symbolism and history as well as the international
component that is integral to building an effective ILTF. By holding regular
meetings the ILTF shall provide an open arena for working groups (see below)
to coordinate development of legal and policy findings and, recommendations.
<BR>
<BR>
<B>B. Mission.</B> The ILTF mission includes but is not limited to: <BR>
<BR>
* Identifying and proposing solutions and or alternatives to legislative
initiatives arising from any terrestrially based and or electronic governing
body; <BR>
<BR>
* Specifying the development of alternative forms of rules that electronic
communities can opt to use in order to diffuse any conflicts; <BR>
<BR>
* Facilitating the exchange of information between professionals in different
countries so that there may be a better informed and more active legal and
policy community; <BR>
<BR>
* Providing a forum for the exchange of relevant information within the
Internet community between system administrators, users, network operators,
publishers, intellectual property holders, government agencies, businesses,
academics, educators, and concerned citizens; and, <BR>
<BR>
* Publishing online tools and information resources to be used by citizens
of electronic communities, governmental agencies, businesses, and other
interested parties. <BR>
<BR>
<B>C. Working Groups.</B> Leading up to the first meeting and in the time
between meetings thereafter, the actual substantive work of the ILTF shall
be done by working groups. Like the working groups that sustain the efforts
of the IETF, workings groups for the ILTF shall be organized by topic into
several areas. The following areas are suggested and additions and modifications
are requested: <BR>
<BR>
Suggested Area Suggested Contact Person(s) <BR>
<BR>
1. Content a. Copyright Lance Rose, Esq. b. Warning Labels David Johnson,
EFF; Howard Shapiro, Playboy Enterprises <BR>

<BR>
[Nota Bene: The foregoing list of lawyers is subject to change and non-exhaustive.
No contact has been made to any of the above with the exception of Ellen
Kirsh and George Clapp. It is recommended that the acting advisory committee
ask individuals to join the initial slate of working groups.] <BR>
<BR>
Each working group area would have a director that would be a member of
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG) (see below). Under each director
would be a collection of one or more working groups breaking out to tear
through various issues that make up the larger area. As necessary, each
working group within an area could have its own director who would be a
part of an area directorate which reports its findings to the area director
which are then to be communicated to the ILSG. While a very large pyramid
of people can be created here, it is important to have small and focused
efforts in order to cut through issues and not get bogged down in larger
and somewhat alienating meetings. Rough consensus and not strict voting
shall be the proactive rule. <BR>
<BR>
Also, it would be wise to have liaisons set up between ILTF and the IETF,
W3, the U.N. Internet Project, and other organizations and programs as deemed
necessary so that the ILTF may maintain open and interactive communications
links between other organizations to which the ILTF should work in concert
with either intermittently and or regularly. <BR>
<BR>
<B>D. Management.</B> Management of the ILTF shall be handled by individuals
who volunteer to lead a particular topic area and or who represent a particular
region or interest group at large. Together, these volunteers shall form
the Internet Law Steering Group (ILSG). The acting advisory committee to
be formed at the Internet Society Summit in San Diego after the unveiling
of the ILTF concept shall act as the ILSG until a proper ILSG can be formed.
This is likely to occur after the first successful meeting of the ILTF.
The operational management of the ILTF may be handled by the ILSG under
the auspices of NPTN and the Internet Society. In addition, the ILTF may
decide, at future time, to create an Internet Law Arbitration Board (ILAB)
for the specific purpose of having an independent body to adjudicate disputes
in the working processes of the ILTF. <BR>
<BR>
<B>IV. Policy Development </B>&amp; <B>Dissemination.</B> <BR>
<BR>
Neither the ILTF, nor any voluntary, international body can or should have
the right to somehow claim that its de facto rules can be imposed upon other
bodies. However, the ILTF can draft and adopt high quality policies and
then let the marketplace decide if they want to join in and support them
as norms. <BR>
<BR>
<B>V. International Outreach &amp; Character of ILTF.</B> <BR>
<BR>
To be successful the ILTF must focus on attracting active international
participants and directions. Those volunteers involved in the early stages
of the effort to build an ILTF must not be limited in their thinking; while
the &quot;likely suspects&quot; shall be integral, new and unusual members
must be sought out and asked to adopt the concept of an ILTF as their own
and become an ILTF evangelist. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VI. Path Forward.</B> <BR>
<BR>
First, a broad and internationally diverse endorsement of ILTF must be sought.
Second, a plan of action must be drawn up for those leading ILTF. Third,
input must be solicited and integrated. Fourth, a revised memorandum or
formal proposal green paper should be produced and released for comment
and revision. Fifth, plans for a first meeting should b made. Sixth, a formal
white paper should be produced and disseminated for consideration and if
possible adoption and endorsement. Seventh, the processes involved in the
Sixth stage should occur at a live meeting held some time in the summer
of 1995, perhaps around the time of Bastille Day. Eighth, a host for a second
meeting should be sought out in advance and be announced at the conclusion
of the first meeting. <BR>
<BR>
<B>VII. Appendix A: &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.</B> <BR>
<BR>
The following is an unordered, unpreferential, unrevised listing of those
individuals and organizations that should be contacted and asked to be involved
in the creation of an ILTF. They are in no particular order. This list is
not exhaustive. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Internet Law Task Force Organizing to Achieve Consensus on Internet
Legal Issues</CENTER>
</H1>
<B>OCTOBER 31, 1995</B> -- <B>Seattle,WA</B> -- The first international
conference on the law of the Internet served as the platform for the announcement
of an effort to establish the Internet Law Task Force (ILTF) to facilitate
the progressive development of law and public policy in the global information
age.<BR>
<BR>
The ILTF will provide an international forum for issues related to the use
and growth of the Internet including: evolution of the business practices
and legal instruments to assure the validity and acceptance of digital transactions;
property rights; privacy; and the elimination of legal barriers to Internet
commerce and electronic transactions.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;We need to accelerate at the global level the development of solutions
borne of consensus,&quot; stated Peter Harter, former executive director
and general counsel of <A HREF="http://www.nptn.org/">National Public Telecomputing
Network</A>, and now public policy counsel of <A HREF="http://www.netscape.com/">Netscape
Communications</A>, who first advanced the ILTF concept.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Developing standards and practices to protect digital information
and promote the integrity of electronic markets is essential for extending
the Internet to developing countries and nations in transition,&quot; said
Jeffrey Ritter, a legal advisor to the <A HREF="http://www.un.org/">United
Nations</A> on the automation of international trade. &quot;Quite simply,
without an established framework, the Internet faces a confusing, and potentially
disabling, assortment of national laws seeking to govern a global environment,&quot;
Ritter added.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle-based <A HREF="index.html">Discovery Institute</A>, will provide
organizatinal support for the ILTF. The organizing committee will be jointly
chaired by Albert Gidari, a partner with the Seattle-based law firm Perkins
Coie and senior fellow of Discover Institute; Harter; and Ritter, program
director for <A HREF="/Eclips/eclips.html">ECLIPS</A>, a research program
of the Ohio Supercomputer Center.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Our goal is to mature the ILTF into an operating non-governmental
organization as soon as practicable, but ILTF must be a collaborative operation.
We look forward to seeking and obtaining broad-based support for moving
ahead.&quot; the organizers said.<BR>
<BR>
The Internet Law Symposium '95, hosted by the Discovery Institute, was the
first conference devoted to analyzing the legal aspects of an evolving global
space. Bruce Chapman, President of Discovery Institute, announced that most
of those attending added their names to the global listserv--an electronic
discussion group--established for continuing dialogue on the structure and
direction of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
The concept has attracted widespread interest from industry, which has grown
increasingly concerned by the growing efforts of governments to attempt
to regulate the Internet. According to Harter, since the early dialogue
on the need for an ILTF, over one hundred interested organizations and professionals
from four continents have urged establishment of the ILTF.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;For commerce to succeed in cyberspace greater certainty, not inconsistent
regulatory regimes around the globe, is needed,&quot; Gidari said.

<HR><BR>
These are heady times for entrepreneurs, high tech whizzes and international
traders. But many people are left out of the boom, including bank tellers
and telephone operators, middle managers and others whose jobs are being
rendered obsolete by new technologies, corporate down-sizing and international
competition. They can get jobs in this economy, but often not at levels
commensurate with their backgrounds.<BR>
<BR>
In the short term, there is no easy answer to such people's underemployment,
but there is one field that offers substantial opportunity for workers of
all kinds, from the minimally skilled to the highly educated. That field
is tourism. Paying an average of 10 percent more than other employment,
today's tourism industry is a source of good jobs as well as more jobs.<BR>
<BR>
Tourism matters to Washington State because the region is an increasingly
popular visitor destination, but also because Seattle is headquarters for
such top travel companies as Westin Hotels, Alaska Airlines, Holland America
cruise lines and, of course, Boeing. Unfortunately, state and local governments
have put relatively little emphasis on exploiting this strength. At 15.2
percent, Seattle has the second highest hotel room tax in the country--surpassed
only by Columbus, Ohio, hardly a tourist magnet. Yet, Washington State ranks
47th among states investing such dollars in development of the tourism industry.<BR>
<BR>
What's our problem? Perhaps we still think of tourism as a frill, or as
an industry with a real future only in sunnier climes. Or we fret that the
tourists who visit from Japan or Scandinavia will go home, quit their jobs
and move in on us. Neither statistics nor experience back up those concerns.<BR>
<BR>
How underrated is tourism? Well, how many of us realize that it is now the
number one industry in the world? The stunning fact is that tourism business
generated $3.4 trillion last year, even surpassing conventional manufacturing
categories like steel or autos. Seattle and King County stand to gain greatly
from this global development; our own annual tourism business has grown
from $900 million to $2.7 billion in the past decade. The number of foreign
visitors--480,000 last year--also has doubled in that period, not even counting
two million Canadians. But we can do much better.<BR>
<BR>
The foreign market, indeed, is one of the most promising. This is especially
so in Asia, where the middle class is doubling its massive size in this
generation--from 200 million to 400 million in India, for example. Worldwide,
women are becoming a bigger share of travelers now--already up to 33 percent.
Another trend: leisure visitors, rather than business travelers, will soon
account for 80 percent of air travelers.<BR>
<BR>
Analysts have found that these new international tourists are very cost
conscious--just at the point in history when the United States finally has
become more affordable. Moreover, 75 percent of current foreign visitors
to the US have been here before, so there is fresh curiosity about destinations
other than standard gateway cities like New York and Los Angeles. Seattle,
for instance: close to Asia, up-to-date, well-priced, and also friendly
and safe. <BR>
<BR>
Juergen Bartels, the new chairman and CEO of Westin Hotels, a company that
began in Seattle 65 years ago and today is a leading hotelier in 80 locations
around the world, was asked recently why Westin decided to remain here.
His response was that &quot;Seattle is not in the middle of the country,
but it is in the middle of the world.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Lest that sound like mere boosterism, the German-born Bartels is quick to
point out that the &quot;world&quot; Westin has identified as leading the
travel boom is the Pacific Rim, and especially Asia. Seattle is a good location
from which to launch an ambitious hotel expansion scheme like Westin's,
which aims to open 60 new hotels in the next five years, an average of one
a month.<BR>
<BR>
Seattle's position in international travel is improved further by our new
status as U.S. home to APEC (the Asian Pacific Economic Council) and the
prestige of the Henry M. Jackson School at the University of Washington,
whose international program is particularly strong in Asian studies. The
Port of Seattle's new International Conference Center that opens next summer
and the coming expansion of the Washington State Convention Center will
help establish Seattle as an especially well-endowed meeting location.<BR>
<BR>
What is missing so far, however, is a well-orchestrated, high priority effort
to build on this area's international tourism potential. We cannot and should
not count on the federal government to lead; its whole tourism budget is
only about the size of Luxembourg's, and nothing like, say, Canada's. In
Olympia, Governor Lowry and a couple of state legislators intend next month
to propose a doubling of the state budget for tourism--but that still will
amount to only $4.6 million, far less than the programs of neighboring states,
let alone, British Columbia. It's time for state and local governments to
see the full scope of the opportunity and to collaborate in meeting it.<BR>
<BR>
The best strategy is, first, to increase spending in tourism development
by tapping into the huge tax revenue provided by the tourist industry itself
in the form of the hotel tax. Judicious use of that source should not alarm
the general taxpayer and will return its investment manifold. When a modest
public and private promotional budget was deployed by the Seattle area in
Great Britain recently, it resulted in a doubling of British tourist visits
here. <BR>
<BR>
Pooling existing funds of government and private sector alike, as in the
British promotional case, should be the second emphasis of an international
tourism strategy. A common promotional campaign will go much farther than
many divergent ones. Indeed, we should solidify the tentative efforts now
underway to link the overseas tourism programs of the Northwest states with
the more advanced foreign visitors campaign of British Columbia and build
up the international appeal of the whole Cascadia region.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, isn't it time that we stopped looking the gift horse of tourism
in the mouth?

    <TITLE>Curbin America's Appetite for Lawsuits</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<B>From the Friday, December 8, 1995, <I>Seattle Post-Intelligencer:</I></B>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
It's time to curb America's appetite for lawsuits</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
</I><A HREF="katz.html">[Read Roberta Katz's remarks on reform of the adversarial
legal system]</A></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>A woman at McDonald's spills hot coffee in her lap and a jury awards
her $2.7 million. Another jury awards a man $4 million from BMW because
he wasn't told that his new car had received a minor paint touch-up before
he bought it. Yet another man is awarded $12.3 million, most of it in &quot;punitive&quot;
damages,&quot; because he fractured his neck on a Slip 'n Slide lawn toy
whose wrapper, he charges, did not warn him adequately that adults could
get hurt playing with such a thing. (It just shows that we must keep toys
out of the hands of grown ups.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Winning the lawsuit sweepstakes in today's America is a lot easier than
winning the lottery, and while news of enormous legal awards arouse amazement
and anger in most of us, it evidently incites a drooling appetite to sue
in the rest. No wonder we now have 14 million lawsuits a year, one for every
17 Americans.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The western district of Los Angeles alone has more lawyers than all of Japan.
California as a whole is definitely a Golden State for trial lawyers; 99
of 100 auto accidents, including fender benders, result in lawsuits. Overall,
Americans' chance of being in a suit is now three times that of Canadians.
And it isn't just big businesses that gets hit, but also mom and pop stores,
charitable groups and local governments--anyone, however remotely connected
to a problem, with &quot;deep pockets&quot; that can be invaded when the
real source of a grievance is poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When lawsuits hit the jackpot, who do you think benefits almost as much
as the alleged victim (who gets an average of 43 percent of awards)? That's
right, the lawyers get about 33 percent, and the rest goes to administrative
and other costs. Top corporate lawyers in America do very well in life,
but the top trial lawyers eclipse them, some raking in $15-$90 million a
year, a recent review inForbes magazine shows. Especially well-rewarded
are those who figure out how to get a parade of new clients to sue the same
company for the same problem over and over and to get &quot;punitive damages&quot;
each time in order to &quot;send a message&quot;--a message that sometimes
reads &quot;bankruptcy.&quot; Juries are not allowed to learn about this
tactic, or they would rebel more often.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And who, in addition to the manufacturer or store owner, pays? Right again:
you do--in higher insurance premiums, higher consumer prices and lowered
stock values in your personal or pension portfolio. Even though some of
the most outrageous suits are later reduced by judges, the whole litigious
system in this country, according to a study by the management consulting
firm of Tillinghast/ Perrin Towers, is freighting our economy with a burden
$140 billion annually. That is money that otherwise could create new jobs,
raise pay and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before the trial attorneys and the professional &quot;consumer advocates&quot;
they so often support race to their word processors to protest my bias (or
maybe start a class action suit!) let it readily be acknowledged that businesses
and ordinary citizens do sometimes commit terrible blunders that harm others,
and that &quot;tort law&quot; is an entirely proper corrective. Lawsuits
often have forced negligent companies, doctors and other entities and individuals
to accept proper financial responsibilities and to improve safety standards.
Even the &quot;contingency fee&quot; arrangement that assures a plaintiff
that he will not pay the lawyer unless he wins the case can be defended
on the basis that it allows poor people access to justice in a system that
favors wealth.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem, however, is that the system has slowly gone nearly out of control
and has become counterproductive. Trial attorneys' jaundiced eyes and wily
ways may have motivated some otherwise indifferent firms to act more responsibly,
but at least as often the fear of legal action reaches a point where companies
are driven out of business by ruthless legal speculators. Doctors stop entering
certain fields that have become overly attractive to lawsuits. In some states,
people who might otherwise be good Samaritans when confronted by a person
in distress, instead refuse to help because of a wholly rational fear of
being sued. Another example of the chilling effect of over-litigation is
the growing trend among employers to avoid giving objective references for
former employee because they know that certain trial attorneys' latest speculative
field is &quot;wrongful termination&quot; (cases doubled between 1991 and
1994). The result is that many employers are wary of new hiring altogether.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recognition of these consequences of over-litigation has finally created
a backlash. This year alone some 20 states have passed tort reforms. A study
by the National Bureau of Economic Research shows considerable stimulus
of economic growth in those states where tort reforms have been enacted,
and a drag on the economies of states where lawsuits hobble enterprise,
and that kind of study will fuel still more reform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nationally, trial attorneys are used to calling the shots in Washington,
D.C. , perhaps because they are generous campaign contributors, last year,
for example, donating $14 million. But they are conspicuously apprehensive
that Congress might pass serious tort reform legislation in this session;
indeed, in the next few weeks. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives,
led by Rep. Henry Hyde of Illinois, passed a fairly broad bill, including
caps on punitive damages and much-needed malpractice limitations. But the
Senate, where floor-leader Slade Gorton of Washington feared that too narrow
a victory would invite a Presidential veto, came up with a much more limited
reform bill that mainly covers product liability. (Another bill to limit
frivolous class action suits by supposedly aggrieved stockholders disappointed
at the failure of managers to anticipate stock price fluctuations seems
to be coasting to a surprisingly easy victory and Presidential signature.)
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, while the trial attorney lobby believed that House-Senate differences
were too great to allow any bill to pass this year, the two houses' &quot;Conference
Committee&quot; suddenly appears close to a resolution. Reform-minded senators
now think that their present veto-proof majority might be willing to accept
certain obviously reasonable aspects of the House bill--for example, a financial
limit on civil actions that don't involve physical injury or suffering,
and a limit on actions taken against non-profit organizations and local
governments.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If Congress passes any tort reform bill this session, the cause of major
reform will not be drained of energy, as some reformers fear, but reinvigorated.
A public appetite for suing one another took us down the present path, and
an appetite for restoration of a more civil society can now be stimulated
through the steady introduction of successive and successful steps toward
the thorough overhaul our system really needs. Legal utopianism paradoxically
diminishes the very justice it claims to seek. We have another, better tradition,
and that is common sense. It has a much better record of achieving justice
in this all too imperfect world.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Happy Conservative Pit-Bull Turns Ten <BR>
by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
Polls show that the public primarily blame Republicans in Congress, rather
than President Clinton, for the recent (and future?) government shutdown.
Those who blame both sides equally think that the battle is merely &quot;political&quot;
in the worst sense. At the state level, Referendum 48, the property rights
initiative, was soundly defeated earlier this month by a margin of 60-40.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is the conservative revolution running out of steam? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No--not to hear John Carlson tell it on his KVI radio afternoon talk show.
Indeed, the jovial Carlson, who infuriates liberals, is even more gleeful
than usual these days as he urges Seattle area listeners to deluge the President
with ball point pens to encourage him to sign a balanced budget. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In truth, there are good reasons for conservatives to smile. Though politically
at sea for years, they finally can smell dry land. History, their onetime
foe, seems to be on their side now. Significantly, while conservatives are
keeping their promises, the opposition is accepting their premises. The
issue in Washington, D.C., for example, no longer is whether to seek a balanced
budget, but how to achieve it, and how soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once you get the issues defined your way, it is possible to stop fighting
rear-guard actions and go for a clear cut victory. When you really reduce
spending growth to below the rate of inflation and commit in fact, not fancy,
to a balanced budget, you can expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest
rates. In anticipation of that, markets already have rallied. If you go
on to reduce taxes on families and capital gains, economic expansion becomes
sturdier, and philanthropic giving grows. If you genuinely constrain government
over-regulation and decentralize government functions, personal liberty
is enlarged. Seeing that all this really is possible, the voters want more.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Thus, conservatives may lose some day-to-day propaganda struggles, but the
long term &quot;fundamentals&quot; of their position (as economists might
say) are sound. In about two more elections they may emerge not only as
the normal governing majority in politics, but also the major force in intellectual
life--the status that liberals have occupied since the Depression. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The liberals' ideas came out of academia, starting with the first self-conscious
&quot;political scientists&quot; at Princeton and Johns Hopkins at the turn
of the century. Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson created
the huge federal civil service, and it, too, generated ideas. The media,
which was mostly conservative or neutral until 40 years ago, swung to the
left in the 1950s, with a few notable exceptions, and gave liberalism an
aura of moral superiority and political inevitability. Even big business
was leery of wandering outside of the supposed liberal &quot;consensus.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The seeds of conservative renaissance, however, were planted during the
very heyday of the liberal intellectuals by a philosopher named Russell
Kirk and a small magazine edited by young Bill Buckley, <I>National Review</I>.
But it has prospered thanks largely to an institution created in the present
generation: the think tank. Some think tanks--or public policy institutes--are
liberal, but most are not, and as you look at the pages of national and
local magazines and newspapers, or listen to TV discussions and radio talk-shows,
you are bombarded by the news and views of &quot;fellows&quot; in &quot;institutes.&quot;
That's new. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In national affairs, it happened first in Washington, D.C. with creation
of the American Enterprise Institute (eclectic conservative), the Heritage
Foundation (&quot;movement&quot; conservative, with a $28 million budget),
and Cato Institute (libertarian), among others. But then a second phase
occurred--explosively--at the state level, and, at last count, there are
now some 60 think tanks around the country specializing in local and regional
issues. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Portland, there is the Cascade Institute and in Olympia, the Evergreen
Freedom Foundation, led by former state legislator Bob Williams. But the
oldest public policy group in the Northwest is the Washington Institute,
founded by John Carlson, which is about to celebrate its 10th anniversary.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am prejudiced, I admit it. I have enjoyed John's company ever since he
was a delightfully irreverent college student at the University of Washington,
assaulting the choleric dogmas of The UW Daily . He is still irreverent,
and whether you find that delightful or not probably depends on your politics.
He's also smart and constructive. By founding the Washington Institute in
1985 and helping it to survive this long, he has given state and local government
a whole new source of political ideas and initiative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
John has now graduated to a perch as institute &quot;chairman&quot; so that
he can devote more of his time to harrying the left from his talk show,
a weekly column and regular appearances on two TV discussion programs. Stomping
around on the grapes of liberal wrath, he still lands hard on the toes of
antagonists, but his writing and wit have matured like a vintage Merlot.
Visiting dignitaries pay him court, and one of these days he is going to
wake up and find that he is part of the Establishment. But, happily, not
yet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, an energetic former insurance executive, Bill Baldwin, runs the
institute's show out of donated offices in a West Seattle building with
the biggest American flag you ever saw. From there issue papers decrying
state regulatory and budgetary excesses, calls for stronger defense of property
rights and a tough line on crime. A couple of years ago the institute helped
conceptualize the &quot;Three Strikes, You're Out&quot; legislation that
now wins nods even from The White House. Institute arguments were used by
state legislators who rolled back Gov. Lowry's health care plan. At the
moment, high priority is attached to increasing privatization of many state
government functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of this policy agenda, Washington Institute also publishes
Counterpoint, a newsletter that assigns itself the role of watchdog on the
watchdogs of the media, usually biting at their heels, but also making &quot;good
dog&quot; awards. Overall, critiquing the press is not exactly a winning
strategy for assuring coverage of your other programs, but it does keep
many readers amused and gratified, and maybe it does some good in reminding
members of the Fourth Estate that they, too, are human. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For all of this, the state's watchdogs of the right are grinning as they
nip away. Every dog must have its day, and, after 10 years, the sun does
not seem at all ready to set on the Washington Institute. <BR>

    <TITLE>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<I>From Friday November 3, 1995 Seattle Post Intelligencer:<BR>
</I>
<H1><CENTER>The Danger of Ethnic Nationalism is Not Unique to Quebec </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by <BR>
Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>What do you follow in politics, economics or your heart? The moral discipline
of the market or the lure of memory? Your future as an individual or the
passions of your group? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Quebec was asked such questions this week, it split almost neatly in
two. And so might many of us. Indeed, what Canada faced, and will face,
is not dissimilar to what America faces and much of the world faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By a victory margin of only one percent, the decent, muddle-through confederation
of Canada--engaging affection not because of its pride, but because of its
humility--managed to hold on to just enough of the French-speaking community
to give it a reprieve from permanent division. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We now see, moreover, that what was averted may have been worse than even
the loss of a major province; namely, a complete breakup. When it seemed
that the &quot;sovereignist&quot; side might prevail in Quebec, large crowds
nationwide rallied 'round the Maple Leaf; and in that sense, Canada at last
found its patriotic voice. But at the same time, some commentators began
to re-investigate old arguments for an independent British Columbia, Alberta
or Ontario. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Gibson of the Fraser Institute in Vancouver, whose <I>Thirty Million
Musketeers: One Canada for All Canadians</I> , has just been published,
warned that a &quot;majority-plus-one 'yes' vote&quot; in Quebec very quickly
might result in several nation-states emerging across the broad pink map
that now represents Canada. But Quebec, voting a majority-plus-one percent
&quot;no,&quot; did not secede, for the moment, though another attempt will
be made in a few years. In the long run, however, economics, the moral discipline
of the market and individualism--rather than ethnic nationalism--will prevail.
And, they should prevail. Je me souviens (&quot;I remember&quot;) is a bitter-sweet
ethnic sentiment, not a principle for just governance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the battered federalist victors in Monday's vote have another
chance to revise political Canada. One way to try to prevent dissolution
is devolution. Not just heavily subsidized Quebec, but also the relatively
well-off provinces of Ontario, B.C. and Alberta, want more power to make
policies on pensions, labor training and economic development. Driven by
the brutal demands of Canada's federal debt--roughly $400 billion U.S. dollars--and
huge provincial debts, too, the governing Liberal Party in Ottawa may well
agree. Otherwise, as Gordon Gibson notes, the twin to the danger of losing
Quebec will be losing Canada's sovereignty to foreign credit markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Along the way, as federal power is devolved to the provinces, the level
of federal funding will be cut. Taxes probably will not go up, however,
and eventually must come down, for political as well as economic reasons;
Canadians are punished by high taxation and are showing interest in the
supply-side economics of the relatively new Reform Party. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If cutting spending and devolution sound like an echo of the policies of
the Republican Congress elected last year in the United States, that is
because these trends are, in fact, widespread. Pruning back years of government
growth, privatizing and decentralizing are logical responses to increasing
global economic competition. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The frugality medicine is hard enough to swallow in the United States, but
Canada is likely to gag on it. But, one of the reasons for the strong separatist
vote in Quebec is the poor state of the Canadian economy, and the main reason
for the poor economy--high unemployment, high interest rates, sagging dollar--is
government's refusal until now to take the medicine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The moral discipline of the market does lead to economic--and social--health,
that is the good news. You can see the results in the recent improvements
in such far-flung countries as Chile, New Zealand, the Czech Republic and
Estonia. The government of President Meri of Estonia, who visited Seattle
this week, cut taxes and eliminated tariffs and reports a sustained six
percent growth rate, in contrast to dawdling, centralist Russia, next door.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Estonians also have the second highest per capita Internet use in Eastern
Europe (after Finland). High technology, indeed, is another force for decentralization
and greater economic freedom world wide. The Internet is almost an emblem
of what is happening to communication and commerce today. It ignores national
borders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But does this free and open world, with its economy driven by high technology,
sound a bit frightening? If you feel that way, you have company in more
places than Quebec. In Eastern Europe, for example, the collapse of communism
caused even more fear than pain and often stimulated an escape to the seemingly
warm hearth of ethnic nationalism. Chechnya, Bosnia and the peaceful but
foolish secession of Slovakia from its Czech partner show the devastating
consequences of that illusion. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In our own country, we only have to get over two generations' growth of
the welfare state, not totalitarian socialism. But the appeal of ethnic
nationalism is strong here, too, as witness the black separatist ambitions
(though now ambiguous) of Louis Farrakhan. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wherever you are, if you are hurting and fearful, it is tempting to nourish
your resentments and to imagine that you are stronger in a group-- racial,
ethnic, religious, geographic, gender, or whatever. The group, you find,
derives its justification in grievances against some other group. If only
you can remember past wrongs to the group and elevate the group identity
to your all-purpose answer, you can forget the moral discipline of the market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The American Founders and the classical liberal economists had a different
vision: of personal liberty and personal responsibility. The Canadians have
their own version of the same understanding. Because it respects all individuals
as equal before God and the law, this vision benefits society as a whole.
It tries, at least, to see you for yourself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For people have souls as well as hearts, and souls do not go to heaven in
groups, but one by one.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>For Canada breaking up is hard <BR>
-- and wrong -- thing to do</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Canada is a country where something terrible is always just about to happen,
but never does. The terrible thing is usually the secession of Quebec. The
mere possibility of a province seceding reminds a citizen of the United
States of what stability was bequeathed to our country by the Civil War.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other respects, Canada's political scene is usually so calm that Americans
pay it no attention. We tend to see our northern neighbor as simply that
big happy vacation land that produces great comedians and Hollywood movie
locations that look more like American cities than our own do. &quot;Politics
in Canada&quot; sounds like the title of a boring book.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But hardly anything disturbs the political calm like breaking up one's country.
And in Canada that seems to be a constant and real threat. For nearly three
decades Canada, like Sisyphus, has been condemned to roll the rock of Quebec
up the hill of federalism, only to have it roll back down again, over and
over. Worse, federalist forces have to win every election held on on the
issue of separation, while secessionists need only win once. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Probably. In Canada, elections often settle even less than they do here,
especially since Canadians are masters of the art of Awkward Compromise
that leaves everybody somewhat satisfied, but also a little grumpy. If Quebeckers
next Monday vote for &quot;sovereignty&quot; and empowerment of provincial
leaders to negotiate a new relationship with the rest of Canada, it is still
unclear what that will mean in concrete terms. Prime Minister Jean Chretien
says it means separation, clear and simple. No more Canadian passports.
A division of the national debt, and no special favors. On the other side,
the Bloc Quebecois, led by Lucien Bouchard, argues that Quebec will be an
independent &quot;nation&quot; if the &quot;yes&quot; vote prevails, but
nationhood in this instance apparebtly is conceived as something between
the existence of a strong province and a truly foreign state. Both sides
claim the other is insincere and unrealistic.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going into the final week of the campaign, the &quot;yes&quot; vote on sovereignty
was pulling ahead. If the final returns run along those lines, there will
be a political earthquake of long duration in Canada. Already, in dreadful
anticipation, the Canadian dollar and stock prices have been falling. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best hope for federalism, acording to a former Liberal Party cabinet
minister, Gordon Gibson, who is now a fellow of the free-market Fraser Institute
in Vancouver, is &quot;ballot box chill.&quot; As seems to have happened
in 1980, Quebec voters may celebrate independence over the weekend, then
soberly vote their economic interests--which surely lie with federalism--the
next day.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, Quebec sovereignty is a deep cultural aspiration for many of the
francophone citizens of la belle province, and to the extent that economic
motives operate beyond that aspiration, popular disatisfaction over the
currently stagnant economy seems to make &quot;change&quot; the ally of
separation rather than of continued federalism. Sadly, Quebec is no different
than the rest of Canada in its bad fiscal management in recent years. Government
deficits at both national and provincial levels are so high that America's
appear mild in comparison and elsewhere even the dominant Liberal Party
has been forced to economy measures, many Quebeckers have not got the word.
Though they are, on balance, subsidized by the federal government, they
think their economic difficulties come from unfair treatment at the hands
of &quot;TROC&quot;--the rest of Canada.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That makes TROC as angry as reserved Canadians allow themselves to get.
Annoyance is especially strong in the West, and nobably across our border
in British Columbia.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That raises the obvious question, how would a &quot;yes&quot; vote in Quebec
affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Americans, especially those living close to the border, the obvious
question is, how will this affect us?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer is complex. However annoyed English (or better, non-French) Canada
may be with Quebec, the prospect of disunion would be a real blow to national
morale. Worldwide, Canadian prestige would be hurt. Despite the high cost
of keeping Quebec in the style to which &quot;le Belle Province&quot; is
accustomed, the loss of Quebec and the literal division of the country,
would damage Canada economically. Even more than the US, Canada needs budgetary
belt-tightening combined with sound growth if it is to avoid economic decline.
Yet, as the breakup of the USSR has shown, it is difficult to reform oneself
economically while the whole map is being redrawn.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Canada in not a basket case like some of the former Soviet states.
Unfortunately, Americans tend to think of Canada mainly as a place that
produces great comedians, shares our baseball games (where we fly their
flag upside down and get their national anthem wrong), and looks more &quot;American&quot;
in Hollywood movie productions than many locations in the United States.
It's our little brother that we alternately ignore or enjoy teasing.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, in reality, Canada is a big, independent, powerful country. If it seems
less sometimes that is only because Canada is next door to, well, us. It
wins awards as the most &quot;livable&quot; country in the world. It is
democratic. In their quiet way, Canadians are passionate about freedom.
When times are tough, as when our diplomats were taken hostage by Iran,
or on any number of ocassions at the UN, when a confidential friend or honest
broker has been needed, Canada has taken on the job. In trouble spots around
the world or in a natural disaster, Canada is almost always at our side,
or there before us. Canada is our NATO ally. And our biggest trading partner.
Canada's well-being and its self-confidence matters--to us.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, a vote for disunion may, once more, be avoided. Quebec's voters
may have their separatist victory party Saturday night and then sober up
the next day and again vote &quot;non.&quot; Alternatively, disunion for
a diminished Canada, if it happens could prove endurable, or even beneficial
for Canada. Like the Czech Republic without Slovakia or Slovenia without
the rest of Yugoslavia, a smaller Canada might actually prosper.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, meanwhile, we in the Pacific Northwest have especially strong reasons
to be concerned about the Quebec vote. Our commercial and cultural ties
with British Columbia are growing stronger all the time. Regardless of the
Quebec vote, we have cause to persevere with our concept of &quot;Cascadia&quot;
as a cooperative region of US states--particularly Washington and Oregon--with
Western Canada--particularly B.C. We have great opportunities to promote
both sides of the border in this distinct and fortunate geographic region,
whether the collaboration is expressed in expanding tourism from overseas,
conducting ocassional joint trade missions, reducing border delays, improving
bi-national transportation, forming education partnerships among our universities,
boosting regional sports teams and arts activities, and just learning from
one another. Cross-border Cascadians have much in common, including a bright
future. Let us also make it plain that we have never wanted political union,
just friendship and cooperation. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The genuine crisis a Quebec separatist vote would cause Canada, and the
chronic frustration the issue will continue to cause in Canadian politics
even if the federalists prevail by a narrow margin, can evoke only one legitimate
response down here. Regret. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The best thing we can do after Sunday's vote is to emphasize how much we
in the Northwest value the close ties we have with our provincial neighbors
in &quot;Cascadia,&quot; as well as with the rest of Canada.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>What Laws Should Govern the Internet? </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1><CENTER>Individuals, not governments, should shape Internet's future</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
<B>by</B> <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bruce Chapman </I></B></CENTER>
<P><HR><BR>
The two traits that have always distinguished the American character are
a fierce insistence on personal liberty and &quot;Yankee ingenuity.&quot;
Both live on brightly in the Internet, the winning future of communications
and commerce. Forget Al Gore's industrial era image of &quot;the information
superhighway,&quot; conjuring up visions of interactive televisions and
a big regulatory job for government. The concept isn't big enough or open
enough for what the Internet already is becoming. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet began as an obscure Defense Department communications project
a quarter of a century ago, but for the past twenty years it has been changing
in form and content. It is no longer a government network tying computer
users together, but a worldwide network of many networks, free and open
to all, and increasingly easy to access. There is no monopoly potential
to it, so government's excuse to regulate it is almost nil. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
More than 40 million people presently use the &quot;Net&quot;, some just
for electronic mail. However, 22 million of them also use it for research,
education, buying and selling, video-conferencing, publishing, or simply
seeking information in text and motion pictures from around the world. With
the number of &quot;domains&quot;--Net locations you can contact--growing
about seven thousand a month, and with numbers of users doubling annually,
the Internet is a whole new communications revolution. Further, its low
cost general offerings are greatly enriched by various for-profit services
and software products that, in turn, help America's economy to expand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But (good news for lawyers, alas) there are legal problems on the Net. If
the Internet it to continue to flourish, these problems must be met head
on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When businessmen, attorneys, techies, academics and government officials
meet in Seattle for the first International Internet Law Symposium later
this month, they will be responding to a sense that Internet service providers
and users need to find answers to certain legal issues before the government
does. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A government-run Internet is no more in the public interest than a monopoly-run
Internet. But neither is a lawless Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For example, this column belongs to the Seattle Post-Intelligencernow and,
per agreement, to me later. In a few days I'll put it on the Internet &quot;home
page&quot; of my think tank and make it available to readers all over the
world (I can dream, can't I?). But what if someone plagiarizes it? Or simply
reprints it and sells it commercially? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yes, I know, &quot;Who cares?&quot; Well, if it were not a column, but,
say, a book--say, your book--you might care a lot. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, copyright law has to apply somehow to the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And so do other property rights, including the right to protect one's reputation.
Who, for example, owns e-mail within a company? What are standards of libel
in cyberspace? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Or take the issue of gambling, which is now illegal in most states, with
certain exceptions. A huge battle is building over a proposal to provide
Bingo and other gambling on the Internet, organized through a Native American
company, Multimedia Games, Inc., in Oklahoma, and operated through outlets
on reservations nation-wide. How can gambling be controlled when state and
eveninternational borders mean nothing? Among other things, how can it be
taxed? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like most legal disputes, these involve both important principles and practical
trade-offs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pornography is another example. When both models and customers may be children--including
children receiving unsolicited filth through the Internet--the principle
of offended &quot;community standards&quot; normally would be invoked. But
what is the &quot;community&quot; in this case: Seattle? The world? The
&quot;community&quot; of Internet users? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then there is the related problem of persons inventing false identities
and deploying the Internet to attract gullible minors to real life sexual
encounters. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any added legal sanctions, of course, must be understood as complimenting,
not contradicting, other important values, such as privacy and free speech.
Fortunately, law enforcement is getting into the field in both a vigorous
and reasonable way. Which raises the question, do we need new laws in this
area, or just common sense extensions of the ones we have? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The trend towards digitized cash is yet another story. Banking is heavily
regulated now and while many of us are intrigued by the trend toward commercial
transactions conducted over the Internet, unless people have good assurances
of security, such innovations won't succeed. Unfortunately, federal law
presently prevents U.S. businesses from encrypting their transactions internationally.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In any case, transfers of money electronically, as ATM's have shown in a
modest way, do not have to be fail-safe. They just need to be as safe as
transactions that use cash or checks. In a few years, cash in your wallet
may be almost as rare as a silver dollar. Money will move internationally
the way it moves around town now. Ah, but when all that happens, what becomes
of the IRS? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of these questions are fascinating to discuss and deliberate. But first,
one major medium for discussing them, the Internet iteself, needs to be
better understood. At the moment, while the telecommunications bills before
Congress move in the direction of a freedom model, they still ignore the
Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ordinary people should shape the exciting future of the Internet. Government's
job is simply to be sure that the laws that keep normal commerce reliable
and free also protect the Internet. But, even that job is going to require
careful foresight. <BR>

NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Ross Perot may have walked into a trap of his own devising. By deciding
to set up an official political party instead of merely running for President
as an independent candidate, Perot will be subject to all the legal difficulties
that beset the two major parties. It will be harder now for him to play
the reformist outsider. And the state versions of his new party are almost
sure to cause problems. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What will he have gained? Practically nothing. Organizing a new political
party in these times is like starting a typewriter company; you're investing
in a declining market. Political parties historically had four main roles:
control of nominations, financing candidates, filling patronage jobs and
creating a cohesive caucus in the Congress and state legislatures. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All but the last role have been reduced in the past thirty years, thanks
to one &quot;reform&quot; after another. Primary voters, not party regulars,
pick most nominees; candidates' organizations, not parties, raise most campaign
funds; and patronage--after a century of civil service reform--is down to
token numbers, and those few are hired by office-holders without much consultation
with their party. And the last role--forming legislative caucuses--is not
one that will benefit Perot's Independence Party, since it is unlikely to
elect many local candidates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we assume that Perot will be able to get his party legally recognized
in all 50 states, and that is a big assumption, there still are enormous
obstacles to operating the party successfully. Laws governing parties differ
widely from state to state. For example, the latitude for a party to give
financial support to particular candidates is far greater in a state like
Ohio than it is in a state like California. Separate legal teams, and legal
procedures, will be needed for each state. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With 50 new state Independence parties will come a certain amount of &quot;independence&quot;
for those parties internally. The publisher of the daily political Hotline
in Washington, D.C., Douglas Bailey, predicts that &quot;Once Perot creates
all these state parties, there is nothing to stop them from running local
candidates with their own ideas and their own personal baggage. Then Perot
loses control.&quot; New York's Independence Party, which suggested to Perot
that he use its name, already plans to slate up to a thousand candidates.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot also may lose some of his self-styled reformer image. In the past,
he has wanted us to believe that the two major parties get into trouble
so often because their candidates are morally weak and lack his wonderous
&quot;common sense.&quot; Only Perot, standing above the fray, was pure.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In reality, most election scandals are the result of some petty infraction
or wrong assumption about the nation's increasingly dense weave of campaign
laws. Never before, including the Progressive Era, have so many ethics laws
been put on the books. Even with relatively experienced personnel, the Republicans
and Democrats cannot help making the kind of petty bookkeeping and judgment
errors that, taken out of context and exaggerated by a hostile opponent
or the media, can be made to look serious and intentional. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perot's United We Stand, America is legally a mere non-profit organization
and, for example, does not have to follow financial disclosure laws. But
Perot's new and official party will be held to the same strict standards
as the Republicans and Democrats. His organization will find the reporting
of contributions alone to be a tricky challenge. Then will come the scrutiny
by the media and political foes. Did anyone contribute more than the permitted
$1000 per person? Was any of the money from a source that someone, somewhere
deems disreputable? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, when something goes wrong, the blame will tend to fall directly
on Perot himself, for his party will still be identified as more of a one-man
show than any since 1968, when the American Independence Party was organized
by and for Alabama Governor George Wallace. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if Perot is the Independence Party presidential candidate, one of
the &quot;reforms&quot; most likely to develop wide public interest in 1996
will be ending the advantage allowed for rich individuals like him to buy
advertising and organizing talent that other parties must obtain through
broad solicitations. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Perot may persuade Colin Powell to run at the head of the new
party, which surely would increase the flow of individual contributions
and expand the party's showing at the polls. What opinion surveys indicate
so far is that the Independence Party would do its best with Powell as its
nominee. But the ticket still would not win. In contrast, the surveys suggest
that Powell as a Republican would win. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This raises another question. Other than Perot's o'ervaulting ambition,
what substantive reason is there for the Independence Party? Is there some
novel insight it brings to a deficient political system--as the new Republican
Party did with its clear anti-slavery message in the 1850s, which helped
it replace the badly divided Whigs? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No. Except for his anti-free trade position, Perot's main themes, including
budget cutting, echo the Republicans. The difference is that they are in
office, and he is not. They take the heat; he carps. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the head of a national party, that stand-offish role will change. Ross
Perot running as an outsider, as in 1992, might make enough of an impression

<H1><CENTER>Public needn't fear budgetary 'train wreck' rhetoric </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR><BR>
The noise you hear coming from Washington, D.C. is not the screeching prelude
to a budgetary &quot;train wreck.&quot; It's only the noise of a rhetoric
wreck. There is nothing at all unusual about the failure of Congress and
the President to reach agreement on a budget by the formal deadline, October
1 (this Sunday). And the &quot;crisis&quot; over the debt ceiling that is
slated to follow later on this fall is only slightly more worrisome. We
have gone through such &quot;crises&quot; many times since the 1970's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On one occasion, when Budget Director Jim Miller warned Ronald Reagan that
refusal to reach a compromise with the Democratic Congress could bring government
operations to a halt, the President replied, &quot;Jim, Jim, settle down.
Let's close the place down and see if anybody notices.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nobody did. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In similar stalemates now Congress almost routinely adopts a &quot;continuing
resolution&quot; that allows spending on essential services (such as defense)
and entitlements (such as Social Security) to carry on, and for other programs
to operate at a maintenance level. Such a resolution is available this weekend.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The situation will not be much different around mid-November if Congress,
on another issue, tries to force financial discipline on the Administration
by refusing to raise the federal debt limit. Mr. Clinton and his allies
already are warning that Republican &quot;blackmail&quot; will spook the
markets. Air traffic will be grounded. Federal contractors will be stiffed.
Children will starve. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps these horror tales are meant to frighten us out of that national
&quot;funk&quot; that concerns the President. Or perhaps the Democrats are
just getting an early start on Halloween. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, all the whoops of distress have but one purpose, which is to deflect
the majority in Congress from doing what they promised: to cut the budget
now in order to balance it by 2002. The people whose careers are built on
an ever-expanding government sector--people who believe that downsizing
is only for the private sector--are going to try to make you believe that
the world is coming to an end. But it's only their political assumptions
that are ending. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Don't get me wrong. Many proposed budget cuts are difficult to accept. Some
reductions don't make sense when considered by themselves. And almost all
of us are for government spending when it favors a cause close to our own
hearts. I can see the desirability of eliminating the national service program,
&quot;Americorps,&quot; but a student benefiting from its payments probably
does not. Consumers in Seattle and New York might cheer the overdue effort
to end farm subsidies, but it's a hard sell in Louisiana cotton country
or Wisconsin dairlyand. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, the truth is that relatively little of the budget savings needed
will be achieved just by cutting &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; or
even by tackling special interest spending. At some point, you have to go
into broadly popular programs. That Republicans are doing so, though gingerly,
and that these reductions are being presented before television cameras
as the mad slashing of mean-spirited conservatives, accounts for the sagging
public approval ratings of Congress. Yet, with a national debt equal to
$71,860 per family of four, we just can't afford all the good things government
intends to do for us. Spending growth needs to slacken. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, taxes do need to go down. The reason is not to make the rich richer,
but to raise our savings rate, spark the investments that create jobs and
to help working families make ends meet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The question for voters is, do you really want to stay on the track to long
term economic growth, or do you want to derail the train at the first signs
of difficulty? For the Republican majority in Congress, the question is
almost identical. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, most Democrats, as in the '80's, have already given their
answer: Real cuts are for budgetary &quot;outyears,&quot; Washington, D.C.'s
equivalent of the sweet-by-and-by. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But unlike the 80's, when Republicans occupied the White House and Democrats
controlled Congress, the tactical advantage is now with the GOP. If Congress
wants to spend, a President has few ways to prevent it. If--as now--Congress
does not want to spend, the President has even fewer ways to force it to
do so. In a contest of wills, Congress probably can stand the pressure better
than the President. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That means they also may not be deterred by short term drops in the polls.
Perhaps the left has forgotten a pertinent lesson from the past, but it
has not been forgotten by the GOP elephant. In 1990, when President George
Bush tried to force budgetary restraint on a Democratic Congress, the artificial
heat generated in the ensuing &quot;crisis&quot; was especially intense.
Bush finally cracked and backed down. In return for limited future spending
controls, he agreed to break his pledge on taxes (Remember &quot;Read my
lips&quot;?). He was a hero to the media at the time, a real statesman.
And the voters didn't seem to care much--until they trounced him soundly
in the next election. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994 the Republicans ran on a Contract with America. They told the voters
exactly what they wanted to do: cut spending, cut taxes and revive America's
economic growth. And they won a history-making victory. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
They are now trying to do what they promised. Boogeymen are being thrown
up to scare them off track, including Mr. Clinton's holograph of a government
&quot;train wreck.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the ghost of George Bush scares them a lot more. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>Tithing tax break offers better reform <BR>
than block-grant push </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I> <BR>
<BR>
<HR></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
Wailing critics in Washington, D.C. would like you to believe that America's
poor are about to be devastated by plans to block grant welfare funds and
send them to the states. The House of Representative's desire to add specific
mandates to that approach simply raises the wailing to a higher pitch. <BR>
<BR>
But the truth is that 70 of the 80 major federal and state welfare-related
programs are not affected by the reform bills, while those that are affected
will go through a slower rate of growth, not real reductions. Adopting &quot;workfare&quot;
or allowing the states to experiment with other structural changes does
not automatically assure more innovative use of the money, let alone savings.
<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of whether the Senate bill or the House bill emerges from the
conference committee set up to reconcile their differences, and regardless
of the President's relative enthusiasm,&quot;welfare as we know it&quot;
is not really going to end. But, maybe it should. <BR>
<BR>
Why must we always turn to government--at whatever level--for welfare solutions?
Since the 1960's &quot;War on Poverty,&quot; spending on cash and in-kind
transfers (cash, food, housing, energy, medical aid, etc.) has increased
640 percent in real, inflation-adjusted dollars. Yet most social problems--such
as out-of-wedlock birth rates--are far worse today. Perhaps welfare reformers
are not being &quot;radical&quot; enough. &quot;Radical,&quot; after all,
means getting at the roots, and when it comes to helping the poor, we need
to recognize that the private sectors of society--including churches and
other non-profit organizations, as well as the job-creating profit sector--tend
to do a better job than government. <BR>
<BR>
The challenge is to find ways to enable the non-government sectors gradually
to take on greater responsibility, while government's role is reduced. The
idea is not to leave the poor without friends, but to find them truer friends.
<BR>
<BR>
Rep. Mark Souder of Indiana proposes to stimulate private giving with an
increase in the tax deductibility of charitable donations, from 100 to 120
percent. Reps. Joe Knollenberg of Michigan and Jim Kolbe of Arizona would
give a $100 tax credit for gifts to community groups that work with the
poor. Sen. Coats of Indiana would increase that to $500. <BR>
<BR>
In Seattle, philanthropist and former businessman Mark Bloome asserts that
society would be spiritually improved overall and the poor allowed to advance
more surely, if the old Judeo-Christian ideal of the &quot;tithe&quot; could
be reinvigorated. He does not necessarily connect his idea with welfare
reform, but welfare reform certainly would benefit from being connected
with his idea. Tithing, the gift of 10 percent of one's income to the church
or other charity, is rare today, a victim mainly of high taxes. The answer,
Bloome believes, is to provide a federal tax credit for those charitable
contributions a person makes beyond five percent of his income (which are
tax deductible) and up to ten percent (the tithe). In contrast to a mere
deduction, the tithe would encourage people to give beyond the five percent
threshold, which is already a sacrifice, while the ten percent ceiling would
prevent tax-credited benevolence from bankrupting the federal treasury.
<BR>
<BR>
Tax reform advocates, as well as welfare reformers, would do well to consider
the wisdom of ideas like Bloome's. Experience in the 80's--when marginal
tax rates were lower and charitable giving was higher--and the 90's--when
tax rates went up and charitable giving stagnated--supports the common sense
expectation that people will give more when they have more to give. Thus,
lower and flatter tax rates probably will increase charitable giving even
as they boost the overall economy and personal income growth. <BR>
<BR>
What tax reformers tend to overlook is the political, if the not the moral,
desirability of linking a more productive tax system to one that assuredly
serves the poor directly. The tithing idea would do it. <BR>
<BR>
Private charity is intrinsic to the American character. It is more personal
and voluntary, and hence more moral, than government distributed tax funds.
And it tends to be more effective. Perhaps private charity cannot supplant
all government welfare, but it can redress the present imbalance. It offers
citizens of many political persuasions a potentially better choice than
either the present welfare mess or any of the conventional political proposals
for reform. <BR>
<BR>
It's time to get radical.

<H1><CENTER>&quot;Endless campaign a poor way to choose a president&quot;
</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>By Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
In the recent dog days of summer, over a hundred people showed up at Seattle's
Washington Institute to meet one of the superficially more improbable candidates
for President in 1996, the articulate black Republican, Alan Keyes. <BR>
<BR>
A former Reagan Administration official, Keyes believes that the decline
of the family is the central problem in society, around which almost all
other problems revolve. His message went over well. He said he'll be back
soon. <BR>
<BR>
For so many citizens to appear at such events a full year before the 1996
national nominating conventions and fifteen months before the final election
might seem remarkable. But, decision time for activists is not next spring;
it's now. <BR>
<BR>
Presidential campaigns are being organized and financed earlier than ever
before. Competition to attract attention from candidates and the media has
encouraged states to set their primaries earlier and earlier on the calendar.
As a result, the first primaries next year will come in February. Only seven
weeks later, in April, over 80 percent of all public votes for delegates
will be over. <BR>
<BR>
If candidates waited to enter the race until the primary season was nearly
underway, as Dwight Eisenhower did in 1952, they would be too late to qualify
legally, let alone to assemble a team. (Attention, Gen. Colin Powell.) A
strategy like President Franklin Roosevelt's in 1940--when he did not declare
his candidacy until the eve of the Democratic convention--is unimaginable
in our time. <BR>
<BR>
Since Washington State recently moved its own presidential primary forward
to March 26, we, too, are suddenly part of the scramble. That and fundraising
opportunities are the reasons that candidates already are showing up. Sen.
Phil Gramm of Texas, Gov. Pete Wilson of California, former Education Secretary
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania have all flown in.
Sen. Dick Lugar of Indiana, who still thinks a coherent foreign policy is
important, apparently has decided that Washington could be a breakthrough
state for his candidacy and is planning several visits. Malcom S. (&quot;Steve&quot;)
Forbes, Jr., publisher of Forbes magazine (&quot;The Capitalist Tool&quot;),
may visit Seattle soon after a likely declaration of candidacy this month.
Now that our primary falls on the same date as nearby California's, even
the frontrunning Sen. Bob Dole is increasing his interest in Washington
State, according to his national political consultant, Don Devine. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, Washington is a must-win state for the Democrats in the final
election, so don't be surprised to see lots of President Clinton and Vice
President Gore. <BR>
<BR>
In the month of March in past presidential election years, we were all watching
the first primary. But next March, Washington State will be taking part
in one of the last of the important ones. Thereafter, the identity of the
two presidential nominees may well be known--and then we will fall into
the rut of a six month long final election drive. Spring's excitement will
be brief, the frustrations that follow interminable. <BR>
<BR>
If you believe that democracy benefits from some relatively quiet time between
spasms of political extravagance, this is not the way to organize our national
elections. Neither a sitting president nor his opponent is likely to behave
like a statesman when a campaign atmosphere dominates. Leadership suffers
when a presidency is preoccupied with the next election for a full two years
out of a four year term of office. <BR>
<BR>
When you consider that the first six months or so of a president's term
are absorbed in putting an administration together--another process elongated
in recent times--the normal tasks of governing actually are getting only
about a year and a half of our Chief Executive's undivided attention. And
the same is true for most of his would-be opponents. <BR>
<BR>
Americans don't hate these politicians. They just get very tired of them.
But, no immediate change is possible. Party rules and presidential primary
dates are already locked into place for 1996. <BR>
<BR>
The only cure for the coming epidemic of politics-fatigue is for citizens
in this election cycle to demand that the two major parties and Congress
push the primaries back to something like their old schedule for the year
2000. Parties, for example, should pass rules precluding the seating of
convention delegates that are chosen before, say, April of an election year.
And Congress should refuse to provide candidates with federal matching funds
until roughly the same period. <BR>
<BR>
In an era of instantaneous and ubiquitous communications, why should our
political system require five times as long to choose a president as it
did in the days of Grover Cleveland?

Forward Thrust or Bust? </CENTER>

<P>The danger in next month's capital improvements election--with the Seattle
Commons, neighborhood ball parks and a big outdoor ballpark for the Mariners
on the ballot--is not that voters of Seattle and King County will lack the
facts upon which to make a sound judgment. There will be plenty of healthy
debate. The real danger, especially for young voters and newcomers, is that
the choices may take place in an historical vacuum. <BR>
<BR>
The best argument for the bond issues is that, unlike so many federal, state
and even government promises, voters in this case can be fairly sure of
what they are getting for their money. They will be able to see the results.
But if they are skeptical, they might want to review what happened with
some other great decisions in Seattle history, including most recently,
&quot;Forward Thrust.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Even people who experienced it may have forgotten what that former citizens'
crusade did to make Seattle a better place to live. Indeed, our area today
is at a crucial point not unlike that of 27 years ago. The economic boom
back then had left many people worried, for the first time, that the area's
&quot;livability&quot; was threatened. Yet, voters may have been more optimistic
then, if only because family income was growing faster than it is now. <BR>
<BR>
In the short term, that optimism was somewhat unwarranted. Within a couple
of years after the first and determinative Forward Thrust election of 1968,
Seattle suffered the famous &quot;Boeing recession.&quot; In the subsequent,
less hopeful atmosphere of 1970, the remaining Forward Thrust proposals
that were put on that year's ballot were defeated. <BR>
<BR>
But then a wonderful thing happened--several wonderful things, really. The
Forward Thrust projects that King County residents had approved in the palmy
days of 1968 began development in the early 70's at just the right time
to help revive the economy. A spectacular series of civic improvements ensued,
including new parks, recreation and professional sports facilities, sanitation,
fire stations, a youth service center, and community centers. It was largely
due to the major Forward Thrust projects, and the many smaller projects
inspired by them, that Seattle started winning &quot;Most Livable City&quot;
awards over the following decade. A successful 1972 vote for a metropolitican
bus system (the often-forgotten third ballot vote of the Forward Thrust
series), and the state legislature's adoption of Forward Thrust measures
to modernize SeaTac Airport and our seaport added to the momentum. <BR>
<BR>
I was newly on the City Council then and delighted with the opportunities
Forward Thrust offered Seattle. Many of them were serendipitous and unanticipated.
For example, historic preservation had not been considered when the Forward
Thrust parks proposal was planned, but by 1972 we were able to use historic
preservation techniques to find new uses for old Seattle landmarks and to
save money on building some of the &quot;new&quot; facilities Forward Thrust
had promised. <BR>
<BR>
As for the parks themselves, Forward Thrust allowed Seattle area governments
to pick up properties for what we can now see were bargain prices. For example,
the land for Mercer Island's Luther Burbank Park, presently valued at $70
million, was acquired for all of $l.5 million. <BR>
<BR>
Though capital funds were relatively plentiful in the '70's, thanks to Forward
Thrust, maintenance funds were not. But Forward Thrust inspired City Hall
to find creative ways to close much of the gap. One way was to combine projects
in order to reduce overhead expenses. Merging the new aquarium with the
Waterfront Park is an example. <BR>
<BR>
We also found we could get some of the new parks actually to generate revenue
to offset their maintenance costs, as was the case again at Waterfront Park.
Re-using the existing old piers as part of the park design was entirely
in keeping with the park's theme, and it also permitted us to expand visitor
interest with shops and restaurants. And, ever since, these private concessions
have provided the city with rent and sales tax revenues. <BR>
<BR>
Due to the inspiration of the father of the Forward Thrust movement, Jim
Ellis, the city and county also learned how to leverage bond moneys to attract
public grants, private investments and gifts. These ranged from highway
funds and a new private building that helped make Freeway Park possible
to private flower garden donations for the park's operations. Thus, the
citizens of Seattle and King County actually got far more than they voted
for. How often does that happen with government? <BR>
<BR>
In fact, the total bond moneys of $330 million were nearly doubled by federal
and state public grants, along with private investments and gifts ($240
million), plus interest on the bonds ($55 million). Throw in the increased
property values of recent decades, and Forward Thrust turns out to have
been the best bargain for Seattleites since we built the City Light hydroelectric
dams at the turn of the century. <BR>
<BR>
People over 40 often ask what happened to the kind of enlightened and inventive
civic leadership that gave us Forward Thrust. Part of the answer is that
while contemporary Americans demand leadership, we denigrate leaders. We
are particularly cynical about motives now, even with citizen volunteers.
And then there is the problem of time. Back in the '60's, Jim Ellis expected
to spend less than two years on Forward Thrust and wound up devoting seven.
Today's extensive approval processes and other hurdles make public projects
exhausting for citizen leaders. <BR>
<BR>
But the rest of the answer to the leadership question is more heartening.
The truth is that both the Seattle Commons idea and the proposal to build
a new outdoor stadium initially arose from outside of government and have
elicited almost exactly the same quality of citizen spirit that gave us
Forward Thrust-or, earlier, the Century 21 World's Fair that left us the
Seattle Center. <BR>
<BR>
Over several years more than 2500 citizens from all walks of life have donated
personal time, financial contributions and talent to the Commons idea. At
first, there was not even any great interest from the organized business
community or from government. <BR>
<BR>
There is no hidden agenda. The uncommon Commons vision is persuasive because
it has just the right mix of boldness and prudence, like Forward Thrust.
The vision is to create 18,000 good new jobs, anchor a good share of the
city's new, multi-income housing growth at the south end of Lake Union,
with a landmark central park that everyone can use, and in the process help
reduce urban sprawl and traffic congestion. It will be a model of a more
sensible urban envirornment. <BR>
<BR>
As with Forward Thrust, the citizens who have thrown themselves into the
Commons effort have figured out how to blend many aims to produce a package
with wide appeal. The neighborhood ballparks are needed, though they are
not urgent. But the plan to use the Commons project as a means to solve
the near-legendary Mercer Street traffic mess is an excellent case of sound
multi-purpose planning. <BR>
<BR>
The Commons, if adopted, probably will excel Forward Thrust in attracting
private investments and and already has done so with philanthropic gifts
and loans. The Commons group also has figured out how to attract money from
outside the area. As an immediate consequence of approval of the Commons'
bonds, $18 million of bond funds will be used to secure matching state and
federal highway grants to widen the Mercer corridor and put it underground.
<BR>
<BR>
When you think of it, the Forward Thrust spirit is also alive in the unfairly-maligned
plan to build a Mariners ballpark. It, too, will be multi-purpose, not just
the place for a baseball fan to enjoy a soft summer night, but a place for
any of us, and our children, to enjoy a wide range of civic events and celebrations.
And thanks to an ingenious retractable roof, it will work regardless of
the weather. <BR>
<BR>
The ballpark proposal bespeaks the all too-unusual civic dedication of the
wealthy individuals who risked their own money--starting with the Japanese
owner of Nintendo who effectively gifted us with $50 million--to save the
local professional baseball team. That is what we now have on the line.
<BR>
<BR>
You don't put your money into a baseball team in Seattle to get rich (or
richer) these days, whatever you may tell your spouse. And you don't go
to endless Commons meetings to advance your career. Maybe you step forward
because you are nostalgic for your youth, or for the dreams you had of the
city you'd like to see, or maybe you are that old fashioned type of person
who believes in the concept of civic virtue. <BR>
<BR>
Whatever its source, we can't buy that kind of civic spirit at any price.
Like the citizens of the ancient Roman republic--or Seattle at the high
points of its history--we can only try to call it forth. <BR>
<BR>
This town has lots of other needs and opportunities beyond those on the
current ballot. But that is not a reason for discouragement. We also have
better prospects than we have ever enjoyed. Surely we would like to see
more of the newly wealthy Seattleites step up to the challenge of philanthropy
and to endow our next genereation with new civic advantages--in schools,
city beautification, housing, camps, museums, public gardens, transportation
amenities, music, medical care, and job opportunities. But, how do we entice
our new millionaires to play this role unless we honor those who do? <BR>
<BR>
This town, as part of its heritage, also probably has more than its fair
share of talented potential citizen leaders, regardless of financial resources,
good people of a new generation whose imagination, know-how and drive we
would like to enlist for our community's benefit. They will do the volunteer
chores others shirk. But what do we have to entice those individuals--other
than the respect we pay them by taking their efforts seriously? <BR>
<BR>
Is ours going to be the era of Forward Bust? Or are we headed for another
Forward Thrust, with all the good it can bring us? The September ballot
will not finally answer that question. But it can become an important sign
that civic confidence--and the calling forth of public service--is once
again ignited. It can light our way. <BR>
<BR>
If you doubt what such measures can do for a city, drive around. Many of
the best features of contemporary Seattle sprang from the public spirited
efforts of earlier citizens, including the Progressive Era generation at
the turn of the century who built our first comprehensive boulevard and
parks systems, the ship canals and locks, our exemplary water reservoirs
and power dams and the Denny Regrade. Those folks are all gone. <BR>
<BR>
But the Forward Thrust generation, most of them, are still here. From our
clean water to a vibrant cultural life, you also can see their works. The
point is that Seattle did not become the envy of the nation by accident.
Seattle citizens--with remarkable frequency--have made wise choices at the
right time. <BR>
<BR>
Just look around you.

</H2>
<BR>
Good morning, and Happy Leap Year, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee.
I am honored to be asked my opinion about the 2000 Census.<BR>
Leap Year, indeed, is a good time to review the Census Bureau's plans, because
a great statistical leap into the 21st century is what the Bureau is proposing.
The Congress may wish to look very hard before you take this leap, however,
because it is a leap into the unknown.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I am particularly concerned about the plan to use sampling to adjust the
hard count for the 2000 Census. Looked at through a green eye shade, it
may seem prudent. Obviously, it is financially burdensome to obtain the
last 10 percent or so of Census names, so sampling looks like a winning
solution. Undoubtedly that thought must have weighed heavily in the recommendations
of several bodies that are advocating adjustment. But if money is what matters
most, you could save even more by relying on still more sampling. The Census
is, indeed, expensive. But consider what you get with it. It holds up the
whole statistical system of the Unite States. Having said that, I do acknowledge
the legitimacy of the cost issue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The statistical accuracy argument must also be acknowledged. It is embarrassing
to have an undercount after every decennial Census. However, it is an embarrassment
the republic has managed to survive each decade for two centuries. I am
not sure how well we would survive its alternative. The problem with sampling
and adjustment does not lie only with accuracy, which statisticians can
debate, but with its admitted core of artificiality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My argument with adjustment, thus, is not primarily a matter of statistical
methodology. That's not my background, in any case. If anybody could pull
off an adjustment in a conscientious manner it is the U.S. Census Bureau.
My experiences at the Bureau left me with the greatest respect for the honesty,
ability and public spirit of the people who work there, right up to and
including the outstanding current director, Dr. Martha Riche. Moreover,
many of the statistical and management innovations the Bureau has proposed
for the 2000 Census, including new &quot;matching&quot; software to spot
double-counting, the digital &quot;capture&quot; of data on forms, more
user-friendly forms and the added mail contacts with each address, all have
excellent prospects, in my view. The 2000 Census, as with past censuses,
will see improvements, regardless of adjustment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Should an official adjustment take place, however, and you have one national
number, the Census will still not have counted everyone, even in theory.
For example, the present plan will have done nothing to count the literally
hundreds of thousands of Americans who are not employed by the government
and who are temporarily living overseas. (Overseas government employees
now are counted, of course.) The people I'm talking about are U.S. citizens;
some of them own homes and other property here; some are on the voter roles
and motor vehicle license lists. I certainly agree with the proposal to
explore the use of many other administrative records, such as Social Security
and welfare rolls, to seek names of people who may have been missed in the
Census head count. I also understand why the Bureau must count illegal immigrants,
even though they may lack reliable addresses and their stay in this country
may be very temporary, indeed. But shouldn't we also be trying to identify
citizens of the U.S. who happen to be out of the country around the Census
time, but whose names can be found in public records and who count the United
States as home? Isn't their stake in the country important enough to be
reflected in the numbers that are used, for example, to apportion Congress?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer given by the Census Bureau, with OMB no doubt looking over its
shoulder, is that such a search would be costly. Well, if so, why isn't
it proposed to sample and adjust for the overseas Americans, too? But, meanwhile,
the controversy of this very subject returns us again to the central problem
in the 2000 Census plan, and that is the moral or philosophical concept
of an official, adjusted enumeration. Sampling is a proven and accepted
form of measurement, but there usually has to be some hard, broadly accepted
data base from which the sample is drawn. More importantly, I can't think
of a statistical sample that is so closely tied to a civic act as is the
Census enumeration, any more than I can think of an election survey that
has the moral authority of an actual election.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census enumeration is a participatory function of government hallowed
by Constitutional mandate. There are not too many comparable civic acts;
voting is one, serving on juries is another. Perhaps participation in the
Census falls between those two--it is neither as voluntary as voting, nor
as demanding as jury service. In any case, the Census is one of the fundamental
democratic institutions of our society, and I believe, it is a noble one.
It gives us the numbers that make other numbers meaningful. It must not
only be trustworthy, but palpably trustworthy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The current Census director herself has spoken of the three legs of the
Census stool that must dictate the process: cost, accuracy and public perception.
The first two legs are important, as I have acknowledged, but if the latter
breaks, the whole construction comes down. The term &quot;public perception&quot;
could also be described as trustworthiness. In a time when public mistrust
of government is rife, I question a change that would introduce the invention
of statistical persons into the Census--robots constructed of sampled data
and intellectual abstractions--to stand in the place of real human beings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Census has long represented an honest attempt to count every person
in the United States--every real person, not every &quot;virtual&quot; person,
not every &quot;statistical analog&quot; for a person, not every &quot;full
time equivalent&quot; of a person, but every real person. Once citizens
realize that the Census number is partly an invention--however brilliant
an invention it is--they will begin to question many things. Suspicions
will be aroused. How, some will ask, do we know that the creation of statistical
persons does not have some partisan or factional or geographic regional
basis? How does this corrupted Census count infect other numbers and political
institutions?<BR>
Let me stress again my own full confidence in the integrity of the individuals
who serve at the U.S. Census Bureau. It is largely because I don't want
to see that integrity even put up to question that I raise this problem
of perception--of evident trustworthiness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's next consider legal problems with the Census; do you think you have
them now? In fact, the costly lawsuits challenging the Census invariably
are won by the government. Common sense tells a judge that a good faith
effort to count every person cannot be faulted for occasional human mistakes,
especially when plaintiffs can seldom if ever produce evidence of actual
individuals who have not been counted. But under an adjusted Census it will
not be difficult at all to produce evidence that the Census erred, and erred
intentionally, by imputing fictitious people into neighborhoods where the
real neighbors can readily prove that the interlopers do not, in plain truth,
exist. In some cases, the fictional, imputed people are going to amount
to a difference between drawing a redistricting line one place rather than
another, and maybe even change the apportionment of states. (After all,
isn't that part of the whole idea?) In such cases, I suggest, common sense
will now become the government's enemy, because you will need to give all
the judges and ordinary citizens an extensive course in statistics to persuade
them that it is just and fair to invent people for something as supposedly
straightforward as a U.S. Census. How especially do we explain including
invented people in determining such matters as apportioning Congress when,
as I noted before, we do not count real American citizens living abroad?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Maybe the American public will accept all this with total unconcern or even
satisfaction. But maybe, instead, this will be seen as one more way the
government is trying to pull a fast one on the people. Won't any resulting
public cynicism make the hard count even more difficult to obtain in the
first place? If it contributes to further falloff of response, won't that
and the ever-present financial incentives, lead to still more sampling in
subsequent Censuses, in a downward spiral? And won't it seem perfectly acceptable
soon to conduct the whole Census through sampling? And won't there be an
irrestible temptation to try, Census by Census, to improve the content of
what constitutes the invented persons created through the sample, and hence
the meaning of such invented persons?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To conclude, Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, I am here to urge
you to look at the Census as one of the most venerable civic institutions
of the United States, and to do all you can to protect it. Once trust in
it is undermined, it will be very hard, if not impossible, to restore. <BR>

<P>	 Let's not hear any more about &quot;character', okay? This country
is moving to a values neutral, non-judgmental consciousness in which such
outdated concepts are irrelevant. &quot;Character&quot; is just another
device by which the power elite seek to instill guilt in the masses and
bring everyone under the control of old fogies and their retrograde values
system.<BR>
	Character is not an issue. Character is not an issue. Character is not
an issue. Got it?<BR>
	What's with these politicians, anyway, trying to inject a concept like
character into a straightforward contest for votes? It's very negative.
Next, they'll be quoting a bunch of dead Greeks, like Heraclitus (&quot;Character
is destiny.&quot;) or Plutarch (&quot;Character is simply habit long continued.&quot;)
We're getting tired of it, burned out. It really brings people down. Talking
about character has become a character flaw itself, when you think about
it. Especially when candidates come right out and say that's what they're
doing. Give us a candidate who has good vibes and sympathetic body language.
If he's going to attack his opponent's character, he can do it on the sly
or get a surrogate.<BR>
	Besides, character doesn't matter.<BR>
	All right, maybe it matters a little bit. But, it has to take its place
at the end of a long line of considerations used to evaluate a candidate.
First, you need someone who is smart. And a riveting speaker. Good looks
help--a lot. No Abe Lincolns need apply. And then you want someone who says
things you agree with.<BR>
	Character? A poor runner up in any relationship. Maybe you are deciding
on a home remodeling contractor, or a banker, or a teacher (if you get a
choice), or a doctor (if you get a choice much longer), or a lawyer. Do
you want a good talker or character? Right: if it doesn't feel good, don't
do it! It's not how you play the game, but whether or not you win that counts.
If someone does something wrong, better to get past it, unless of course
we can sue.<BR>
	Character! Whose character, we want to know? The graybeards that prattle
about &quot;consequences,&quot; &quot;reliability,&quot; &quot;honor,&quot;
&quot;keeping your word&quot;? Talk about quaint; the other day one of them
used the word &quot;duty&quot;! Next, it will be &quot;honesty is the best
policy!&quot; Well, they have their values, we have ours. Haven't they ever
heard about the value of a good story? Or the value of getting away with
it? Their values are yesterday's, the old Eurocentric behavior control that
runs all the way back to Aristotle and the Bible. Well, isn't it time someone
had a kind word for Nicolo Machiavelli?<BR>
	Our hierarchy of character is just different. It is headed by &quot;compassion,&quot;
which is best expressed, for example, by helping  the less fortunate with
other people's money. Next comes &quot;tolerance,&quot; sometimes recognized
as indifference with a wan smile.<BR>
	The old guard are bogged down in particulars--this poor person, that family,
the town over there--while we expand our &quot;concern&quot; to include
whole groups and abstract categories of people; indeed, &quot;The People&quot;
as a whole. So who has the larger view? Their boring politicians talk about
this bill and that amendment; our sprightly leaders talk about  the symbolic
legislation that shows how they feel. The old guard say they care about
results. Well, we are more idealistic; we care about intentions.<BR>
	That's why, as I think I said, character is not an issue.<BR>
	&quot;Right? Wrong?&quot; Very good words, useful words; we use them all
the time, in fact. But let's be serious. Right and wrong depend on the situation--and
who they are used against. What's right and wrong also depends on public
opinion, or, more particularly, on the polls. And, lately, on focus groups
and on approval meters that people can hold in their lap to record their
instantaneous reactions to a speaker's every word. <BR>
	&quot;Leadership?&quot; That's very important, too. It involves finding
out what the folks in the focus group or studio audience believe (or say
they believe) and then advocating it.<BR>
	The old timers prefer principles to values, because they are more permanent,
and they think that human nature really doesn't change over time. We moderns
hope human nature does change because we are trying constantly to change
it. And we ignore principles and prefer values, because values can be anything
you want. They are merely an appendage of a constantly evolving  social
order, a reflection of the power structure at any given moment. As time
goes by, it is smart to abandon some values as they become  inconvenient.
Other values we just give others new meanings; for example, &quot;creative.&quot;
And other values we invent; for example, &quot;energetic.&quot;<BR>
	So character is not an issue.<BR>
	One candidate is a human weathervane? So? His opponent has changed his
mind on several occasions; who is he to talk?<BR>
	One candidate routinely breaks his word? So? His opponent failed to achieve
his whole agenda.<BR>
	They're all the same. It's all relative. Character is not an issue. Really,
it's not.<BR>
	Feel better now? Good. Feelings are what it's all about.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Garry B. Trudeau, creator of the comic-strip Doonesbury, is
one of your star Boomer celebrities, a self-appointed guru of perpetual
'60s cool. It was Trudeau who invented the jaunty Mr. Butts character that
mocks the tobacco companies and the politicians who take their contributions.
Today Mr. Butts figures haunt only Republican rallies, despite the annoying
fact from the National Library on Money and Politics that more than half
of the tobacco support of congressional candidates from 1980 to 1994 went
to Democrats.<BR>
<BR>
Real history, in contrast to cartoon history, has that way of interfering
with a good story. In Mr. Trudeau's case, this crusader against the legal
vice of tobacco recently felt obliged to write an essay in Time magazine
regarding his own past use of illegal narcotics. Were RJR Nabisco sleuths
about to expose him? Regardless, his confession is not the mea culpa of
a Newt Gingrich or even the denial of a Bill &quot;I didn't inhale&quot;
Clinton. Instead, Trudeau manages to say only briefly that he no longer
advocates drugs, while telling us at length how much he once enjoyed them
and even sold them. He implies that he only quit once he became a parent,
not so many years ago. &quot;To summarize,&quot; he writes, &quot;at one
time I possessed, consumed and probably distributed marijuana--activities
for which I may feel embarrassment but not guilt.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
These &quot;memories of TOKING UP are fondly held,&quot; he coos in capitals.
&quot;Finally, I admit that this has not caused me to lose a moment of sleep,
except as it has pertained to my career.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
How&Igrave;s that as a didactic tale for the kids? Tobacco's bad for you,
but dope's a bit of a kick. Cartoonist, draw thyself!<BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration also did not take drugs very seriously for over
three years; indeed, until a political attack appeared on the horizon. Then
the Administration, too, came up with the preposterous attempt to switch
the subject to cigarettes.<BR>
<BR>
In the first three years of the Clinton presidency, Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders proposed looking into legalizing drugs and the Justice Department
recommended reducing mandatory sentences for drug crimes. The President
slashed the staff of his drug office by 80 percent and reduced interdiction
of drugs at the border and eradication efforts overseas. Coast Guard seizures
of cocaine fell 45 percent and marijuana, 90 percent. Supply reduction was
deemed a waste of time and money. <BR>
<BR>
When a report was produced for the Pentagon by the Institute for Defense
Analysis (IDA) suggesting the contrary--that interdiction is a &quot;cost
effective operational strategy for increasing cocaine prices and thereby
reducing cocaine use in the United States&quot;--the Administration held
up dissemination. Only insistence by the Republican dominated House Government
Reform and Oversight Committee brought the report to public awareness last
week. The full contents still have not been released.<BR>
<BR>
It apparently was the Administration's expectation that increased funds
for drug treatment would bring about demand reduction. Indeed, <I>The Man
From Hope</I>  told a group of Miami middle-schoolers last spring that drug
use had gone down &quot;every year for the last three years.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But the hard facts showed the hope was false. The National Household Survey
on Drug Abuse for 1995 revealed that drug use among teens rocketed upward
105% since 1992. Cocaine use among teens soared 166%. Compared to the past,
the drugs themselves have become cheap, &quot;pure&quot; and dangerous.
This would tend to validate the IDA study. Greater drug supply produces
lower prices and wider availability. Lessened drug education, meanwhile,
lowers the threshold for initial usage. Drug treatment for addicts, a Clinton
priority, is a valuable and humane service, but not much of an answer to
expanded drug supply and usage.<BR>
<BR>
The Administration tried to wriggle off the bad publicity--and escape the
merciless Dole ad showing candidate Clinton in 1992 laughing on MTV that
he wished he had inhaled--by pinning the problem on the Bush years. The
numbers in that period, however, don&Igrave;t show anything more than anti-drug
efforts and drug usage reaching a plateau. So another spin was tried, that
Republicans in Congress are responsible because they have not supported
all the treatment funds the president sought. But again, even if true, that
argument begs the question.<BR>
<BR>
That question is, what works? The best answer, so far, is an all-fronts
struggle of the kind launched in the Reagan years, when drug use was cut
in half.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of who is elected president, let&Igrave;s increase drug interdiction
and drug eradication, overseas as well as at home. From my own service as
U.S. representative to the U.N. narcotics agencies in Vienna in the '80s,
I would argue that we should solicit more international cooperation and
financial support for these tasks. Let&Igrave;s also expand assistance for
crop substitution in countries like Colombia, and thereby promote the domestic
stability that gives politicians the courage to stand up to narco-traffickers.<BR>
<BR>
Let&Igrave;s revise the once useful, but now stale, &quot;Just Say No&quot;
educational campaign among youth. Yes, we also should continue to improve
drug treatment for addicts and we should decriminalize medicinal use. And
let&Igrave;s do more to rebut Hollywood and media figures who glamorize
drugs, or, like Trudeau, laugh them off.<BR>
<BR>
As for politicians (or cartoonists), nobody cares what they did as youths.
What matters is whether they set an example as adults who have taken the
drug issue seriously.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Ted Van Dyk is a former Washington State resident</B> and
a Democrat of national pedigree, who once served as an aide to Vice President
Hubert Humphrey, later ran a Democratic policy center and advised Sen. Paul
Tsongas in his 1992  presidential bid. These days he gazes balefully over
developments in the Whitewater scandal as described in the newspapers that
arrive daily in his Washington, D.C. office; and he asks rhetorically, what
is the likely outcome of this seemingly endless mess? <BR>
<BR>
Consider this scenario, he suggests: Bill Clinton, like Richard Nixon in
1972, wins big in November, and next February independent counsel Kenneth
Starr announces an indictment. The country and the Congress are thrown into
an uproar. It's Watergate all over again and the people demand to know why
the facts had not been presented to them when they could have exercised
their own judgment at the polls. <BR>
<BR>
Now picture a second scenario: Clinton wins, but narrowly. Then the independent
counsel announces that he has found, in the familiar term of art, &quot;insufficient
grounds to prosecute.&quot; The White House and Democrats are outraged that
they have had to put up with the character issue hanging over their heads,
when an earlier resolution could have spared the President and maybe Democrats
in Congress a lot of anxiety, and maybe given them a larger mandate. <BR>
<BR>
In scenario three, the current steady erosion of news stories--Mrs. Clinton
cited for failure to report her role in the Castle Grande real estate deal,
talk of pardoning the McDougals, and what have you--take their silent toll.
Dole wins narrowly. Then, the independent counsel reports around inaugural
time that he is indicting the soon-to-be-retired Clintons. More distress,
including Republican indignation that this information was not available
at a time when it could have led to a more substantial GOP victory. <BR>
<BR>
Or, four, a narrow Dole victory is followed by a decision by the independent
counsel not to indict. Outgoing President Clinton is relieved, but angry.
This decision earlier could have saved the election for him and helped the
Democrats in Congress. The process has triumphed over justice once again.
(Van Dyk thinks the chances of indictment overall are 50-50.) <BR>
<BR>
In short, the Whitewater scandal and the investigation attending it have
dragged on so long now that it is hard to conceive of an outcome that truly
serves the nation&iacute;s interest. In 1992 the scandal was new, poorly
reported and had no effect on the election. Later, as Travelgate and other
mini-scandals developed, it was assumed that appointment of an independent
counsel (two, as it turned out) would get to the bottom of the matter and
clear it up, one way or another. Yet here we are, going through yet another
election where Whitewater and related matters whistle around the campaign
like a nasty ditty voters hate but can't get out of their heads. <BR>
<BR>
The assumption has been that because people are fatigued with Whitewater
and related matters, they also are unaware and unaffected. In fact, voters
know that questions of tax evasion, obstruction of justice and perjury are
serious, but they don't know how to assess them. In surveys, the results
are strange, and Charles E. Cook in the Capitol Hill newspaper, <I>Roll
Call,</I> is not alone in saying that he has never seen such volatility.
Consider this exotic syllogism: a) a majority of people believe &quot;character&quot;
is important in a president; b) a majority thinks Dole is far superior to
Clinton on this count, and c) a majority plans to vote for Clinton. <BR>
<BR>
If that kind of survey is accurate, does it suggest, as some say, that the
American people have lost their moral bearings? Not necessarily. It may
suggest that people have other things on their minds, and, in any case,
prefer to give the Clintons the benefit of the doubt until hard evidence
of wrongdoing is presented. Who can blame them? Theirs actually seems like
a very sensible attitude. <BR>
<BR>
For one thing, who can remember all the chapters in the Whitewater saga
as it courses through Arkansas and Washington, D.C., let alone the details?
Few Democratic leaders in Congress or elsewhere are visibly defending the
Clintons on Whitewater, yet the Dole campaign is staying away from the subject,
too. Maybe no one can follow it all. <BR>
<BR>
Of course, there are many other, on-the-record reasons for a vote against
Clinton and for Dole (and vice versa), but they are the old, standard liberal
versus conservative arguments that have divided the parties for sixty odd
years. You don't have to have Whitewater splashed in your face. Not on the
evidence so far. <BR>
<BR>
Van Dyk, who over the past few years became a public critic of Bill Clinton's
character (&quot;I believe he is badly flawed.&quot;), is now frustrated
with the failure of the independent counsel to come to a conclusion in a
timely fashion that would allow a political resolution rather than risk
a constitutional crisis. A partisan Democrat, he is foremost concerned for
the country. <BR>
<BR>
Prosecutors, he notes, always think of building as strong a case as possible
before he takes action. Let justice takes its course. But there comes a
point where more is at stake than a trial--like the future of the nation.
Thus, Van Dyk now concludes that if Ken Starr is going to bring charges,
he has an obligation to do it before election day. Otherwise, he should
drop it.<BR>
<BR>
Think about the grave implications of either course. Someone should.

<BLOCKQUOTE><B>Scott Klug, clean cut and earnest, used to be a reporter
for KING-TV in Seattle. </B>He liked to investigate politicians. You would
not have suspected that he would wind up in Congress himself one day, but
that is what happened. Having returned home to Madison ,Wisconsin, Klug
got elected as a Republican to the House of Representatives. Now in Washington,
D.C.--still clean cut and earnest--he focuses a lot on cutting costs and
privatizing government programs. And he is making some progress. <BR>
<BR>
The Republican House majority, including Klug and his Washington State colleagues,
deserves credit for reducing spending growth and making a balanced budget
by 2002 a realistic goal. It wouldn't have been possible without the Republicans'
sometimes stormy insistence, and if they lose power this fall, that goal
surely will erode. But they got in political trouble when their cuts hit
some highly visible services with broad constituencies. Everybody wants
Congress to combat &quot;waste, fraud and abuse,&quot; but one voter's idea
of waste is another's idea of a vital service. <BR>
<BR>
Similarly, almost everybody would like a tax cut, as Republicans propose.
It is, or ought to be, common knowledge that when federal, state and local
taxes are combined, the American family is more heavily taxed than ever
before. But, how do you pay for a broad cut? There will be a supply side
boost to revenues when marginal tax rates are cut, but it will cover only
about a quarter of the tab. <BR>
<BR>
We clearly need greater efficiencies in government. Klug believes that government
monopolies, lacking the discipline of the free market, raise costs directly
and--by not paying taxes--indirectly, too. Privatization, while not a panacea,
can lower government costs and still improve services. <BR>
<BR>
Privatization was a subject of fashionable discussion in the 1980s, but
few actual conversions were undertaken. Selling off Conrail, the government-subsidized
freight railroad that had been picked up when Penn Central, New York Central
and several other lines failed, was one of the stellar successes. That privatization
was led by Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Transportation, Elizabeth Dole,
and turned a multi-billion dollar public revenue eater into a multi-billion
dollar tax contributor. (The Dole campaign should make more of this story.)
Klug is now among those promoting the current proposal to privatize Amtrak
passenger service. <BR>
<BR>
Klug's efforts led Speaker Gringrich last year to appoint him head of a
House privatization task force that includes, among others, Rep. Jennifer
Dunn of Bellevue, Washington. An initial effort was the abolition, privatization
or partial privatization of some nine programs within the House of Representatives
itself--from beauty and barber shops to food services and recording studios.
As Gingrich recently noted on Meet the Press, the old House still had ice
delivered twice daily to each Member&iacute;s office--80 years after invention
of the refrigerator. Most of these in-House reforms are now completed, with
expected ultimate savings to taxpayers of $44 million, a good example for
the rest of government. <BR>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration has made a few modest moves toward privatization,
of course, such as agreeing with Congress to sell the Naval Petroleum Reserves
(at an anticipated price of $1.6 billion). But Klug is skeptical of any
serious or long term Clinton commitment. Dole is much more interested. Whoever
is president, however, Klug has a long list of privatization targets. They
involve sale or lease of assets, contracting out of services, functional
conversion to the private sector and lifting legal barriers to privatization.
For example: <BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI> Klug and his task force want to contract out the debt collection
activities of the IRS. Citing a General Accounting Office report and a survey
by the American Collectors Association, Klug foresees savings of over $10
billion. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>$80 million could be saved by privatizing many activities of the Government
Printing Office. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Money to build badly needed new prisons could be found by turning
some operations over to private companies, which experience shows can construct
and manage prisons for 20 % less than the government. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Contracting out government commercial-style services could save &quot;as
much as $9 billion a year.&quot; Klug cites as examples the Department of
Defense and the Veteran&iacute;s Administration, which compete with the
private sector in grocery distribution. 
</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<UL>
  <LI>Privatizing management of federal loan programs could save $2 billion
annually. 
</UL>
<BR>
Some of the GOP proposals Klug is introducing will require more study and
debate. For instance, he wants to move, though slowly, to sell off the electric
power projects built in the '30s and 40s. This would have been politically
unimaginable several decades ago, but, as shown in a report this month by
a bi-partisan task force of governors from the four Northwest states, even
the huge and venerable Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is coming under
increased consideration for privatization, at least for its power transmission
system. The power industry is moving into greater competition these days
and a co-existent government monopoly makes less and less sense. Klug wisely
suggests privatization &igrave;from least to most complex&icirc;power marketing
administrations, starting with Southeastern Power Administration, and reviewing
Western Area Power Administration and BPA last. <BR>
<BR>
Perhaps it is remarkable that anyone is even able to talk about such matters
these days. Barry Goldwater's proposal in 1964 to sell the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) helped defeat him. But few attack Klug in 1996 for wanting
to bring at least the non-power programs of TVA into the private, tax-paying
sector, at a savings of $140 million a year, and he bravely asks why regulated
private ownership of TVA power would not also make sense for citizen rate-payers
in today&iacute;s environment--as well as earning $28 billion for the federal
treasury. <BR>
<BR>
There, indeed, are few sacred cows in the Wisconsin representative's budget
pasture. He even dares to mention the Postal Service. Barry Goldwater himself
didn't raise such an issue. If he had, it would have been thought a joke.
But that was before private overnight mail delivery, faxes and e-mail. Now
Klug's suggestion that the Post Office evolve into an employee-owned corporation
doesn't strike most people as either ridiculous or extreme. More and more,
it sounds like common sense.<BR>

A Common Sense Test on Contemporary Politics</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman</CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="/rob_c/Rob%27s%20files/DISCOVERY/starbar.gif" WIDTH=
"468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>Here is a test of Common Sense Opinions on Current Politics. Write true
or false next to each item and, at the end, see how you scored.<BR>
<BR>
1. A presidential candidate, such as Ross Perot, who continually fails to
reach beyond 4 to 8 percent in the opinion polls and never would have been
in the race in the first place if he hadn&iacute;t been rich, is not owed
a position in the televised presidential debates. And he shouldn&iacute;t
get one.<BR>
<BR>
2. If Perot is invited to the debates, anyway, so should Harry Browne of
the Libertarian Party and Ralph Nader of the Green Party. At least the show
would be more entertaining.<BR>
<BR>
3. Broad tax relief that allows people to spend more of their money according
to their own priorities is better than &igrave;targeted&icirc; tax breaks
that assume the government knows best how people should spend their money.
Thus, Dole is right in his approach and Clinton is wrong.<BR>
<BR>
4. Regardless, Dole, if elected, is more likely to follow through on his
tax cuts than Clinton is with his. <BR>
<BR>
5. In domestic affairs, the number one issue facing America is entitlement
spending. Both parties know that the rate of growth in Medicare must be
reduced if the integrity of the system is to be preserved, and that little
or no damage will be done to seniors if modest steps are taken now. The
actual legislation that the Republicans tried to pass was responsible and
fair, despite the demagogic spin put on it by the current crop of Democratic
and AFL-CIO ads.<BR>
<BR>
6. Social Security takes roughly 12 and a half percent of people&iacute;s
payroll income. For the next few years, while the government takes in more
from Social Security taxes than it pays out, it is possible to a) assure
present recipients of exactly the Social Security payments they expect and
b) allow young people to turn their future payments into a mutual fund savings
instrument tied to the private economy and thereby save significantly more
for their future. The proposal has wide support in think tanks and among
economists.That this idea is not even being discussed so far by either Mr.Clinton
or Mr. Dole is testimony to the threat of demagogy on this subject. <BR>
<BR>
7. Mr. Clinton has a new spending proposal each campaign day. For example,
he wants to fund more Americorps community volunteers, even though taxpayers
pay $27,000 per &igrave;volunteer,&icirc; about twice what comparable volunteers
cost private charities. If he is re-elected, Mr. Clinton&iacute;s statement
that &igrave;The era of big government is over&icirc; will become one of
the most ironic political pronouncements of all time, along with Herbert
Hoover&iacute;s &igrave;Prosperity is just around the corner.&icirc; <BR>
<BR>
8. Under the new federal so-called &igrave;reform&icirc; laws a lobbyist
may not pay for a dinner for a senator anywhere within 35 miles of the Capitol.
But he can take the senator on an &igrave;inspection trip&icirc; to Paris
and have his corporation or oganization pay for the whole thing. The rule
should be the opposite. No politician is going to be bought for the price
of a dinner, while a glamorous, all-expenses paid trip may raise &szlig;real
questions. Congress--and the professional &igrave;reformers&icirc; that
live off controversy--should get real.<BR>
<BR>
9. Under the same new &igrave;reform&icirc; laws, members of Congress who
may not receive a free meal from a lobbyist, constituents or almost anyone
else, are quite free, however, to provide free meals for the lobbyist, constituents,
or whomever. Later, the Congressmen also are free to ask the lobbyists for
campaign contributions, and from those campaign contriibutions--pooled in
their campaign funds-- pay off all their meal chits. This is considered
part of the expense of doing business, and since it can&iacute;t be charged
to the taxpayers, it can be charged to campaign funds. This shows again
a) that petty reform laws can almost always be circumvented, and b) that
there&iacute;s no such thing as a free lunch.<BR>
<BR>
10. It is wrong for the media to refer to Sherry Rowlands, the prostitute
hired by Presidential &igrave;family values&icirc; adviser Dick Morris,
as a &igrave;call girl.&icirc; The proper term should be &igrave;call person.&icirc;<BR>
<BR>
Results: The correct answer for each question is &igrave;True,&icirc; except
for the last, number 10, which is definitely false (Tsk, tsk. Common sense
must hold to standard English, even in vernacular speech--just as in standard
morality.) Give yourself 10 points for each correct answer. If you scored
under 50, you seriously need to re-examine your prejudices, although the
same is true for many of your fellow citizens and most of the media. A score
of 60 to 90 shows that you have a common sense understanding of the American
political scene. Congratulations! A perfect score puts you in perfect harmony
with the author and cannot be admired too highly. <BR>

To Succeed, Seattle Should Share the Olympics </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<BR>
The Seattle Bid Committe that is spearheading the drive to bring the Olympics
to Seattle and the Northwest in 2008 has entered a new, post-Atlanta phase.
First, the organizational effort is about to be intensified. Entrepreneur
Clark Kokich will operate as chairman of the committee, and internationally
known events impressario Bob Walsh will lead planning, as before. But to
provide day-to-day continuity, Dave Syferd, a noted public relations and
marketing executive, is expected to be named soon as president. The Seattle
Sports and Events Council is loaning staff to the project.<BR>
<BR>
The second post-Atlanta development is a growing recognition among supporters
that the early inspiration to seek the games on as broad a regional basis
as possible was wise and should be re-enforced. Indeed, the regional approach
would seem to have been vindicated both by the over-crowding in Atlanta
and the results of a recent Western Washington poll on the Olympics.<BR>
<BR>
Public backing in the poll actually grows when the idea is broached to make
the games a regional affair centered in Seattle, but with events staged
throughout &quot;<A HREF="cascadia.html">Cascadia</A>.&quot; This would
seem to reflect wholly legitimate concerns about traffic congestion and
about cost. If the Olympics are held on a regional basis, both traffic and
overhead expenses can be spread from Victoria and Vancouver to Portland,
though primary emphasis will remain on the Central Puget Sound area and
the official host city, Seattle. <BR>
<BR>
In Atlanta, though a few events were staged outside the metropolitan area,
regionalism was an afterthought. Central Atlanta was closed down and the
focus of non-event activity was on the new, 21 acre Centennial Park--less
than a third the size of Seattle Center. Yet, it was also Atlanta's ambition
to host the largest spectator audience ever for the Olympics. Nine million
tickets were printed. <BR>
<BR>
The solution for Seattle is 1) regionalize to the full extent feasible,
and 2) prune the spectator ticket sales back to the four million figure
typical of earlier Olympic Games, or at least to the five million number
Sydney will print for 2000. There is good reason to think that the International
Olympics Committee (IOC) will like this approach. It was Atlanta&iacute;s
idea, not the IOC&iacute;s, that bigger necessarily was better.<BR>
<BR>
It is probable that the IOC, with Atlanta&iacute;s experience to remind
it, also will approve of Seattle&iacute;s plan to share many Olympic events
with its neighbors. The IOC requires a single city to take the lead, or
else the organizing commitee already would be moving forward with a multi-city
or regional bid. Oregonians and British Columbians already serve on the
bid committee and Seattle area participants all want bi-national regional
cooperation to develop as one of the identifiable achievements of the games.
Victoria hosted the Commonwealth Games recently and Vancouver has splendid
new facilities, as does Portland. It would be a mistake not to share many
of the Olympics&iacute; 271 events with these neighbors. <BR>
<BR>
Closer to home, Tacoma and Everett are logical hubs for various events.
A new equestrian facility already contemplated for Ellensburg will help
pull events over the mountains into Eastern Washington. And what about the
state capital, Olympia? How could we pass up holding some of the classic
&quot;Olympic&quot; competitions in the city with the same name as Olympia,
Greece, the games' birthplace almost 2800 years ago?<BR>
<BR>
In further response to the traffic issue, Seattle itself would not anticipate
closing off the downtown or concentrating recreation and cultural events
in one small area. We already have a large and lively urban core with far
more attractions to disperse crowds than Atlanta had. Also, the Seattle
sponsors would integrate local government and citizen planning on both security
and transportation early on, as Atlantans, unfortunately, failed to do.<BR>
<BR>
But what about local costs, even with sharing? Didn't Atlanta's businesses,
individuals and government wind up paying nearly $2 billion for the games?
Yes, but they brought in over $4 billion. The metropolitan area was beautified,
its infrastructure--from road surfaces to new recreation, housing and park
facilities--was immensely improved. Thousands of young people gained news
skills and work experience, representing an untold increase in &quot;human
capital.&quot; Community groups pulled together and made regional alliances.<BR>
<BR>
Hosting the games, as Atlanta found out, is no panacea for poor planning
or other urban ills, but the games--the world's biggest event, and a positive
one--do represent a useful forward strategy. In Barcelona, host to the 1992
Olympics, the games (according to the mayor, quoted in the Wall Street Journal)
&quot;were fantastic, but it was only a 15 day dream.&icirc; Thanks to his
city&iacute;s revitalization, &igrave;The best moment in Barcelona is now.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there remains perhaps the biggest question: Could Seattle win
the games in the first place? Consider, for example, the image problem.
A Seattleite who was in Atlanta found himself marooned at a restaurant during
one of the frequent downpours that were common this past sticky summer --and
every summer. Sitting there, he mentioned to a local citizen Seattle's interest
in hosting the games in 2008.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Seattle?&quot; replied the Atlantan incredulously. &quot;But it rains
all the time in Seattle!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
News flash to the IOC: Late July and early August in Seattle are golden.<BR>
<BR>
My colleagues in Discovery Institute's Cascadia project are conducting a
feasibility study to examine a range of other real and imaginary obstacles
to Seattle's hosting the Olympics. If the whole region, working together,
cannot master those difficulties, then, by all means, the Olympic games
effort should be abandoned.<BR>
<BR>
But what a mistake it would be not to find out!<BR>

They're Attacking Dale Foreman to Defeat His Ideas</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P>	State House Majority Leader Dale Foreman is a logical candidate for
governor.  He's smart, personable, and experienced. At 48, he's still a
fresh voice in politics, having been elected first only four years ago.
He's the easily-met, thoroughly decent kind of person you'd like to have
as a neighbor.  An attorney, orchardist and author, the well-rounded Wenatchee
representative has the political advantages of an earnest speaking style
and a natural bloc of support in Eastern Washington, which has long wanted
a home-based governor. He  has many friends, as well, in Puget Sound country,
where he grew up. Former King Country Prosecutor Chris Bayley chairs his
campaign.<BR>
<BR>
	 Like Jack Kemp, Foreman is a serious social as well as a fiscal conservative.
His several legal books include one describing the trial of Jesus. He also
has Kemp's redeeming grace for seeking an inclusive, welcoming Republican
party.<BR>
<BR>
	Most of all, the scholarly Foreman, better than anyone running, understands
the state budget. And he knows he wants to cut that budget.  He specifically
and courageously announced his intention to trim 10,000 jobs, and in the
campaign he has been laying out a plan for doing so. He believes efficiencies
also can be achieved through improved technology, where the state lags behind
the private sector. It is not a radical program, but a prudent, business-like
one that he realistically acknowledges will take several years to complete.<BR>
<BR>
	In fact, Foreman's &quot;Comprehensive Change and Reform Plan&quot; reads
as if he had pulled together the best ideas that such reform governors as
Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin, John Engler in Michigan and Christine Todd
Whitman in New Jersey have enacted in their states. <BR>
<BR>
	Selective pruning, notes Foreman, the orchardist, is especially overdue
in Washington State.  He points out that state government employment has
gone up more than 50 percent in the past dozen years--from approximately
60,000 to 97,000, rising at a rate twice that of population growth.<BR>
<BR>
	Unfortunately, the media has shown little interest in Foreman's proposal.
But that doesn't mean that word of Foreman's program hasn't gotten around.
His pledge to reduce the state payroll is exactly the kind of provocation
that excites active animosity from those who feel their jobs might be jeopardized.
And, sadly, some in the media, while mainly ignoring Foreman's policy ideas,
are quick to air personal attacks on him.<BR>
<BR>
	The charges began with allegations of infractions of the Public Disclosure
law, including largely technical matters, but also a remarkable claim that
Foreman, as Majority Leader raising funds to promote the GOP agenda in the
Legislature and only considering a run for governor, should have filed papers
then as if he already were a candidate. <BR>
<BR>
	This is new ground, a free speech limiting power grab by the staff of the
Public Disclosure Commission (PDC) that almost surely will lose in the courts
if the commissioners themselves pursues it. Once again the PDC will have
strayed far from its original mandate. But meanwhile, the issue assails
Foreman during the final weeks of the primary campaign--which undoubtedly
is just what the complainant intended.<BR>
<BR>
	Then there was the hot news tip--breathlessly reported--that Foreman had
been &quot;excused&quot; from some lawsuit ten years ago. Nothing illegal
or damaging there, mind you, just an &quot;appearance&quot; of an implication
of a suggestion, you might say. What mattered was not the empty story, but
the reporting of it. Where did the story come from and why didn't the media
tell us what the motivation might be?<BR>
 <BR>
	More recently, there was yet another story: that Foreman used irrigation
&quot;water-spreading&quot; on his farm in a way that had caused a dispute
with the Department of Ecology (DOE). It is one of those penny-ante accounts
that leaves the knowledgeable observer asking, &quot;So, what?&quot; But
it leaves--and is meant to leave--the casual observer musing, &quot;I don't
understand what this is about, but it must be really serious or the media
wouldn't be covering it.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Where's there's smoke, there's fire, people say.<BR>
<BR>
	Except in politics, I would say, where's there's sometimes only a smoke
machine.<BR>
<BR>
	In this case, it definitely was a smoke machine. But it wasn't necessarily
operated from within the DOE. Carol Fleskes, director of shorelands and
water resources at DOE, states that &quot;We're not the ones generating
this story.&quot; DOE and Foreman--who added five acres of land to his orchard
and is using the same amount of water as before to irrigate it--do differ
on whether he now needs a new legal claim or the old one remains suficient
under the law. &quot;Until that claim is verified by the courts it is hard
for us to take any kind of action to clarify the dispute,&quot; says Fleskes.
<BR>
<BR>
	It boils down to a minor jurisdictional issue. But somebody did want to
make a big deal out of the little claim. Why?<BR>
<BR>
	Because Dale Foreman's fiscal program, even with scant media attention,
is close to hitting a popular nerve. His talent and his ideas endanger entrenched
powers as well as some rivals. Therefore, the strategy: If you don't want
to confront a candidate's ideas, attack him personally. Or see that someone
else does.<BR>

Republicans Said What They'd Do, and Did What They Said</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>

<P>	Media coverage tends to emphasize presidential politics,  but the real
center of governmental action these days is on Capitol Hill. The present
Congress already has produced more legislative and attitudinal change than
any  Congress in a quarter of a century.  Moreover, the record shows that
members of the Republican majority did something their critics cannot honestly
deny: they kept their promises. <BR>
	In terms of substance, a comparison of the &quot;Contract with America&quot;
that House Republicans and some senatorial candidates campaigned upon in
1994 and the &quot;Families First Agenda&quot; that House Democratic leaders
are proposing for 1996 is also telling. Where the GOP Contract aimed at
long-term, systemic reforms, the Democratic Agenda is a form of Great Society
Lite.<BR>
	If you recall from early last year, the new Republican majority voted,
as pledged, on all ten Contract items within the new session's first three
months. An immediate priority was a series of reforms of Congressional operations.
 These, for example, cut House administration costs, streamlined services,
privatized commercial operations and reduced the number of central staff
 by 40 percent. &quot;What's impressive is the size of the overhaul that
they've managed so quickly,&quot; said William B. Parent, executive director
of Innovations in American Government, an awards program of the Ford Foundation.
<BR>
	In one form or another, Republicans in both houses managed to pass their
anti-crime bills and many of their national security proposals. They provided
the line item budget veto authority that many presidents, including Clinton,
have long sought and that Democratic majorities long denied. They ended
the practice of creating  federal programs that states and localities would
have to fund later--so-called &quot;unfunded mandates.&quot; <BR>
	The first major reform of telecommunications law in six decades was accomplished,
a boost to US leadership in the high tech field. Republicans combatted discrimination
against older workers by raising the Social Security earnings limit to $30,000.
 They enacted the first of their proposed litigation reforms, affecting
securities, overcoming the trial attorneys lobby and a Clinton veto to do
so.<BR>
	Congressional Republicans also passed a balanced budget, one of their most
important aims, but here they lacked the votes to over-ride a veto.  With
this defeat their  $500 per child tax credit and an end to the marriage
penalty in the income tax also went down. Likewise, while House Republicans
were able to muster a majority on term limits, it was not the two-thirds
majority needed to pass the issue on to the states as a constitutional amendment;
and the bill also failed in the Senate. The GOP got a sufficiently big House
majority (300 to 132) for a balanced budget amendment, but once more failed
to gain sufficient support in the Senate--falling short by one vote. They
pledged to try again next year.<BR>
	Lately,  on the third try, they were able to pass a sweeping welfare plan
that the president finally would agree to sign. Even a Republican Congress
under Ronald Reagan had not enjoyed such a victory. Alongside it came a
tax credit for the costs of adoption, an IRA reform that makes that savings
instrument available for at-home parents, and some tax relief for small
businesses, all of which are long time conservative objectives. They compromised
with Democrats to enact portability of health insurance and squeezed the
new concept of medical savings accounts into the bill, as a pilot project.<BR>
 	Overall, this record is an impressive down-payment on a more economical
federal government and the goal of devolving more power to lower levels
of government, families and individuals.<BR>
	Of course, the Republicans made mistakes. It was foolish to waste time
and moral capital on environmental proposals that would answer over-regulation
by government with new over-regulation of the government.  Speaker Gingrich,
among others, finally recognized that a policy that is clearly pro-environment
as well as pro-economy is the only one that will prevail with either the
public or the Congress. <BR>
	 From a public relations standpoint, at least, it was a mistake to propose
reductions in the current rate of growth of Medicare costs, for it was obvious
that the president was ready  and able to demogogue on this issue.<BR>
	In the budgetary realm as a whole, media and Democratic representations
of Republican economies made them appear more severe than the reality. But
it also is fair to say that the deficit reductions  realized in the past
two years would not have been possible without the billions in savings the
Republican Congress forced upon the Clinton Administration. Even failing
to pass a budget at all for long periods--which hurt GOP poll numbers--helped
lower federal spending and stabilize the economy. For what it's worth, the
GOP also extracted a promise from the president to produce a balanced budget
by 2002. <BR>
	What next awaits the Republicans if they continue as a majority is a full
scale effort to help average Americans to save and invest safely for their
future.That should be the goal of reforming tax and entitlement policies.<BR>
	Meanwhile, what do we hear from Congressional Democrats' &quot;Families
First Agenda?&quot; In addition to health care portability and an increase
in the minimum wage, both of which Congress, in a compromise, already passed,
the &quot;Agenda&quot; offers more federal job training programs...more
federal college tuition aid...health insurance for children...federally
mandated minimum education requirements...an increased day care credit.
Most of these ideas assume that the federal government needs to decide how
people should spend their money.  Moreover, even from a liberal perspective,
they hardly amount to much. Talk about a lack of vision!<BR>
	That is the real difference.  Congressional Republicans have had the more
far-reaching and well-considered program, and, as the current session shows,
the discipline to follow through. Agree or disagree with their policies,
but give them credit for that.<BR>

<H1><CENTER>Ross Perot best characterized as leader of <I><TT>Anti-Reform</TT></I>
Party</CENTER>
</H1>

</H3>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="25" ALIGN="BOTTOM"

<P><BR>
	Former Democratic Gov. Richard Lamm of Colorado, who wants to be the presidential
nominee of the Reform Party, has found out from Ross Perot that just because
someone advocates fair campaign competition in theory doesn't mean that
he supports it in practice. In the hands of Perot, as in many others' these
days, the slogan of &quot;reform&quot; is nothing other than an easily hidden
weapon--the &quot;Saturday night special&quot; of politics. As a weapon,
of course, you use it on other people, never on yourself.<BR>
<BR>
	Last spring Ross Perot was a figure of august humilty, telling Larry King
on TV that he did not want to run again and was looking instead for some
&quot;George Washington the Second&quot; to be the Reform Party candidate.
Perhaps there should be several candidates. But when Lamm, a politician
with an honorable, if maverick, pedigree, suggested that he was interested
in the nomination, Perot dropped the coyness ploy and announced his own
candidacy the next day. Having failed to locate a new George Washington,
it looks like we'll have to settle for a new Napoleon. After all, Napoleon
called himself a reformer, too.<BR>
<BR>
	There would have been nothing wrong if Perot had opened himself to an immediate
series of debates and given Lamm access to the party's voting lists. But
Perot, to date, has declined to debate Lamm. And the party's Perot-picked
coordinator, Russell Verney, has made the weak claim that letting Lamm have
access to the Reform Party lists would constitute an illegal campaign contribution.
It's a fine illustration of the way that political &quot;reform&quot; regulations
are invoked to pervert democracy instead of to improve it. <BR>
<BR>
	Seen in the perspective of his political career, Perot's display of old
fashioned machine politics is simply  the latest expression of his long-standing
double-standard.<BR>
<UL>
  <LI>	 He wants &quot;reform&quot; laws to limit what others can give to
political candidates, but wants to be free to spend his own vast fortune
on his own candidacy. <BR>
<BR>
  <LI>	 He wants laws restricting contributions to political parties, but
so far has laddled $4.4 million of his own money into Reform Party coffers
and has laoned the party another $1.5 million.<BR>
<BR>
  <LI>	 He rails against special interests and lobbyists, but made his own
fortune largely in business deals with the government, which he lobbied
hard.<BR>
 <BR>
  <LI>	 In 1992, he attacked both parties for failing to cut federal spending
and reduce the future federal budget deficit, but when the Republicans offered
actual spending reforms after their 1994 Congressional victory, Perot stayed
out of the fight. It wasn't that he had a better idea; he just couldn't
be bothered to put his influence on the line.
</UL>
<BR>
	The Dallas billionaire first  gave us a glimpse of his true political nature
four years ago when he ran as an independent presidential candidate and
head of United We Stand, America, an organization he created. To hear Citizen
Perot tell it, the United States was tyrannized by the two major parties.
But, in fact, the Republicans and Democrats are governed by federal and
state regulations that, if anything, have become overly restrictive during
the past two decades. In some places, for example, it is even illegal for
a local party to help the national party's ticket.<BR>
<BR>
	Meanwhile, however, United We Stand, America was established under the
tax law as a mere civic organization, rather than a party, and thereby escaped
public disclosure requirements and other legal provisions that regulate
Republicans and Democrats. The whole organization could be--and was--centrally
controlled by one man. Yet from that legal sanctuary Perot sallied forth
to attack--get this--the &quot;corruption&quot; of the two major parties.
<BR>
<BR>
	The United We Stand, America story is instructive. It shows the way non-parties
can operate as parties and get away with it.  Many of the most powerful
groups in society today use the law exactly as Perot did, and some even
set up tax-deductible charitable groups to go along with their campaign-related
activities. That way, funds for campaign research, voter &quot;education&quot;
during campaigns and voter turn-out efforts, can be washed through tax-free
entities. You would think that real reformers would want to look into these
strange creatures. Some of them represent a cost to the federal treasury
and--the real unfairness--they place the over-regulated political parties
at a disadvantage.  Yet, guess what? Mr. Perot and other professional &quot;reformers&quot;--some
of whose organizations also use the law the way he did-- have nothing at
all to say about them.<BR>
<BR>
	The Perot campaign this year did decide to organize as a party and that
party does have to display its rules--or its lack of rules. And, unhappily
for the  party's boss-financier-leading candidate, there has emerged this
naive, but strenuous, competition from Richard Lamm. Apparently, there is
to be another round in the nomination process. Boss Ross will surely win,
but it may not be a pretty sight. In the final election voters may decide
that the Perot ticket should be re-named the &quot;Anti-Reform Party.&quot;<BR>

<H1><CENTER>The Results of Attacks on America's Political Parties Were Predicted

<P>It was way back in the fall of 1961, in Sever Hall, Harvard Yard, and
I was taking notes in a class on urban politics taught by Professor Edward
Banfield. Tall, distinguished looking, yet approachable, he resembled an
academic Gregory Peck. Earlier, at the University of Chicago, the good professor
had been an intimate observer of the first Mayor Richard Daley and the Democratic
machine in Chicago, so his instruction had the authority of experience usually
missing from political science courses.<BR>
<BR>
Banfield said that even though the Daley machine had managed the year before
to deliver Illinois to John F. Kennedy's presidential campaign, it and all
other party machines were doomed. They were dying, he said, because New
Deal legislation and post-World War II prosperity made voters less dependent
upon the charity of the machine; but also because civil service reform had
ended the party's control of jobs, and because the former immigrant groups
whose votes the machine counted upon &quot;were developing a bourgeois view
of ethics.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The machines' practices were, indeed, corrupt and in need of correction.
But with the rise of a political reform movement that Banfield already discerned,
parties as a whole would likely be weakened, he said; and weaker parties
would hurt the public even more than the old fashioned graft had done. The
nature of corruption would change rather than disappear, and in the end,
the cost to democracy would be higher than ever. <BR>
<BR>
Banfield's analysis clashed with my youthful idealism, so I mostly rejected
it at the time. But I had enough sense to tuck my notes away for later reflection.
And, referring to them now, here's what I find.<BR>
<BR>
Political parties, according to Banfield, serve to &quot;harmonize social
expression&quot; that otherwise would be dispersed into &quot;specialist
political groups and interests that have no discipline or collective loyalty.&quot;
But self-righteous reformers tend to ignore or scorn this role.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Reformers are usually upper class people for whom petty stealing is
not a habit,&quot; Banfield dryly noted. But if you define &quot;bribe&quot;
properly, as &quot;any such advantage by which an official is induced to
do other than his duty,&quot; one can see that there are different ways
to offer a bribe from those used by corrupt machines. Perfectly legal offers
of votes--something mass membership interest groups do routinely--could
constitute such a bribe. Also, voters can be bribed as easily as politicians;
a targeted government benefit program will do the job nicely.<BR>
<BR>
Motive is the key to understanding what is fair, yet motive is not always
easy to know, Banfield reminded us. This is a central problem with all ethics
legislation. However, one at least can say that &quot;In the long run, private
bribes are cheaper than public ones,&quot; since subsidies of individuals
and groups by government--the legal kind of bribe--are more expensive than
occasional petty graft. Moreover, &quot;To the extent vulgar inducements
are ended, public ones are likely to increase...It may break us financially
at some point.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Destroying the power of the parties in the name of reform, Banfield declared,
would have several other consequences. Where once parties could pick their
own candidates and fund them directly, there soon would be &quot;an advantage
for incumbents in elections (since they will be better known); an advantage
for the influence of 'names' over issues; more attempts by candidates to
make contradictory appeals to all groups; a temptation for 'personality'
campaigns to turn into smear campaigns; and an inability after an election
to force through unpopular but necessary measures.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In an article he published about the same time, Banfield went on to explain
that the very flaws reformers found in political parties, such as their
basis in local and regional concerns and self-interest, helped make them
more effective and less dangerous than their supposedly purer rivals, the
organized interest groups and self-starting individuals. Purity in politics,
he saw, threatened to become the enemy of good political consequences. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is an inherent antagonism between 'democracy of procedure' and
production and maintenance of a good society, (so) that some defects of
procedure are indispensable conditions of success from the standpoint of
results. Therefore, what the critics call the 'archaic' character of the
American party system is a very small price to pay for government that can
be relied upon to balance satisfactorily the several conflicting ends that
must be served.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When logrolling and patronage were disallowed, for example, a President
would have to turn increasingly to manipulating the electorate with charm
and personality. &quot;TV and the arts of Madison Avenue would become more
important in politics,&quot; Banfield predicted. &quot;...Whereas the political
trader maintains his control by giving and withholding favors to individuals
(a circumstance which makes his control both dependable and in its operation
cheap), the president would have to maintain his by the uncertain and costly
expedient of offering to whole classes of people--the farmer, the aged,
the home owner, and so on--advantages that they would have only at each
others' expense.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
&quot;There is, then,&quot; he continued, &quot;a danger that reform will
chip away the foundations of authority upon which the society rests....(O)ur
very goodness and democracy may lead us to destroy goodness and democracy
in the effort to increase and perfect them.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thirty five years later, all the predictions from Professor Banfield's crystal
ball have become reality: 
<DIR>
  <LI>Parties are weakened by restrictions that don't apply to politically
active issue groups like the National Rifle Association, the Sierra Club
or the AFL-CIO, let alone the media, while individual candidates--also tied
down by strict ethics and reporting laws--fight desperately to find money
to answer lavish TV attacks launched by such groups. 
  <LI>Our public disclosure and ethics laws are obsessed with proceduralism.
  <LI>The advantages enjoyed by incumbents and rich self-starters are greater
than ever. 
  <LI>Appeal on television, rather than capacity for governance, dictates
candidate selection. 
  <LI>Politicians regularly bid for voters with expensive baubles from the
public treasury--whether special interest tax breaks or free college aid.
  <LI>Public budgets are several times what they were in 1961. 
  <LI>The inability of elected officials, once in office, to enact tough,
but necessary, legislation (think of Medicare) is so commonplace that it
almost goes unremarked. 
</DIR>
For such reasons, my support goes to the real reformers in Congress who
are trying this year to strengthen the parties, and definitely not to the
privileged interests and their supporters who want to weaken political parties
still further.

US can't afford to continue graduating economic illiterates</CENTER>

<P>	Steve Murphy loved his Miami-based work as an economic development consultant
specializing in Latin America, but he found he could not explain it to young
people. Many of the ones he met said they wanted to start their own businesses,
but &quot;when I ask where they plan to get their startup capital, they
just shrug their shoulders. Motivation and knowledge are not connected at
that age.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	So Murphy, a former Seattleite and steeped in the ethic of service, tried
something unusual; he created a high school course that appeals directly
to the student's self-interest in making lots of money. &quot;They're all
interested in that,&quot; he reports. And he volunteered to teach the course,
 calaled &quot;Material Wealth and the Stock Market,&quot; at inner city
Miami's Jackson High School. The course became so popular and successful
that it got coverage in The Wall Street Journal, as well as The Miami Herald.
<BR>
<BR>
	Murphy's lesson plan reaches from &quot;the wisdom of Solomon&quot; in
the Bible to the  guile of Dan Akyrod and Eddie Murphy in the film &quot;Trading
Places.&quot;  But central to its appeal is the practical experience Steve
Murphy gives the students in investing in the stock market. He starts with
play money, but at the end of the class, the students that performed best
win cash prizes in the form of stock, donated by a brokerage house.<BR>
<BR>
	Murphy now is expanding his consulting business into his old home town
of Seattle, and also is looking for a way also to volunteer a practical
economics course here like the one he started in Miami (attention, school
superintendent John Stanford).<BR>
<BR>
	When he returns he will find another model of educating kids in economics
is being tried here for the second year by the National Foundation for Teaching
Entrepreneurship (NFTE, pronounced &quot;Nifty&quot;). With support from
Microsoft, among others, NFTE will run  a two week crash course next month
in starting a business, and like Murphy's regular school year course, it
is making its strongest appeal to kids from minority backgrounds. Students
tour companies, hear motivational and instructional talks and learn how
to develop a business plan. The best students win cash prizes. An independent
evaluation by Dr. Andrew Hahn of Brandeis shows that the program leads to
sharp increases in knowledge of the economic system and how to participate
in it.<BR>
<BR>
	Both these excellent approaches are making a difference, but to a relatively
small number of students.  The need is to replicate them on a far larger
scale. Minority students certainly warrant major attention, for the gap
between entrepreneurial ambition and actual outcomes is most striking in
the inner city. But, the truth is that America, the world's greatest capitalist
power, does a poor job of instructing any large share of its youth in practical
economics. And in the population as a whole the results are manifest.	<BR>
<BR>
	A survey of the National Council on Economic Education showed that &quot;the
general public was able to answer correctly only 39% of the questions on
economic concepts, relations and ideas that are frequently used in discussions
of economic matters.&quot; For example, &quot;Only 36% knew the basis purpose
of profits in an economy.&quot; (And where do they get their economics information?
For 79%, &quot;television&quot;.)<BR>
<BR>
	The ignorance of high school graduates is even more discouraging. Two thirds
of seniors could not tell the meaning of the word &quot;profit&quot; and
nearly half were baffled by such concepts as &quot;inflation&quot; and &quot;governmental
budget deficit.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Such reports frustrate educators, presumably, but they also weigh upon
serious politicians. One reason political campaigns dwell on scandals and
candidates' slips of the tongue is that the public has a hard time following
 economic issues. The proposed flat tax, trade policy or the minimum wage
may bear more on the average citizens well-being than the latest candidate
poll, but if voters don't understand the subject, they can't even participate
in the debate on it.<BR>
<BR>
	Also frustrated by widespread ignorance of economics, of course, are the
nation's employers, banks, insurance companies and other organizations that
need to rely on a population with some minimum economic literacy. <BR>
<BR>
	We constantly are told that the jobs being created  today are for workers
with higher skills, and some of those skills include a knowledge of economics.
Yet only 40 percent of high school students take economics and even many
of those, the surveys show, manage to maintain an appalling ignorance of
the subject. In college, the avoidance of economics courses continues, which
is why so many college students' ideas about the economy seem so bizarre.<BR>
<BR>
 	Surely, motivation is part of the problem. Economics, the &quot;dismal
science,&quot; sounds boring to a young person interested in rap music and
exploring his own &quot;feelings.&quot; There is too much discipline to
it.<BR>
<BR>
	That's where people like Steve Murphy, and the NFTE (and, of course, older
organizations, like Junior Achievement), come in, exciting the students'
native desire for personal success and community respect. However worthy
and popular,  however, such experiments mainly serve to point the way ahead.
The people who write curricula for our schools have infinitely more power
to close the gap between what the public knows of economics and what it
needs to know. In a world where even informed consumer behavior, let alone
earning a living, takes some economics background, how can we go on graduating
economic illiterates?<BR>

    <TITLE>Saving Social Security</TITLE>

<H1><CENTER>Little Chile May Save Your Economic Future--and America's</CENTER>
</H1>
<BR>
<H3><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="barrwb.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="5" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"><BR>
Recently in this space I described the effort of Sam Beard, author of &quot;Restoring
Hope in America,&quot; to rescue the Social Security system from bankruptcy
and provide a real economic future for the American worker. Now touring
the United States is another crusader with the nearly identical cause, Jos&eacute;
Pi&ntilde;era. The main difference between the two is that Beard, head of
the Jefferson Awards program and a Discovery Institute fellow, has a plan
for saving Social Security, while Pi&ntilde;era, former Minister of Labor
in Chile and a fellow of Cato Institute, has actually achieved something
very like it in his country.<BR>
	<BR>
Furthermore, little Chile's experiment in using the private sector and personal
choice to reform social security has been in operation for 15 years now,
long enough to test the concept thoroughly.  The result is what Pi&ntilde;era
terms &quot;a real system of social security rather than the system of social
insecurity we used to have, and which the United States has today.&quot;<BR>
	<BR>
Pi&ntilde;era was in Seattle this week, in concert with Rep. Jennifer Dunn,
and is moving on to a most interesting meeting in Colorado with former Gov.
Richard Lamm, the man who may succeed Ross Perot as the Reform Party's presidential
candidate. It has been assumed that the two major parties would decline
to get sucked into a debate over reform of Social Security in this election
cycle. Their fear is that the public couldn't get used to such novelties
fast enough to blunt the temptation of the politicians themselves to demagogue
(&quot;Stop me before I smear you again!&quot;)  But that all could change
if the most prominent third party candidate decided to take up the issue.
	<BR>
<BR>
Pi&ntilde;era, like Sam Beard, does not want to get drawn into U.S. partisan
politics and has made himself available to all interested officeholders
and parties. A foreign economist with a Harvard doctorate, he simply wants
to spread the good news. Part of his news is that three other countries
recently adopted the Chilean model--Argentina, Peru and Columbia--and that
he has high hopes soon for New Zealand, a new free enterprise tiger on the
Pacific Rim.  Prosperous Singapore already has adopted the idea.<BR>
	<BR>
Sixteen years ago Chile was just another South American economic basket
case. Pi&ntilde;era persuaded the Chilean people through television talks,
who then persuaded the government, that they could do much better investing
the 10% of their money going into the national social security system in
an approved private mutual fund or insurance annuity plan. They also were
pleased to know that they would have the option to stay with the established
government social security plan.<BR>
	 <BR>
&quot;I believe that ordinary people will make good choices if they are
given good information,&quot; Pi&ntilde;era says, and today nine out of
ten workers choose the new system. Each one has a little passbook, about
the size of a passport, which shows an updated account of how much his savings
presently is worth. Many people carry these around in their back pocket
and add new information weekly. A worker is free to assign his money to
any of the 20 or more approved mutual funds and annuity plans, with more
being approved yearly; and they can change accounts up to four times yearly.
	<BR>
<BR>
People in Chile, unlike those in the U.S., also have ample choice now as
to what point in their life they can obtain social security. So long as
they have invested enough to provide at least a minimal living, they can
get retirement benefits anytime--at 50, say. Or, says Pi&ntilde;era, they
can continue working as long as they want--&quot;like your Senator Strom
Thurmond&quot;--and keep adding to their retirement nest egg, which they
can use later or pass along to their heirs. In other words, they have the
choice between using social security as an income stream or as a savings
instrument. Further, during their working years, they can choose at any
time to increase their contribution from the mandated 10% to up to 20%.<BR>
<BR>
	What is good for the average working citizen in Chile is, of course, great
for the Chilean economy. Using the private sector to save social security
has provided a huge stimulus for economic growth. The savings rate is 27%,
the annual rate of growth is an exuberant 7% (compared to 2 1/2 % in the
U.S. this year), with unemployment at 4.8%.  The social security funds--which
now represent 40 percent of the entire economy--have been increasing in
value by over 12% a year. &quot;In Chile today,&quot; says Pi&ntilde;era,
&quot;when the stock market goes up, the workers cheer, because they know
that much of it is their money. Everybody is now an owner.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	Compassion plays a role--people whose social security savings fail to reach
a minimal threshold are subsidized. But overall the genius of the system
is to connect results to efforts. What a novel concept!<BR>
<BR>
	I have assumed that it would be a mistake to &quot;put social security
on the table&quot; in this election year.  It is too tempting for candidates
to try to frighten the elderly through misinformation. But if an average
Chilean can apprehend the virtues of a reformed system, why can't an average
American? The elderly are held safe, keeping exactly the plan they have
now, if that is their wish. For their children and grandchildren, a much
better opportunity is offered--a way, at last, to get ahead. <BR>
	<BR>
The federal government's own figures show social security going broke in
2029,  in the lifetime of today's baby boom generation. It probably will
happen sooner, about 2012.  Little Chile, however, shows that it doesn't
have to turn out that way.<BR>
	<BR>
Memo to Bob Dole and Bill Clinton: The party that enacts this new social
contract with working Americans is likely to stay in office for generations.<BR>

<P>The front page story in the Vancouver Sun last weekend was from Seattle,
where British Columbians were told that Sonics excitement revealed an &quot;America...where
sports become a life's obsession.&quot; Interviewing--get this--&quot;Milt&quot;
and &quot;Merle&quot; from Texas, the reporter had these two urban cowboys
hanging onto the bar at F. X. McRory's restaurant in Pioneer Square and
speaking for the rest of us. &quot;'It goes back to the culture,' Merle
said. 'Remember, in America, everything is capitalism. You're paid to win.'&quot;
And &quot;'..winning is everything,&quot; and if you don't win, &quot;'you're
a goat!'&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Maybe in Texas. But we're not in Texas. And we're not in Chicago, either,
where the mayor has to warn citizens not to riot when the home team wins.
In Seattle, when one of our teams wins a playoff, we have a parade. When
they lose, we have a slightly smaller parade. <BR>
We also wait for lights, don't honk much in traffic, and on most days &quot;would
rather be sailing,&quot; or skiing, or hiking --just like Vancouverites.
So, I have a deal for the Vancouver Sun: don't confuse neighboring Washington
State with Texas and we'll try not to confuse British Columbia with Quebec.<BR>
<BR>
If the Sun's reporter had walked two blocks to the waterfront and a few
blocks north to the Port's dazzling new Bell Harbor International Conference
Center, he would have met some fellow British Columbians who, in heavy conversation
with Washingtonians and Oregonians at Discovery Institute's Cascadia conference,
plainly understood that what we share is more interesting than what separates
us. <BR>
<BR>
One of those things is sports. Of course, British Columbians are fans of
the (Seattle owned) Grizzlies, just as Oregonians cheer the (Seattle owned)
Trailblazers. But our neighbors were at least vicarious Sonics fans these
past two weeks, and I think we would return the favor if the situation were
reversed. When it comes to baseball, the Mariners have the only major league
team in Cascadia and are working to build a regional base of fans. According
to Paul Isaki, Mariners vice president, &quot;On average, 10-13 percent
of our advance sales are from B.C. and roughly 8 percent are from Oregon.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
But, sports--and the tourism dollars they attract--are much more than pro
ball teams. The whole region shares recreation distinctions. Our Canadian
cousins are unquestioned first in hockey. In skiing, no Washington State
resort can compare to the internationally acclaimed Whistler Village north
of Vancouver. In horse back riding, two of the premier &quot;western adventure&quot;
ranches in the West--Sun River and Black Butte Ranch--are in Central Oregon.<BR>
<BR>
A panel of tour wholesalers from Germany, England and Australia explained
to conference attendees that overseas visitors are likely to find a Cascadia
two-nation vacation much more appealing than one to either Canada or the
US Northwest alone. People interested in Native American culture, for example,
would like to see the best museums and tribal activities on both sides of
the border. Land-cramped Europeans will be equally intrigued by seeing Banff,
Vancouver Island beaches, Puget Sound whales and the Mt. St. Helens volcano,
so why not package them together? They also will be interested in tangible
history that evokes our region's unusual past, including the Oregon Trail
and the Klondike Gold Rush. And they really will love movie sites, from
the Portland high school of Mr. Holland's Opus, to the houseboat in Sleepless
in Seattle, and the growing list of movie location sites (often disguised
as US cities) in Vancouver. <BR>
<BR>
Part of our challenge, then, is to figure out how to make the attractions
of Cascadia more accessible. Amtrak described its ambition to increase the
present schedule of three trains a day between Seattle and Portland to some
14 trains a day and foresaw an eventual jump in the new service to Vancouver
from one round-trip daily to three. (The obstacle is the $30 million needed
for track improvements on the B.C. side.) The private Rocky Mountaineer
railroad in B.C., meanwhile, wants to extend private excursion train service
that runs from Squamish to Vanvouver, to Seattle and Portland. Everybody,
meanwhile, wants to find out how to better connect the new train services
to buses, cars and airplanes throughout the region.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the development of Cascadia's identity is taking place in the private
sector and among non-profit groups. When you want to know what Cascadia
is, just look at some of the organizations which are experiencing it, such
as the regional airlines in the new &quot;open skies&quot; era of NAFTA,
the Victoria Clipper, the new &quot;Eco-Tourism groups,&quot; the regional
hotel chains, KCTS public TV (with boards in both Washington and B.C.) and
varied arts and entertainment festivals.<BR>
<BR>
There is a proper, if modest, government role, at least at the local level.
For the first time we are beginning to hear Port officials from Washington,
Oregon and B.C. talking about collaboration. A Port of Portland official
even agrees that joint marketing of the region's tourism facilities overseas
makes sense now.<BR>
<BR>
The Cascadian spirit, then, is a bit different from the stereotypical Texan.
We do like competition, and we love winning. But in life--if not basketball--you
sometimes can win most through cooperation. <BR>

Meaningless Modern Myths  Mislead America</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER></CENTER>
<H4><CENTER><I>by Bruce Chapman</I></CENTER>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
	During the past year you have heard all about it: Americans no longer are
joining community  groups to the extent they did in the good old days. In
the widely quoted phrase of Harvard's Robert Putnam, people are &quot;bowling
alone&quot; instead of joining bowling leagues, and dropping out of other
social organizations as well. It shows that we're a society increasingly
alienated, selfish and pessimistic. Surely we need government programs to
stimulate volunteering.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	This disturbing message has found its way into endless thumb-sucking media
commentaries and stentorian political pronouncements.  But, fortunately,
it is just another meaningless myth devised from misleading statistics.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	  Putnam's grim imagery was in my mind last weekend at two public school
events very unlike those I experienced as a youth. The first was the Annual
Spring Auction to raise extra money for the Tops program at Seward School
on Seattle's Capitol Hill.  Seventy or so parents, teachers and cooperative
local businesses produced the kind of fabulously successful fund-raiser
one usually associates with a posh private school. The several hundred attendees
were almost recklessly enthusiastic. Cakes typically went for $100, a small
tray on which second graders had decorated tiles--hardly Jackie Kennedy
memorabilia--sold for $400. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	The next night my wife and I joined  hundreds of &quot;Friends of Garfield
Jazz &quot; at the Westin Hotel to hear two truly inspired student jazz
ensembles--and, on Mother's Day, no less, to attend another fund raiser.
More thousands of dollars were raised by eager volunteers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	When I was a kid we were lucky if the parents helped us sell hot dogs at
the school football games. So, I sat there last Sunday, thrilled by professional
sounding trumpeters and drummers (none of them my child, I should add) and
found myself muttering happily, &quot;Whatever happened to 'Bowling Alone'?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	It's not just these busy school parents programs, or the  other organizations
whose meeting announcements increasingly engulf  my postal box, that lead
me to conclude that the &quot;bowling alone&quot; picture is false.  It's
also a recent analysis by economist Robert J. Samuelson in the Washington
Post. Samuelson that shows how Putnam's numbers, selectively derived from
a University of Chicago survey, mislead by comparing memberships in the
same organizations from a generation ago to today.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Yes, membership in the Red Cross apparently has &quot;slumped 25 to 50
percent.&quot; Farm groups are down, so are unions. But the whole set of
&quot;group&quot; categories is too rigid. Americans keep making up new
groups and associations to replace or supplement the older ones, and these
newcomers are left out of the old categories.  The school auction I mentioned
has been going on for only four years, the jazz gala for only six. Overall,
Americans actually are volunteering more, and in more ways, than in the
past.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	But we can't seem to take credit for our progress. We are that rare civilization
that cultivates myths that put it in a bad light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Take the widely spread &quot;fact&quot; that there are now more African-American
males in prison or jail than in colleges and universities. This is the kind
of statistic that is meant as a kind of vague, all-purpose zinger.  Whatever
conclusions one might draw from the comparison, however, the  facts on which
it is based turn out to be exaggerated. According to government figures,
in 1993 some 379,000 black males 18-24 were enrolled in post-secondary schools,
while 179,000 of the same age group were in jails and prisons. That comparison
is serious enough, but to get the more shocking figures of the myth you
must compare the population of college age black males in college with the
population of  black males of all ages in jails and prisons. In other words,
to validate the myth, you have to compare apples with oranges, an old trick.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Then there is the myth that corporate downsizing and the development of
free trade treaties is resulting in a net loss of American jobs overseas.
This is perfect made-for-TV theater, conducive to scenes of stunned workers
and managers who have lost their jobs. Some have, of course. Some always
have, for capitalism destroys even as it creates. At least temporarily,
life is hard for people caught in change. But the alternative is government
management of the economy, and experience world-wide shows that that approach
creates few new jobs outside government and ultimately leads to stagnation
and much worse job prospects.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	 As George Gilder reports, the relatively free U.S.  has outperformed all
the other economies in job development. &quot;We've created some 35 million
net new jobs in the last 30 years--while the Europeans, for example, have
created almost no net new jobs outside of government consumption.&quot;
 While the Japanese have done better, they have fallen behind the U.S. To
make the myth of job evaporation seem real, therefore, you must adopt a
partial blindness: you focus on the disappearing old jobs and you just ignore
the more numerous new ones.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	What difference do such myths make? Plenty. As Nicholas Eberhardt of the
American Enterprise Institute points out in his new book, &quot;The Tyranny
of Numbers,&quot; we are a country that makes public policy with a reverence
for statistics that other lands reserve for tradition or religious texts.
When journalists and politicians fall for the tricks of myth making, the
damage  can be long-lasting.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Forty years ago Alfred Kinsey produced his famous and influential scientific
study on &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot; and another on the
human female. These purported to show widespread promiscuity  and a preoccupation
with sex that begins almost in infancy. The whole concept of &quot;normal&quot;
was challenged, and the resulting intellectual furor helped to rationalize
and justify the later excesses of the sexual revolution. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Only in recent years have  Dr. Judith Reisman and other investigators actually
checked out Kinsey's data and methods and uncovered scandalously shoddy
work--and worse. Some of the small children, for example, apparently were
&quot;tested&quot; pro-actively to get the desired sexual arousal, which
Kinsey's workers then duly  recorded.  The unmentioned source of reports
on the sexuality of 800 pre-pubescent boys was one single adult man, a pedophile.
The adult test population included numbers of prison inmates, which hardly
provided an objective sample for sexual or any other social norms. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	But at the time Americans were so enthralled with science and statistics
that, as Reisman wrote, &quot;No one had the mind-space to recognize what
they were looking at.&quot; A little sensible skepticism might have prevented
a lot of wrong conclusions--and myth-making--about American society.<BR>

It's time to put warning labels on everything</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><B><I>by <A HREF="chapman.html">Bruce Chapman</A></I></B></CENTER>
<P>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rwbline2.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><BR>
	&quot;May Cause Abdominal Cramping and Loose Stools.&quot; That's  only
part of the delightful warning label the Food and Drug Administration insists
that Procter &amp; Gamble place prominently on potato chip and tortilla
chip products prepared with its new fat-substitute, Olean. The FDA did not
accede to the Center for Science in the Public Interest this winter when
the Naderite group called for a ban on the new low-calorie snacks. But the
FDA announced recently that it does plan to treat the products to a dose
of perpetual  bad publicity through package labeling. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	The FDA approved the chips because research studies showed that any abdominal
or other problems were minor and rare--about as rare as those suffered by
eaters of regular potato chips, the fatty kind long available at every grocery
store.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	But since the FDA feels that we need to have every conceivable health risk,
no matter how remote, placed constantly before our noses, surely we concerned
citizens should demand that it require big labels on the standard chips,
too. Something like, &quot;May Cause Obesity, Heart Disease and Premature
Death; And, in the Meantime, Abdominal Cramping and Loose Stools.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Other health warnings could go on popcorn, ice cream, chocolates, donuts--and,
oh, yes, broccoli. After all, there are other self-anointed experts seriously
telling us that  fruits and vegetables can be a source of potentially deadly
toxins. (Kids, here's a new argument against spinach: That stuff'll kill
ya!)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Some want the FDA to ban Melatonin, the hormone the brain itself secretes
and which is sold in artificial form over-the-counter. Others wish merely
to assign production to established pharmaceutical companies and allocation
to a doctor's prescription, which, together, of course, might just increase
its price about ten-fold. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Dr. Richard A. Friedman, a psychiatrist at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical
Center, wants many  kinds of dietary supplements now freely available to
consumers at health food stores and pharmacies put under the same daunting,
scrutiny of the FDA. That agency can't even get drugs commonly in use in
Europe approved for prescription use here without years of redundant studies.
Thus, what the FDA obviously needs now is a host of over-the-counter dietary
supplements to investigate as well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	The fallback position--the moderate stance, if you will--is to scare the
daylights out of consumers with large, mandatory warning labels. Well, none
too soon, in my opinion. For example, how about one for lemon cough drops
(&quot;May Cause Yellow Tongue&quot;) and another for Band-Aids (&quot;May
Cause Pain and Skin Redness When Removed Quickly&quot;)? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	  One hesitates to think what might happen to drinking water consumption
if city water departments have to list all the stuff that comes out of the
faucet with the H2O--but, still, we'd better make them label those ingredients,
down to the quadrillionth particle, just to be sure. A sign on every sink,
alongside a &quot;Mr. Yuk&quot; picture,  should suffice.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	As word spreads of the myriad dangers that lurk in ordinary kitchen refrigerators
and bathroom cabinets, whole new diseases are being created to cope with
people's heightened distress. The demand for these new diseases is especially
keen among the over-educated and under-occupied.  An article in &quot;The
Women's Quarterly,&quot; journal of the Independent Women's Forum in Washington,
D. C., describes, for example, the pscho-pathology of Multiple Chemical
Sensitivity (MCS), which the author (and many doctors) cruelly compare to
the &quot;hysteria&quot; that afflicted upper-middle class ladies of the
nineteenth century. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	&quot;Aided and abetted by plaintiff's lawyers,&quot; Melinda Ledden Sidak
reports, &quot;MCS groups have pressured government agencies and the courts
to recognize MCS as a disability under all state worker's plans, as well
as state and federal handicapped and disability laws.&quot; So, taxpayers
and insurance policy owners, get ready to pay for the latest fashion in
angst.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Possible symptoms of MCS include &quot;mental confusion, nausea, headaches,
heart palpitations, joint pain, irritability and insomnia.&quot; Among the
reputed causes are exposure to any number of odors, such as perfume (&quot;We
want to destroy the fragrance industry,&quot; says one activist), air fresheners,
petroleum, deodorants, cleaning products, fireworks, licorice, and even
toothpaste. Whereas  some of us are nauseated by the stories we read in
sensationalist publications, certain MCS sufferers believe they are made
sick by the ink.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Put warning labels on everything, I say.  Television sets, for example,
not only carry terrifying stories about supposedly dangerous foods and everyday
household products, but endless other nonsense. They definitely  should
be forced to carry a government warning: &quot;Watching More Than One Hour
Daily May Contribute to Obesity, Lassitude, Pessimism and Anti-Social Attitudes.
Consult Your Doctor, Therapist and Lawyer.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Along these lines, I notice that someone finally  is organizing a class
action suit against those dating services you see in weekly newspapers.
Why, did you know that some of those personal ads are actually less than
truthful?  Surely we need the government to require honesty in all such
advertising claims. Thus a personal for &quot;SWM, 34,  professional, likes
music, hiking, sensitive relationships&quot; might be forced to add, &quot;Warning:
Has two unpaid parking tickets; sings off-key; consistently tardy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Maybe we should have a government-directed warning added to wedding ceremonies:
&quot;Dearly Beloved, marriage is known to lead to divorce in some cases;
and it may contribute to headaches, high stress levels and children.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
	And don't forget to put a warning label on the children. They're really
hazardous.<BR>

Why God Can't Get a Speaking Part in Hollywood</CENTER>

<P>	More than half the population of the United States will be in  synagogue
or church this week, the holy season of Passover and Easter. Surveys report
that over 100 million Americans find God in daily prayer. His healing hand
is experienced in hospitals, His hope in hospices. Victims and heroes who
have brushed death in accidents and war passionately praise His name. Clergy
of varied denominations enlist Him--successfully--to save marriages, comfort
the grieving and give courage to people facing loss, career challenges,
or troubled relationships with families or friends. Sunday schools still
instruct the young in virtue and the heritage of the Bible, which is still
the world's perpetual best-seller. Christian books, almost unnoticed, out-publish
the &quot;trade book&quot; houses that are followed so closely by the media.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	But you have to look hard to find God in the movies or even on TV. He has
been all but black-listed. When He gets a part, it usually is trivial, or
ridiculous or even--amazingly--villainous. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
 	In the midst of its regular diet of mayhem, you will find the occasional
movie or TV program that tells a tale of people successfully combating gang
violence, say, or rehabilitating drug addicts. But you seldom would guess
that much of that work is done by religious groups--who raise over half
of all charitable dollars in America--or that faith is not just part of
the motivation for such service but is its transforming essence. Rev. Del
C. Maxfield of the Denver Rescue Mission, for example, asserts that &quot;God
is the only answer to the spiritual emptiness that drives substance abuse.&quot;
He backs this claim with the fact that his mission's success rate in rehabilitation
programs is 60% for men and 70% for women, versus a government program success
rate of 10%.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	From building orphanages overseas to helping rescue teen runaways on our
own urban streets, the churches are there, witnessing their faith in God.
But seldom, if ever, are they in the movies or on TV. Millions of believers
died at the hands of Hitler, Stalin and Mao, and Christians today are persecuted
still in China, North Korea, Cuba and the Sudan. Christian doctors and nurses
risk their lives in outbreaks of dread diseases in Africa and trying to
prevent killings in the Balkans. Few of their stories make it on to the
big screen.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	The rare exception makes us grateful. <I>Dead Man Walking</I>  just won
an Oscar for Susan Sarandon who plays a nun who is involved as much in saving
the soul as the life of a murderer on death row. There is little sense that
this nun is part of a supporting church, but at least her own motivation
in faith shines through. Looking back, one remembers a few other films of
our times--<I>Chariots of Fire </I>in 1980, comes to mind--where real people
in the movies lives of witness. A cartoon feature like Disney's enormously
popular <I>The Lion King</I> somehow evokes a sense of an Almighty and an
eternal order.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	But far more common are anti-religious movies like Disney's <I>The Priest,
</I>that Michael Medved, movie critic for PBS' Sneak Previews, has called
&quot;the most anti-Catholic movie ever made,&quot; or the poorly made,
but ardently defended <I>The Last Temptation of Christ</I>, a few years
back, which was genuinely sacrilegious. &quot;Christians,&quot; says Medved
(who himself is a practicing Jew) &quot;are the last group that Hollywood
feels it can offend with impunity.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Some of the offense is simply gratuitous and preposterous. There is stock
use in comedies of the amiable buffoon who makes a brief appearance as a
minister or priest at weddings (e.g., <I>Four </I>Weddings and a Funeral)
or the silly rabbi with a Yiddish accent (c.f., the films of Mel Brooks
and Woody Allen). On TV, its Dana Carvey's sanctimonious and lusting &quot;Church
Lady&quot; satire. But, increasingly, the stereotype is sinister: the evil,
Bible-spouting warden in <I>Shawshank </I>Redemption (with the same Tim
Robbins who--remarkably--directed <I>Dead Man Walking</I>), the fundamentalist
fanatic in <I>The Rapture</I>, the Orwellian Puritans in <I>The Handmaid's
Tale</I>, the Pentecostal psychopath in <I>Cape Fear</I>, the maniac in
      who uses a sharpened crucifix to slash his victims, the hypocritical
and violent papacy depicted in numerous thrillers such as <I>The Pope Must
Die . </I>(When I was a babe, a few Protestants still railed against the
papacy, while Hollywood glorified the Catholic Church in fine films such
as <I>Boys' </I>Town and <I>Going My Way</I>.  Today, Protestant and Catholic
clergy attend prayer groups together, leaving Hollywood to demonize the
Vatican. The dark days of the Inquisition live on, not in the real world,
only in the reel world.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Hollywood, of course, is not meant to be real. Robert and Linda Lichter
of George Washington University's Media Center have shown that 40 percent
of the murders on the screen are commited by businessmen, whereas you'd
hardly find a less likely profile for the real life police blotter's lineup.
So what difference does it make if films and television trash religion when
they are not ignoring it? Aren't they just responding to the market and
giving people what they want?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	We can thank Michael Medved and his truly courageous 1991 book, <I>Hollywood
vs. America</I>, for showing that Hollywood is not giving people what they
want. The reason you may not even recognize some of the films I have listed
here is that anti-religous movies tend to bomb. Most of the best attended,
money-making movies of the past few years have been G rated or P-13 rated.
Turkeys like <I>The Pope Must Die</I> routinely fare poorly at the box office.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	So, why do they go on making them? Because, Medved indicates, people in
Hollywood care most about impressing each other. They are very politically
correct about a lot of things, which is why they adopt a dilettante's affectation
of New Age spirituality. They love &quot;angels&quot; and people coming
back from the dead as helpful spirits, which is to say they imagine to be
the goodies of religion without the responsibilities. But then they find
organized religion offensive, or at least think that taking a cheap shot
at it in their horror or science fiction flick will make them seem more
like serious artists. Not to ordinary people--but to Hollywood. After all,
&quot;Epater les bourgeois&quot; (shock the middle classes) has been the
motive force of inferior art for much of the materialist 20th Century. Lacking
a moral core, its original criticism of hypocrisy eventually became hypocritical
itself, and, hence, literally degenerate. My colleague Philip Gold calls
it &quot;anarcho-sterility.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	This is not art, no matter how many candles you light in front of a ghoul's
shrine to Jesus. As the late Bart Giamatti, Renaissance scholar, Yale President
and Baseball Commissioner said of the genre, it is &quot;fatigue masquerading
as philosophy.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	But if anti-religious themes are not money-makers and lack artistic authenticity,
they still do damage. Just because an ad on TV doesn't sell everybody, that
doesn't mean it doesn't sell somebody, as Medved points out. Hollywood's
antagonism to God and to people of faith cannot help but have an influence
on the culture, just as its themes of wanton violence do. Worse, they portray
to people who have no compensating contact with faith a bizarre caricature
of reality. Instead of Mother Theresa (no film on her yet!), we get some
dopey Christian slasher.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Fortunately, Hollywood is in financial trouble and cannot much longer support
self-indulgent work that offends large segments of the population and results
in small box office returns. Moreover, there are signs that some few producers,
directors and artists are realizing that faith and the faithful are not
necessarily their enemies. There are quiet Christians in Hollywood as there
were in the Catacombs of Rome. They had a role in <I>The Lion King</I>,
for example. Some Christians are forming film companies outside the Hollywood
orbit. At the same time, a few Hollywood artists of integrity are going
through something very like religious conversions. When Steven     Spielberg
made <I>Schindler's List</I>, the great Holocaust story that ends in an
affirmation of both brotherhood and deep faith, he not only came to grips
with his ethnic Jewishness for the first time, but he also powerfully encountered
the God behind it. His new company features both serious Christians and
Jews. Its first motion picture, Spielberg recently announced, will be <I>The
Prince of Egypt</I>, about Moses. Why? &quot;To be a blessing&quot; on the
new company, he said.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
	Well, that's not exactly the Church Lady speaking.<BR>

Racial Tallies will serve only to divide us more</CENTER>

<P>The Census Bureau projected recently that by the middle of the 21st century
&quot;non-Hispanic whites&quot; will constitute only 52.8 percent of the
U.S. population, Hispanics will have doubled to 24.5 percent, blacks increased
slightly to 13.6 percent and Asians almost trebled to 8.2 percent. Supposedly,
the news is that high birth rates among Hispanics and immigration among
Asians are changing the face of America. But, can anyone doubt the unwritten
text here that an inevitable political, cultural and economic transformation
is coming?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, count me as one who doubts it. The race and ethnicity issue is not
as clear as the numbers imply because it is premised on faulty definitions.
As some politicians beat the drums of group demands and others call for
stringent curbs on immigration, the truth is that no one is sure what the
government's race and ethnic terms mean. Certainly no one can infer from
the projections that people will behave in the future according to some
fixed racial and ethnic stereotypes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider two hypothetical couples, the kinds that show up repeatedly in
real Census stories told, for example, at Congressional hearings.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Couple One consists of a wife whose parents were Chinese and her husband
whose parents were Norwegian and Irish. When the Census rolls around, how
should this couple record the race and ethnicity of its children? The Census
provides little help; it counts one choice for race on the Census short
form and is only somewhat more flexible for ethnicity identifications on
the long form that is filled out by a population sample. It provides no
&quot;mixed race&quot; category, which usually means that one parent's background
goes on the records and the other's does not. Obviously, this annoys people.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Couple Two includes a husband who insists that his race and ethnicity is
&quot;American,&quot; although he has to write it in, for no category exists
for that, either. His identification may be a protest statement, in fact.
If you pressed him (as Census takers do), you might find out that he has
a jumble of ancestors from places like Germany and Italy, along with some
whose pasts in America go back so far they are lost to the current generation.
So what's the government going to do about such situations, conduct family
research and issue us all racial and ethnic identity cards?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The wife in this second couple is, it seems, &quot;black&quot;--&quot;African-American.&quot;
Except that she is light skinned; there are plainly white forebears in her
family background. So, in facing the Census question, what &quot;race&quot;
should husband and wife number two put down for <I>their</I> children? And
whatever they put down, what does it really mean? How do people like this
show up in those confident sounding projections of national racial makeup
a half century hence?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer is that race and ethnicity designations produce some of the squishiest
numbers in the federal statistical system. Fifty year projections of those
numbers are squishier still and subject to repeated revision.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Civilized beings love to give names to things, and then to keep refining
their categories. But, in the 19th century the kinds of ethnic terms people
had adopted through custom or folklore were taken up as a &quot;scientific&quot;
project. For a long time, the inquiry seemed successful. I remember visiting
Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History in the 1950's and seeing statues
and pictures of the various racial types, sub-grouped down to &quot;Nordic&quot;
and &quot;Slavic,&quot; and &quot;Semitic,&quot; with tell-tale noses and
brows painstakingly examined. Of course, the whole concept of racial designations
was very popular earlier with the Nazis, and it was the basis of the boundless
meddling of the <I>apartheid </I>system in South Africa.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But as science it was not sustainable. Prof. Lionel Tiger, the Rutgers University
anthropologist, writes, &quot;The fact is that all of contemporary population
genetics and molecular biology underscores that the 19th century notion
of races as discrete and different entities is false. There is only gradual
genetic diversity between groups. We all merge smoothly into each other.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nor is Dr. Tiger alone. An assemblage of international scientists who gathered
recently in Austria concluded, &quot;Categorization of humans by distribution
of genetically determined factors is artificial and encourages the production
of unending lists of arbitrary and misleading social perceptions and images.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Take the expression, &quot;non-Hispanic white.&quot; Can anyone say specificially
what that is? Immediately, it raises the question, what is an &quot;Hispanic
white,&quot; then--a Spaniard? (Some college scholarships disqualify Hispanic
students if they are of &quot;Iberian&quot; descent.) How about a Chilean?
What of &quot;meztisos,&quot; which is to say, most Mexicans, with the bloodlines
of indigenous and European lines in exquisite and varied tanglement? What
race, pray, is a Cuban?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here in the United States of America, the mischief caused by &quot;misleading
images&quot; starts with the government-ordered racial and ethnic declarations
on the Census forms. Even if they were based on science one might suspect
them, because they rely on self-identification. You can call yourself anything
you want. A Census study showed, for example, that some 12 percent of people
identifying themselves as Hispanic in one survey did not do the same in
a later survey. Identification as &quot;native American&quot; has leaped
implausibly in the past twenty years and may as likely reflect growing cultural
acceptability or imagined affirmative action advantage as rising birth rates.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other words, however we celebrate our group identities for private purposes,
we seem to have reached the point where official racial and ethnic designations
are more confusing than illuminating. This confusion can be dangerous. When
we see racial projections spun out 55 years we are tempted to draw stereotypical
conclusions, to say prejudiced things to our inner hearts, and to contribute
to fears and rivalries that distort public policy. The glory of our real
lives is that racial and ethnic stereotypes are slowly breaking down, so
why do we make it official business to preserve them?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A small first step toward reforming this system of flawed codes might be
to acknowledge that many Americans are of &quot;mixed race&quot; and should
be allowed to list themselves that way on Census forms. Rep. Thomas E. Petri
(R.-Wisconsin) has proposed that Congress authorize the Census Bureau to
include such a category. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eventually, however, we should re-evaluate the whole scheme of government-directed
racial and ethnic categorization and consider retiring it to the archives.
File it under &quot;Failed 19th Century Pseudo-Science,&quot; alongside
Phrenology and Mesmerism.<BR>

Perilous Levy Vote Will Affect Future of School Reform</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER>by Bruce Chapman<BR>
<BR>
<IMG SRC="rwbline2.gif" WIDTH="512" HEIGHT="6" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG=
"3"></CENTER>
<P>There are at least four &quot;school reform&quot; constituencies in Seattle,
as well as the hard core body of voters who habitually vote against any
tax measure, including special levies. Unless three of the groups of reform
voters combine, the special levy for regular maintenance and operations
will fail next Tuesday. How the levy goes, moreover, will affect the future
of all kinds of school reform.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Note that there is no sizable constituency for business-as-usual in the
school district, because nearly everybody acknowledges that public education
is in trouble and needs to change. The problem is in deciding what kind
of change and how to achieve it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The first reform group is the school establishment, made up of state and
district education officials, the teachers' union (Washington Education
Association) and the organized business community. In an alliance that is
sometimes uneasy, the WEA is willing to cooperate with business and the
crusading new district Superintendent, John Stanford, to increase accountability
for curriculum standards and greater site management (school control at
the school level) in return for assurance that nothing too radical will
disturb the power of the union. The education establishment reformers, calling
themselves &quot;Schools First,&quot; back the levy strongly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A counter-levy group has organized around People for Ethical Government
(&quot;PEG&quot;), a title that suggests, I guess, that everyone else is
unethical. This group has taken a fair shot at wasteful practices of past
school management and is not prepared to concede even sincerity to former
General Stanford as he tries to improve things. &quot;No more money until
they account for past spending!&quot; the &quot;PEG&quot; campaign demands.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The trouble is, we know from a similar experience 20 years ago that a final
failure of an M &amp; O levy is not likely to stimulate analysis of past
actions by the school district, but a crisis, with huge increases in class
sizes, reductions in hours of classroom instruction and the furloughing
of hundreds of teachers and counselors, plus curtailment of whole programs
in language instruction, arts and music. (Voters' homework assignment: See
the film <I>Mr. Holland's Opus</I>.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This brings us to reform group three, the backers of school vouchers, embracing
among others the large number of parents with children in private schools,
including many minorities. A different (and sometimes overlapping) reform
group consists of backers of charter schools, who want to retain the public
school system, but allow parents and teachers groups to organize neighborhood
and specialized schools without the day-to-day direction of district headquarters.
Proponents of vouchers and of charter schools differ on their prescriptions,
but they share the same diagnosis: the central bureaucracy and the teachers
union have confused what's good for them for what's good for the kids.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How big are these structural reform groups? Well, an Elway Poll in February
showed the charter school idea with majority support (51% to 38%) among
Seattle voters. Voucher backers will have Initiative 173 on the ballot this
fall. Charter school proponents have Initiative 177 up at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, you would think, given the growing support for these structural
reform ideas, that the education establishment might have been willing at
least to allow the charter schools proposal to be adopted by the state legislature
on a modified basis. And in the recent legislative session they were--but
only in the Republican House. In the Democratic Senate the teachers union
made sure that the compromise was killed. The only &quot;charter school&quot;
bill the WEA would sanction was a Trojan horse that borrowed the &quot;charter
school&quot; title while assuring that no real change would take place.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The temptation must be very strong for the structural reformers to sit out
the levy. Many believe that the media and business community will fail to
back structural reform until failure of the system is incontestable, as
happened with mandatory busing. But, in fact, backers of structural reforms
probably will go to the polls and vote for the levy. They must know that
you cannot destroy the system to save it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You do not have to look back 20 years to see how failure breeds failure;
just look south today--to Portland. There the state government made bold
promises of education improvements five years ago, but forgot to institute
the financial measures to implement them. Meanwhile, concurrent state tax
and revenue cutbacks forced the Portland school district to drop its budget
from $351 million to $304 million over four years. So instead of realizing
Oregon's high sounding reform aims, parents are seeing increases in class
size, big cuts in kindergarten and special education programs and--most
ominously, as the Associated Press reports--middle class parents placing
their children in private schools or moving to the suburbs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Portland has absorbed over four years, Seattle will have to accomplish
in one year if the levy fails. The chance to get school based budgeting--to
support children, not the system--will not be advanced in the midst of such
mayhem. It will be killed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The PEG group expresses the fear that levy passage will be interpreted as
a sign that all is well with the Seattle schools--and that improved accountability
is not necessary. Some, indeed, may make that interpretation, but if they
do it's a terrible mistake. In fact, the present weakness of voter backing
in Seattle should be a wakeup call telling district and state officials
that serious and deep reform cannot be delayed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Reformers who want either vouchers or charter schools in the long run are
best advised to go resolutely to the polls Tuesday and support the levy.
But after the levy passes it might be helpful if some of the education establishment
made more of an effort to listen to what the structural reformers--backed
by a growing body of experience in other states--are trying to tell them.
Reform doesn't have much of a chance if the reformers are divided.

Is Uncle Sam About to Take Leave of His Census?</CENTER>

<P>Washington State's population is growing fast enough that the state seems
likely to warrant another Congressional seat (our tenth) when the U.S. Census
is taken in April, 2000--only four years from now. But the outcome is sufficiently
uncertain that it may depend on what kind of Census the government holds.
Will Congress fund a traditional Census that counts each person? Or, bowing
to the Administration, will it authorize a new kind of Census that enumerates
most people, but then uses population sampling techniques to complete the
job? On such an arcane issue hangs great electoral power and the public's
confidence in the statistical system whose numbers we rely upon everyday
in commerce, education and politics.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is true that sampling would eliminate many time consuming house calls
and other enumeration efforts, and thus save hundreds of millions of dollars.
But Census numbers are used to distribute large shares of the federal budget,
as well as to apportion seats in the House of Representatives and redistrict
state and local legislatures. So it is worth doing right. The &quot;cheapest&quot;
Census, after all, would be one that didn't even attempt a complete enumeration
and simply came up with numbers based on surveys. Yet most of us would not
be represented in those numbers as real people, but only as surrogates for
certain demographic characteristics, such as age, race, sex, and income
level.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is also true that the Census misses several million people in its traditional
count. But such an &quot;undercount&quot; has been experienced each decade
for 200 years without endangering the republic. In 1990 the undercount amounted
to only an estimated 1.8 percent. Instead of creating artificial numbers
to represent the missed residents (including many who wished to be missed),
the Census should emphasize improvements in taking the count. These include
employing new software and using administrative records, such as Social
Security and welfare rolls, to find persons omitted in the head count.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If, instead, we undertake an official census that mixes virtual people with
real people what will happen to public trust in the results? What happens
when the Census imputes such virtual people into neighborhoods and voting
districts where critics can show, block by block, that the bodies just aren't
there?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Administration professes to be worried about all the lawsuits that were
filed after the 1980 and 1990 censuses by states that lost Congressional
seats. Ironically, the government so far has won all those suits. But if
the Administration cares about legal vulnerability, just wait until it gets
hit with the suits brought by states that lose representation through a
Census whose adjusted numbers can easily be disproven in small areas. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Washington State, it is very possible that we would not have received
our ninth Congressional seat in 1990 if the Census had been adjusted that
year. It was a close call as it was. In 2000, despite an expected population
growth of roughly one million new people--from 4.9 million to 5.9 million,
a 20 percent growth rate that is twice that of the nation as a whole--the
chance of a tenth seat for Washington could be another close call. Once
again, that chance could be jeopardized by Census adjustment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
According to the Forecast Division of the Office of Financial Management
in Olympia, the state's population already has passed 5.5 million, an increase
about the size of the average current Congressional district nationally,
569 thousand. However, each state's prospects are affected by growth rates
in other states. The overall U.S. population is expected to rise from 248
million in 1990 to about 275 million in 2000, so the average district population
will have to grow, too. In Washington, that will mean an increase from districts
of 540 thousand each to districts of about 632 thousand each. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No one knows how all this arithmetic will work out because no one knows
whether current growth rates will continue for four more years. But what
does seem certain is that states like Washington that do a relatively good
job of counting their people will suffer if the Census Bureau awards other
states with large imputed numbers. What also seems certain is that the Census
Bureau's hard-earned reputation for integrity could suffer when people find
out that a mere survey has removed part of the foundation of our national
statistical system. It would be analgous to announcing that we were going
to settle future political contests with polls rather than actual elections.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If the Census Bureau's statisticians are ordered to do so by the Administration,
and Congress goes along, they will conduct surveys and make subsequent adjustments
as fairly as possible; for they are a conscientious group. But eventually
the traditional civic role of the Census--one of the few functions of government
named in the Constitution--will be undermined and its political legitimacy
brought into question. As a government demographer (who wishes anonymity)
told me recently, &quot;The statistical community is not united on this.
There is a potential here for cooking the books that is stomach wrenching.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Congress, therefore, should not go along. Why create yet another source
of public mistrust?

<H1><CENTER>Fix the Presidential Nominating Process of 2000--Now</CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><BR>
<B>by Bruce Chapman<BR>

<IMG SRC="aredblue.gif" WIDTH="468" HEIGHT="10" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=

<P>The prevailing mood of the Republican presidential nominating process
is still one of irritated reluctance, like that of singers being awakened
to go on stage at 5 a.m.--and an audience being forced to attend the performance.
This show started too early.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
We also are witnessing the infamous law of unintended consequences as it
snaps back in the faces of the reformers. These good government types (&quot;goo-goos&quot;
in the old machine lingo) thought that if we just put limits on what individuals
could contribute to candidates and provided federal matching money tied
to a spending limit we could clean up the nominating process.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wrong. For the second presidential campaign in a row we have a multi-millionaire,
this time Steve Forbes, who is exploiting his constitutional right to stay
out of the federal matching money cage and spend all he wants. He may be
an excellent fellow (and I happen to think he is), but there is a little
issue of fairness. Competing in dollars with Forbes, Sen. Dole is fast approaching
the spending limit imposed by the reformers. We actually could have a &quot;front
runner&quot; run out of gas long before the national convention, not because
he can't raise money, but because isn't allowed to spend it. President Clinton,
on the other hand, is effectively unchallenged for his party's nomination,
so he can spend &quot;primary&quot; dollars--re-enforced by federal matching
funds--all summer, as if they were final election dollars. This situation
also was unanticipated by the reformers. Then comes H. Ross Perot, who could
buy and sell <I>Forbes</I> any day of the week, and throw in <I>Fortune</I>
and <I>Business Week</I> while he was at it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Long before the candidates and parties go broke you will see the special
interests step in--labor unions, various industry associations and single
issue groups. Their &quot;free speech&quot; protected by the Constitution,
they will go on TV, as they did in the recent special senate election in
Oregon, to run the negative ads the candidates don't want to pay for or
have attached to their own names. The moral is, ban money spent on candidates
and parties and you soon will open new channels for it elsewhere, and with
no controls. Reformers should think hard about this lesson before imposing
still more restrictions upon the political system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meantime, here is Chapman's Plan to Restore Sanity to the Presidential Nominating
Process. But it can't happen in 2000 if it doesn't start now. (Another way
of putting this is that we wouldn't be in today's mess if someone had been
looking ahead in 1992.)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
1) <I>Push the delegate selection process back in the calendar by </I>at
least six weeks. The presidential campaign is lasting one year out of every
four, which bores and disgusts the electorate. The first presidential primary
should take place no earlier than mid-March, as of old. In fact, there is
no reason in this instant information age that the primary season should
start before mid-April, or even later. It is the two parties who must force
this shift by enacting rules changes at their conventions this summer. States
and federal governments can't do it. Under new party rules, no delegates
selected before the approved primary season beginning date would be recognized
at the party's national convention.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
2) <I>Keep the primary system, but give each party's top elected </I>and
organizational leaders a bigger role in the nominating process . The supposedly
bad old nominating system that prevailed before the primary system had the
merit, in reality, of letting the long term leaders of a party come together
every four years to deliberate. It was hard then for a sudden avalanche
of enthusiasm for a candidate to derail the party's sensible quest for a
winner. That system (victim of reformers again) may have been flawed in
some ways, but it gave us Abraham Lincoln, Grover Cleveland, Woodrow Wilson,
both Roosevelts, Harry Truman and even, arguably, Dwight Eisenhower. Have
we been doing a lot better lately?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Democrats already reserve a small share of delegate slots for their big
wigs, such as governors, members of Congress and state party chairs. I suggest
that both parties reserve a full one third of each state's delegates for
its top leaders. The presence of a party's old hands would assure that the
nominating convention retained some of its institutional memory--and the
flexibility to help the party change course in August if the choice of April
suddenly seemed doomed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
3) <I>Raise the personal contribution limit and end the federal </I>spending
limit. No one can stop a billionaire from spending his wad (nor should we),
but we must stop handcuffing his competition. The best way is to free up
all individual givers and positively encourage the ones of modest means.
Individuals' contributions, unlike PACs, tend to be less about business
interests and more about personal commitment. Therefore, raise the $1,000
limit on personal contributions to $10,000. Then give a tax <I>credit</I>
for small contributions, up to $50. And throw out the useless spending limit.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The result will be a gusher of new money into campaigns. Yes, campaigns
are costly, but we still spend less on politics than on ads for soft drinks,
so why are we trying to handicap candidates who have lots of individual
backers they can mobilize to match the bank accounts of the super-rich?
The real alternative is government funding, whereafter you will have candidates
who owe their elections to the government--the most powerful interest of
all--and behave accordingly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
4) <I>Use some of the present federal matching funds to support </I>major
issues debates. The kind of televised &quot;debates&quot; we have seen in
New Hampshire, Georgia and elsewhere are usually just padded versions of
the personal attacks that otherwise dominate the news. You can only blame
the candidates to a degree; set up a glorified shouting match and the candidates
will shout.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So instead, set up regular debates on general topics. Remember foreign affairs?
Instead of mere fleeting references to nuclear proliferation, terrorism,
the U.N., narcotics traffic or human rights, let's get the candidates to
go into their views in greater detail. Then do the same with economic policy,
defense, social issues and the environment. Some candidates simply would
burble their sound bites over and over, while others would be able to explain
complex ideas. It could prove educational.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I don't know if my proposals are ideal, or even sufficient. For example,
Senator Slade Gorton's idea of scheduling the primaries as four regional
events is also a good one; however, I wonder about having the federal government
take over this responsibility. But I do <BR>
know that unless the parties (especially), state legislatures and Congress
start thinking now about major changes in the nominating process, we'll
be right back in this leaky boat in four years.<BR>

Seattle Poised to Go &quot;Major League&quot; with International Sports</CENTER>
</H1>

<P>Seattle's future as a sports town could brighten in the next few months,
and everyone--not just fans--will benefit. Fascinated disgust with the saga
of the migrating Seahawks has tended to obscure this area's bids for two
of the most exciting sports events anywhere--the World Track and Field Championships
in 1999 and the Olympic Games of 2008. Getting either one would be a coup
for the whole &quot;Cascadia&quot; region of Washington, Oregon and British
Columbia. Winning both bids is possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The third largest sporting event after the Olympics and the World Soccer
Cup, the World Track and Field Championships is expected to attract over
1,800 athletes from 198 countries, some 4,000 members of the media and 600,000
spectators. The television audience can only be estimated in the billions.
Amateur sports clubs and school athletics in the region would be energized
and--as in the Goodwill Games of 1990--the region's performing arts would
find the sports events a good backdrop for a summer festival.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Selection of the U.S. bid city to compete for theWorld Track and Field Championships
in 1999 is anticipated this weekend. Seattle's leading competition is thought
to be Palo Alto, California, home of Stanford University. Two weeks ago
a US track and field association team quietly surveyed Seattle to check
out potential facilities and to test community support. The group was favorably
impressed and invited the Seattle organizers to make a final presentation
this weekend in Atlanta. If Seattle is chosen as US bid city, which could
happen as early as this Sunday, it will proceed to compete internationally
this summer, with other contenders including Seville and Beijing. Again,
organizers think we have an excellent chance, partly because the track and
field championships have never before been held in the United States.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Coordinating the Seattle bid is Tom Porter of Seafirst and chairing the
overall Summer Games Organizing Committee is Clark Kokich of AT&amp;T Wireless.
The effort is backed by many businesses and such public figures as Mayor
Norm Rice, Governor Mike Lowry and the State Legislature. Leading the campaign
day-to-day is Bob Walsh, the sports events impresario responsible for much
of the Goodwill Games success, with other support coming from Discovery
Institute's Cascadia Project.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hosting the1999 World Championships would be a prestigious way to prepare
for the Olympics--the competition of all competitions. Even if the Track
and Field Championships do not come our way, the Summer Games Organizing
Committee is mounting an effort to persuade the US and international Olympics
Committees to smile on our bid for 2008 Olympics. Indeed, 1999 is the year
the choice of locations for 2008 will be determined, and despite Atlanta's
sponsorship of the games this year, the power of America's financial and
spectator market is such that by then another American bid could well succeed.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once again, strong competition is inevitable. In the U.S., it might include
Chicago and Boston. Having lived in both of those cities in my youth, I
would like to advise the Olympics Committee that in the summer they both
suffer too much heat, humidity and--yes!--rain. In July and August, at least,
the Pacific Northwest's weather is incomparably athlete-friendly.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Seattle thus has a terrific opportunity to host the Olympics, too. With
that in mind, contributors to the Summer Games Committee are lining up to
make three year commitments to promote the initial bid approval in 1999.
Among the larger backers so far are such familiar names as the Sports Council
of Seattle/King County, Holland America Line, Boeing, Microsoft, U.S. Bank,
Seafirst Bank, Perkins Coie, Motorola, AT&amp;T and Providence Health Systems.
But there also are interesting novelties, such as Paul Allen's Portland
Trailblazers. Backing from other Oregon concerns, and some from Victoria
and Vancouver, B.C., is expected because the Olympic sports and cultural
events will take place throughout the region.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, Seattle organizers began this effort with the idea of making a bid
on behalf of all of Cascadia. But, it quickly turned out that only one city
can be the official sponsor. Still, cooperation among neighbors not only
will be allowed, but a precedent for it may be set by Villach, in southern
Austria, which is bidding to host the Winter Olympics of 2006. That Alpine
city has the strong assistance of its neighbors in adjacent Italy and Slovenia,
which will stage some of the events. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In our region, even the years of planning such trans-border cooperation
is bound to stimulate collateral efforts, such as getting better inter-city
passenger rail service, developing a regional &quot;two-nation vacation&quot;
approach to international tourism and creation of stronger cultural, environmental
and trade ties. It will boost the visibility of this region in the world,
as Seattle Port Commissioner Paul Schell has argued, far more than could
be expected from any professional sports team's achievement.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The truth, which always bears repeating, is that Seattle seems to move ahead
internationally when it decides to hold a party. The Alaska-Yukon Exposition
of1911 helped our trade position and left us a developed site for a new
University of Washington campus. The Century 21 World's Fair gave us Seattle
Center and a base for a huge expansion of arts activities. The Goodwill
Games of1990 and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting of
heads of state in1994 improved our international standing in ways direct
(massive publicity) and indirect (Seattle is now the official home for America's
APEC office). Hosting the Olympics--and, if we should be so lucky, the World
Track and Field Championships--will help focus a lot of energy in a civic
endeavor of major proportions. And it will give a richer local dimension
to the term &quot;major league.&quot;

    <TITLE>George Washington Bush: Puget Sound Hero</TITLE>

<H3>From the Friday February 23, 1996 <I>Seattle Post Intelligencer</I>:</H3>
<H1><CENTER><BR>
Washington State history often neglects this heroic Puget Sound country
pioneer </CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="barrwb.gif" WIDTH="679" HEIGHT="7" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>Test yourself: who was he? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In most ways he was a self-made man, a well-to-do farmer from Missouri who
assisted other frontiersmen on the Oregon Trail. Most noteworthy, he was
the determinative leader of the first pioneer settlement in Puget Sound
country in 1845. His homesteading helped the United States establish the
future national identity of this whole region. One of his sons, William,
was a state legislator who introduced the bill that created Washington State
University in Pullman. <BR>
<P><CENTER><HR></CENTER>
<H3><CENTER><I>His homesteading helped the United States establish the future
national identity of this whole region.</I></CENTER>
</H3>
<P><CENTER><HR></CENTER>
<P>Hospitable, smart, manly, he conquered such daunting adversity in nature
and society that we should see him as an exemplar among the early pioneers.
Yet he makes only a small appearance in history books. Paul Thomas wrote
a fine master's thesis about him at the University of Washington 30 years
ago, but there apparently is still no published book on this remarkable
pioneer--George Washington Bush. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In truth, the life of George Washington Bush has the makings of an exciting
novel or a Hollywood film. In 1975 it inspired a series of state-comissioned
paintings by one of the nation's best loved artists, Jacob Lawrence. But
the Bush story is still waiting adequate recognition. There is no statue
of him, that I know of, anywhere. This is a shame, because much of the drama
of George Washington Bush's life lay in what he overcame while making his
mark. He was seeking neither fame nor fortune, he was seeking respect. In
the nearly all-white pioneer West, George Washington Bush was black. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Much of Bush's early life is still wrapped in confusing accounts. It appears
most likely that he was born free, not slave, around 1790, the offspring
of a black West Indian sailor and an Irish maid in the home of a prosperous
Pennsylvania family. He was given some schooling and broad experience in
outdoor life. Despite a Quaker upbringing, Bush saw military service with
Andrew Jackson at New Orleans in 1815 and was wounded in the Black Hawk
Indian War. At some point in the 1820s he is said to have trapped and scouted
the West, all the way to Puget Sound. Back in the East, he married Isabella
James, a white woman from Tennessee, and raised a family of ten sons, six
of whom survived. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the 1830s Bush built a successful cattle business, first in Illinois
and then in Missouri. But he never was allowed to forget his skin color
or the lack of legal rights that resulted from it. Southern states practiced
slavery, of course, but even Northern states were passing anti-Negro laws.
Aged 50 or so, and determined not to live any longer as a second class citizen,
Bush in early 1844 helped organize and finance a wagon train to the new
Oregon Territory. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Along the perilous way West, Bush confessed to John Minto, a white friend,
that if he was not accepted in Oregon he would move on, possibly to California,
which was still governed by Mexico. When they arrived in Washougal, near
Fort Vancouver on the North shore of the Columbia, Bush found to his dismay
that the Oregon Provisional Government, too, had just enacted a Black Exclusion
Law. At least in theory, it barred him from residence, on pain of a flogging.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps in practice Bush would not have been mistreated under the anti-Negro
law. Yet it was plain that having come so far he would not tolerate a law
that did not tolerate him. To their everlasting credit, many of the whites
Bush had befriended on the wagon train, including Michael T. Simmons, later
founder of Tumwater, decided that if Bush could not settle in Oregon, neither
would they. In 1845, the Bush-Simmons party pushed along the Columbia River
by boat, then up the Cowlitz River and over foot trails into the densely
forested Puget Sound country Bush had explored years before. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Other pioneers described how the skillful Bush made his large frontier farm
prosper. Then he helped newer settlers to get through their first rough
winters, giving away the produce he couldn't sell. When smallpox ravaged
nearby Indian camps the Bushes reportedly took in some orphaned children
and raised them until they were old enough to return to their tribes. Bush's
benefactions also had a political effect, though he probably did not intend
it. By moving into contested territory and starting a permanent pioneer
community where the British Hudson's Bay Company had held sway, he helped
the United States to assert possession of what is now western Washington.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yet, ironically, Bush never obtained the elemental right to vote in the
nation he so critically assisted. He died in 1863, just after Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation, but before adoption of the equal citizenship
amendments to the Constitution. He did gain legal right to his own land
in 1855 after Congress granted a special petition from the new Washington
Territorial Legislature. Among other things, the petition pointed out that
Bush &quot;has contributed much towards the settlement of this Territory,
the suffering and needy never having applied to him in vain for succor and
assistance...&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It was his greatest triumph in combating racism that the struggle did not
make him bitter. It made him a humanitarian, admired by his fellow pioneers--and
respected. In Black History Month, when there are so many stories recounted
of distinguished African Americans from thousands of miles away, here is
an historical figure especially relevant to the Pacific Northwest. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Fortunately, the Thurston County Historical Commission is planning a small
Bush Family Interpretive Park, with an historical kiosk, at Bush Prairie,
a few miles from the state capitol in Olympia. If you'd like to contribute
to this over-due testimonial, you can reach the commission at 1-800-624-1234,
extension 5222. <BR>

<H1><CENTER>&quot;Mistrust&quot; of Political System Begins with Poor Education</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H4>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="starbar.gif" WIDTH="394" HEIGHT="19" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>Why is there so much &quot;mistrust&quot; of government and political
institutions? The University of Washington's Graduate School of Public Affairs
has been asking this question in a series of provocative public discussions
this winter. Many explanations are offered, including lack of sufficiently
stringent ethics reforms or, on the contrary, too many misguided reforms;
jaundiced media coverage of politics; the expanding and ubiquitous reach
of government that excites new opportunities for corruption; and, of course,
the obvious possibility that mistrust merely and fairly reflects the untrustworthy
behavior of the recent crop of politicians. Some commentators even think
that popular mistrust is purposely generated by interests who seek to discredit
government in order to halt the march of progressive social programs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Weighing these explanations makes for an interesting debate, but, upon reflection,
if I had to pick the most crucial contribution to public mistrust of government
it would be something more fundamental: poor civics education in high school
and college. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ignorance is a great breeder of indifference in almost any subject, from
sports to art to science--to politics. It is one short step then to disparagement
of the field of which one is ignorant. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
People who have studied the political process and taken part in it may become
irritated over some candidate or campaign, but they seldom express a lack
of interest, let alone cynicism, about the system itself. They know that
politics is a robust activity that we employ not because we prize its negative
attributes--from false promises to name-calling--but because we would rather
tolerate such annoyances in a democracy than have public decisions made
by dictators or mobs. Politics provides us choices; its unattractive competitive
features are among the smaller costs of freedom. But this understanding
seems lost on people who discount politics or damn its participants. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, a growing share of the indifferent and hostile are young
people. A study released last month from the University of California at
Los Angeles shows that college freshmen nationally are less interested in
politics now than at any time in at least thirty years. The proportion who
believe that &quot;keeping up with political affairs&quot; is important
has declined by half, from 57.8 percent in 1966 to 28.5 percent today. (You
can imagine how low the percentage would be for voting age youth who do
not attend college). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This study tracks well with voting turnout among eligible young voters,
18-21, which also has been sinking. It went up briefly in 1992, perhaps
partly in response to MTV's &quot;Rock the Vote&quot; campaign, but even
then it reached only 39.9 percent. A Peter Hart poll of 15-24 year olds
found little recognition of &quot;the duties and responsibilities of good
citizenship;&quot; only 12 percent mentioned political involvement of any
kind, including voting. There should be no doubt that ignorance, not some
sage sense of moral superiority, is the cause of this indifference. Objective
knowledge of public life has been in decline since the 1960s. A review of
&quot;studies conducted over the past 40 years&quot; by the (Los Angeles)
Times Mirror Center for People and the Press showed, for example, that &quot;young
people were 20 percent less likely than middle-aged people to give the correct
answer to 74 questions on current events.&quot; In contrast, until the late
1960s, the review noted, &quot;young Americans were as interested as their
elders in the large news events of their times.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The reports go on and on: high school students who can't find Japan on a
map; students who don't recognize the Bill of Rights. All demonstrate the
decline in instruction in civics, as well as geography, economics and history.
Sometimes the ignorance is almost sublime. An official at the Federal Elections
Commission advised me a few years ago that his office had been contacted
by high school students wondering where they could get information on the
Electoral College; they were thinking of applying for admission. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The blame for this--and it is blameworthy--lies with K-12 school boards
and universities that have undervalued instruction in the theory and practice
of citizenship, including politics. Almost any trendy social idea is placed
ahead of it. For example, later this month at the same University of Washington
that commendably sponsors the program on mistrust in politics, the faculty
once again will consider a proposal to require most students to take a course
in &quot;ethnic studies.&quot; Learning about other cultures in the world
is highly desirable, but ethnic studies too often is mainly about ideological
assaults on our own culture. One example at the UW is a course that treats
the first settlement of America as a &quot;holocaust&quot; that we &quot;unwittingly
celebrate each Thanksgiving.&quot; Here is trivialization, by comparison,
of the Nazi holocaust, compounded by an a-historical application of today's
political correctness to the 17th century. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, there is no requirement to study the system of self- government
that developed in this country over the four intervening centuries? But
can you justify requiring courses that debunk a system and a culture you
have not adequately explained on their own terms? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, in the common schools one sees a number of new textbooks that
error in their slighting accounts of the United States as badly as old texts
waxed fulsome in praise. Writing of a badly flawed federal government report
on curriculum standards that continues to downplay western democratic development,
Paul Gagnon asks recently inThe Atlantic , &quot;In what other country...are
students required to study other cultures but not their own?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Neglect of our democratic tradition in either high school or college defies
the very idea of public education. When the University of Virginia was founded
by Thomas Jefferson in 1818 it was expressly dedicated to teaching good
citizenship. The Jefferson-inspired &quot;Rockfish Gap plan&quot; that shaped
the UVA, and subsequently exerted its influence nationally, stated that
the first purposes of education are &quot;(t)o form the statesmen, legislators
and judges on whom public prosperity and individual happiness are so much
to depend.&quot; Jefferson also was an early voice for creating a public
education system through common schools, expressing his belief that the
very safety of our form of government required an educated citizenry capable
of responsible democratic participation. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even a dim reflection of the brilliant vision of a Jefferson would shine
a bright light on the &quot;mistrust&quot; of politics and government that
we presently experience.

    <TITLE>Legislature Must Master ABC's of School Reform</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<I>From Friday February 9, 1996 Seattle Post Intelligencer:<BR>
<BR>
</I>
<H1><CENTER>Legislature Must Master A-B-C's of School Reform </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<BR>
<HR>Passions over school reform are running high in this state and could
wind up splitting the ever wobbly majority of people who support education.
Properly channeled, however, the enthusiasm generated by proponents of two
initiatives--I-173, the school voucher proposition, and I-177, the public
charter schools proposition--could inaugurate a new age of educational progress.
The opportunity is in the hands of the present State Legislature. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The two education reform initiatives reflect a national movement to make
schools more accountable to parents. Many communities are happy with their
existing schools, but others--especially in urban areas--want at least a
chance for change. One solution, embodied in I-173, is to give each child's
parents a voucher equal to all or part of what the state would spend on
that child in a public school and let the parents decide whether to send
the child to a public school or a private (non-religious) school that meets
state requirements. Another approach, I-177, would allow parents and teachers
to set up state-chartered schools which students could attend as an alternative
to other public schools. The object here is to provide more autonomy for
schools and options for parents, but strictly within the public system.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Each approach has advantages and each is bound to draw great public support--and
opposition--when it appears on the fall ballot. Unfortunately, a statewide
survey by the respected Ellway Poll shows that public opinion not only is
divided over these proposals, but confused. A majority of voters like the
idea of more &quot;choice&quot; and &quot;competition&quot; in the schools.
Yet, as pollster Stuart Ellway notes, &quot;an overwhelming majority (also)
would rather focus the resources on the public schools than look to options
outside the public schools.&quot; The trouble is, charter schools, at least,
are public schools. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Confusion over the two school reform alternatives lands on top of another
little understood reform effort already underway. Since 1993, a legislatively
mandated Commission on Student Learning has been drawing up standards for
assessing curricula and student academic progress. Assuming that commission
members can contain the education bureaucracy's partiality for jargon and
cant, this is a highly desirable exercise. On the other hand, it is hard
to see how better standards and assessment by themselves can do the whole
job of education reform. In any case, these new standards are not expected
to be in place until 2000. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The business community has been a major proponent of improved standards
and assessments and, almost until this week, has tended to see such structural
reforms such as I-173 and I-177 as untimely distractions. Nonetheless, the
Washington Roundtable, an influential group of business executives, has
suggested that the Legislature &quot;Pursue comprehensive charter schools
legislation and support other innovations which (are) consistent with the
goals of education reform, require accountability for improving student
academic performance as required in HB1209 (the standards and assessment
law) and introduce greater parental choice......&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Initiative 177 does not mention the academic standards and assessment issue,
but the initiative drafters and their legislative allies have made it plain
that they have no objection to requiring charter schools to abide by such
standards. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rep. Brian Thomas (R-Issaquah) has authored a constructive compromise bill
(HB 2910) that incorporates this concept. Jim and Fawn Spady, the Seattle
parents who lead the charter school campaign, say they gladly will settle
for this bill if it is enacted and cease campaigning for their initiative.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, something that also purports to be a &quot;charter school&quot;
bill (SB 6765) is moving through the Senate. In fact, it is such a weak
bill that almost any local school board opposition to innovation could strangle
a charter school in its crib. Moreover, initially, only three charter schools
would be allowed in the whole Puget Sound Education Service District that
includes 300,000 students in Pierce and King Counties. It is charter school
reform for people who oppose charter school reform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So the state has a choice. The Legislature can deliberate, and then adopt
a genuine reform bill that the public will likely approve. Or it can abdicate
its responsibilities and leave the legislating on this important issue soley
to the voters. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Before the latter happens, all sides need to think through the consequences.
If either vouchers or charter schools is approved by the voters, the Legislature
and the education establishment that neglected them will see their prestige
sink through the floor. If both vouchers and charter schools are defeated,
major structural change in education might be stalled for 10 years. Another
generation will have been sacrificed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the powerful Washington Education Association might be well advised
to back a negotiated compromise, as did its counterpart in New Jersey. If
not, it stands to lose in the long run--regardless of whether it wins at
the polls next fall. By pouring precious dues-dollars into prevention of
any parent-empowering reform, the WEA will openly antagonize many voters
who in the past have supported school levies and higher teachers salaries.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Twenty states now have public charter school programs. Experiments with
vouchers, meanwhile, are disproving the canard that poor and minority students
will lose under structural reforms; in fact, poor urban neighborhoods are
the most eager for change. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Public support does not diminish with new information and debate about school
reform. It increases. You might say that's testimony to the power of education.

    <TITLE>Tax Cuts</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<B><I>From Seattle Post-Intelligencer Friday, February 2, 1996:<BR>
<BR>
</I></B>
<H1><CENTER>Cutting taxes can once again spur our economy </CENTER>
</H1>
<H3><CENTER>by <BR>
<I>Bruce Chapman </I></CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>How much of your income--or anyone's income--do you think governments
from all levels should take? In a recent Reader's Digest survey, Americans
of all backgrounds overwhelmingly selected the figure of 25 percent. In
truth, we already are far past that amount. Indeed, high taxes have become
one of the main reasons that Americans find it so hard to get ahead and
that the economy is so anemic. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But this is not a major theme in Washington, D.C. this winter. Democrats
and Republicans in Washington, D.C. are preoccupied over the budget, understandably
enough, and to the extent taxation is discussed at all, it usually is in
terms of the flat tax idea. But, though budgetary discipline is vital and
the flat tax concept is fascinating, the country also needs lower tax rates
overall. It was a lesson understood by Democratic President John F. Kennedy
in the 60s and Republican Ronald Reagan in the 80s. Their policies led to
booms. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Economists at the Business Leadership Council in Washington, D.C. are trying
to persuade politicians that it once more is economic growth--sparked by
tax reductions--that will best produce the revenue increases government
needs to achieve a balanced budget with minimal pain. Indeed, the Council
warned last month that failure to enact tax reform, along with spending
reductions, could tip the nation into a recession. A still more serious
downturn could follow early in the new century as the Baby Boom reaches
retirement age and starts taking more out of the U.S. Treasury than it puts
in. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Oh, but pain is necessary, say some economists. Let spending cuts do the
whole job of reaching a balanced budget. Besides, tax cuts would just make
the budget deficit bigger and widen the gap between the rich and the poor.
This is almost a journalistic mantra now. But in the present political environment
the Republicans cannot even get agreement on a budget that only reduces
the rate of growth in government spending, let alone one that would make
real cuts . For political as well as economic reasons, therefore, you cannot
expect to balance the budget solely through surgery. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To typical media political analysts like Elizabeth Kolbert of The New York
Times, however, insistence on lowering today's high tax rates to increase
revenues is just &quot;Alice-in-Wonderland optimism.&quot; In a recent profile
of presidential aspirant Steve Forbes, Kolbert states that &quot;when supply
side thinking was put to the test during the Reagan Administration, revenues
declined and staggering deficits were produced.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Statements like Kolberts' are as false as they are familiar. Tax revenues
did not decline in the Reagan years. From the time the Reagan budget constraints
and tax cuts took effect in 1982 and early 1983, they and the Federal Reserve's
tight money policies led to tremendous economic growth. For seven and a
half years, Treasury figures show, the average increase in federal revenues
was eight percent a year. Some &quot;decline,&quot; Ms Kolbert! <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Wall Street Journal editor Robert L. Bartley writes in his book Seven
Fat Years, &quot;(Federal Reserve Chairman) Volker's tight money killed
inflation (and) Reagan's tax cuts revived growth.&quot; 
<UL>
  <LI>The Gross Domestic Product grew 31 percent, the equivalent of adding
the whole economy of West Germany to our own; 
  <LI>The standard of living, as measured by disposable per capita income,
grew 18 percent; 
  <LI>Civilian employment grew 19.5 percent; * Manufacturing went up 48
percent, exports 92.6 percent. 
  <LI>Charitable giving, contrary to predictions, rose an average of 5.1
percent a year, as opposed to 3.5 percent annually during the previous quarter
century. 
</UL>
<BR>
Of course, these same years found a huge increase in spending on defense
and social programs. You may criticize some of those increases, but you
cannot lay responsibility for their contribution to the deficit on the Reagan
tax cuts! <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Deficits, in fact, were headed down at the end of the Reagan Administration.
They started back up under President Bush. In 1990, the Democratic Congress
cut a deal with Bush to increase income taxes, supposedly in return for
tighter controls on spending. But instead of shrinking the budget deficit,
these tax hikes helped precipitate a recession that increased the deficit.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eventually, you'd think people would recognize that you have to consider
the effects of taxation in terms of incentives and disincentives; that you
have to use dynamic analytical models, not static ones, to forecast the
effects of tax changes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, despite running for office in 1992 on the promise of a &quot;middle
class tax cut,&quot; Bill Clinton in office neglected to do so. Instead,
he raised taxes, albeit mainly on the upper middle class and rich. Meanwhile,
throughout the late 80s and early 90s, local and state governments also
raised taxes, sometimes steeply. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, many middle class families are in the 28-33 percent federal income
tax btracket, pay a total payroll tax of 15 percent (if you correctly count
the employer contribution with that of the employee), high state sales taxes
(8 percent and more in this state) and/or state income taxes, plus property
and excise taxes, and various fees. All told, the total amount surrendered
to government can approach 50 percent of income. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Do you think that in the difference between the 25 percent fairness ideal
that Americans cited in the Readers Digest survey and the 50 percent reality
that more and more people experience there might be some explanation for
the growing tax reform movement? <BR>

Nation Set for a &quot;Teach-in&quot; on Budget and Taxes </CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER>by </CENTER>
<H3><CENTER><I>Bruce Chapman</I> </CENTER>
</H3>
<HR>Most Americans are either bored or disgusted by the failure of Congress
and the President to reach agreement on a budget and tax program. But the
stakes are enormous and rightly demand more of our attention, not less.
The subject ultimately affects not only the stock market, but the whole
economy; indeed, the well-being of each American family. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, while the budget and tax story, on one level, is simple and
on another complex, most media coverage has focused on &quot;human interest&quot;
material that is mainly distracting. Thus, during the government shutdown
we had efforts to make a national crisis out of closed passport offices
and the difficulties of unpaid federal workers. Annoying inconveniences?
Yes. Occasional personal hardships, yes. Crisis? Forget it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A civil servant friend at the Education Department in Washington, D.C. was
stopped on the way out of her building by CNN. Would she &quot;go on camera&quot;
about the furlough? &quot;Yes,&quot; she said, &quot;but you won't like
what I have to say. Nobody I know is truly suffering, it's a vacation for
most and they all know they'll get their back pay soon enough. As for me,
I think the furlough is okay if it forces some economies in government.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
She was right; CNN did not want to hear that point of view and the reporter
and camera crew moved right along, searching for sob stories. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we ignore the media theatrics as well as the political personalities
that cloud this issue, we can see better what is going on. The United States
is facing a fairly straightforward problem. Government spending continues
to race ahead of revenues. Payments on the debt already soak up $300 billion
a year and the deficit is destined to get completely out of control as the
huge Baby Boom generation ages. If we do not reduce the rate of growth in
spending on Medicare and a host of lesser programs, from farm subsidies
to welfare, and increase the private sector savings rate, we cannot sustain
prosperity, let alone increase it. Taxes will stay up, interest rates will
rise, and ordinary people will have an even harder time getting ahead. Now,
when the economy is still strong, is the time to restrain the growth of
government spending and let revenues catch up. The alternative, even in
the short term? The Business Leadership Council in Washington, D.C. has
it right when it says that &quot;the Clinton budget stall may tip the economy
into a recession.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Republicans, as the party that believes in less government, understandably
find it easier to rise to this challenge than do Democrats, as the party
that tends to support more government. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, President Clinton long promised to provide a balanced budget,
even while denouncing the Republicans' proposals as &quot;extreme.&quot;
He even agreed to use for his calculations the famously cautious Congressional
Budget Office economic estimates. When he finally did offer his budget it
quickly was buried in controversy as deep as this week's East Coast snowdrifts.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The trouble is, the latest Clinton budget is big on theoretical savings
several years into the future and short on serious belt-tightening now.
Like St. Augustine in his days as a sinner, Mr. Clinton seems to be saying,
&quot;Lord, make me virtuous, but not just yet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
His overall cuts are a quarter under those of the GOP Congress. This former
governor and federalism advocate will not return welfare to the states under
a bloc grant; he won't cut the bloated farm program and he imagines that
the taxes U.S. businesses pay overseas can be taxed again as &quot;income&quot;
in this country without damaging American competitiveness. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The debate at this level, however, is complex because the numbers keep changing
as offers and counter-offers are made. When tax issues are placed in the
story, the whole subject becomes even harder to follow. At least there is
an American consensus now on the need to achieve a balanced budget in good
times, but there is no agreement on what level of taxation is best for the
economy, or most moral. Moreover, the tax proposals now on the table are
far too detailed to be examined briefly. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Politically, the more complex the better, so far as the Clinton Administration
is concerned. With remarkable skill, the President uses these complexities
to keep the spotlight off the budget itself and onto the supposedly &quot;cruel
and unusual punishment&quot; caused by Republican intransigence. It makes
for better TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But if the Republicans mostly have been losing the public relations battle,
they may be set to win the war. They already have changed the climate of
budget debate from a year ago and on some points they have obtained support
from even such usually liberal sources as the Washington Post and Cokie
Roberts of ABC. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Long debates do have educational value. That is why the Republicans and
cooperative Democrats have an opportunity to use the present presidential
primary season to undertake a national &quot;teach-in&quot; (to borrow a
60s phrase) on the subject of federal spending and taxes. Let C-SPAN serve
as national classroom. As people realize that the ordinary citizen's well-being,
opportunity and security are at stake, the struggle between the Congress
and the White House suddenly will not seem at all like politics as usual.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That's how the loss of the short term publicity battle may be converted
into a long term and historical victory for fiscal conservatism and economic
growth.

<H1><CENTER>The place to slow illegal Mexican immigration is in Mexico</CENTER>

</H3>
<HR>Oaxaca, Mexico--It is a distortion of politics that establishes separate
categories for domestic and international affairs. In fact, the categories
repeatedly merge. A good example is the current economic plight of Mexico
and, concurrently, the legislation before Congress to restrict illegal and
legal immigration. The interaction is profound.<BR>
<BR>
Mexico, like the United States and Canada (and several other countries,
for that matter), has a government that overspent for years, and now the
people are paying for it. But whereas you might say that the United States
has a fiscal cold and Canada the flu, Mexico is suffering from pneumonia.
Despite a more than 50 percent devaluation of the peso in the last year
and a $51 billion bailout program financed by the U.S., Mexicans continue
to endure a recession that in our terms would be a depression. If you think
the modest belt-tightening that the U.S. Congress has in mind for our government
is hard to bear--with a mainly theatrical government shutdown--imagine the
cutbacks taking place in Mexico. That economy is not just sluggish; the
GDP actually plunged 7 percent this past year. And there is no safety net.<BR>
<BR>
In this beautiful state 350 miles south of Mexico City, the graceful and
clean colonial city of Oaxaca (pronounced <I>Wa-ha-ca</I>), founded by the
Spanish almost five centuries ago, is rich in archeology, architecture,
music, cooking, handicrafts and a delectable climate (at 5,000 feet in a
tropical zone, neither air conditioning nor central heat is needed). It
has counted Mexico's greatest president, Benito Jaurez, and its longest
serving dictator, Porfirio Diaz, among its citizens.<BR>
<BR>
Scattered around the center city of some 350,000 are villages of &quot;idigenas,&quot;
descendants of Zapotec and Mixtec peoples who raised a high civilization
in the broad, rolling valley of Oaxaca a couple of thousand years before
the Aztecs, and then the Spaniards, conquered them.<BR>
<BR>
A 16th century Spanish monk with a genius for economic development later
organized each village around a different craft. In one village it was pottery,
in another carpets, in another textiles, and so on. To this day villages
pursue these same crafts, about as pure an assemblage of cottage industries
as one could find.<BR>
<BR>
But some of the very charms that make the Oaxaca valley so appealing--the
lack of fast food restaurants, for instance--also reflect the lack of modern
marketing and technology that could help lift the curse of poverty hereabouts.
It takes two days a week for women of the village of Teotitlan to fetch
the pure water they need for the all-natural dye process used in making
carpets--a tremendous waste of human capital. A closer source would help.<BR>
<BR>
Again, many of the fabrics and leather work produced in other villages are
lovely, but not much suited to export. As happened successfully a generation
ago in Thailand, a bit of design assistance would help turn these fine crafts
into greater commercial successes.<BR>
<BR>
Absent such advances, some of the already-poor people of the valley inevitably
turn their eyes north, especially during hard times. Nobody in Oaxaca knows
how many compatriots wind up in California or Texas, but the numbers are
large.<BR>
<BR>
If you said that much of the problem in Oaxaca and similar towns is lack
of far-sighted political leadership, you'd be right. The temptation for
authorities is to turn economic development over to their political cronies.
It's no wonder that the long-dominant political party (Partido Revolucionario
Institucional, or &quot;PRI&quot;) has been dislodged in recent Oaxaca municipal
elections and is growing wobbly at higher levels. Nationally, the PRI, founded
as the party of &quot;reform,&quot; now is the party in most need of reform.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, however, there is much that Americans can do to help Mexico--and
ourselves. First, the immigration bill before Congress will not stop the
kind of push felt from places like Oaxaca, and needs to be revised. The
U.S. surely has every right and good cause to control its borders and to
search out cases of immigration fraud. But to curtail <I>legal</I> immigration
sharply will not have any effect on the border. Instead it will damage the
ability of high tech companies like Microsoft to hire graduates from overseas
and US hospitals like the Fred Hutchinson Center to recruit specialized
doctors. <BR>
<BR>
What will work is more tourism in places like Oaxaca. That may sound naive,
but, in fact, tourism is by far the largest industry in Mexico. <I>Norteamericanos
</I>are welcome, the sights and experiences are inexpensive for us, and
our travel dollar puts tortillas on the table of even the poorest Mexicans.
Rampant tourism can trample culture, but Oaxaca shows it also can save culture
by giving it a stronger economic base.<BR>
<BR>
More importantly, when Americans visit a place like Oaxaca, many of them
fall in love--with the country. A retired American architect, for example,
divides his time between Connecticut and his new house in Oaxaca where he
has &quot;adopted&quot; a local blind man and his family of six. Two quiet
Seattle philanthropists, Bud and Judi Greer, along with other Puget Sounders,
have helped develop several orphanages elsewhere in Mexico and nearby countries
(with a Northwest Friends of the Orphans office in Bellevue) and have rescued
thousands of children. They also recently began a simple banking program
that assists villagers in starting small (we would say &quot;tiny&quot;)
businesses.<BR>
<BR>
Americans have such a tortured history with Mexico that we sometimes don't
want to give ourselves fair credit. There are a lot of well-meaning--and
adroit--Gringos working to prevent illegal immigration in the way that best
succeeds. They do so by helping their neighbors to achieve for themselves
what all of us want: dignity today and the promise of a better future.

Has the 21st Century Arrived?</TT></CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
It turns out that Jesus was really born about six B.C., not in the year
0, as you might expect. A sixth century monk named Dionysius Exiguus, who
was given responsibility for settling a dispute over the date of Easter,
miscalculated his account of Jesus' life and placed His birth about six
years late. This scholarly error, which was perpetuated in later calendars,
means that we already are in the 21st century, and, for that matter, in
the Third Millennium. <BR>
<BR>
There is a certain satisfaction in our unexpected arrival in the 21st century
and the new millennium, if only because it has caught the numerologists
off guard. It will be harder now for them to peddle their prognostications
when the merely nominal millennium rolls around. <BR>
<BR>
But the new century, if not the new millennium, already has begun intellectually,
too--and politically and culturally. Just as the fin de si&egrave;cle 100
years ago closed down the 19th century in a burst of fashionable despair
mixed with exciting new ideas about nature, man and society, we are now
witnessing rejection of many of the prevalent ideas of the 20th Century.
And again something new is coming onto the stage of history. <BR>
<BR>
What seems to be happening intellectually and politically is the cumulative
repudiation of the whole grim, pedantic, utopian, hedonistic-yet-moralizing,
centralizing, pyschologizing, determinist, reductionist, relativist, modernist
project of the 20th Century. And I say, good riddance! <BR>
What may replace it is a revitalized version of what used to be called the
liberal tradition of the West, facilitated by new science and new technology.
<H3><BR>
<BR>
The Case Against the 20th Century </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
Of course, there was some good to the 20th century, and some necessary change.
For example, we probably did need a civil service to replace the political
spoils system--though we later got carried away and let bureaucracies regulate
away many of our freedoms. We did need civil rights protection through central
government action in order, finally, to right the great wrong of slavery
and to fulfill the spirit of the Declaration of Independence. But the best
intellectual innovations of the 20th century were in the fields of science
and technology--medicine and communications, notably. Most of the others
were of lesser significance or were baneful. <BR>
<BR>
Not only did the 20th century bring us the scourges of fascism and communism,
but, to a lesser degree, it brought us what the Alexis de Tocqueville correctly
foresaw as the &quot;democratic tyrannies&quot; of socialism and the welfare
state. Specialization and expertise flourished, bringing great benefits
in some areas, but also contributing to the depreciation of the liberal
arts. Over-emphasis on expertise also tempted leaders in one field to claim
authority in others, which is always a moral usurpation. Some generalists,
in turn, claimed the label of science for arts and crafts that did not deserve
it. This holds true for several of the &quot;social sciences,&quot; but
especially for something that grandly calls itself &quot;political science.&quot;
Even economics claimed more scientific stature than it deserved, guided
by the late 20th century conceit that the qualitative can always be quantified.
What the experts and pseudo-experts did was separate ordinary people from
their government and culture, robbing their authority and undermining their
morale. <BR>
<BR>
Not only was the authority of representative democracy undermined, but so,
too, was God's. It was the century that popularized the &quot;God is Dead&quot;
movement and--professing &quot;science&quot; again--tried to free us from
what modernists considered the superstition of religion. We actually created
an official culture--not in Russia, but in the United States!--that frowns
on expressions of religious faith in public life. We even self-censor, making
faith a non-subject in leading private as well as public arenas. Most American
youth grow up without any grounding in religious faith, or take a naive
Sunday school faith into combat with sophisticated university debunkers.
<BR>
<BR>
We are a more materialist culture than ever before. But materialism itself
is deadening. It has created a great cyst of loss and sorrow in our collective
soul. <BR>
<BR>
Among elites, few are religious, or even seriously stoic. Instead, they
worship a kind of debonair high style, and, of course, they worship health.
For them, as Jackson Lears says in his history of advertising, salvation
equals peak performance in the bedroom, the bathroom and the boardroom (and,
one might add, the exercise room). <BR>
<BR>
But isn't it odd that this age of materialism has seen such an efflorescence
of real superstitions? They range from New Age channelers to cable channel
psychics charging $4 a minute. <BR>
<BR>
Spiritual demoralization -- the loss of moral bearings and morale -- affects
the way we raise families and conduct our work. The professions today, especiallay
law, medicine and teaching, already are infected by demoralization. So is
journalism, which adopts cynicism as a reflexive attitude. In turn, &quot;all
this cynicism has permeated society,&quot; says Queens University Professor
George Rawlyk in the Vancouver Sun, &quot;and caused people to lose faith
in institutions.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
Politics is definitely demoralized. Bureaucrats and experts--including that
strange breed, the professional &quot;ethicist&quot;--have trod on the cord
of responsibility that links the elected official to the electorate. More
worrisome, young people know almost nothing of the system of representative
democracy and therefore are bored with it, when they are not disgusted.
<H3><BR>
<BR>
The False Promise of &quot;Reform&quot; </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
The so-called &quot;reform movement,&quot; once volunteer, but now professionalized,
aims to take the politics out of politics and replace it with juicy personal
scandals or mere titillating innuendo. Whereas the communists said the political
is personal, which made the state's role tyrannous, the present-day reformer
says the personal is political--and transforms the private gossip of politics
into subjects of public litigation. That is distracting, and it, too, can
become tyrannous. <BR>
<BR>
Over-regulating human life -- including public life -- destroys liberty.
When the laws governing politics become so voluminous and complex that no
one even knows whether he is in compliance or not, a candidate or office-holder
is at the mercy of anyone who investigates him. This is always the irony:
the more laws and regulations you have, the more inevitable lawbreaking
becomes. And, because everyone can be found to have broken some law, the
decision as to whom to prosecute becomes--once more--arbitrary. Yet it was
to resist the power of arbitrary authority that the rule of law was established.
<BR>
<BR>
When the current political reform movement gained sway about 25 years ago,
it was with the promise of restoring confidence in government. (I know,
I was a part of it.) But, all surveys show that public confidence actually
has fallen during the very period when reform laws have been enacted. <BR>
<BR>
Reform has become just another political weapon. Our experience is thus
an extreme recapitulation of the earlier reform period, the Progressive
Era, 100 years ago. Also starting with high ideals, a number of the progressives
ultimately descended into false and exaggerated accusations and personal
abuse of power. Theodore Roosevelt, himself a reformer, gave us the term
&quot;muckraker,&quot; borrowed from the low-visioned Man with the Muckrake
in Pilgrim's Progress. He could have been speaking of our own time when,
on another occasion, he remarked, &quot;Whoever said that 'Patriotism is
the last refuge of a scoundrel' had not considered the possibilities of
'reform.'&quot; 
<H3><BR>
<BR>
Birth of 20th Century Thinking </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
From where did the past century get such curious reversals of virtue and
vice? Well, much of the force of 20th century modernism, for good and ill
alike, developed from industrial era science and industrial era ideas. Without
succumbing to over-generalization, one can still point to telling patterns,
especially in the work of the great thinkers of the later 19th and early
20th centuries, and of their followers, whose influence still is with us.
Chief among them: Karl Marx, Frederick Nietzsche, Sigmund Freud, Charles
Darwin and Albert Einstein. <BR>
<BR>
Through such thinkers, science, which really did accomplish great things
in the past century, also was misused to create the materialist culture:
atheistic, relativist, and cynical about personal virtue, yet blithely prepared
to build a New Society. Marx, for example, gave us the term &quot;dialectical
materialism,&quot; the priority of matter over mind. He taught class warfare
as a just pursuit and assailed bourgeois morality. Like most social engineers,
he created a system where everyone was exposed as self- interested, except,
of course, for himself and his favorite abstraction, the workers. <BR>
<BR>
Nietzsche taught us the &quot;will-to-power,&quot; the claims of self-expression
and moral relativism beyond good and evil. On the extreme right he inspired
the Nazis. And yet he also was the progenitor of the New Left and the hippies
in the 1960s. Nietzsche taught that there is no God, but that you can be
a god. From deconstruction in academia to the cynicism of the media, his
effects seem as strong as ever today. <BR>
<BR>
Freud was another brilliant, single-minded simplifier whose perspective
reflected the industrial era in which he lived. To him, a person is like
a steam engine, full of tensions that have to be released--thrusting pistons
and opposing forces. It wasn't just his emphasis on sexuality that was exaggerated,
but also his willingness, and that of his followers, to misapply their gifted
insights into mental disorders to a wide range of other fields, including
religion, war, history, philosophy, art and literature. <BR>
<BR>
So far, Darwin has stood the test of time better. But the uses to which
his ideas have been put are another matter. He never wanted to apply natural
selection to human society, and yet, far right and left both made bold use
of Darwin's ideas to do just that. From Social Darwinism to National Socialism
to the view of man as a soulless animal, Darwinism has been used to justify
complete disregard of the poor, on one hand, and the practice of eugenics
and euthanasia on the other. How instructive it is that the little metal
fish symbols some Christians stick on their autos are now mocked on other
autos by little metal amphibians with &quot;Darwin&quot; written on them!
<BR>
<BR>
Einstein was locked into relativity (which, of course, is not to be confused
with relativism), a theory that explained certain relationships between
time and space, matter and energy. Einstein wanted physical laws that would
hold true anywhere. Most of his discoveries were made before 1906 and he
spent the rest of his life trying to disprove the uncertainty principle
at the foundation of quantum theory-still seeking a mechanistic explanation
for the universe. But he failed. What Heisenberg, Planck and, more recently,
Richard Feynman, revealed is that atoms cannot be deterministically defined,
and that at the heart of every atom are mysterious and infinite waves. In
other words, matter doesn't matter--at least not as much as we thought.
<BR>
<BR>
But if materialism, even in physics, no longer prevails how can it possibly
be used, as Marx and several other industrial-era thinkers (or their followers)
attempted, to define the life of the human mind and the organization of
society? 
<H3><BR>
<BR>
The Return of Freedom </H3>
<BR>
<BR>
The answer is that it cannot, and the good news is that this intellectual
realization is beginning to affect our social and political life. As much
as anything, the technological revolution that is built on the science of
quantum physics and probability theory, makes this clear. The silicon chip,
the computer, software, fiber optics, and wireless telephony are among the
great triumphs of mind over matter. The Industrial Age thus has given way
to the Information Age. The effects are seen not only in communications,
but in the broad economy, where work is being decentralized and personalized
and where intellectual property now competes in value with physical property.
<BR>
<BR>
The information revolution helped topple the Soviet Union, which could not
compete with American high technology and could not tolerate the openness
resulting from computers. Indeed, it could not resist the force of the new
technology in part because communism is a rigid, centralized, industrial-era
system. But the USSR and other command economies and political systems are
not the only ones threatened by the new information freedom model. So are
almost all overly centralized, bureaucratic organizations that operate the
way they did in industrial times. <BR>
<BR>
The revolution is now beginning to shake the earth under the U.S. federal
government. And other levels of government. And great universities. And
even the public school system. It is affecting our thinking about transportation
and the future of cities. <BR>
<BR>
New technologies are &quot;only&quot; tools, of course, but history shows
that once man creates new tools, the new tools tend to reshape the way man
lives. <BR>
<BR>
They surely will overthrow the contemporary version of television, the last
great example of industrial age technology. TV broadcasts from a central
point where all the power resides. It, too, is a top-down power structure.
You take what you get, and what you get is standardized, because it must
appeal to the lowest common denominator of a mass audience. The new technology
that is about to take its place- -including especially what George Gilder
calls the &quot;teleputer&quot;--will be interactive as well as multi-media.
It is a bottom-up power structure, liberated from the center, and free of
the potential for Orwellian propaganda controls found in industrial-era
communications. <BR>
<BR>
Leftists would have you believe it is elitist; it is not. You, as user,
will control it, selecting exactly what you want and when you want it. Videoconferencing,
family gatherings in cyberspace, new ways to learn exactly at the pace suitable
for you or your child, and choices tailored to what is individual and distinctive
about you: All these are designed to serve your own interests and pursuits,
not those prescribed for you. They will connect you to others near and far
who share those interests--say, pre-Columbian art or gardening or learning
a foreign language. Already the Internet is providing alternative sources
of political action and news. Some critics think it threatens to bring us
mass direct democracy, unscreened from temporary passions and runaway enthusiasms.
I believe it is more likely to help restore the authority of representative
democracy. <BR>
<BR>
The new communications technology both reflects the disintegration of materialist
assumptions and contributes to that disintegration, so the process is robust.
Nonetheless, we will long have to deal with the cultural and political detritus
left over from the collapse of the materialist dispensation. <BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, it is exactly among the educated elites that ideas of materialism
took strongest hold and it is also within those quarters that confusion
and uncertainty-- demoralization--is greatest. But the average citizen,
never having drunk as deep at the well of 20th century ideology as did the
elites, is not as ill-prepared for the 21st century. Ordinary people, surveys
show, still believe in God, still believe in objective right and wrong,
still credit common sense, human nature and a Jeffersonian, rather than
a deconstructionist, understanding of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
They even persist in the benighted, pre-20th century view that art has something
to do with beauty and truth. As the late Christopher Lasch put it, the early
20th century writer and critic Ortega y Gasset's fear has been proven wrong;
the &quot;masses&quot; did not revolt against western civilization, only
the elites did. <BR>
<BR>
And now many people seem to be revolting against the whole soft tyranny
of modernism. This is really the 18th and 19th century liberal tradition
reasserting itself for the 21st century. <BR>
<BR>
The term &quot;liberalism&quot; here, of course, is not the left fork that
political liberalism took in this century, but the older understanding of
a free and civil society--with its institutions of representative democracy,
limited government and freedom from arbitrary rule, belief in progress,
tolerance, emancipation from dogma, and individual rights coupled with personal
responsibility--all tutored by civic virtue. This tradition rebelled against
a state church, but in this country almost always presupposed a divine order.
<BR>
<BR>
This classical liberal tradition was the consensus tradition of the United
States, distinguishing us from the Old World order. As Thomas Jefferson
proclaimed after the bitter election of 1800, &quot;We are all federalists
and we are all republicans.&quot; In the 1950s this point was observed again
by the so-called &quot;consensus school&quot; of historians, including Louis
Hartz and Richard Hofstaedter. It was a point that Francis Fukuyama made
in his essay, &quot;The End of History,&quot; a few years ago. <BR>
<BR>
The old liberal tradition moves forward in harmony with the individualist,
free-market drive of the information revolution. It is in harmony, also,
with government's appropriate functions, so it does not reflexively denigrate
public service. It is the tradition so despised today by campus reactionaries
on the left, steeped as they are in the paradoxically anti-Western influence
of such Western rebels as Marx and Nietzsche. The liberal tradition survives
such assaults precisely because it is open and ready to learn from other
cultures. In this, it looks back to the rich moral and intellectual resources
of the liberal arts. <BR>
<BR>
Traditionally, the liberal arts have consisted of language, philosophy,
history, literature, mathematics and abstract science. These subjects help
a man or woman to reflect upon how to live one's life, how to learn and
to interpret change. In the information age, these subjects are more precious
than ever. For now, when one opts out of a liberal education and into mere
professionalism or tradecraft, he is both likely to find himself impoverished
mentally and rendered obsolescent by constantly changing technology. <BR>
<BR>
It is quite possible that we already have hit bottom in the disregard of
the liberal arts and are beginning to look up. A recent report, for example,
shows the study of the classics increasing on college campuses. At 28,000
students, classics enrollment is higher than it has been in almost 30 years.
The classics teach not only the dead languages of Latin and Ancient Greek,
but also the history and philosophy of the Greeks and Romans, and those
works are as vital as ever. Happily, they can betaught today with the aid
of CD- Roms. <BR>
<BR>
At the moment, what is called conservatism is the political movement most
congenial to revival and restatement of the liberal tradition for the 21st
century. One sees this in those state capitols where governors are exploring
new ways to hook social and economic policies to human nature rather than
to abstract, welfare-state ideals. One sees it in Congress where House Speaker
Newt Gingrich refuses to adhere to the barbarian caricature of his adversaries
but pursues a coherent and old/new fashioned restatement of the goals of
limited government--and with panache as well as vision. <BR>
<BR>
But, obviously, this great seachange cannot be confined to any one party,
let alone one figure. Many nominally on the political left today are intrigued
by the possibilities that new intellectual understandings and new technologies
can improve public policy in unanticipated ways. Indeed, they are influenced
by today's intellectual currents on the right in the same way, for example,
that the right in earlier times was influenced by the Progressive Era and
the New Deal. <BR>
<BR>
Regardless, much that until recently was unthinkable is now on the table.
We used to describe someone as &quot;so conservative he wants to privatize
the Post Office.&quot; Today, in the age of overnight courier services,
FAX machines and E- mail, privatization is taking place with hardly any
one noticing. Twenty years ago you could not find mention of the word &quot;privatization&quot;
in the lexicon of public policy. Now the loose consensus on the value of
privatizing many government activities stretches from the Republican right
to Chicago's Democratic Mayor Richard Daley. The call for decentralization
comes from governors of both parties. Democratic senators such as Bennett
Johnston (LA) and Wendell Ford (KY) join Slade Gorton (WA) and Dirk Kempthorne
(ID) in calling for the Endangered Species Act to be rewritten. Even President
Clinton indicates support for revisions, if not repudiation, of affirmative
action, and finds a whole host of leading black intellectuals, such as Thomas
Sowell, Shelby Steele, Stephen Carter, and Glenn Loury already there. <BR>
<BR>
When one side of the political spectrum starts to embrace the positions
and policies of the other, something profound is happening, not only to
politics but to the culture. <BR>
<BR>
I suggest that what is beginning to happen is the restoration of a noble
and correct view of the world. When Aristotle wrote his Politics and his
Ethics, he defined a way to determine what is good--the Golden Mean between
&quot;excess&quot; and &quot;defect.&quot; In specific application of those
absolute standards to a particular principle, however, man was to look to
consequences as well as to means, and employ prudence, the virtue of good
judgment. When it came to public philosophy, Jews and Christians found common
ground in such a moral philosophy, and undergirded it with revelation. Indeed,
as C.S. Lewis wrote, you do not requirereligion to find that common ground,
or, as he called it, the Tao. For God gave man reason, and through that
reason, most civilizations apprehend the Tao. 
<H3><BR>
<BR>
Untangling the Materialist Mind </H3>
<BR>
It wasn't simply materialism that failed, but utopianism, which is its contradictory
and yet complementary twin. The materialist/relativist tells us that there
are no normative standards; for example, the definition of a &quot;family&quot;
is anything you want it to be. (After all, you have your &quot;values&quot;
and I have mine.) The utopian impulse in the same modernist mind is much
sterner. When it comes to endangered species or product liability or sexual
harassment, it dictates absolute purity of means, as well as purposes. Thus,
on one hand, we have moral vagueness, and, on the other, rigidly moralistic
emphasis on processes. What both of these superficially dissimilar modernist
impulses--which normally co-habit--have in common is that neither looks
very much at consequences. <BR>
<BR>
In contrast, for the founders of the liberal tradition, the Greeks, the
object in politics as in life was not the triumph of one interest or one
consideration, but the balance, the harmony, of interests and considerations.
<BR>
<BR>
The American Founders also clearly stood in that line. The great goal of
the 21st Century, following the classical liberal tradition, is to recover
that sense of harmony in life--the sacred and the practical, private virtue
and civic virtue, and the personal in balance with the political.<BR>

</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Current welfare debate revolves almost exclusively around the
question of how to motivate young women to get off, or stay off, the dole.
Completely ignored are the young men in their lives, except as they are
identified as candidates for child support. Yet establishing the conditions
that will encourage young men to marry the women who bear their children-and
for young women to accept them as husbands-is the central challenge of social
policy today, according to Discovery Senior Fellow George Gilder.<BR>
<BR>
Current laws and regulations are biased against family formation and have
created a blighted underclass, Gilder says. However, even today's reformers
continue to think the problem is simply one of impelling young mothers to
forgo child-bearing or to get a job if they already have children.<BR>
Fortunately, Gilder's view is about to re-enter the debate through publication
of a revised version of <I>Visible Man, </I>his 1978 book edited by Midge
Decter. The book<I> </I>tells the true story of Sam, a black youth of the
Albany ghetto, and the women in his disconnected life. In a tribute to Ralph
Ellison's classic <I>Invisible Man</I>, Gilder portrays the Sams-the <I>Visible
Men</I> of the American inner city - as the all-too conspicuous victims
of government policy, as well as the frequent victimizers of society. Black
males' income is actually below that of black females', so is educational
attainment, and black males are the only demographic group in American to
suffer a declining life expectancy rate in 1994.<BR>
<BR>
The problem, Gilder insists, is not racism, but a failure of government
policy at all levels to reward family life and to discourage deviations
from it.<BR>
The tragedy of Sam is compounded by the passage of time, Gilder notes in
his new introduction to the book. A young man with several illegitimate
offspring when he appears in <I>Visible Man</I>, Sam is now, 17 years later
most likely a grandfather.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Visible Man, </I>billed as a &quot;true story of post-racist America,&quot;
originally sold only 800 copies, though it has become a kind of cult book
for close Gilder readers. Its insights helped inform Gilder's following
book, <I>Wealth and </I>Poverty, which became a world-wide best seller (500,000
copies) and, in revised form, is still in print from ICS Press. (Copies
are available through Discovery's office.)<BR>
This spring Discovery plans to co-publish <I>Visible Man </I>with ICS Press,
placing the original Sam in the context of all that has been learned-and
all that politicians, academics, journalists and philanthropists have failed
to learn-since the first version. </BLOCKQUOTE>

CALLED &quot;A MUST READ&quot;</CENTER>
</H3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>If members of Congress are not already up to their armpits in
alligators, they soon will be (along with California gnatcatchers, spotted
owls and burying beetles), for the Endangered Species Act (the ESA) is coming
up for the first serious review since the controversial bill was passed
a generation ago. And suddenly gliding deep into the political maelstrom
is <I>Noah's Choice: The </I>Future of Endangered Species (Knopf, N. Y.),
the powerful new book by Discovery Senior Fellow Mark L. Plummer and Charles
C. Mann.<BR>
<BR>
Publication date is February 25, but the book already is attracting eager
interest. &quot;Must read&quot; is the pre-publication judgment of the <I>Kirkus
Review</I>, a journal used by bookstore owners and newspapers assignment
editors, while <I>Publisher's Weekly</I> calls the book &quot;timely, provocative
and reasonable.&quot; Sen. Slade Gorton, who read the book immediately after
his re-election campaign and is a leader on the endangered species debate
nationally, says<I> Noah's </I>Choice is &quot;written with the drama and
emotional impact of a novel. It will make a wonderful contribution to the
debate over how best to steward our natural heritage,&quot; he wrote for
a dust jacket endorsement. &quot;It shows, compassionately and wisely, how
we should weigh values when none can be met in their entirety.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Word apparently is travelling, because other Congressional offices and journalists
have begun asking for advance copies of the book. An article derived in
part from the book graces the cover of the current <I>Audubon</I> magazine,
and other pieces will appear shortly in <I>Science</I> and <I>The Atlantic
</I>Monthly. Discovery Institute and the publishers, Alfred A. Knopf, New
York, will introduce the book in Washington at a press conference and reception,
tentatively scheduled for February 28. A later book party will be held in
Seattle, and the two authors will make appearances in various other cities.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Noah's Choice</I> has been in preparation for three years, with research
taking the authors coast to coast, from limestone caves to sand dunes. During
the last year and a half Discovery Institute has built several conferences,
seminars and dinner forums around the endangered species topic, with attendees
ranging from members of Friends of the Earth to the Wise Use movement, with
government and industry representation as well. Besides Mark Plummer, participating
Discovery Fellows have included former Congressman John R. Miller, whose
<I>Policy Review </I>article on the topic has been widely disseminated,
and Albert Gidari, Jr., author of several scholarly legal monographs on
the constitutional difficulties of the ESA. (See article in box.)<BR>
<BR>
One reason for the broad appeal of <I>Noah's Choice</I> is its manifestly
even-handed account of endangered species and of human beings forced to
deal with the consequences of the draconian Endangered Species Act. More
controversial are sure to be the book's stern prescriptions, which entail
a major rewriting of the act - to share the burden of conservation more
equitably between individual land owners and society at large and to shift
the law's focus from punitive legal sanctions to voluntary incentives.<BR>
<BR>
Nobel prize winning economist Robert M. Solow of M.I.T., reviewing the book,
praised it as &quot;knowledgable, thoughtful and sympathetic.&quot; He expressed
hope that &quot;it may help keep rationality from becoming an endangered
species too.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Plummer and Mann collaborated on an earlier book, <I>Aspirin Wars</I>, and
have been personal freinds since a childhood shared in Bellevue, WA. Mann,
a contributing editor of <I>The Atlantic</I>, now lives in Western Massachusetts,
while Plummer resides in Seattle. </BLOCKQUOTE>

Summary</I> </H4>
America needs passenger rail service as an economical and ecological alternative
to endless road and airport construction. Unfortunately, Amtrak cannot (and
probably should not) survive as it is presently structured and funded. Perpetuating
the status quo will burden America with a lame, government-run passenger
operation, limping along on the nation's freight rail rights-of-way, operating
under outdated federal rules from its 1970 authorization, and surviving
on Congressional handouts. <BR>
<BR>
But, the solution is not to throw Amtrak on the market, accepting whatever
happens. What would happen is, Amtrak would die. The proper course is to
reorganize the system, privatizing whatever can be privatized, building
new public-private alliances and compacts around the set of rail corridors
that link cities 100-500 miles apart-which is the functional core of the
national system-and then reconnecting this reorganized nation system to
other forms of transportation to create a true intermodal passenger network.
<BR>
<BR>
But before dealing with Amtrak, we need to understand its true circumstances.
Since its birth in 1971, Amtrak has been a neglected stepchild. The government
had no interest in its success. Neither did the freight railroads, over
whose tracks it ran. Labor made certain Congress burdened it with uneconomical
work rules; politicians picked the routes; bureaucrats ran the place like,
well, a bureaucracy. In retrospect, the wonder is that Amtrak succeeded
as well as it did. <BR>
<BR>
Amtrak's 1994 fiscal crisis coincided with the rise of budget cutting as
a national political priority. Following the election of the new Republican
Congress in November 1994, Amtrak's new president, Tom Downs, tried to adjust
to this priority, cutting 22% of its train miles and 1500 employees and
developing new, flexible strategic business units. Unable by themselves
to save the system, these measures did help reduce the financial crisis,
while improved marketing and a few new routes actually led to a small increase
in ridership. The cuts also alerted ordinary people to the value of passenger
train service. As a consequence, a number of states have offered subsidies
or have committed revenues to help save local service. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Presently, the unwillingness of many Congressmen to buck the opposition
to reform from the rail labor unions, the trial lawyers and commuter rail
states led Rep. Bud Shuster, Chairman of the House Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure to declare, &quot;Amtrak is dead.&quot; His pronouncement
may prove to be prophetic, but it is premature. Amtrak's continuing financial
crisis still can be turned into an opportunity if the public's interest
is sustained and if a government reform process can be formalized. Toward
that end, Discovery Institute proposes the following measures: &#183; 
<UL>
  <LI>Approve three years of interim Amtrak operating support, tied to a
firm schedule for transition to a new system. &#183; 
  <LI>Pass a comprehensive Amtrak Privatization and Revitalization Act that
gives management power to eliminate all costs that do not improve service.
This will lift prohibitions against contracting out services, repeal excessive
labor provisions and resolve the legal liability questions between freight
and passenger rail.. &#183; 
  <LI>Establish a public-private commission to develop a new national system.
This Rail Alliance for Passenger Services (RAPS) will analyze proposals
for privatizing various corridors. These proposals should come from compacts
among local and state governments, private entrepreneurs, and the freight
railroads over whose tracks the passenger trains run. 
</UL>
<BR>
It is vital that the freights become stakeholders in passenger service.
RAPS will seek ways to upgrade passenger service, infrastructure, technology
and safety. And, RAPS will study development of a truly intermodal passenger
system, closely linking rail to bus service, airports, ferries and other
modes of transportation, with coordinated ticketing. At the end of this
period RAPS will recommend which corridors become part of the new National
Passenger Rail System, and will preside over the transition. <BR>
<BR>
The new National Passenger Rail System will be composed of corridors in
every region of the country, with a national organization setting safety
and service standards. To help justify the cost of long distance trains
that make the national system truly national and which assure service to
rural areas where air service is often lacking, passenger trains should
be allowed to carry mail and packages once more. Further, as in the National
Highway System, there should be a Federal commitment to provide infrastructure
capital-possibly through states and interstate compacts. After all, the
government provides the roads and airports over which the trucking and air
transport industries operate. Indeed, given the congestion in many parts
of the country and the ecological harm inherent in road and airport expansion,
passenger rail may turn out to be one of the bigger transportation bargains
in the federal budget. Why are we in this situation? 
<H4><I>A Little History </I></H4>
<BR>
The United States has not always neglected its railroads. Far from it. In
the 19th century, railroads were closely allied with the government. Land
grants, state loan programs, and other subsidies facilitated rapid expansion.
By the 1890s, indeed, the so-called Rail Barons had achieved incredible
influence and wealth, and some railroads employed more people and took in
more money that the government itself. But power and arrogance triggered
trust-busting and aggressive regulation. The railroads found themselves
fighting against an intermittently irate government, while the press and
populist politicians inflamed voters. <BR>
<BR>
Once the railroads' servile ally, government eventually became their effective
enemy in an era of social experimentation, imposing stifling regulation
and unnecessarily costly labor rules. All rates, routes and service were
under the rigid control of the Interstate Commerce Commission. Shippers
became a privileged class in commerce. Railroad workers received a special
Federal retirement program, a Federal unemployment program, and a Federal
tort-based workers compensation program. <BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, railroads often headquartered in far-away cities saw their rights-of-way
become targets for ever-increasing taxation revenues by state and local
governments. <BR>
<BR>
But even as government presided over the slow strangulation of the railroads,
it began starry-eyed love affairs with the automobile and the airplane.
Upon creation of the Highway Trust Fund and under the general guidance of
the Bureau of Roads in Washington, DC, a great bureaucratic auto constituency
was built in the states. The motor industry and its allies saw the government
as a potential partner, and one of the most powerful lobbies in history
was created. General Motors, the trucking industry, asphalt producers, road
contractors, dealerships, and the American Automobile Association (AAA)
became the &quot;Road Gang&quot; that worked effectively through the Association
of State Highway Officials (AASHO) and the Congress. A similar combination
of &quot;Airmen&quot; pressed for airports in every community and for a
fail-safe air traffic control system. <BR>
<BR>
A bi-partisan political team transformed America. Many of the results benefited
the average citizen and community, but rail transportation was left out
of the new dispensation. Private railroad operators found that cars, buses,
trucks and airplanes operating over government-funded superhighways and
aviation infrastructure became virtually unbeatable. The economic and social
effects were tremendous as cities emptied and people and industry moved
to the suburbs. Freight and passengers were increasingly diverted from the
rail beds to the interstate freeways and the airports. <BR>
<BR>
By 1980, the competition seemed to be over. Much of the railroad industry
was insolvent. Salvaging passenger rail was beyond the capabilities of private
companies. Led by the once mighty Penn Central, Northeast railroads tumbled
into receivership one after the other, followed in the Midwest by the Rock
Island and the Milwaukee Road. At the low point, 25% of America's railroads
were bankrupt, with the Chicago North Western, Illinois Central and Southern
Pacific nearly so. Rail market share continued to fall; debt was staggering,
the physical system was breaking down. A national system failure was probable.
Liquidation or nationalization were serious alternatives. <BR>
<BR>
From the beginning, saving the freight lines received top priority. Passenger
service was an afterthought. The first step toward recovery came in 1971
when Congress created Amtrak as a relief measure for freight railroads.
In 1973, Congress authorized a Northeast rail restructuring process and
a rebuilding of the freight infrastructure that produced Conrail. Congress
then authorized some repayable loans directed primarily at rebuilding midwest
freight lines. The Staggers Act of 1980 eliminated decades of over-regulation
and freed the freights to compete. Profitability soon followed. Unfortunately,
over in the new public sector, service did not fare as well. <BR>
<BR>
It need not have been this way. Although passenger service had been deteriorating
for a half century, experiments in the depths of the Great Depression had
demonstrated that revival was possible. In 1930, Ralph Budd, president of
the Burlington Railroad and his ally, railcar maker Edward Budd (no relation),
committed massive capital to high-speed, light-weight, state-of-the-art
rail technology. In a few years, modern diesel engines were pulling art-deco,
air-conditioned cars at over 100 miles per hour. Consumer response was enthusiastic
and profitable. American passenger trains, such as the California Zephyr
and the Santa Fe Chief, were the best in the world. During World War II,
passenger and freight railroading boomed. <BR>
<BR>
At war's end, the country had a great opportunity to create a balanced transportation
system that included rail. But the government chose to subsidize rail's
air and automobile competitors. Perhaps no one fully understood the long-term
implications for America. Western Europe and Japan, on the other hand, committed
to balanced systems and today enjoy high speed and, in some cases, profit-making
passenger rail operations. <BR>
<BR>
In 1971, the U.S. government finally committed to maintaining passenger
rail. In an exceedingly thoughtless law, no attention was given to restoring
American rail passenger service to a world standard. While Europe and Japan
invested billions in passenger rail to create true modal balance, Congress
directed Amtrak to become a self-sufficient, independent passenger operation.
Government funding was always minimal and no long-term capital commitment
was planned. The results of this policy are now apparent. <BR>
<BR>
The Amtrak Act created several counter-productive conditions. A government-owned
(and ill-financed) passenger system now operated over privately-owned tracks
and infrastructure-the exact opposite of the air and automobile and trucking
systems, where privately owned vehicles utilize government-provided facilities.
Further, the freights had no self-interest in seeing Amtrak succeed, since
the government paid them less-than-market rents for the use of their facilities.
Amtrak trains interfered with the freights' own operations and created unwelcome
insurance and liability problems. They agreed to the arrangement only as
a way of getting passenger service off their backs. Since the establishment
of Conrail, the freights have concentrated on their own core businesses.
<BR>
<BR>
Amtrak never really had a chance. The government didn't care and the private
entrepreneurs were out of the game. And, from the beginning, the Amtrak
Board was dominated by the Department of Transportation. Increasingly, Amtrak
behaved like a government bureaucracy. Middle management, with no incentives
and salaries capped by Congress, became rigid. There was continuous rancor
between management and the 16 rail labor unions, making highest quality
service impossible. The Washington, D.C.-based bureaucracy was nearly blind
to potential state and local community efforts for rail improvement. Further,
Amtrak inherited an ancient fleet and received little capital for modernization.
<BR>
<BR>
Both the Reagan and Bush administrations thought that Amtrak should be zero-funded.
In fact, Amtrak survived largely because senators and congressmen protected
trains running through their districts, enabling Amtrak President Graham
Claytor to maintain limited subsidies. Unfortunately, this meant that Congress
effectively controlled the national route system, which it froze in place
regardless of growing route losses. Congress became a de facto Board of
Directors, albeit a Board that paid attention to Amtrak's business only
sporadically. Statutory labor protection continued to guarantee Amtrak employees
up to six years' salary if they were moved more than thirty miles because
of a route change. Contracting car maintenance or any element of the passenger
operation to lower cost providers was forbidden by Federal law and union
contract. <BR>
<BR>
Under the circumstances, it is remarkable that, for many years under Claytor,
Amtrak arrived as well as it did. A good system was built in the Northeast
Corridor, and new rail cars were acquired. For a period, ridership improved,
creating an illusion that all was well. But decline could not be staved
off forever. By 1994, with a recession and fare wars in the airline industry,
ridership fell, while costs and capital needs increased. By fall, Amtrak
was confronting a cash crisis. In November, Americans went to the polls
and elected the first Republican Congress in 40 years. &quot;Deficit reduction&quot;
became the political battle cry. For Amtrak, the crisis had ripened at the
worst possible moment. <BR>
<BR>
American political debate in the aftermath of the 1994 elections set the
tone of a pseudo-debate. Aggressive freshman and senior budget-cutting Republicans
suggested that Amtrak has no modern function in an age of planes and automobiles.
They proposed &quot;Zeroing Amtrak&quot; in the Budget. Amtrak did make
cuts. But, then, from around the Nation, complaints of those affected quickly
found their way to mayors, governors and Capitol Hill. <BR>
<BR>
The crisis, however, created new interest in Amtrak. Several states, especially
Wisconsin and Vermont, offered subsidies to preserve threatened services.
Amtrak, Washington State, Oregon and British Columbia began incremental
development of high speed rail service along the Cascadia Corridor from
Eugene and Portland, through Seattle to Vancouver, BC. Initial ridership
has been higher than expected and a recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted
the new service and its special emphasis on regional cuisine. North Carolina
inaugurated its new Piedmont Service. Florida and California have committed
revenue streams to high-speed rail development. Amtrak, New York State and
the Federal Railroad Administration developed an experimental 125 mph turbine
train retrofit which is now in service between Albany and NYC; the state
is studying the re manufacture of additional trains to establish a fleet
capable of regular 125 mph service. At the suggestion of Senator Trent Lott,
Amtrak conducted a series of outreach meetings throughout the country. These
meetings produced broad recommendations and also demonstrated popular and
local government support for passenger rail. Passengers have increased four
percent so far in 1995. Maybe, then, passenger rail has a future. 
<H4><I>The Role of Congress </I></H4>
<BR>
The Clinton Administration has called for a continued Amtrak and has pushed
for labor provisions to be negotiated through collective bargaining. But
the Administrationcannot or will not advocate immediate cost savings that
cross the rail labor unions. Key Republican Representatives and Senators,
however, have made a clear that substantial savings must come from such
reforms. Further, they insist, Amtrak must have total flexibility to contract
operational functions to low cost, sometimes non-union, providers. To the
Republican leadership, these changes are a pre-condition for continuing
subsidies, even for an interim period. <BR>
<BR>
At the beginning of the 104th Congress, veteran Pennsylvania Congressman
Bud Shuster was named chairman of the newly organized Committee on Transportation
and Infrastructure (T&amp;I), and that committee and its Rail Subcommittee,
chaired by Representative Susan Molinari of Staten Island, New York, were
given authority of Amtrak. In the Senate, jurisdiction stayed with the Senate
Commerce Committee where Senator Larry Pressler of South Dakota is Chairman.
The Subcommittee Chairman is Trent Lott of Mississippi. Lott also serves
as Majority Whip of the Senate, putting him in a powerful position within
the Leadership. All four key chairmen have expressed support for saving
Amtrak-if it can be reformed. <BR>
<BR>
Hearings began in Congress in the Spring. The popular outcry resulting from
service cutbacks brought new focus. The Committees took a hard look at the
real problems of Amtrak, and of passenger rail in general. First came the
battle of the budget. It was a solid win for proponents of a national rail
passenger service-at least in the short term. During a transition period
through fiscal year 1998, the combined capital, operating and other payments
can total $712 million a year under the Republican-passed budget. <BR>
<BR>
However, Representatives Shuster and Molinari also promised the budget hawks
on the House Budget and Appropriations Committees that they would wring
maximum savings out of the existing system in exchange for these relatively
generous appropriations. Whereas current law prohibits any contracting by
Amtrak, other than for food service, the Shuster/Molinari bill (the Amtrak
Reform and Privatization Act, H.R. 1788) would repeal all anti-contract
law and permit subcontracting of all rail operating functions. H.R. 1788
reduces labor protection payments from 6 years to 6 months for an employee
whose job is eliminated. In addition, the bill places stringent limits on
liability exposure for freight and passenger carriers in intercity (including
high speed) and raises the rent for commuter passenger rail in the Northeast
Corridor. <BR>
<BR>
In the face of these proposed House reforms, rail labor mounted an intensive
lobbying campaign to overturn the contracting and labor protection amendments
which are the heart of the bill. Trial lawyers mounted an effort to remove
the liability limitations, while commuter rail states fought the move to
increase rental rates. When, June 14, the full T&I Committee markup on the
Shuster/Molinari bill was held, opponents caught the bill's backers off-guard,
prevailing on two vital reform votes. Chairman Shuster adjourned the Committee
mark-up without &quot;reporting out&quot; the bill to the House of Representatives.
It was the next day that he announced in the press, &quot;Amtrak is dead.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
Action moved to the Senate. On June 16, the Senate Commerce Committee held
a substantive hearing on Amtrak. Interest for the next few months has shifted
to this Committee, where it will remain unless the House deadlock can be
broken. <BR>
<BR>
Prospects are certainly unclear. Amtrak has a large enough base in Congress
that is likely to receive some level of financial support for the coming
year-if it is tied to significant reforms. But the base is now more fragile
than in some time. And it is not realistic, in any event, to expect federal
subsidies adequate to restore or improve service over the longer term. But,
the need for inter-city and regional rail is still conspicuous. This means
that now is the time to establish a long-term comprehensive strategy for
our national rail passenger system. 
<H3><CENTER>Making Rail Passenger Service a Success<BR>
The Discovery Proposal </CENTER>
</H3>
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio361661" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
1: </I>Cut All Administrative Costs Permitted by Law </H4>
Amtrak must take all necessary steps within existing law to cut costs. Under
Tom Downs' leadership, remarkable progress has been made in a short time.
Business-oriented operating units have been established. Service on major
routes has been reduced while reinvigorated marketing has prevented a matching
decline in ridership. In fact, passenger revenues are 4% ahead of last year.
If passenger rail service is to be saved, more can be done within the existing
Amtrak framework. 
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio361901" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
2:</I> Cut All Extra Costs Imposed by Law </H4>
The contracting and labor reforms, as well as liability provisions of Shuster/Molinari,
must be adopted to give the system any real chance of survival. Second,
Railroad Retirement, the worker liability statute known as FELA, and all
of the other costly and non-productive Federal mandates that are unique
to railroads (described earlier) should be ended, or at least sharply reduced.
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio363876" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
3:</I> Maximize Resources </H4>
There are several laws which allow funding for elements of intercity passenger
service. The Swift High Speed Rail Act authorizes grants for development
of high speed rail technologies and corridor planning. The massive Intermodal
Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA) allows limited funds for technology
development (section 1036) and grade crossing protection in emerging rail
passenger corridors (section 1010). All of these provisions should be integrated
into a comprehensive intercity rail program. This is a good job for the
Federal Railroad Administration. 
<H4><INPUT TYPE="radio" VALUE="radio" NAME="radio364695" CHECKED="true"><I>Step
4:</I> Design a National System Plan</H4>
<BR>
A blue ribbon federal commission should be charged with development of an
overall passenger system analysis, leading to a new national system plan.
The commission, which, for convenience, we shall call the Rail Alliance
for Passenger Service (RAPS), also should be responsible for overseeing
implementation of the plan. While Amtrak should be represented on RAPS,
membership should be heavily represented by the rights-of-way owners, states
and communities, the general business and labor communities and consumers.
<BR>
<BR>
Some believe that Amtrak itself could take on the functions of RAPS, obviating
the need for a new entity. However, Amtrak never has had a planning capability
and, as a bureaucratic organization with rail operating responsibility,
has a corporate culture and an altogther understandable urge for self-preservation,
that might complicate its performance of the role envisioned for RAPS. <BR>
<BR>
RAPS should be charged with market-driven development of a National Rail
Passenger System that provides incentives for Amtrak and other operators
to make money. Once the new national system is in place, the Amtrak monopoly
for providing intercity passenger service will pass to RAPS. Operations
over the new national system then will be re-distributed to Amtrak or other
qualified passenger rail operators. <BR>
<BR>
<B>RAPS will: </B>&#183; 
<UL>
  <LI>Analyze corridors as candidates for inclusion in the National Rail
System. It will contract with a major accounting firm to review Amtrak's
financial and operating records and make findings as to the fully distributed
cost of each Amtrak route. That firm also will make findings about the most
likely shortfalls between revenue and cost on each route. &#183; 
  <LI>Make a special study of the unique Northeast Corridor (NEC) between
Washington and Boston to determine its role in the National System. The
NEC has taken a large share of Amtrak's federally provided capital and is
presently faces an estimated five billion dollars of needed repairs. Amtrak
owns the tracks (which are also used by many commuter trains) and must maintain
the NEC to an exact standard to achieve high speeds. Yet the NEC is a popular
service and the only rail corridor where Amtrak is competitive with airlines.
RAPS would investigate transferring ownership to an interstate compact.
Privatization options, as well as Congress might well designate the Corridor
as a highly controlled &quot;interstate highway,&quot; making it eligible
for trust fund spending, with private users paying a fee to operate high
speed rail service over its lines. &#183; 
  <LI>Analyze the cost and feasibility of upgrading designated routes throughout
the national corridor system to 125 mph. Swift Act planning funds and ISTEA
section 1010 funds will be used to hire engineering firm consultants for
this purpose. Freight/passenger interface problems will be addressed as
will estimates of infrastructure improvement costs. RAPS, further, will
analyze potential funding sources and cost-benefits. &#183; 
  <LI>Over an 18 month period, solicit proposals from multi-party compacts
for corridor route operations and intermodal connections. These pacts should
be composed of: an entrepreneur who proposes to operate the trains, the
host railroads (who may choose to operate the trains themselves), the states
and communities served, and possibly other private stakeholders. Transition
employee interests must be considered. Proposals should include both a realistic
operating budget and financial plan, identify specific funding sources and
ways of overcoming financial shortfalls. Although it is probable that some
long-term federal financial support for infrastructure will be necessary,
each plan should be based on realistic assumptions-not on the hope of a
bottomless well of federal money. 
  <LI>See to it that issues involving host freight railroads are resolved
in compact negotiations. These issues include: grade crossing protection;
liability; operational interface; rent for use of track; and financing capital
improvements (such as higher rail speeds) for passenger operations. Through
the RAPS corridor, the freight owners in each will have a long-term role
in the governance of the National Rail Passenger System. &#183; 
  <LI>Recommend the specific routes that will become elements of the National
Passenger Rail System and approve the operating plan. This concept assumes
that there will be competition for the right to operate these routes. Different
contractors, freight carriers, and/or state/local authorities may operate
trains on different routes, so long as they meet RAPS' standards,which must
be approved by the Federal Railroad Administration and the track owners
for safety and operating compatibility. &#183; 
  <LI>Permit Amtrak itself and its employees, if they so decide, to privatize
and compete as a member of compact coalitions. In the interim, a residual
&quot;public Amtrak&quot; will need to operate during five-year analysis-and-transition
period. This public Amtrak will continue to operate the existing basic system
but with complete flexibility to achieve cost savings provided in the Shuster/Molinari
legislation. &#183; 
  <LI>Address in this planning process the distribution and ownership of
Amtrak passenger equipment. &#183; 
  <LI>Establish a plan for a national intermodal surface passenger system.
This will include a national system of reservations and ticketing, with
links to bus and even air. Intermodal bus/rail stations will be encouraged.
RAPS will set standards and principles of service, including equipment design
and compatibility for the National Rail Passenger System. &#183; 
  <LI>Provide a permanent residual national authority for oversight and
coordination with the National Passenger System. The RAPS Board will provide
for arbitration of disputes and administration of whatever federal funding
is ultimately authorized. It also will serve as residual holder of the right
to provide passenger service as a part of the National Rail Passenger System.
The RAPS Board will ultimately be privatized. 
</UL>
<BR>
<BR>
Funding for the plan Funding for the implementation of the National Rail
Passenger System envisioned in this proposal will be provided in three parts.
<BR>
<BR>
First, Amtrak will be given a general fund operating subsidy for the &quot;interim&quot;
planning period of three to five years. (The 1996 Congressional Budget allows
adequate funding for 3 years.) <BR>
<BR>
Second, the states will be given flexibility to commit discretionary ISTEA
trust funding to &quot;National Rail Plan&quot; rail projects. Currently,
states may not use highway trust fund money for rail. However, in considering
a highway bill recently, the Senate passed an amendment offered by Sen.
Anthony Roth (R.-Delaware) and Sen. Joseph Biden (D.-Delaware) to provide
some highway trust fund flexibility for Amtrak projects. The vote was a
persuasive 64 to 36. Coincidentally, a recent national poll indicated that
63% of the public support the concept of committing gas tax revenues to
Amtrak projects. Nevertheless, Roth-Biden has fierce opposition from the
highway lobby and will face great difficulties in the House of Representatives.
The opponents, unfortunately, include Transportation and Infrastructure
Chairman Bud Shuster. However, if Roth-Biden becomes law, chances for a
passenger rail revival will become greatly improved. At the very least,
it will quickly become clear how much priority the states are willing to
give passenger rail when confronted with a real choice. Besides, in many
corridors, federal capital improvements mean highway/rail grade separation
and improve port access, which benefit community safety, trucking and sea/air
traffic. <BR>
<BR>
The National Rail Plan adopted by RAPS for transmission to Congress will
include a statement as to whether any additional Federal funding is necessary
on a temporary or permanent basis. <BR>
<BR>
Needless to say, the more detailed the plans developed by RAPS, and the
more solid the state and local commitments, the easier it will be for Congress
to respond with long-term capital funding. Government has traditionally
provided infrastructure investment capital when public benefits are substantial.
For example, on congested or higher speed routes that are shared with freight
trains, double tracking, passing tracks, and state-of-the-art signal and
separation systems (as well as fencing), may prove necessary. Once a rational
planning process has been completed, the Congress will have a solid foundation
on which to allocate national transportation dollars to competing intermodal
priorities. 
<H4><I>Creating a National System </I></H4>
<BR>
A large issue will be how to deal with the long distance overnight trains
that make up much of the current national system. Nostalgia and romantic
names out of the past have political appeal. The question is whether they
make economic sense. Should the Sunset Limited ride into the sunset? Or
can such new (and old) ideas as combined passenger and mail service help
make the longer runs viable? Perhaps states and communities at location
stops along the route could maintain stations and underwrite part of the
cost of service. The answers must come out in the factual analysis and should
not prejudiced at the beginning of the process. <BR>
<BR>
Under this Discovery Institute proposal, the National Passenger Rail System
will be based on the building blocks of corridors in every region of the
country. Only after the corridor compacts have been submitted, analyzed,
and implemented-and costs are known-will it become clear whether national
connectivity should be a system goal. No doubt, the entrepreneurial imagination
of rail and bus operators will see opportunities where bureaucratic thinking
has seen only problems. 
<H4><I>Conclusion</I> </H4>
It is possible and desirable for this country to have a world-class passenger
rail system once again. But what priority will Congress and the people give
to saving and exploiting this asset? There must be a serious debate in Congress-a
debate informed, not just by political pressures from constituents and economic
interests, but by proof of cost-effective readiness to enter new partnerships
and try new arrangements. <BR>
<BR>
Today's new federalist philosophy seeks to return decision-making power
to the people. It seeks to give resourceful, customer-oriented capitalism
a chance. Saving passenger rail falls into this overall challenge. Privatization
is not a magic answer, but it can be a key part of a successful long-term
solution. <BR>

</H3>
Lewis Perelman, a Senior Fellow of Discovery Institute, is one of the nation's
top authorities on education and training. His advocacy of high technology
in the restructuring of what he has called <B>The Learning Enterprise</B>
is expressed in his book, <A HREF="schlsout.html"><B><I>School's Out: Hyperlearning,
the New Technology and the End of Education</I> </B></A>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman, president of Kanbrain Institute, has provided strategic consulting
advice since 1983 to public and private policymakers concerned with technology,
institutional change, human resource, and economic development issues. His
private consulting clients have included IBM, Apple Computer, National Computer
Systems, Hay Group, Ashton-Tate, L.F. Rothschild, National Education Corp.,
the Edison Electric Institute, and other companies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman is the author of the best-selling book <I>School's Out</I> (William
Morrow &amp; Co., 1992; Avon Books, 1993) a study of restructuring education
and training sponsored by twelve U.S. corporations and foundations. He has
produced several other publications on training and education, including
the widely discussed Briefing Papers, <I>&quot;Closing Education's Technology
Gap&quot;</I> (November 1989) and <I>The Acanemia' Deception</I> (April
1990). His report for Hudson Institute's Workforce 2000 project, <I>The
American Learning Enterprise in Transition</I>, was published by the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development (1990). <BR>
<BR>
Perelman coined the phrase <B>The Learning Enterprise</B> to describe the
total universe of education and training in a report with that title published
by the Council of State Planning Agencies in 1985. And his study for the
Western Governors' Association, Human Capital Investment for State Economic
Development (1989), was the first attempt to chart the entire &quot;portfolio&quot;
of a state's many investments in human resource development. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's work in education, training, technology, and economic policy
has been widely discussed in the national press, cited in legislative testimony,
and used in university courses. He has made speeches and presentations of
his work before numerous audiences throughout the United States and in Europe
and Pacific Asia, both live and on radio and television broadcasts. He also
has testified before Congressional, state, and local legislative committees
as well as executive boards and commissions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Currently an adjunct fellow of the Discovery Institute, from 1981 to 1983
Perelman was a director in the corporate planning department of Holiday
Corp. in Memphis. From 1979 to 1981, he was a senior scientist in the Social
Systems Group at Caltech's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. In 1980 he was a visiting
scientist at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis. Previously
he held positions at the federal Solar Energy Research Institute, and at
the Colorado Highway Department. He taught physics and mathematics in public
schools in New York and California, and has taught graduate courses at the
Harvard Graduate School of Education and the George Mason University School
of Business Administration. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman's first book, <I>The Global Mind</I> (Mason/Charter, 1976), was
cited one of the year's best scientific-technical books by the Library Journal.
Perelman's writing has appeared in such major publications as <I>Business
Week, Forbes ASAP, WIRED, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, The
Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor, Success, Insight, </I>and
the <I>French magazine ACTUEL, a</I>s well as professional journals such
as <I>TIMS Studies in the Management Sciences, New Management, Strategic
Planning Management, Planning Review, Human Capital, and Ethics</I>. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perelman earned his doctorate in administration, planning, and social policy
at the Harvard Graduate School of Education. He graduated cum laude with
a B.S. in mathematics from the City College of New York, where he was elected
to Phi Beta Kappa. He did graduate study in space and atmospheric physics
and applied mathematics at the Goddard Institute and at the Harvard Division
of Engineering and Applied Physics. Perelman resides and works in Washington,
DC. <BR>

<HTML><HEAD>    <TITLE>Coming Jewish Conservatism</TITLE></HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="#ffffff"><I>From The Washington Times Tuesday, September 26, 1995:</I><H1><CENTER><BR>The Coming Jewish Conservatism </CENTER></H1><H3><CENTER>by <BR><I>Adam Pruzan </I></CENTER></H3><IMG SRC="rainbow.gif" WIDTH="793" HEIGHT="2" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=bottom><BR><BR>For most of this century, American Jews, liberalism and the Democratic Partyhave gone together like bagels, lox and cream cheese. At the present, wecan expect this cozy relationship to continue. However, to borrow PresidentClinton's favorite word, Jewish liberals will increasingly have to contendwith change - and it will not be an easy task. <BR><BR>Liberalism has already changed. From a broad national consensus, in favorof equal opportunity, individual rights, popular sovereignty and economicgrowth, modern liberalism has become a minority ideology, supporting equalityof income, groups rights, the rule of the elite, and redistributionist economics.<BR><BR>Judaism continues to change. The Orthodox community, the largest potentialsource of Jewish conservatives, remains relatively small, but it is growingand vibrant. At the same time, the liberal denominations (including Reformand Conservative Judaism - the latter not to be confused with Jewish conservatism)have sadly become little more than comfortable exit doors through whichgrandchildren, if not the kids themselves, leave the faith. With intermarriagerates over 50 percent we can readily understand Rabbi Alexander Schindler,leader of the Reform movement, when he calls for proselytizing - the firstsuch appeal in Jewish history. <BR><BR>And, of course, the Democratic Party has changed. Others have chronciledand catalogued those changes far better than I could do; for our presentpurpose, it will suffice simply to restate the post-November bottom line:minority party. While our liberal coreligionists deal with these changes,Jewish conservatives should be prepared for an eventual shift within ourfaith that will mirror what has already occurred in the country as a whole.Such a transformation may not happen for decades, but we should understandits underlying dynamics, and do whatever we can to advance the process.To that end I offer the following guideposts. <BR><BR>First, let us steel ourselves for a long and difficult struggle. Jewishdemographics illustrate the problem. Reckoning conservatively (as conservativesshould), we estimate that America has 4 million voting Jews, that only 20percent vote Republican and that only 20 percent of those are real conservatives(the other 80 percent might be Jacob Javits types). This leaves us withonly 160,000 Jewish conservatives. <BR><BR>That number should both sober and encourage us. Although a minority withina minority, we can still comfortably fund an influential national organization,plus a periodical or two. We can partner effectively with far larger Christianconservative groups, benefiting from their size and influence while helpingto guard their flanks. We can offer the major media interesting &quot;manbites dog&quot; stories, potentially gaining exposure disproportionate toour numbers. (The radical feminists have done this for years). <BR><BR>Second, realize that an imbryonic Jewish conservative movement has muchmore intellectual firepower at its disposal than did the original conservativeleadership at a comparable state of development (say, 1955). This newspaper,the Wall Street Journal's editorial page, National Reviews, Commentary andthe American Spectator have all published Jewish conservatives by the score.<BR><BR>Third, get comfortable with putting religion into politics. We must do asour liberal brethren do, not as they say. The Reform movement calls itsWashington office, headed by a rabbi, the Religious Action Center. <BR><BR>Liberal Jews, unabashadly proclaim the religious authority of our sacredtexts, liberal Jews invoke the Talmudic principle of tikkum olam, the repairof the world. For them, &quot;repair&quot; includes active support for thehomosexual, feminist and abortion-rights agendas, the welfare state, andthe NEA. At the same time, liberal Jews vilify conservative Christians forsimilarly acting on their religious beliefs. <BR><BR>By definition, any religious-based attempt to repair the world must involveimposing on others. Modern Jewish liberals do this, so did President LIncoln.In his second inaugral address, a speech of fewer than 700 words, Mr. Lincolninvoked God six times and quoted the Bible three times. Lincoln put religionin politics to justify the Union imposing its values on the Confederacy.<BR><BR>Lincoln acted &quot;with malice toward none, with charity for all and withfirmness in the right as God gives us to se the right.&quot; That is thekind of whole-hearted, noble conviction our conservative Christian friendsshould bring into politics and we should follow their example. <BR><BR>God made our ancestors wander in the desert for 40 years before they couldcross into the Promised Land. Generations inured to slavery and sin hadto pass on before we could fulfill our destiny.

Can a Virtual School Help Improve Learning?</CENTER>
</H1>
<H4><CENTER>by Tom A. Alberg<BR>
Chairman, Discovery Institute</CENTER>

<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="zigzag-3.gif" WIDTH="394" HEIGHT="6" NATURALSIZEFLAG=

<P>BILL Gates said several years ago that &quot;on a scale of one to ten,
if a mediocre teacher is a three and Socrates was a nine, computers and
software are about a four, with prospects of someday being a six or seven.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It probably is true, indeed, that computers and educational software, by
themselves, will never equate to a great or even a good teacher. But if
today's networked computing is enlisted, the possibilities become more promising.
Networking connects the calculating, storage, retrieval and display power
of electronic machines with people who have ideas, creativity, questions
and emotions. It is a means of asking others for their opinions and of expressing
your own. Its instantaneous reach is around the school or around the world.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The components of high-tech leaming already in use are impressive; from
the increasingly popular and powerful Internet to the expanding corpus of
educational software and CD-ROMS. Distance leaming video broadcasts have
the power to bring the best lecturers to all students. Adding interactive
techniques including wireless and Internet facilities-can create a much
enriched personal experience for students, especially for those living a
long distance from large schools.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we hope to approach the &quot;nine&quot; of Socrates, however, we need
to combine and organize such resources into a coherent program of leaming.
We need to find out how emerging technological possibilities comport with
human nature in practice. We must find out how the new technology works
and how it can be made to work better if we are to know how to encourage
its appropriate development and dissemination. It took generations to create
the traditional classroom; the high technology leaming center of the future
can and should be created in one: ours.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One way to concentrate progress in high-technology leaming, while avoiding
disappointments and waste along the way, would be to organize a demonstration
project that tested out new hardware, Internet services and software for
varying kinds of learners. Call it a virtual school. In addition to combining
different high-tech leaming techniques (both Internet and software, for
example), it would pull together the lessons of existing experiments that
operate solely with one kind of technology or in one kind of leaming environment.
Today these experiences are scattered in n-tany homes, public and private
schools, universities and high tech firms.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The virtual school project is not a job for govemment acting alone, nor
for any one school, foundation or corporation. It should, however, collaborate
with all levels and kinds of existing educational systems and educators-from
state officials to home schoolers, from software manufacturers to telecommunications
companies, from computer scientists to educational television stations,
and with much attention to the actual students and their parents.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A virtual school is not one without human teachers. We may talk about the
virtues of self-leaming, but even the greatest scholars usually operate
within a community, and almost all fledgling students must have a structure
and human guidance. But the nature of the teacher/pupfl relationship may
well change as high technology is introduced.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the experiments in the virtual school, therefore, would seek to discover
what kind of teacher/student interaction works best in a high-tech leaming
environment. We mostly abandoned rote leaming years ago and yet we have
found that total reliance upon student spontaneity does not yield measurable
progress in knowledge and skflls-which is one of the major concerns of school
refon-ners. With new hardware and software technologies, it should be possible
to develop both new kinds of group interaction and self-directed learning.
Accordingly, the job of the teacher is sure to be different, and it will
take experience to discover how to teach in the high tech environment.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Likewise, what it means to be a student will change. For certain, it will
not be appropriate to give each pupil a computer with CD-ROMs filled with
great literature and hope that he or she will stumble across Nfilton or
The Federalist Papers. Nor should we consider it sufficient to give students
a connection to the Internet, which is a wonderful tool, but often referred
to as &quot;chaotic.&quot; They will need some kind of guide-and some reliable
accountability for results. It may be that the teaching model will be closer
to the tutor of yore than to today's classroom instructor. The &quot;tutor&quot;
guides his or her pupil, suggests certain inquiries and requires a demonstration
of increased knowledge and skill. Sometimes the tutor meets with the pupils
as a group, sometimes singly-sometimes over the Internet and sometimes in
person.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The virtual school, then, would be an association of educational tutors
(teachers) and participants of all ages (students), organized and equipped
to make maximum use of existing and new educational software and the Internet.
The tutors would work together to devise curricula, combining desktop software,
specific knowledge based resources on the Internet (such as the Harvard
files on Greek architecture for a fine arts or history course .... ), Internet
communication opportunities (pen pals in Italy for a course on Italian;
topical bulletin boards on whales .... ), interactive video &quot;classes&quot;
and personal meetings and field trips with students.<BR>
Assignments-and tests-in the virtual school would take place largely on
the Internet. Scoring of exams would be faster and easier than now, and
the whole idea of &quot;exams&quot; might change as learning patterns change.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Anyone could &quot;audit&quot; the experimental virtual school, but the
tutorials would require preliminary application and approval. Whether he
or she was a home schooler or someone attending a standard public or private
school, a student would sign up with the virtual school for an actual course
and be assigned a tutor. C)n the other hand, a tutor with his or her own
group of students could also enter.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Imagine, for example, how a Garfield High School student who wanted to study
Italian@r some other language not now available in the Pubfic school system-might
sign up for a beginning course with the virtual school. The curriculum for
Italian would carry the student as far as he or she desired, with measurable
milepost results satisfactory not only to the student but to his or her
parents and Garfield advisor. The curriculum would be flexible enough, moreover,
that a hundred students taking Italian through the virtual school could
each learn in his own way and in varying real times, with wide choices of
content to permit instructional custon-dzing. The students also would be
part of an on-line, interactive, real time class. All would have some opportunity
for face-to-face interaction, as desirable.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The tutors would be drawn from existing teachers at schools, supplemented
by other people in the community. For example, the Garfield High School
student who wanted to study Italian, n-dght have a knowledgeable language
teacher at Garfield as the tutor or someone else in the community who was
qualified to monitor his progress. Math and science teachers might be supplemented
by Boeing engineers serving as tutors on the Internet. Lawyers might tutor
constitutional law or environment and public policy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While the virtual school would not bear any resemblance to the large physical
structures Of today, it would probably actually exist in physical space
as well as cyberspace and etherspace. There would be meeting rooms at an
otherwise modest virtual school office where you occasionally could meet
your tutor and probably other participants, as well. Rooms would be flexible
in size and also would include the latest high quality video broadcasting
and teleconferencing screens, as well as virtual reality facilities.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most students would use the virtual school as an adjunct to their regular
institutional or home school program. The dynamic of the school would be
such, however, that it would be constantly iinproving itself and expanding,
as the participants learned what worked and what didn't.<BR>
Nationwide, schools are investing literally hundreds of millions of dollars
in high technology products, often for school office improvements, but increasingly
for student learning. The future is likely to see such investments expand
exponentially. But planning for this development currently is sparse (Washington
State is further along than most), and discouraging waste, therefore, is
inevitable unless better information is available on what works and what
does not. Teachers will need to be trained when they are still attending
schools of educationonly a small fraction are computer literate nowand existing
teachers need to be retrained. But trained to do what? A comprehensive virtual
school experiment that is not beholden to any interest can help shorten
the learning curve in the high-tech educational future.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If we want to pioneer in creating a virtual school in the Puget Sound area,
we must build a constituency that believes, first, that the use and deployment
of computer software, hardware and networks can measurably improve the learning
process, and, second, that the new system should be able to justify itself
in terms of measurable results for students and for the educational system
as a whole. Technology should not become just another expensive addition
to the present system. It should help transform education, facilitating
the real reforms in productivity and cost-effectiveness.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But it can't happen without some experimentation, some trial and error me
use of high technology, in other words, to learn more about high tech learning.<BR>

<H3>Discovery Institute's name and logo derive in part from the British
explorer sloop &quot;Discovery&quot; launched on the Thames River in 1789.
Ninetynine feet long and 340 tons, the Discovery sailed the world and explored
the Pacific Northwest and Puget Sound region in the Spring of 1792 under
the command of Captain George Vancouver and 134 sailors. The picture below
is from a drawing by Northwest Marine artist and historian, Hewlitt Jackson.</H3>

<H3><CENTER>Microsoft suddenly sees itself beset by broadband rebels and
its own middle age</CENTER>
</H3>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BR>
<BR>
GOLIATH IN THE VALE of Elah roared his contempt at the weapons and zeal
of David: &quot;Do you think me a dog that you contest me with sticks and
stones?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, the Goliath of software, sees himself simi-larly beset by zealous
rivals with risible weapons. Entering his modest second-floor office on
the edge of the Microsoft campus on a twilight evening in late November,
I find him irked and addled by what he sees as a siege of slingshots from
irrational media and capital markets in his industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft entered November on an autumnal blaze of upside news-earnings
up 53%, sales up 63%, a double gi-gabuck quarter. But now, amazingly, people
were speaking of a &quot;crisis&quot; at Microsoft. &quot;That's an emotional
word,&quot; says Gates, twisting uncomfortably in his chair. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT WAS BAD ENOUGH when Netscape came on with 9,000 lines of code for a World
Wide Web browser that took six weeks to build and that was given away free,
and people began talking of his company's downfall. Gates had pulled that
trick himself in 1976, with a few thousand lines of code for the Basic programming
language for the PC and then again in 1980 with MS-DOS. But to do it to
Goliath seemed l&eacute;se-majest&eacute;. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then comes Sun Microsystems with a new program-ming language called Java,
and people like me, who by Mi-crosoft standards don't know anything about
programming, who have never written a single line of code, presumed to tell
him about its virtues. It's safe, secure, interpreted, plat-form independent;
it collects your garbage (automatic garbage collection). It compiles as
if by incantation. It builds market cap as by magic. Give poor Bill a break.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Yeah, right,&quot; says Gates. &quot;I have to wonder who screwed
your head around....&quot; Oh, he knows, he knows. &quot;The In-ternet&quot;
makes everything different. You can make any claim you want, however bizarre
or ludicrous, that would ordi-narily be laughed off the stage, and if you
add the mantra &quot;on the Internet&quot; at the end you can morph yourself
from a typical media clown into a visionary, a prophet, a guru. &quot;Nobody
pauses to say, 'Huh?' &quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the analysts will nod and the market will bow. It's &quot;on the Internet.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One day in November, three days before my visit, Rick Sherlund, the Goldman
Sachs analyst who helped bring Microsoft public in 1986 and had touted the
stock for a decade, downgraded Microsoft's shares from buy to &quot;mod-erately
outperform&quot; on the basis of Internet incantations from Sun and Netscape.
Sherlund also replaced Microsoft with Netscape on his recommended list.
Indeed, Goliath's net worth was shrinking by the minute as Microsoft's mar-ket
cap sank by $9 billion, and Sun's and Netscape's surged by $9 billion in
a matter of weeks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does Bill Gates know Rick Sherlund, by any chance? Sure, Gates answers,
&quot;extremely well.&quot; &quot;He's your man, he's great,&quot; says
Gates, &quot;if you want to run a spreadsheet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this world of manias and emotions, &quot;I have to make rational decisions,&quot;
Gates says, glaring at me. &quot;Somebody who thinks that because of a browser
that anyone can clone, because of a language that is magic, they [Netscape
and Sun, the unmentionables] can overthrow the world-that person can't even
think two chess moves ahead. You're not even in the game I'm playing.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Okay, thinking forward a couple of moves, what is the big thing bearing
down on Microsoft on that road ahead? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's middle age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No, in Redmond, they have another name for it. Throughout the company, wherever
you go-from hum-mus on pita bread at the cafeteria with a glib former Holly-wood
agent hired to handle publicity, to a Starbucks latte at the Microsoft model
&quot;home&quot; with software sage Rick Rashid incandescent on a couch,
or off to Rover's Restau-rant where Nathan Myhrvold spiels refulgently at
a cor-ner table through 12 courses of rococo &quot;fatware&quot; and my
two missed flights-the word is middleband. From the top down, Microsoft
is becoming a middleband company. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates, Myhrvold, James Allchin, Craig Mundie- nearly anyone in Redmond will
step you through it. The future is not broadband, not narrow-band; it is
some middle way. It takes Excel and Word and Pow-erPoint presentation graphics
and multimedia CD-ROMs and the new Video ROMs-indeed all the front and back
Office suites that are the core of the company, all the teeming tow-ers
of legacy code-and attaches that to the Internet. It's Encarta and Baseball
and digital TV all tied to the Web over middle-band circuits. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates explains: &quot;We will translate Encarta into many lan-guages and
make it a front end to the Internet, so that when-ever you look up a topic
in the encyclopedia, we can link you into what there is in the Inter-net
on that topic. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Now the Internet is not fast enough when you just want to go pure
Internet, so every year you can buy the CD that holds the bulk of the material.&quot;
It will be a middleband world. I see the millennium at hand: People are
all queu-ing up at Egghead for their Encarta update CDs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From Gates on down, however, Microsoft leaders do grasp the essence of the
change. Myhrvold trenchantly points out that communications standards no
longer rise from the center out, from the LAN to the WAN. They be-gin on
the Net and move inward to the LAN and transform it. &quot;The LAN is dead,&quot;
as Myhrvold says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these same Microsoft leaders seem to believe that the transforming power
of the Net stops short of the PC and operating system. Sun will set, but
Windows will open wide on the World Wide Web (up to ISDN speeds). After
all, as Allchin puts it, &quot;We see the Internet as an extension of the
operating system.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask Gates how we can have a middleband world in the face of a rising tide
of bandwidth. Gates in the past has spo-ken of virtually &quot;infinite
bandwidth.&quot; But he does not see it today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Twenty years from now we will have broadband in homes, he explains, but
until then middleband is the best you can expect. Indeed, in his presentation
to the press the week after my visit, on December 7, he strangely declared
&quot;broad-band is the holy grail, [but] it's much further away than ever
before.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I ask about cable modems. But to Gates, cable modems are mere middleband:
&quot;Don't get me wrong-you can do a lot in middleband. But cable is a
shared medium. Cable modems are middleband. You get 10 megabits per second
and share it with 500 homes and you are back to ISDN speeds.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But, I protest, Netscape has a different view. It has joined with @Home
(the Kleiner Perkins-TCI joint venture) to supply browsers and servers for
a new scalably broadband Internet based on cable. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates's voice reaches a new pitch. &quot;I assure you Netscape has no relationship
with @Home that Microsoft does not have. I didn't spend three years talking
with John Malone for nothing three years with Bruce Ravenel [Tele-Communications
Technology Ventures' senior vice-president and chief operating officer].
In the first place, browsers are trivial. We will have cable browsers. And
we will have cable servers. We will do anything with @Home that Netscape
does.&quot; After all, TCI Technology Ventures invested $125 million in
MSN (Microsoft Network). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So it went in the Redmond gloaming. I deeply admire Gates. The guts to leave
Harvard at the end of his junior year and launch a new industry; the tenacity
to build it into a planetary utility; the audacity and ingenuity of the
original deal with IBM; the entrepreneurial confidence to cut loose from
OS/2. The vision to be the only major software company to embrace Macintosh
and save Apple by en-dowing the Mac with the leading GUI spreadsheet and
word processor, Excel and Word, while at the same time gaining the graphics
skills to create Windows. The bold challenge to Unix through Windows NT.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
THERE IS NO DOUBT that Gates has been the exemplary business leader of our
era. Compared with the leaders of IBM, heavy with &quot;NIH&quot; (not-invented-here)
and degrees in business administration and finance, who could not even grasp
the concept of sunk costs or the rule of self-cannibalization well enough
to burke OS/2, who could not even see the huge opportunity to embrace the
Mac OS, Gates is indeed a giant. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A week later, in an announcement emblazoned in Com-puterworld as &quot;Capitulation,&quot;
Gates showed his superiority to the NIH syndrome at IBM. He declared that
he was licensing Sun's Java Internet animation language, in which he seemed
suddenly to have discovered new virtues, and was essentially abandoning
Microsoft Network as a proprietary paid service. It would serve as an attractive
Inter-net entry point, open to all, with content and advertising prepared
with anyone's available software. Beyond that, Microsoft announced an array
of impressive-sounding new Internet products: Blackbird publication tools
for the Net; Gibraltar Internet server products four times as fast as Netscape's;
Visual Basic as a scripting language for the Net already far easier and
more familiar than Java; upgrades of current Word versions that allow direct
creation of HTML documents; and an array of other announcements. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But all the brave talk, the bestselling book, the stilted TV appearances,
the an-nouncement of a news channel with NBC, the stream of new products,
the bold embrace of an In-ternet strategy, the spread of Windows 95, could
not disguise the rising confu-sion in Redmond. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All of a sudden, Gates seemed to have lost his bearings. The man who elbowed
aside an on-air Connie Chung as if she were a bothersome gnat and shunned
NBC as a nuisance, now was clutch-ing the old network, of all things, as
a source of news and investing in it, as if it had a future. It was as if
old NBC with its Max Headrooms of smiling anchor faces and two-minute splashes
of &quot;news&quot; could morph into an in-formation resource simply by
invoking the mantra &quot;on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in his long romance with Warren Buffett, Gates seemed to be reaching
out to old money, power and pres-tige to bolster his company as it whirled
in the vortex that he had described as the &quot;Internet tidal wave.&quot;
It was as if he no longer trusted the PC to sustain his growth as an $8
billion revenue company, as if he needed sustenance from mass media. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Netscape, Sun, @Home and other firms, Silicon Valley is in the ascendant
again. But the software colossus is still losing ground on the road ahead,
so Gates pivots on his peerless pinnacle simultaneously at the summit of
the New York Times bestseller list and the Forbes 400 and looks back with
a Macaulay Culkin smile from the cover of a book that is mostly news of
yesterday. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I N T E L   O U T S I D E ? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks later, back in Silicon Valley from the Vale of Elah, I visit Goliath's
prime mover, Andrew Grove of Intel. With revenues more than twice as large
as Micro-soft's and a price/earnings ratio less than half as high, and commanding
the world's most awesome manufactur-ing facilities for the world's most
complex and portentous product, Intel seems to stand on firmer foundations.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove opens the meeting with jokes about the &quot;tunnel of death&quot;
that perpetually menaces his industry in the pages of the media. Ensconced
in a small open cubicle on the fifth floor of the Robert Noyce headquarters
in Santa Clara at the heart of Silicon Valley, with &quot;Intel Inside&quot;
inscribed on the roof to enlighten the planes from nearby San Jose In-ternational
Airport, Grove effervesces wit and irony and bonhomie where Gates seethed
sarcasm and defensiveness. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Grove, there is no longing for canonization by old money, no sell-sign
craving for the sickly glamour of Hol-lywood and TV, no fashionable yearning
for business in &quot;content.&quot; Grove grasps that the PC is the ascendant
force in the global culture of capitalism and that the Internet consummates
the PC. Nonetheless, asked about the possibility of the teleputer-the $500
Internet PC-freed from the coils of Wintel, he echoes Gates in a cele-bration
of current PC culture that somehow misses the point. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove associates the teleputer with dumb or static appliances, from set-top
boxes to PDAs, in the catalog of PC sub-species that emerged in hype as
substitute PCs. Most of them sold a few hundred thousand units, and then
expired. &quot;The new device will be produced and it too will sell a few
hundred thousand units. But not 10 million units,&quot; he says. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Forbes ASAP editor Rich Karlgaard and I prepare to leave his office,
he asks us to guess the cycle rate of the up-coming '96 basic home-based
PC. I suggest 100 megahertz. Grove shakes his head. He confides that he
is headed for a meeting to decide whether the 1996 PC will bear a 120- megahertz
or a 133-megahertz Pentium. &quot;Everyone un-derestimates the progress
of PCs,&quot; he says with satisfaction. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You could fix on a special-purpose device today, to satisfy Larry
Ellison's mother [who wants a simpler PC], but by the time it came out,
the PC will have moved on, powered by incomparably more potent microprocessors,
leaving the new machine trivialized and obsolete in its wake.&quot; In other
words, evolutionary products will suffice in this revolutionary time of
exponentially expanding Nets and peripheral CPUs. Nonetheless, moving a
few miles north on California's Route 101, out of the hypergravita-tional
fields of Philistea, one can still feel a radical shift-ing in the spheres
of possibility. &quot;And David took his staff in his hand and chose him
five smooth stones.&quot; I Samuel 17:40 <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
FOR THE NEW ORDER, the ultrawideband wireless Sand Hill slingshot-the capitalist
conjurer of the forces causing new sleeplessness in Seattle-is John Doerr
of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers. Shunning Herb Allen's summits of
schmooze, where the entrepreneurial big-time is an &quot;au-dacious&quot;
investment in Coke or NBC, Doerr epitomizes the venture capitalist as industrial
demiurge. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As technology investor Roger McNamee puts it: &quot;While other venture
capitalists say, 'Let's start a company,' John says, 'Let's start an industry.'
&quot; So far, beginning at Intel in the early years, he has played a key
role in launching in-dustries in electronic design automation, RISC workstations,
personal computers, financial software, multimedia and wire-less pen appliances
(well, let that last one pass). His current new industry will be the biggest
yet. It is broadband Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From the vertiginous launch of Sun, Lotus and Compaq in the early 1980s
to a fund gush-ing Go at pens, his career has seen several peaks and valleys.
Doerr has even dallied with middle age. He once weighed a mid-life retreat
from the madding bustle of Silicon Val-ley to contemplate the Tantra or
the Tao: &quot;I sometimes think,&quot; Doerr told the New York Times in
1987, &quot;I would like to become a Buddhist monk.&quot; Sure, John. But,
tell me, what yoga discipline was he brewing two years ago in Palo Alto,
at breakfast at Il Fornaio head-to-head with Jim Clark? What karmic rites
was he conjuring with Clark and Bill Joy in the winter of 1994 on a three-hour
conference call among wildernesses of Marriott on the road? What karass
was he kenning in December 1994 among the tacky booths and bins, the barkers
and indoor bikinis at the Western Cable Show in Anaheim? What tables were
tipping in January 1995 in his Woodside home, among pizzas and pastas with
his wife, Anne, and Marc Andreessen, Bill Joy, Andy Bech-tolsheim, Jim Gosling
and Rick Schell (Netscape's VP of engineering)? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why, in early 1995, was he lurking around the NASA Ames Research Center
at Moffett Field in Mountain View, Calif.? Is he seeking evidence of alien
IPOs, or just some hard-core Unix Christian libertarian netbender from outer
space to levitate a new industry in Palo Alto? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AT&amp;T venturer Thomas Judge told Forbes ASAP's Nancy Rutter in 1993:
&quot;You have to be on the fringes to make money in [Doerr's] business,
and that's where he is.&quot; Follow Doerr, however, from day to day, call
to call, from Sun to Oracle to America Online to Netscape to Macro-mind,
and you will find yourself at the fringes just as they invert into the Zen
center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A lean figure, with blondish hair, a cowlick and horn-rims, Doerr at 44
is as bashfully all-business and freneti-cally bitwise as Gates whom he
resembles, but he is still flouting the gravity of middle age. On a crisp
Sunday in mid-December, I catch up with him at Buck's restaurant, near his
home in Woodside in Silicon Valley. Wearing a dark suit from church, he
checks for messages on his Skytel pager, greets fellow venturer Bill Davidow
passing by and then opens a black briefcase full of technotoys. From across
the restaurant, this venture colossus looks to be a frowsy salesman perhaps
a little desperate to present his wares. He removes a Mac Power-Book 5300
and Sony speakers and lays them out on the table. Amid empty latte glasses
and plates of ravioli pesto and his own half-eaten hamburger, Doerr is ready
to give a demo of the new industry-a fore-cast for next year's Netscape-style
IPO. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It takes a minute or so to boot up the Mac, checking through the 32 megabytes
of RAM (teleputers, Doerr says, will boot up instantly from flash ROM).
But from there on out, it is all immediate grati-fication. Click to ignite
a Java Web page with streaming stockmarket data, a c/net talking- head newscaster
and a vocano video from Venezuela. &quot;Wow, look at that new PowerBook
go,&quot; exults a jolly woman observing from the next table. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Doerr is on a rush through a world of his own. Click again and you have
the Sunnyvale Sun, efflorescent with vivid speech, sports clips and classified
personals. Newspapers will be hot on the broadband Internet. Click on the
classifieds and you can presumably meet their makers in living color. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is a glimpse of @Home, a mere demo of Doerr's new broadband Internet
company. As the service develops you will soon be able to download movies
and other pro-grams on demand. Over 28.8 modems or even 128-kilobit-per-
second ISDN lines, all such dynamic fare would be ag-onizingly slow to access.
By contrast, Doerr says, in @Home everything is instant, full motion and
always on. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How can this be, you ask, on an essentially middleband Internet? &quot;That's
the genius of Milo Medin, @Home's net-work chief,&quot; he explains, &quot;linked
to the genius of Marc An-dreessen of Netscape.&quot; NASA Ames's network
king, Medin is now building a scalable, extensible architecture for a cable-based
World Wide Web. With some help, I might add, from John Doerr and his five
smooth stones. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, four of the five companies-Sun, Netscape, Macromind and Intuit-Doerr
estimates, &quot;have added more than $10 billion to their market cap in
the last six months because of their Internet initiatives,&quot; this new
model of computing based on the Web, while Microsoft lost a similar total
by briefly resisting it. Now @Home is on target to generate another multibillion
market cap by exploding the current bandwidth bottlenecks of the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At Intel, Doerr worked at a desk down a corridor from Bruce Ravenel. Then
an architect of the 8086 and the 8087, Ravenel is now TCI Technology Ventures'
influential chief of technology. Igniting the fuse for @Home were words
between Doerr and Ravenel as the two old grads from &quot;Noyce-Moore U&quot;
wove their way through the Western Cable Show in the first week of December
1994. &quot;I dare not call it an epiphany,&quot; Doerr says, &quot;but
Bruce and I were at the Motorola booth where they were showing off a sleek
little $300 box the size of a modem that would enable telephone calls over
a cable line. 'What would it cost,' I asked, 'to add an Ethernet port to
the device, so you could link a computer to the Internet through it at up
to 10 megabits per sec-ond? ' When the Motorola guy guessed, 'Maybe $30,'
our eyes got as big as saucers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Doerr sees a hole in the line, he hits it hard and fast. Two weeks
later, four days before Christmas 1994, he was in John Malone's office in
Denver presenting a plan for a Silicon Valley startup to bring broadband
Internet over cable. Likely IPO market value in two years? $3 billion. Malone
also hits hard and fast. After a three-hour meeting, the TCI chief signed
off on the venture with-out a qualm. Doerr's chief job was to &quot;line
up some unique Silicon Valley technical genius to make it work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tapping Internet experts at Sun and around the Valley, Doerr found only
one name popping up on every list. It was that hard-core Unix Christian
libertarian netbender from outer space, Milo Medin. A 32-year-old wunderkind
manager of the multiple networks converging at NASA Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, Medin had spent the last 12 years making increasingly
crucial contributions to the Internet's growth. But uh-oh. For a week or
more, Medin refused to answer any calls from Kleiner Perkins. He says, &quot;I
thought they were a bunch of lawyers.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
DOERR WAS ATTACKING the key problem of the Internet. With the number of
host computers doubling every year since 1970 and the power of the computers
doubling every 18 months, the Internet had mastered every challenge of capacity
by multiplying cheap local routers and servers. The Net has already overtaken
the U.S. Postal Service as a carrier of mail (by one estimate, a trillion
e-mail messages compared with 180 billion postal deliveries). And the Net
similarly has pushed the number of digital data bits ahead of the total
of voice bits on the phone system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last two years, however, the traffic has taken a turn toward GIFs
and graphics, doubling the number of bits every few months. As the Internet
careens toward its destined collisions with television and telephony as
the prime sources of information, entertainment and commu-nication for the
public, the prime obstacle is bandwidth. Many in the industry have begun
to blink and bluster in the bright light of optical media and other broadband
pipes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Led by Bill Gates, they believe in middleband and ISDN. They dabble defen-sively
in TV. As a shared medium, even cable, so Gates contends, will dwin-dle
to ISDN rates as the number of customers on the system rises. But at 128-kilobit-per-sec-ond
or even at 1.54- megabit-per-second T1 rates, ISDN means picture quality
inferior to NTSC television. A shared medium linked to slow routers means
bottlenecks throughout the system if cable modems yield a thou-sandfold
increase in bit traffic beyond existing modems (up from 28.8 kilobits to
close to 30 megabits per second). On-line services will bog down in slow
access, sticky searches, jerky movement, blurred faces. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such a middleband net will not be able to maintain its current momentum
of growth and power. It will not be able to challenge television and telephony.
Yet the valuations of Internet companies depend on a continued exponential
ascent. Thus many people believe the Net is overhyped, overvalued, starved
for &quot;content.&quot; They believe Doerr's broadband revolution will
fail. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Milo Medin is Doerr's weapon to break the bottleneck. He has spent most
of his adult life overcoming crises on the Net. Medin's fast rise began
in 1987 when he led the creation of NASA's Internet and almost came to an
end in 1993, when the swarthy Serb with the spruce mustache and the piping
voice and broadband gush had barged into Washington to persuade the entire
government to em-brace the Internet protocols (TCP/IP). Fueled by this uni-versal
language, the Net had grown exponentially up a wall of worry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problems did not reach critical mass until 1994, however, when its traffic
began doubling every couple of months. Andreessen's Mosaic browser had spurred
the World Wide Web into a multiterabyte cyclone of growth and expansion,
concentrated in California. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the entire Internet converged in one room in one building at Ames.
On one side of the room were the Cisco 7000 routers and Digital gigaswitches
and Northern Telecom add-drop multiplexers of the FIX (the Federal In-ternet
Exchange), the government peering-and-exchange point, managed mostly by
Medin. On the other side was MAE West, the Internet access exchange point
for most of the private Internet, including the pullulating college and
university Nets, the regnant Internet service providers such as ANS and
Sprint, and the budding local fiefdoms of Netcom and The Well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in April 1994, the government ended its $25 million in annual Internet
subsidies and arranged for a private takeover. Among the winning bidders
were Pac-Bell and Ameritech, assigned to run two key network ac-cess points
(NAPs). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Long expecting the withdrawal of government subsi-dies to throw the Net
into chaos, many observers would welcome the ensuing crash. The private
sector would flub the job. There would be a tragedy of the commons. As in
feudal Britain, when the commonly owned lands were overgrazed and ruined,
the commonly owned Internet would suffer a glut of graphics &quot;GIFraff&quot;
and traffic jams. Sure enough it was happening. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PacBell's ATM switches from Newbridge Networks, with skimpy buffers designed
like a PBX for voice-traffic pat-terns, choked. California, the source of
two-fifths of In-ternet traffic, was down. The Western NAP jammed, and Ameritech's
Chicago NAP was also largely out of commis-sion. Bay Area e-mail from a
student on Netcom to a small business on BBN's BARNet had to steer clear
of the Ames hub and pinball through routers all the way across the country
to Sprint's NAPs in Pennsauken, N.J., or Reston, Va., and then all the way
back again. As a result, the Eastern Inter-net hubs also began to tilt.
An obvious solution seemed to be to have FIX West, the government hub at
Ames, take over the traf-fic that was fleeing the Pacific Bell NAP. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Savvy residents of Silicon Valley, the Ames management was sympathetic.
Then Medin gained the blessing of NSF networking chief Steve Wolff and enlisted
Jack Waters at MCI, a crucial Internet backbone supplier that no longer
used its PacBell connection. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Within two weeks, Medin created a system comparable in capacity and reliability
to the original FIX, with expanded Net management capabilities, power supplies,
communications ports and routing facilities. The result was a broadband
national peer-ing- and-exchange point, with a cumulative capacity of some
10 gigabits per second. It combined traffic from all the major commercial
Internet suppliers with the bitstreams from government laboratories and
agencies. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, throughout this period of crisis and turbu-lence, no ordinary
Internet customer experienced any un-toward deterioration of service. Although
Medin's contri-bution was only part of a major national effort, he became
the talk of the Net. Doerr had to sign him up. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
AS DOERR SUMS IT UP, &quot;Milo was running the largest IP net in the federal
government. When they decided to set up a White House.gov Web site, they
asked where to put it. They put it on Milo's server. Milo helped run the
fiber ring around Moscow. Internet connections for Australia and Antarctica
and for deep space probes ran through Milo. He was supplying IP connectivity
for the entire Scandinavian subcontinent. He had some 200 remote nodes.
And he ran it all with some 99.98% uptime.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
@Home CEO Will Hearst of Kleiner Perkins likes to tell a story that gives
some clues as to how this young Net nerd from NASA became a legend in his
own time: &quot;In 1988, a Finn-call him Lars-hacks his way into Milo's
comput-ers. Ticks Milo off. He does a trace route and finds his way back
to the administrator of the domain in Finland. It's an academic site. Milo
already knows Lars's IP address. You can't hide from Milo. He says to the
administrator, 'We have a problem. Please have a conversation with Lars.'
That upset the Finns, who say, 'We are not going to do that! We respect
civil liberties here! You can post a complaint if you like, but we can't
tell the guy what to do.' So Milo goes into a slow boil. Says, 'I'll give
you about 30 minutes to get that guy's files off our machine.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Nothing happens. So Milo issues an order: 'Take down Scandinavia.'
The switch is pulled. Three countries go dark. They don't notice it immediately,
but pretty soon e-mail messages are not getting returned. At last, three
senior administrators go to Lars, so the story goes, and they say: 'We don't
care if you hack into the CIA; we don't care if you bring down NSA; and
we don't mind if you abscond with all the financial bits in the Federal
Reserve. But don't mess with Milo at NASA.' <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The Finns called back Milo, said the situation had been taken care
of. Milo said fine and put the service back up.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
NOW DOERR and Medin are again confronting the perennial doomsday adven-tists
who gather on mountaintops of slightly older money and disparage the future
of the Net, talking crisis, over-load, overhype, overvaluation. Tragedy
of the Commons. The experts are chiming in. From Howard Anderson of the
Yankee Group to Andrew Seybold and Bob Metcalfe, lead-ing analysts are prophesying
a crash in 1996. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin has been there before. The answer to traffic jams on a narrowband
Net is creation of a broadband Net. Don't tell him it is not technically
possible. Who are you kidding? This is the age of the telecosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Bill Gates, though, thinks it is the age of middleband. It is obvious beyond
cavil to Gates that his regime, ruling 80% of the world's computers, is
destined to prevail. He commands a market share so overwhelming that Wash-ington's
antitrusters see it as a monopoly in need of gov-ernment dissolution. For
Gates, among the most ludicrous claims to be validated by the mantra &quot;on
the Internet,&quot; is the idea that Windows machines are an inferior minority
system difficult to digest in the prevailing habitat of Unix and TCP/IP.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To Medin, however, it is a matter of simple fact that Win-dows and NT are
awkward systems, hard to incorporate in his domains except as mere terminals.
To Medin, Unix is the heart of the Internet, the matrix of creativity in
net-working, the bearer of thousands of programs and services and tools
and scripts and languages that together comprise the pullulating fabric
of the rampantly growing Web. So far, Medin has a strong case. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Sixty percent of the managers of Internet host comput-ers use Macintoshes
as their preferred personal machine. On the Internet, as a platform for
servers, whether for the World Wide Web, e-mail, FTP, Telnet, Gopher or
NeWS, Microsoft's favored NT now ranks seventh, with a 4% share, behind
Sun, which commands a 56% share, Apple, Silicon Graphics, IBM, Digital Equip-ment
and Windows 3.1. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Around the time that Gates was assuring me of Microsoft's impregnable position
with @Home, Medin was reviewing the Seattle company's software concepts
for his new network. The @Home people wanted to adopt Microsoft's Explorer
browser if they could (TCI fa-vored its interactive TV ally), but it was
simply impossible. Explorer ran on neither Unix nor Macs, and could not
handle mul-ticasting. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's browser already worked with all the existing systems, including
the various Windows. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the influence of Marc Andreessen, who had learned net-working in the
broadband 45- megabit-per-second environment of the National Center for
Supercomputing Applications (NCSA), Netscape had long ago left behind all
the comforts of middleband. Andreessen was eager for broadband con-nections.
Gates was not even in the game that Medin and Andreessen were playing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All right, suppose that &quot;browsers are a trivial tech-nology,&quot;
as Gates told me dismissively. It was servers that Microsoft really wanted
to sell to @Home. Their Gibral-tar system was running Microsoft's somewhat
balky inter-nal Internet at a pace some four times faster than Netscape's
server might. Here, Microsoft benefited from its homogeneous cam-pus environment.
Netscape had to employ the &quot;union&quot; code-using the lowest-common-denominator
instructions to coordinate several varieties of Unix, Mac and Windows NT.
Meanwhile, Microsoft could optimize Gibraltar for all the most powerful
instructions in Windows NT, so it was much faster. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the @Home people were perplexed. How could they use Windows NT, an alien
system on the Internet, unfa-miliar to their employees or to the Internet
service-provider personnel who would work the @Home headends and oth-er
nodes? Microsoft was behaving in the Internet environ-ment as if the company
were still safe in the imperial realms of Windows desktops. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So @Home, which promises to be the most important force in the next phase
of Internet evolution, and Medin, the intellectual firebrand at the heart
of @Home, seem un-likely to embrace Microsoft's offerings. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
MILO'S DARK SHADOW OVER MICROSOFT <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As for TCI, its enthusiasm was dented a bit by the collapse of the MSN project,
in which Malone invested $125 mil-lion. But TCI has recouped its loss. Jim
Clark was persuaded to offer TCI a small share of the Netscape IPO. After
the initial public offering and the subsequent boom in Net-scape shares,
TCI's holding was worth $125 million, leav-ing TCI quite comfortable with
its new allies in Moun-tain View. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A deeper look at Medin's plans casts darker shadows in the path of Microsoft.
Asked about the notion of an Internet computer being free of Windows and
other Mi-crosoft levies, Gates stops rocking on his chair and gets to his
feet. He turns and paces urgently back and forth across his office. He gestic-ulates,
summons the history of past challenges, refers repeatedly to dumb termi-nals
and other unappetizing machines, and hurls forth rhetorical questions: &quot;Do
you want to go onto the Internet when you are doing word pro-cessing, do
you want to go on the Internet when you are using PowerPoint or Excel?&quot;
In other words, do you want to forgo all the wonderful new OLE interactions
among Microsoft programs and all the new Microsoft hot links and other forthcoming
tools when you go on the Net? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Under the pressure of Gates's energy and conviction and hypotheticals, I
answer, &quot;Of course not.&quot; But the real answer is, &quot;Sure, if
in exchange I can have a computer that outperforms a current Wintel machine
on the Net and con-tains linking capabilities comparable to OLE for one-third
the price.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates himself sketched out the answer in his famous In-ternet Tidal Wave
memo, issued in May to galvanize his company in the face of the new threat.
He pointed out that not only could he access far more information on the
In-ternet, he could also find, search and browse it more read-ily on the
Net than on a LAN or, for that matter, he might have pointed out, Gates's
own hard drive or CD-ROM. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The error of all the critics of the $500 teleputer is their assumption that
it will be inferior to current PCs. It will be, they claim, a PC minus a
fast CPU, short a high-reso-lution monitor, without a fast memory or large
drive. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This assumption misses the compounding impact of mi-crocosm and telecosm.
The advance of chip technology through Moore's Law, together with the advance
of net-work bandwidth, will endow a machine not inferior but hugely more
powerful, than the most supercharged Pentium workstation on a local-area
network linked to the Internet at ISDN speeds. The Law of the Microcosm
ordains that one-chip sys-tems will be better, not worse, than intersecting
boards strewn with devices linked by wires and buses. As Wilf Cor-rigan,
chief of LSI Logic, observes, &quot;From calculators to cellular phones,
every time a system has moved onto a sin-gle chip, it has wreaked havoc
with the existing industry.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IN PREPARING THE WAY for one-chip teleputers, Medin con-cedes that the current
Inter-net will not support broadband services. &quot;You link a broad-band
modem to the existing Internet and what you get is an impedance mismatch&quot;-a
bunch of fire hoses attached to a network of garden hoses. In order to accommodate
the fire hoses of @Home, Medin will have to enlarge the band-width of the
Net, from the humblest service provider to the NAPs at the top of the net-work
hierarchy, where the leading service providers join to &quot;peer and exchange&quot;
data. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Leasing capacity from the telephone companies, @Home will create a new broadband
network linking to the existing NAPs at MAE East in Tyson's Corner, Va.,
at the Sprint NAP in Pennsauken, N.J., and at MAE West in Mountain View.
This will expand the capacity of the so-called Internet back-bone (in fact,
an ever-shifting array of virtual vertebrae), which currently works with
maximum pipes running at 45 megabits per second. Over the next two years,
Medin plans to upgrade his backbone to 622 megabits a second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important and revolutionary, though, are Medin's plans for the local
loops and service providers of the Net. Contrary to the claims of many critics
that the Internet PC implies a return to the now-discredited model of the
main-frame and dumb terminals, @Home resolutely distributes intelligence
and memory through the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of the @Home system is ingenious hierar-chical memory management
and caching to conceal the mazes of slow routers, sluggish switches and
narrowband wires that lurk treacherously among the higher reaches of the
Internet. Indeed, when Doerr finally got through to Medin and, with Will
Hearst, first proposed cable modems to him, he said they wouldn't work.
There would be &quot;im-pedance mismatches&quot; with the hardware and software
in the rest of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;This kind of blew the air out of their tires,&quot; says Medin. &quot;But
then I told them how the system could work.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;You have to think of it as a distributed computer sys-tem. In such
systems, every processor cannot access memory at once. You build caches
and shared-memory pro-tocols and you mirror and replicate a lot of the data
so that it's always available locally. That's what you're going to have
to do on the Internet.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In other words, the Internet is a computer on a plan-et. Like a computer
on a chip, its raw bandwidth cannot handle the necessary throughput. Thus
its communica-tions depend on ingenious hierarchical memory manage-ment,
with registers, buffers, latches, caches and direct-memory access controllers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Studies of Internet use show that some 80% of the traffic is still local.
If a particular Web page is popular in a particular locality, you have to
have that page in the hard drive or even in RAM on a local server. You have
to use the multicast ca-pabilities of cable to broadcast popular information
to all ad-dresses. Above all, you have to make the system scalable. You
have to phase in bandwidth, moving fiber links and nodes deeper into neighborhoods
as demand rises. All this is per-fectly possible technically, Medin assured
Doerr. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;After I was through, they decided they had to hire me. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I still thought we would have to build all the software ourselves.
I didn't know Netscape was thinking the same way. But I went down to Netscape
and got together with Marc Andreessen, who is a friend, and we had a real
mind-meld on all this stuff. They were doing the software already. Netscape
became our main software partner. It turned out that their browser is de-signed
for multicast. And their proxy server is great for caching information and
delivering it to users on demand.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Medin thinks that a key to making the system work is to distribute lots
of cache through all the local points of presence. With this kind of network,
the teleputer might become not only far cheaper but also far superior to
today's PC. A now famous Gartner Group study shows that the average office
PC costs $40,000 over five years when you factor in software and network
maintenance. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps 75% of cumulative PC costs now come from staff support. @Home will
supply tech support, mainte-nance and storage more efficiently, whether
centrally by phone or at local headends. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a glimpse of the future, visit Boston College, where cable modems supplied
by Continental Cablevision are already becoming &quot;addictive&quot; to
many students and professors. On the basis of this experience, Forrester
Re-search is now predicting sales of some 7 million cable modems by the
turn of the century. Medin thinks this es-timate is conservative. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With cable modems you will come to demand wireless connectivity throughout
your home or small office, so that your teleputers can link to the Net wherever
they are with-out plugging them in to a connector or dialing up a connection.
Only cable can accomodate such demands. &quot;Internet PCs fit with @Home
like ice cream and hot fudge,&quot; sums up Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the big question: Is it possible to build such a machine? &quot;Sure
it is,&quot; says Medin. &quot;Just take a Sony PlayStation, essentially
based on a one-chip ASIC, and re-place the CD-ROM connec-tor with an Ethernet
adapter. You'll get 3D graphics, Dol-by III sound, a 30-megahertz CPU controller,
a memory-access controller, and a 10-megabit-per-second 10BaseT link to
your cable headend.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
C O N S T E R N A T I O N    I N S I D E    I N T E L <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here the new paradigm be-gins to threaten the cause and complacency not
only of Bill Gates but also of the other master of Wintel, Andy Grove. When
I ask him about such an ASIC so-lution to the problem of the $500 PC, consternation
breaks briefly through the surface of his bonhomie. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He snaps: &quot;I won't comment on the fantasies of Brian Halla,&quot; the
former Intel manager now executive vice-president of product marketing at
LSI Logic. Yet LSI Logic offers precisely Medin's PlayStation so-lution
to the problem of cheap teleputers, free of Wintel code. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
LSI Logic is the supplier of the workhorse chip for the PlayStation. Using
some 2 million transistors, this integrated chip combines a 30- megahertz
Silicon Graphics MIPS processor, a 60-MIPS geometry transfer engine, a direct-mem-ory
access unit, and Sony's proprietary MDEC device (for hybrid MPEG and JPEG
decompression) for full-screen video playback. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For a Netstation, the MDEC would be replaced with the appropriate decompression
engines, and added to those would be Reed-Solomon and Viterbi error correction
to-gether with a cable modem module that receives 64-QAM signals and sends
QPSK. Based on its experience with the PlayStation chip, which LSI Logic
will be producing in volume on the world's first commercial 0.25-micron
fab-rication lines, LSI Logic estimates that it could sell a tele-puter
on a chip for around $50 in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This machine is the consummation of a long LSI Logic strategy. In the mid-1980s,
the company suffered a serious crisis as NEC, Fujitsu and Toshiba all opened
fast-turnaround design centers in the U.S. to deliver high-speed, high-density
gate arrays. At the same time, LSI launched a spinoff, Headland Tech-nology,
to make chipsets for PCs in competition with Chips &amp; Technologies and
VLSI Technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Supporting Headland,&quot; says Halla, &quot;was like walk-ing around
with an open artery. Intel remorselessly sucks out all the margins in PC
hardware.&quot; Chastened by the Japanese in gate ar-rays, LSI learned from
Grove not to take on Intel in PC markets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To a company special-izing in gate arrays and chipsets, these lessons were
not inspiring. Then Wilf Corrigan, LSI's salty founder and CEO-a Silicon
Valley legend from Liverpool who previously played key roles at Fairchild
and Motorola-underwent a triple bypass. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
People talked of retiring him, giving him a title with a new consortium,
U.S. Memories, where he might have learned not to compete with the Koreans
in DRAMs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two weeks after surgery, however, Corrigan returned to work at LSI and developed
a new strategy that would transcend the strategies of both Intel and the
Japanese. Under the new plan, LSI built state-of-the-art fabrication facilities
and design tools that could enable creation of a software library of &quot;Core-Ware.&quot;
CoreWare programs would generate a large variety of key functions, from
CPU kernels to signal processors and graphics engines, that could be deployed
in weeks on single special-purpose chips tailored to high-volume applications
mostly outside the Wintel ambit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By 1995, this strategy was bearing rich fruit. The com-pany announced it
had developed a fab process that could place some 49 million transistors
on a single sliver of silicon some 200 millimeters square. LSI released
a series of bellwether high-volume devices that moved the company beyond
the path of the PC, out into the network and into the consumer appliance.
The Sony PlayStation chip ran 1995's most successful CD game machine. LSI's
MPEG-2 decoder will go in the next version of RCA-Thomson's hugely successful
direct-broadcast satellite receiver. LSI also sup-plied the first ATM segmentation
and reassembly chip for several key equipment companies, and the first 100-megabit
switched-Ethernet solution for a fast Ethernet pioneer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Looking beyond Intel, this experience led Corrigan and Halla to conclude
that their company commanded all the crucial CoreWare ready to deploy a
teleputer on a single device manufacturable in volume for about $50. Attesting
that Halla's view is not fantasy is the success of the Sony PlayStation,
now on sale for $299, leaving room to buy a monitor and still stay under
$500. LSI also has several as-yet-unannounced design wins for cable modem
chips aimed at the markets to be opened by @Home. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel's response to such capabilities is its currently embattled program
for native signal processing. NSP allows software implementation of real-time
functions performed in special-purpose hardware under the &quot;CoreWare&quot;
model. As Grove points out, DSPs and com-pression chips may be getting cheaper
all the time, but from Indeo video to Proshare teleconferencing to Intel's
new Vertical Blanking Interval webware, NSP comes free of charge-if you
are already buying a Pentium (and you prob-ably are). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But no sooner will the CPU suck in another real-time role than a new virtual
temptation will glimmer on the hori-zon. For reaching the ever-receding
real-time goals-from continuous speech recognition to 3D rendering-the Core-Ware
approach will prevail, at least until the arrival of the new super broadband
mediaprocessors from MicroUnity and other Silicon Valley firms. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS on these far frontiers of tech-nology, John Doerr
will launch his five smooth stones as the foundation for a new industry.
With Intuit leading the move to Internet financial services, Netscape pioneering
Internet software, Macromind supplying the authoring tools for multimedia,
@Home providing the bandwidth and Sun offering Java and UltraSPARC, the
entente is on its way. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But perhaps Doerr's most important stone is Sun. Asked to name the key influences
in TCI's shift toward the Net, John Malone mentions Doerr first, hesitates
and then stress-es the role of Scott McNealy, chairman and CEO of Sun Microsystems.
Relentlessly, year after year, McNealy would travel to Denver and give his
pitch to Malone: Buy sets of Sun servers and link them to your headends
in order to supply data services. At first Malone resisted. &quot;Two-way
data,&quot; he used to say, &quot;is not a business that I want to be in.&quot;
But as the Internet grew, McNealy's argument gained new force. In late 1994,
it triumphed. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Malone now believes that two-way broadband com-munications is the heart
of his business. For a total in-vestment of less than $188 million, Doerr
claims @Home can launch a business yielding at least $500 million in cu-mulative
revenues by the year 2000. Later this year, the Sunnyvale system will be
up and running. Weeks later, depending on cooperation from other cable companies,
the entire state of Con-necticut will move onto broadband two-way cable.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At that point, all the other cable companies will accelerate their dri-ve
to upgrade their facilities to ac-commodate the gold rush. By the turn of
the century, @Home hopes to extend service to all the major urban and suburban
centers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Sprint, TCI leads a cable group that is paying $2 billion for wireless
personal communications service (PCS) spectrum across the country. Through
New York-based Teleport Communications and other bypass providers, TCI and
other cable firms already command fiber-optic rings through most major metropolitan
areas. With cable providing broadband backhaul for PCS, @Home's founders
think the company will emerge as the backbone for a full-service digital
communications network, including high-resolution teleconferencing, on-demand
films and other pay-per-view video, local news and school listings, classi-fied
advertisements, World Wide Web resources, and mul-timedia programming. TCI
itself is furiously upgrading and streamlining all its billing systems to
accommodate this rich transactional environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Z E R O   M A R G I N A L    M A G I C <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, as Nathan Myhrvold ex-plains, is the extension of
the computer model of flat-rate pricing into the field of communications.
When you buy a PC, you purchase its MIPS and bits essentially at a flat
rate. The average cost per MIP or bit of memory you use is de-termined by
how much you use the machine. The marginal cost is zero. As a result, people
have a powerful incentive to use computers as intensively and creatively
as possible. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This flat-rate pricing effect-where incremental costs are essentially zero-largely
explains the huge success of the general-purpose PC and the companies supplying
it with software and peripherals. Faced with a zero marginal cost of incremental
use, PC owners channel as much of their information processing, education
and entertainment as possible through the PC. Flat-rate pricing makes the
PC a dire threat to all contiguous industries and related functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, on the Internet model, you will pay a flat rate for bandwidth.
Again marginal costs will be zero. Average cost will respond to the extent
of usage rather than to a Public Utilities Commission tariff or some per-minute
charge. As Myhrvold points out, this approach will give you a tremendous
incentive to exploit bandwidth as fully as you can, channeling as much communication
as possible away from systems that charge incrementally and toward flat-rate
systems. In the end, nearly all communications will gravitate toward the
Internet model, and companies will prosper to the extent that they can ally
themselves with this tremendous force of creativity and economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Myhrvold now says that bandwidth is growing at the same pace as Moore's
Law. Gates, too, though long alert to the effects of exponentials in semiconductors,
is strange-ly blind to the faster trajec-tory of communications. He finds
the Internet a big sur-prise: &quot;Who predicted it?&quot; he asks. &quot;Let's
find the guy and make him king.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But by any measure- nodes, total bandwidth, traf-fic- the Internet has been
dou-bling every year since 1970, and many people have pre-dicted that it
would come to dominate communications. I prophesied in 1989 that it would
usurp television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today I believe the band-width tidal wave will sweep away the notions of
Gates and Myhrvold of a smooth middleband transition for Microsoft and its
boob-tube collaborators. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Increasingly released from regulatory restrictions, band-width is now expanding
far faster than MIPS and bits (see <I>Forbes ASAP</I>, &quot;The Bandwidth
Tidal Wave,&quot; Dec. 5, 1994). Over the next five years, for example,
@Home will increase the bandwidth to home- and small-business computers
by a factor of thousands. While Moore's Law doubles com-puter power every
18 months, the law of the telecosm, by the most conservative possible measure,
doubles total band-width every 12 months. This adds up. Over the next decade,
computers will im-prove a hundredfold while bandwidth will expand a thou-sandfold.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until this year, the computer and software industries have drafted behind
Moore's Law, while hiding behind what Roger McNamee has dubbed &quot;Moron's
Law&quot;-the telecom regulations that stifle bandwidth expansion. The industry
thus has thrived by employing MIPS and bits as a replacement for bandwidth
by using compression, de-compression, switching speed, and logic circuitry
to make up for the constrained bandwidth of public networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Grove capped off this tradition in early October, in a memorable keynote
address, following South African pres-ident Nelson Mandela to the podium,
at the Telecom 95 quadrennial exposition in Geneva. Grove wowed the large
audience of telco potentates with an on-stage real-time demonstration of
Intel's Proshare teleconferencing tech-nology. And yet, what chiefly struck
the viewer was the mediocrity of the partial-screen facial images. They
were far lower in resolution than ordinary television. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As long as the pictures are inferior to TV images, PC teleconferencing will
remain chiefly a niche or a stunt. As bandwidth expands powerful-ly over
the next decade, it will seem increasingly perverse to substitute processing
for band-width, and more and more inviting to substitute band-width for
processing. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The logic of MIPS and bandwidth works both ways. Not only can processing
make up for bandwidth, but bandwidth, as Claude Shan-non pointed out in
1948, can serve as a substitute for switching and other comput-er functions.
With bandwidth now expanding faster than processing speeds, new ar-chitectures
will prevail by substituting bandwidth for MIPS and bits. Today, the bulk
of bandwidth to homes is coaxial cable laid over the last 25 years by the
cable tele-vision industry. Exploiting that bandwidth for the Inter-net
is the single greatest opportunity in the history of in-formation technology.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
HAVING ASCERTAINED that Doerr had been meeting reg-ularly with all the pioneers
of the new paradigm that Andreessen was &quot;mind-melding&quot; with Medin,
and that Mal-one had been consulting with Doerr and McNealy, I ask McNealy
whether he has talked to Medin. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;No,&quot; he answers, &quot;I have not talked with Medin at all ...
since lunch on Wednesday. But back then he and I had sore necks from basically
agreeing with what the other was saying. We're fighting like crazy to become
the standard platform for Medin's environment. Our companies are in-credibly
well aligned. We have a list of about 12 engineering efforts that we are
undertaking and driving at Medin's request. The power of a network comes
from the number of nodes times the bandwidth. By this measure, the @Home
opportunity is as big as there is.&quot; McNealy revealed that the day before
in his office at Sun, he saw the demo of &quot;a diskless, CD-less, floppyless,
OS-less computer, and it was great. It had just about every bus, serial
and parallel and S-bus, and every kind of interface you can imagine. With
connectors on all four sides, it was a model for what I call a zero-administration
client. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Consider: If you give a user a disk drive, a CD, a floppy, an OS and
16 megabytes of memory, you have made him, whether he wants it or not, a
system administrator. He has so many resources to manage. What they showed
me yesterday was a virtual machine written in Java, and it booted up instantly
off flash ROM and ran like crazy be-cause the virtual machine rides so close
on the hardware.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Echoing Medin and Corrigan, McNealy evoked the future of the teleputer:
&quot;Put a touch screen on it and make it a kiosk, put a large screen on
it and make it a worksta-tion, put in an infrared detector and make it a
set-top box, put a joystick on it and make a game machine, put a cable modem
or an ISDN port on it and make it a PC or a digital phone. You never run
out of disk space; you never have to back it up; it's mirrored so you never
lose your files. You have an uninterruptible power supply. Your phone or
cable line is much more reliable than your hard drive on your PC. You get
used to the security of the system with no disks to corrupt and with Java
programs that execute only in a virtual machine and cannot invade your system.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
McNealy might have added, in ecumenical concern for Larry Ellison's mother,
&quot;Put in some Oracle code and you have a terrific, cheap database client
in an emerging world of far-flung databases.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the participants in the new regime agree. Combined with a broadband
network, the teleputer will be more flex-ible and powerful than existing
PCs. Rolling out both the network and the teleputer will be the central
activity in the industry over the next two years. Responding to it will
be the principal challenge to Gates and Grove, and possibly a route of redemption
for their companies. All the leading figures in this Silicon Valley renaissance
have endured recent periods of trial and failure. Malone suf-fered the collapse
of his Bell Atlantic merger in 1994 and the long stagnation of his stock.
Corrigan suffered physical collapse and the slump of his company. McNealy
endured a long tunnel of shrinking market share as his SuperSPARC processor
proved too complex to keep pace with rivals. Clark of Netscape lost influence
at Silicon Graphics, the company he had founded, and finally had to leave
in order to retain his self-respect. Even Doerr lost his touch for several
years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For Bill Gates, however, business life has been an al-most unrelenting ascent
toward riches untold for one so young. In the end, his success has made
him seem a bionic business leader leached of his humanity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
His company has appeared to government and to competitors alike as a monopoly
threat, targeting existing rivals and systematically suppressing them, rather
than creating new products and industries. Much the same is said of Intel.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps this is the time for the Wintel team to face a domestic challenge.
From it they may well emerge stronger. Without them, it is clear, the Internet
will be weaker. Only from the crucible of competition between paradigms
can emerge a robust and redemptive new economy of information. <BR>

<H3>In 1995, Internet stories trumped even O.J. The Net will have a far
happier ending. </H3>

<BR>
Well, it had to happen. As the Internet emerges as the central nervous system
of global capitalism, the Luddite left is bursting into &quot;flames&quot;
against the microcosm and telecosm, against interlinked computers and the
global radiance of electromagnetic communications. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This rising resistance resonates with the press coverage that has long lavished
attention on the excesses of the Net. Richard Shaffer of the Computer Letter
counts 39,158 Internet stories during the first three quarters of 1995,
beating O.J. by some 15,000 citations. Much of the coverage has been lurid.
For psychedelic visions of virtual reality, the media have exalted Jaron
Lanier in dreadlocks and bankruptcy above Bob Metcalfe, creator of Ethernet,
or Gordon Moore, inventor of IC processing, or Charles Kao, father of fiber
optics, all of whom reshaped the boundaries of human possibility. Computer
viruses and Net porn win headlines and magazine covers that elude the creators
of vast new computer powers, such as RSA encryption or the World Wide Web
or new tools of chip fabrication at the quarter-micron level. Last August,
Windows 95, a modest advance in operating systems, exploded across the press
and the airwaves as if the entire media had been preempted for a Microsoft
infomercial. No wonder befuddled academics, politicians and book publishers
gain a grotesquely distorted view of the industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Tom Peters's first Forbes ASAP interview (March 29, 1993), he predicted
that the '90s would see a fabulous unfolding of new technology, accompanied
with increasing outbreaks of technophobia, Ludditism and Marxism. Alvin
Toffler greeted the initial readers of Wired with a similar dual prophecy
of networked marvels, foiled by a multifront war against the Third Wave.
Once again, Peters and Toffler may well be right, as from Hollywood to Harvard,
America's brainlords rebel against computer technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In his pungent new book War of the Worlds, Mark Slouka joins the rising
chorus of resistance. Slouka finds it all a &quot;kind of lie.&quot; Like
a &quot;speech of Ronald Reagan&quot; or a spiritual vision from the &quot;religious
right,&quot; the virtual world is increasingly usurping reality and identity
itself. &quot;Rather than doing away with the couch potato, the telecomputer
has actually created a new, more tenacious variety of tuber: the individual
who swivels from the television screen to computer monitor without missing
a beat . . . .&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, Sandra Bullock writhes in anguish in the sinister clutches of The
Net, with a blond, predatory, arachnoid Bill Gates (using &quot;Gateway&quot;
software) masterminding the Web. Similar chimeras recur in antitech crusades.
Bathed in the ultraviolet frequencies of sunlight, humans throughout the
history of the species have raced through a planetary magnetic field of
half a gauss in power on a terrestrial sphere charged by worldwide lightning
strikes a hundred times a second to a capacitive level of 100 volts per
meter of height. Yet Paul Brodeur and other electrophobes panic at power
lines, power plants, cathode-ray tubes, microprocessors, cellular antennas
and other high-tech oscillators with an impact on humans measurable only
in millionths of a gauss. They defy the fact that around the world use of
electricity correlates almost perfectly with greater longevity. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, despite the higher longevity and the globally spreading jobs
and riches springing from high technology, pseudoeconomists prattle endlessly
about the growing gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; Publishers sign up other disgruntled nerds to write hymns to
noble savagery and gardening. And from the fever swamps, a Marxist enrage
posts bombs through the mail and addled editors detonate them in the pages
of the Washington Post. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such fears and fantasies have always afflicted the course of human innovation
and progress. With life expectancies rising eight years in the developed
countries and 22 years in the Third World since 1950, people have more time
to lash out at industrial benefactors who gain wealth and create it from
sources hard to comprehend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Misconceptions about the Internet, however, also abound in more savvy circles.
From Stewart Alsop's Agenda conference to the Internet Society, serious
critics are emerging to predict that the network itself will bog down and
degrade, jammed by traffic and trivia. Often unconsciously, these critics
feed upon a spurious vision of capitalist ecology. Constantly recycling
Garrett Hardin's &quot;The Tragedy of the Commons&quot; as a theory of the
Internet, writers such as Clifford Stoll in Silicon Snake Oil, and others
from publications such as the New York Times to the National Review and
the Atlantic, predict that the Web, as a public good, will be overgrazed,
like the commonly owned fields of feudal Britain. Each herdsman or entrepreneur
gains from adding to his herd or bandwidth, beating rivals to the remaining
grass or spectrum, until congestion ruins the common space. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the epitome of a capitalist commons, the Internet, according to the critics'
predictions, will collapse under the impact of this law, clogged with traffic
and polluted with porn and violence. As a precursor, the same writers cite
citizens band radio, an earlier fad that rose meteorically and collapsed
ignominiously when, as they see it, millions of middle- and lower-class
hoi polloi rushed in and polluted the bandwidth without renewing it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the resistance converges many streams of reaction. In general,
the &quot;humanist&quot; opponents mistake the Internet for a continuation
of television technology. Thus they ascribe to the Internet the very flaws
that they find in TV -- crudeness, violence, porn, entertainment for &quot;diverting
ourselves to death&quot; -- and extend to the computer the old and mostly
valid arguments of Neil Postman and Jerry Mander against the idiot box.
Some of the other critics of the Internet benefit from TV and fear the Web
will replace their familiar tube. The executives of media companies are
mostly baffled by the new technology. Paralyzed by market research, as Jim
Barksdale, CEO of Netscape puts it, &quot;They are trying to build bridges
by counting the swimmers.&quot; A Washington lobbyist for a long-distance
carrier wonders poignantly if &quot;America is ready for all this bandwidth.&quot;
Baby Bells spurn the Internet to fund Hollywood films and TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Blinded by the robber-baron image assigned in U.S. history courses to the
heroic builders of American capitalism, many critics see Bill Gates as a
menacing monopolist. They mistake for greed the gargantuan tenacity of Microsoft
as it struggles to assure the compatibility of its standard with tens of
thousands of applications and peripherals over generations of dynamically
changing technology (avoiding the dialectical babel of the more open Unix,
for example). They see the Internet as another arena likely to be dominated
by Microsoft and a few giant media companies, increasing the wealth of Wall
Street at the expense of the stultified masses of consumers and opening
an ever-greater gap between the &quot;information rich&quot; and the &quot;information
poor.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Focused on the summits of the industry -- CEO s&eacute;ances among media
conglomerates and software kings -- all the critics can foster the impression
that the Internet is a questionable, unpromising venue, vulnerable to monopoly
and trash, thereby vindicating the Luddites and the Cassandras. From the
beginning of its civilian eruption, however (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The
Issaquah Miracle,&quot; June 7, 1993), the Net has risen from the bottom
up rather than from the top down; by nature, it is a heterarchy rather than
a hierarchy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To get a view of the future of the Net, let us turn aside from Herb Allen's
golfing groves and Bill Gates's mansion and Louis Gerstner's &quot;net-centric&quot;
revelation, and visit some of the fertile bottomlands where the Web is growing
fastest. Here no robber barons or monopolists come into view and there are
no signs at all of an impending slide toward tragedy and decline. Here the
negative externalities of the degraded commons fall before the huge positive
externalities of Moore's Law and Metcalfe's Law, the microcosm and the telecosm,
where smaller transistors yield exponentially more efficient machines and
the value of networks rises by the square of the power of all the computers
attached to them. Governing the positive externalities of the Internet is
the convergence of these forces, compounded by the creativity of entrepreneurs.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps such a combinatorial explosion explains the mind of Avi Freedman
of Net Access. Among the vanguard of the armies of the Internet, Freedman
is a classic American entrepreneur, entirely alien to the megalithic visions
of the critics. As an Internet service provider (ISP), Freedman supplies
the Philadelphia area with access to the goods and services of this global
ganglion of networks at a flat rate of between $12.50 and $20 per month,
depending on the services chosen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access still operates chiefly out of his cellar in a marginally middle-class
suburb of Wyndmoor. The street bristles with wires, transformer nodes, terminal
boxes and power lines, many of them converging on the duplex red-brick bungalow
where Freedman lives with his wife in an apartment above a basement crammed
floor-to-ceiling with multiplying racks of electromagnetic conversion and
processing gear for computers and telecom. These technologies are all oscillating
and radiating like crazy in the spirit of their hyperkinetic owner, who
is multiplexing Internet insights between his cellular phone and an attentive
audience of aspiring ISPs from western Pennsylvania and geek students visiting
from the University of Pennsylvania, gathered at his door next to the power-line
link. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this an entrepreneurial dream, or a carcinogenic nightmare out of the
muddled pages of Paul Brodeur? Avi is too busy to give the issue much thought.
Extending business service to New York City, Washington, D.C., and Chicago,
overflowing his basement, he is now moving his operations to a collocation
cage at the Philadelphia central office of MFS (Metropolitan Fiber Systems)
where he has just turned up a T-3 fiber circuit (45 megabits per second)
direct to MAE East, the major East Coast Internet exchange point. From Seattle
to San Jose, top companies are besieging him with multimillion-dollar buyout
offers, but looking to the future and its promise, Freedman calculates that
he can't afford to sell. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With only 4,000 customers, however, Net Access hardly seems to pose a threat
to such local colossi as Bell Atlantic and Comcast, now searching the world
for &quot;content&quot; opportunities and looming ever larger on Rodeo Drive.
Yet Ray Smith and Brian Roberts should pay attention to what is going on
in Freedman's teeming mind and basement. Millions of PC owners may well
become part-time Internet service providers in the future -- as their home
and small-business PCs supply content for others, perhaps beginning with
teleconferencing and telecommuting activities that will soon dwarf Hollywood
in volume. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
One of the students hanging on Freedman's words, for example, is Meng-Weng
Wong, whose personal Web page at Penn attracts some 35,000 hits a week with
its restaurant reviews, film criticisms, Philadelphia maps, technology insights
and other delectations. Drawing wide media attention, from Forbes ASAP to
Scandinavian TV (a crew is visiting this very day from the Netherlands),
Wong has now established a server at Net Access, pobox.com, which supplies
his clients with a permanent Internet address wherever they may go, and
he is developing a Web-page design business. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Responding to the onrush of innovative customers like Wong, the configuration
of Freedman's bottom-up operations offers clues to the future shape of the
industry. A portly, perspiring, blond, balding geek-genius bursting with
monologic humor and street smarts -- hardly full-duplex (scant signs of
upstream flow) -- Freedman has just hustled past his 26th birthday. He has
been deep in computers since age eight, when a prescient uncle gave him
a book on the Basic programming language at a Seder. Within months he was
entrenched among the information rich, opening an unbridgeable gap in computer
savvy between himself and nearly all of the other five billion inhabitants
of the planet. If you think you are going to catch up, forget it. By the
age of 12, in 1982, he was an active user of e-mail and Usenet news and
familiar with the abstruse command codes of the Unix operating system that
ran on his father's DEC PDP-11. Freedman senior, a pulmonary physician,
inherited the machine indirectly from Bell Labs, where it had been employed
as a Usenet news hub until displaced by a VAX. <BR>

In 1986, still a teenager, Freedman began exploring the uses of Unix machines
for commercial databases and discovered to his surprise that serious businessmen
would give him gouts of money to get help with their computers. Eventually,
he was earning &quot;lawyers' rates&quot; (his mother is a Philadelphia
tax attorney) for work he found &quot;amazingly routine&quot; and &quot;even
fun.&quot; Nonetheless, after high school, his parents sent him off to college
in Massachusetts, where his computer skills were underappreciated. He returned
after a few weeks to get a job at the National Software Testing Labs in
the Philadelphia suburb of Conshohocken before enlisting at nearby Temple
University, which he chose because it offered more freedom for computer
experiments and consulting work than the more prestigious Penn a few miles
away. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After arriving, he discovered that Temple's computer lab also commanded
a superb resource: bandwidth, in the form of a nearly empty T-1 line linking
to the Internet at 1.544 megabits per second. Already computer rich, he
was becoming communications rich as well. In Avi Freedman, Temple's department
of computer science got rather more than it bargained for. Realizing that
the available PCs were network hostile and the lab's MicroVAXes ran VMS
rather than Unix, Freedman used his savings to buy five secondhand Sun 3
workstations for $600 apiece. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In short order, Freedman began his career as an Internet service provider
and &quot;professional geek,&quot; albeit unpaid. Soon he had some 100 students
as users, mostly cavorting through games of Multiuser Dungeons (MUD). Temple's
address, supplied by Freedman -- bigboy.cis.temple.edu -- became known far
and wide as a hive of MUD activity. Temple's computer science professors
began to rebel at this untoward distinction, particularly when they found
that lost in the crypts and catacombs of the Net, their charges were virtually
unreachable for assignments in higher-level languages. Freedman was forced
to close down local access to the game portions of the server during daytime
hours. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman has given some thought to the problem of &quot;how to civilize
young, intelligent teenage males.&quot; He concludes, &quot;You have got
to get them interested.&quot; He says the students playing MUD at least
were learning Unix commands, &quot;a better way to get a job than mastering
the Pascal programming language,&quot; which was then being taught in the
regular classes. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a student, working with Prof. Yuan Shi and other Temple professors, Freedman
developed a toolkit for distributed processing on Suns and presented a paper
in London in 1989 at a conference on computer-aided software engineering.
As his time at Temple drew to a close, he began contemplating graduate school.
&quot;Everyone was very surprised that anyone who could do anything on the
outside was going to graduate school,&quot; he says, &quot;but Stony Brook
on Long Island offered me a nice job as a research assistant in the lab
and I went up there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After graduating from Temple, Freedman also encountered the harsh facts
of life in the world beyond college computer laboratories. With their local-area
networks and T-1 links to the Internet, universities offered a revel for
budding cybernauts. Marc Andreessen of Netscape discovered a similar disjunction
between college lab and residential communications. At LAN's end was a communications
cliff and a bandwidth scandal. Most homes and offices connected to the world
only through twisted-pair, four-kilohertz, copper telephone wires. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In October of 1992, Freedman became an ISP chiefly to continue his college
revels by chasing bandwidth. Twenty-three at the time and engaged, he could
still recall his days in high school and remembered how much he had learned
from the Internet through his father's PDP-11. He began to fill up his basement
with second-hand Sun machines, mostly at prices well below new Pentium levels,
all using Berkeley Unix, equipped by Bill Joy with fast TCP/IP (Transmission
Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) for Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with 40 customers from local bulletin board systems, Freedman
provided access through the serial ports of a single SPARCstation IPC with
a 200-megabyte hard drive and 12 megabytes of memory that he purchased secondhand
for $1,500. The serial ports ran up to 38.4 kilobits per second, linked
to 14.4-kilobit-per-second Zoom and Supra modems connected to POTS (plain
old telephone service) outside lines running from the phone company's central
office. Costing a total of some $4,000, the system worked well enough until
his clientele began to multiply and the modems balked at continual resetting.
In April 1992, he bought a 16-port Iolan terminal server that answered the
phones and connected subscribers to the Sun servers, which supplied e-mail,
Usenet news, Gopher searches, Telnet and file-transfer services in a Unix
environment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In June of 1992 emerged the menace of competition. A local entrepreneur
launched Voicenet by simply linking a 386 PC with a modem to each phone
line through a terminal server. Charging fees several times higher than
Net Access's, Voicenet thrived through the device of hiring two full-time
people to scan in pictures from porno magazines for what Freedman describes
as the &quot;sticky keyboard set.&quot; Eventually the &quot;adult&quot;
bulletin board service enlisted some 5,000 members paying $4 per hour to
peruse images. Nonetheless, Voicenet protested what it called Net Access's
predatory low pricing, a $12.50 to $20 flat rate per month with no full-time
employees to pay. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the early years of the Net's development, the late '80s, the Internet
business outside campuses and corporations was a small-time and sometimes
tacky trade. In 1992, the entire Net comprised a million linked computers,
many of them in university and government labs. It wasn't until November
1993 that Net Access acquired a dedicated 56-kilobit line for direct connection
to an official network access point. Costing $400 per month, it multiplexed
22 dial-up modems among 250 users. With the Mosaic World Wide Web browser
yet to catch on outside the universities, Net Access did not even have to
supply SLIP (serial line interface protocol) or PPP (point-to-point protocol)
accounts, which shield the user from the details of Unix. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman, however, saw the need for new technology to link people to the
full resources of the Net without having to know abstruse Unix commands.
&quot;As a professional geek, writing code is my true calling,&quot; he
says, adding that he threw himself into this work. Although the program
was eclipsed by Mosaic, Lynx and other approaches, he still believes that
his software provided easier access to the Internet, complete with the ability
to trace routes and &quot;ping&quot; remote machines. Enabling users to
log in to the program in 1992, he put Net Access on the technological forefront
of ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The largest challenge for an ISP, then and now, is managing the floods of
bits engulfing a Usenet news server at a rate of some 500 megabytes per
day, five news articles per second, each with a unique identification that
has to be scanned to assure that the news is fresh and not duplicated. The
heart of the Internet until the arrival of the World Wide Web -- and still
cherished more than the Web by many Internet veterans -- Usenet is the huge
collection of textual bulletin boards and other information troves and exchanges
from which the communities of the Net exfoliate. As Steve Willens of Livingston
Enterprises puts it: &quot;This is the real source of the Internet as we
know it and the challenge that forced the development of technology specialized
for the Net&quot; -- notably Livingston communications servers that linked
modems to the Net through fast comports functioning with compression at
115.2 kilobits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1994, Freedman recognized he had a major business on his hands. He decided
to lease a T-1 line from PREP-NET (Pennsylvania Research and Economic Partnership
Network), which required a prepayment of $1,000 per month. With 50 phone
lines and modems and 500 users, he broke all ties with Stony Brook and began
hiring people to handle a rising tide of traffic and a surging demand for
technical support. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That summer, he had three full-time people: &quot;Myself, my wife, Gail,
and my 20-year-old brother, Noam. Working with him made me realize why people
pay me so much money as a consultant [up to $150 an hour]. He served as
a kind of Avi echo, intuitively knowing what I wanted and when.&quot; A
student in computer science at the University of Chicago, Noam is in the
process of extending the business to that city, while Avi has established
points of presence in New York and Washington, D.C. He has hired five Net
Access customers, none with college degrees, to provide technical support
full time as the number of users has climbed at a pace of some 15% per month
since the end of 1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For links to other cities, Freedman relied on advice from telecommunications
consultant Gordon Jacobson, a Penn alumnus who maintains close links to
the Penn school of engineering, where his father graduated. With Jacobson's
help, Freedman is ending 1995 with a fiber circuit connecting him to MAE
East at 45 megabits a second, a 10-megabit-per-second link to Sprint's network-access
point, and more than half a dozen point-to-point T-1 lines, all for well
under half of the normally tariffed prices for these services. With increasing
broadband connectivity, Net Access commands more than half as much bandwidth
at the nerve centers of the Net as Netcom, which has 50 times more customers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Though indispensable, technology alone cannot sustain a successful ISP.
It is people that make the vital difference. If Freedman had originally
hired people to perform the work that he did himself part-time -- &quot;keeping
the machines running, maintaining software, recovering from disasters, installing
and tuning equipment and circuits&quot; -- he would have incurred expenses
of some $100,000 per year and his financial model would have collapsed.
The reason many corporations are so slow to develop Internet programs is
not the lack of equipment but the dearth of personnel. The large companies
pursuing Net Access did not care about Freedman's rooms full of gear. They
were after Freedman himself. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's entrepreneurship and technology ride on a tide of other enterprise
by the suppliers of Internet gear. These, too, are not huge telephone company
equipment manufacturers or rising software monopolists but mostly small
or medium-size companies, led by young entrepreneurs, fighting to survive
in the most intensely competitive arena of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An Internet service provider must begin by supplying modems through which
the outside world can connect to his offerings. With millions of home customers
who dwarf the ISP modem volumes, U.S. Robotics is currently ascendant in
most ISPs, but Freedman spurns them for cheaper devices from Multi-Tech.
These modems connect to a Xylogics terminal server that authenticates the
name and password combination entered by the user and validates the caller
as legitimate. Then the customer enters Net Access's local-area network
linking a set of Sun Microsystems servers that supply World Wide Web, Gopher,
Usenet, e-mail, file transfer, Telnet and other Internet services. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Net Access is unusual for an ISP, since few use Xylogics equipment. Recently
bought out by Bay Networks, Xylogics supplied nearly all the terminal servers
for the university market, and it still shies away from the tumultuous world
of ISPs. These customers mostly use Livingston products that run a security
protocol named Radius (remote authentication dial-in user services). Channeling
the bits around the ISP's internal net and on to other networks are banks
of routers, also often built by Cisco or Livingston (although Freedman originally
chose Morningstar because it was cheaper). Linking a particular ISP to other
ISPs and network access points are T-1 cables running at 1.544 megabits
per second through multiplexing and demultiplexing and conditioning equipment.
These functions are performed by DSU-CSUs (data service units-channel service
units) made by such companies as TxPort, Adtran, General DataComm and ADC
Kentrox. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman insists on the Law of the Microcosm in choosing all his equipment
and in making all his projects for expansion. Since his study of distributed
computing at Temple, he has everywhere cherished duplication and redundancy
and cheap components over centralization and scale economies. He at first
bought a nine-gigabyte drive from Micropolis. Now he regrets the decision
and is replacing it with five two-gigabyte drives (more I/O [input/output],
redundancy and reliability). &quot;The more spindles the better,&quot; he
says. He buys lots of cheap secondhand Suns rather than one powerful server.
He criticizes some of the larger ISPs, such as Netcom, for centralizing
their servers and technical support. It causes bottlenecks and delays, he
says, and opens the system to crashes if any of the communication lines
go down. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Freedman's rule is to provide service as locally as possible. He believes
ISPs with fully equipped local network sites, rather than mere communications
nodes like Netcom's, will prevail. Like most small ISPs, Freedman is wedded
to flat-rate pricing, though his accounts of altercations with customers
who want to resell or overgraze his commons may undermine confidence that
this pricing regime can survive into the future. But managing flat-rate
prices is a core competence of the ISPs. Believing that bits will flee toward
flat rates, Freedman says MCI will fail in its plans to transform Internet
pricing models by adding some as yet unannounced scale of measured usage
based on time, packets or both. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is Freedman's model scalable, or is it doomed as he grows? Could Freedman
be displaced by MCI or Sprint-Comcast or Bell Atlantic or Microsoft-UUNet
or AT&T in a siege of merger-monopolization? He believes that up until a
threshold of some 25,000 to 50,000 customers, meaning revenues of between
$5 million and $10 million net of more lucrative business clients, his economic
and technical model can trump all comers. At that point, he will face the
usual entrepreneurial crisis of transition: Freedman will need business
partners, routinized technology management schemes and expensive accounting
to maintain operations as Net Access spreads across the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But he does not fear competition. His problems, he says, are servicing the
flood of new customers and anticipating the depredations of &quot;Congresscritters&quot;
who want to make him liable for any vagrant flasher who strays onto one
of his hard drives. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still a small force in the global matrix of telecommunications, Freedman
now dreams of exploiting available resources of fiber, dark and lit, to
acquire major new bandwidth, linking cities up and down the East Coast and
across the U.S. Helping Freedman move this project toward reality is his
telecom guru Jacobson, an entrepreneurial dervish from Portman Communications.
With financiers on the line to supply some $5 million in startup capital,
Jacobson is planning to launch a national IRamp network. The service will
ultimately open fully staffed Internet access facilities in 30 cities nationwide,
linked everywhere by fiber, at a cost of some $1 million per site. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Such investment looms large compared to the rock-bottom base of Freedman's
operation, and easily eclipses a national ISP's point-of-presence facility
that can cost upwards of $70,000. But David Farber, gigabit-testbed guru,
recently told a New York audience at the Penn Club that, spurred by business
needs, the marketplace is seeking higher-end, stable-broadband ISP services
that can handle millions of hits a day at a Web site with no access delays
or congestion and that provide local access and custom software configuration.
For these high-end customers, the SPARC 20 servers and T-1 and 56-kilobit
links of the many small ISPs will no longer suffice. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering the kind of broadband channels that will eventually become ubiquitous
on the Net, IRamp's planned facilities will command OC-3 fiber (155 megabits
per second) links to a national network of both dark and lit fiber, available
from utilities, pipelines and other unusual sources. Such bypass strategies
will become increasingly common in coming years. The 10 million miles of
fiber currently installed in the U.S., after all, is exploited to approximately
one-millionth of its potential capacity -- and much of it is unused &quot;dark
fiber.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For key ISP server and security functions, Jacobson plans to use fully fault-tolerant
Tandem S4000 servers running the new ServerNet multibus scheme. It was conceived
by venerable Tandem designer Robert Horst as a new-generation architecture
explicitly optimized to substitute bandwidth for switching speeds. Fully
scalable, ServerNet was licensed in October by Compaq, yet it commands a
theoretical throughput limit of an unprecedented petabit per second (a million
billion bits). For graphics-intensive applications, Jacobson envisages Silicon
Graphics WebForce Challenge S servers using Irix software. Even with as
few as 5,000 subscribers per site paying a competitive nonusage-based rate,
Jacobson projects a high rate of return. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, at Netcom, the nation's largest ISP, David Garrison, the CEO,
is undergoing the stresses that Freedman foresees for himself as he expands
his business. During his previous stint at the helm of the meteoric paging
company, SkyTel, Garrison, a rangy dark-haired entrepreneur with a slight
uneasiness in his ready smile of prosperity, thought he had approached the
ultimate in entrepreneurial excitement. But nothing in his career in the
wireless industry prepared him for his first nine months as head of Netcom.
Here is a company that during the last three quarters grew from 400 to 1,200
employees, from 58 to 201 points of presence, from 72,000 to more than 200,000
customers, and from revenues of $12.4 million in 1994 to a $50 million run
rate in 1995 and to a market cap of some $400 million, while the traffic
in bits grows at an even faster pace -- impelled by the graphic demands
of the World Wide Web, itself expanding at the rate of more than 1,000 new
servers per week. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netcom pares down its points of presence to simple communications nodes
and handles all the technical support and Internet services for them at
the company's headquarters. This operation fills up a high-rise in San Jose.
Some floors teem with desks manned by earnest engineers in jeans, many of
them Asian, working the phones. Other floors are replete with row upon row
of racks filled wall-to-wall with Cisco routers, Sun servers, Livingston
PortMasters, Ascend ISDN pipelines, Cascade edge switches and U.S. Robotics
modems. Walking through these ever-expanding mazes of machinery, Garrison's
entrepreneurial smile at times moves from the ready to the giddy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In this environment of riotous growth, the telcos move their slow thighs
like trolls under the bridges and routers of the Internet. Currently commanding
perhaps 2% of the traffic, AT&amp;T, for example, has declared its ambition
to capture 60% of the Internet business over the next two years. But Garrison
demurs: &quot;From the Olympian perspective of a McKinsey &amp; Co. consultant,
AT&amp;T could take over any business. They have one of the greatest brand
names in the world, they've got more money than God, a billing relationship
with some 40 million people, a global network and alliances and consortia,
Internet pioneer Bolt, Beranek &amp; Newman in their fold, and they have
perhaps the world's largest internal World Wide Web on their own Unix servers
among their 300,000 employees.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But like most of the telcos, AT&amp;T lacks focus. As Netcom marketing chief
John Zeisler explains: &quot;Phone companies have their 700 numbers, 800
numbers, corporate customers, their Hollywood links, their leased lines,
their frame relay, their ADSL (asymmetric digital subscriber line), their
cable aspirations, their huge wireless opportunities, their bureaucracy,
their regulatory tariffs, their pricing confusions. Should voice be priced
as data or should data be priced as voice? They are great at laying fiber
and wire, connecting it to switches and bringing signals to the central
office and to the curb. But the Internet is a second thought, just another
business to them.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As in the PC industry, focus and agility are crucial. In an arena where
the technologies ride a remorseless onrush of exponential changes, no prolonged
bureaucratic process can succeed. Even the maps and schematics of rapid
convergence among media industries miss the point. Dominating this arena
is the computer industry -- with its millions of piranha processors and
entrepreneurs -- and it doesn't converge with anything; it eats everything
in its path. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now ascendant is the Internet computer industry. Most of these new companies,
from Livingston to Netscape, focus on the Internet. Using personal computer
components to reduce the price of ISP infrastructure far below the price
of telco installations, these companies endow the ISPs with a further advantage
in a dynamic industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Livingston Enterprises epitomizes the success of the new companies creating
this new industry. Secreted in Pleasanton, Calif., and financed by corporate
cash flow, Livingston has grown up with the Internet at a pace not far in
the wake of its more illustrious rival, Cisco Systems. Livingston PortMasters
crowd Netcom's headquarters, as they do most of the other ISPs. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched in 1989 under the leadership of Steven Sillens, then a manager
of multiprocessors at Sun Microsystems, Livingston's networking drive began
by creating a cheap router and communications server based on a new operating
system, ComOS, specifically developed to help ISPs meet their Usenet burdens.
Livingston quickly became a dominant force in Internet terminal servers
and routers, and grew at a pace of more than 50% per year until engulfed
by an explosion of demand in 1995. In August of this year, Livingston launched
cheap low-end routers to serve both ends of an Internet connection: a $1,395
two-port PortMaster to link small offices to the Net at up to 230.4 kilobits
per second and a sleek space-saving $3,495 PortMaster with 24 ports for
ISPs. In October, Livingston announced a series of ISDN remote-access machines
that will compete with the currently dominant Ascend ISDN pipeline system,
if ISDN becomes the preferred mode of Internet access. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, everywhere in the Internet industry companies are resigning themselves
to ISDN as the next &quot;modem&quot; (though, in fact it just brings into
home and office the 64Kbps digital channels long used by the telcos between
central offices). The scandal of U.S. telecom, however, is that the telcos
could just as easily be bringing video capable T-1 service (1.544 megabits
per second of bandwidth, equivalent to CD-ROMs) to homes if regulations
permitted a reasonable tariff structure. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, new access technologies are emerging, such as cable modems and
AT&amp;T's new SDSL (symmetrical digital subscriber loop). Available this
year and under test by Bell Atlantic, SDSL modems promise to bring T-1-Line
capability to homes on twisted-pair copper wires for about $10 a month.
SDSL follows many such copper prosthetics announced over the years (notably
HDSL) [high bit rate digital subscriber line] from Level One, PairGain,
Brooktree and others), all largely spurned by the telcos on pricing grounds,
but capable of transforming the entire world of Internet access before ISDN's
niggardly pipes catch on with the public. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While Internet hardware rushes ahead, Netscape, Sun and other providers
of Internet software make the ISP a fast and elusively moving target for
the telcos that wish to compete. With eight million browsers in the field,
all upgradeable to the new 2.0 system--with the Java interpreter and Java
multimedia programming language and toolkit--Netscape expects to attract
some 100,000 software developers to its platform over the next year. There
are already some 400 Java applications available, including word processors,
spreadsheets and games that can play on any machine with a browser running
a Java interpreter, regardless of operating system or microprocessor instruction
set. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Netscape's expected army of 100,000 developers compares with some 10,000
developers for Apple's Macintosh and perhaps 3,000 for Microsoft's network,
MSN. Emerging from a company that did not even exist two years ago, such
a juggernaut will further empower the ISPs in their competition with the
large invaders of the territory--not only the telcos but also the on-line
services such as American Online and MSN. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The ISPs, however, are not usually in direct competition with the large
phone companies. ISPs bring them new customers and new business users, and
the ISPs also depend on them for home connections and for potential fiber-trunking
services. The American telcos are currently laying some 1,300 miles of fiber-optic
line every day. Moreover, beginning with TCI's and Kleiner Perkins' @home
system, which functions with cable modems and new software from Netscape,
the ISPs also may end up using cable plant. As cable modems become available,
cable companies will likely turn to the ISPs to supply Internet services,
local content, technical support and point-of-presence technology. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of these whitewater torrents of change, the some 4,000 ISPs
and their increasing armies of supporters represent a serious threat to
many of the established empires of telecom. Not only can they move much
faster and more resourcefully, but they also have the key advantage of having
bet exclusively on the PC and the Internet as the platforms of the future.
However smart and powerful, Ray Smith, Mike Ovits of Disney, Gerland Levin
and Ted Turner, Sumner Redstone and other aspiring Kings of the Road still
entertain crippling visions of set-top boxes and interactive TV sets. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andrew Grove of Intel had the last word for these efforts when he told Forbes
ASAP last year: &quot;By the time the set-top people reach the price points
and form factors of consumer electronics and penetrate 30% of homes, the
personal computer will be everywhere, controlling the TV like a minor peripheral.&quot;
Bill Joy elaborated on this point in the October issue of Red Herring: &quot;By
the time [they] bring digital TV to the home, you will be able to take your
Super Netscape version 4.0 Web browser with Super-Ultra-HotJava-Burners,
and that will be your animated user interface. [The TV people tried, but[
it's like the Internet happened in the meantime. Right?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Distracting most of the large companies (seen by the Internet's critics
as impending monopolists), the pursuit of the set-top not only misses the
point and begs the question but it also blows the key new hardware opportunity
of the epoch. Although the PC will not be dislodged for most office applications,
there is a real and rare chance today to create a new home architecture
and software optimized for the bandwidth rather than for installed base.
Together with the Java language, the Web browser breakthrough allows creation
of new network PC and software architectures at price points that take advantage
of the &quot;hollowing out of the computer&quot; caused by the impact of
the Internet. Sun, Apple, Oracle and Jean-Louis Gass&eacute;e's BeBox are
all focusing on this target today. All are trying to take advantage of the
elusive opportunity of creating cheap machines optimized for bandwidth and
graphics rather than for legacy software baggage (the storage can be supplied
on the Net). That opportunity follows the PC and Internet model--the microcosm
and the telecosm--into the cornucopian digital future of the information
age, with the old analog TV and telephone left far behind. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>AMID ALL THESE TORRENTS</B> of futuristic technology and prophecies of
a tragic denouement in a wasted commons, it is comforting to return to the
man who began it all, Vinton Cerf of MIC. Coinventor of the Internet protocol
TCP/IP, developer of the once-pioneering and a philosopher of the Net, he
is now in charge of MCI's data network, which includes MCI's Internet backbone
network. A rare combination of technical grit and visionary enthusiasm,
he faces resistance from forces within the company that still lust for the
glamour of Hollywood and see the Internet as the CB radio of the 1990s.
Nonetheless, Cerf at 52 is leading MCI toward a new Internet-centric strategy
that is more likely than the MCI lobbyists to save the company from the
grave perils of long-distance deregulation. The company is already creating
a new backbone for the National Science Foundation part of the Internet,
connecting supercomputer centers and other high-bandwidth applications at
speeds of up to 622 megabits per second. MCI also is a major supplier of
Internet bandwidth. Its network connects to all six NAPs (national access
points) through which the ISPs link to one another. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cerf observes that the national phone network grew at a similar pace through
much of its history and regularly met ever challenge. The telcos, for instance,
surmounted the predicted crisis of the NAPs early this year, when--following
the withdrawal of government funds--the network was expected to collapse
under galloping increase sin traffic. But the NAPs, despite unsuccessful
struggles with the remaining instabilities of ATM (asynchronous transfer
mode), ultimately rose to the challenge, saving the Net by using fiber optics
and digitization, as well as transparent silicon and opaque silicon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, new entrepreneurs are rising up to shape the future of broadband
networks and possibly seize the market from the incumbent backbone suppliers.
Silicon, both see-through ad solid, remains at the heart of the solution.
One of the ways MCI is meeting the challenge of the future is by purchasing
eight &quot;gigarouters&quot; from NetStar, a startup in Minneapolis that
is exploiting Moore's Law to bring IP (Internet Protocol) switching and
router technology into the microcosm. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Launched five years ago by a group of veterans of the Minneapolis supercomputer
scene--Lee Data, Cray and other companies--NetStar went public this fall
at a $83 million valuation. It is pioneering an elegant routing architecture
that gets eight times the throughput of a Cisco 7500 at a 20% lower price.
While existing routers run bits down shared backplane buses, NetStar's IP
router reserves a full one gigabit per each of up to 16 media cards attached
to a single-chip TriQuint 16 gigabit-cross-bar switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Ubiquitous on the Internet, Cisco remains an imperial force. But as the
microcosm advances, it too faces threats. Not only can it not compete with
NetStar at the top of the line but it also faces Livingston, Ascend and
possibly even Compaq at the bottom. <BR>

Critics of the Internet have long predicted that as ever-more-turbulent
floods of broadband data and Web images crowd the commons, the Net will
no longer be able to bear the load. The routers in the NAPs and other critical
paths will jam up and crash. But the microcosm enables a constant stream
of exponentially more powerful new architectures as functions that were
once spread out across entire boards collapse into single chips and multichip
modules. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For 1995 and beyond, MCI has bent on NetStar's feats of microchip integration
to countervail every population explosion across the network commons. Following
the laws of the telecosm rather than the megalithic visions of the critics,
the fast new networks are becoming constantly dumber and more entrepreneurial.
Ciena Corp., a small, venture-funded vendor of optical networks, is now
supplying the next generation of back-bone gear, a system that can carry
16 separate bitstreams on every fiber thread. The first application of the
new all-optical technology in public networks, is now Ciena's innovation
is a precursor of the terabit (trillion-bit throughput) networks that will
be filled with video teleconferencing, video on demand, virtual reality,
and other bit-thronging and polygon-shuffling applications of the future.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Only one competitor, Northern Telecom, might challenge NetStar and the others
providing the new superswitches dumb enough to prevail at the top of the
line. In early October, Northern's BNR lab exhibited a terabit-switch architecture
at the Telecom 95 show in Geneva. This machine, once again, illustrates
the triumph of dumb networks. The dumb terminals of the past, whether POTS
phones or mainframe 3270 panels, required smart networks, with central-office
switches from Northern and AT&amp;T containing no fewer than 26 million
lines of software code. But the new Northern terabit uses passive optical
components and virtually no software at all. It points to the evolution
of a fibershpere for broadband wire traffic that will function like the
atmosphere for wireless traffic. (See Forbes ASPA, &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot;
December 7, 1992). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
While the critics of the new technology fix on the foibles of television
and the monolithic aggregations of old media, the Internet is emerging as
an entrepreneurial efflorescence. Comparing the Net to the decline of CB
radio and the tragedy of the commons misses the providential convergence
of the laws espoused by Moore and Metcalfe, with thousands of entrepreneurs
in tow, exponentially expanding the commons with streams of new invention
in a creative spiral of growth and opportunity. In seeing the technology
as a killer of jobs and family life and a polarizer of opportunities between
rich and poor, they miss the most radically egalitarian force in the history
of the world economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics seem oblivious to the most basic realities of the U.S. job miracle.
While the U.S. deployed three times as much as computer power per capita
as any other industrial region, this country created some 45 million jobs
in 25 years at rising, real incomes. Not only was the U.S. a world leader
in the proportion of its working-age population with jobs, but it also created
employment for some 12 million immigrants, while its corporations endowed
new work for people around the globe. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, a billion people, mostly Third World Asians, used the
technology to leap into Third Wave riches without ever having to endure
a heavy industrial phase. Gaps between the rich and the poor collapsed everywhere
that the networks reached, as former peasants around the world--from Bangalore
to Los Angeles--gained new freedom and opportunity from the information
economy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Internet creates jobs by making workers more productive, and thus more
employable, regardless of where they live. By engendering more investable
wealth, it endows new work, providing the key remedy for the job displacement
entailed by all human progress. By aggregating distant markets, the Internet
enables more specialization, and more productivity and excellence. It will
help all people, but most particularly the poor, who always comprise the
largest untapped market for enterprise. And the Internet will continue to
grow, transforming the global economy with its power and building a new
industry even larger than the PC's. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>FUELING THE TRANSFORMATION</B> are the laws of the telecosm. They begin
with Metcalfe's Law: The power of computers on a network rises with the
square of the total power of computers attached to it. Every new computer,
therefore, both use the Net as a resource and adds resources to the Net
in a spiral of increasing value and choice. This means that any limited,
exclusive or proprietary network will tend to lose business to a more open,
accessible and widely connected network. Metcalfe's Law dooms all the dreams
of the Time Warners of the world to create exclusive and proprietary combinations
of content and conduit. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a further rule, networks prevail to the extent that they feed on the
invention and creativity of their users, since the power of the computers
on the edge of the network will increasingly dwarf the intelligence of the
network fabric itself. For example, a 5ESS central-office switch from AT&amp;T,
commanding some 10 MIPS (millions of instructions per second) and linking
some 110,000 lines, once represented the most powerful computer in a local
phone network. Today those 10 MIPS are infinitesimal compared to the collective
computer power of the tens of thousands of personal computers, each commanding
20 to 100 MIPS, linked by modems to the switch. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lacking an entrepreneurial environment of inventive users, the government-run
PTTs (Post Telegraph and Telephone) of Europe have been rapidly losing ground
to the U.S.'s more rivalrous RBOCs (regional Bell operating companies) and
long-distance carriers, and all have been losing ground to the explosion
of interconnected private nets. The U.S. has some 700,000 private networks
compared to just 14,000 in Europe and some 75,000 in Japan. Private nets
that feed on the creativity of their users will always tend to prevail over
public nets, such as France's Minitel or American's interactive TV projects,
that try to supply their entire system from a central office. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt of Sun offers a true parable of the Net. Back when the Internet
was the Arpanet, two routers were added to the system, but the routers'
hopping ratio (the number of hops to any destination) got struck at zero.
Because traffic always seeks out the optimal path, most of the traffic on
the Net rushed to these two machines, since they promised instant transmission.
Until the settings were corrected, the system was swamped. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the Net, traffic will always gravitate to the most efficient broadband
channels. If the telcos and software monopolists attempt to gouge customers
in a badly designed and costly &quot;top-down&quot; network, traffic will
migrate rapidly toward the freedom and bandwidth of a bottom-up solution.
In the engineering global Internet, these channels could emerge among bypass
suppliers using dark fiber; among low-earth-orbit satellite systems, such
as Teledesic and GlobalStar; among cable companies and renegade long-distance
suppliers; or among companies as yet unknown. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Guided by the valuations of the market, capital follows a similar rule:
It is routed rapidly to the channels where it can be used more productively.
At present, afflicted by perverse regulations that bar phone and cable companies
from collaborating in the same region, valuations of these companies are
low. Meanwhile, analysis complain of the excessive valuations for ISPs,
such as Netcom, and their suppliers, such as Cisco, 3Com and Netscape. Not
only traffic but also investment flows to the least regulated and most enterpreneurial
arena. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A further law of the telecosm ordains that, in an age of dumb terminals
and phones, traffic flows to smart networks full of intricate software.
In an age of ever-multiplying computer power, impelled b Metcalfe's Law,
traffic flows to the dumbest networks that gain their intelligence from
the variety of powerful machines attached to them. A corollary is that,
along with traffic, capital flows to the dumbest and most broadband nets
with the most computer intelligence on their edges. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important of all is the cultural law of the telecosm. Networks
promote choice, choice enhances quality and quality favors morality. Television
is culturally erosive because its small range of offerings requires a broad,
lowest-common-denominator appeal. Linking to millions of cultural sources,
global networks provide a cornucopia of choices, like a Library of Congress
at your fingertips. On the Net, as at a giant bookstore, you always get
your first choice rather than a lowest-common-denominator choice. A culture
of first choices creates a bias toward excellence and virtue. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The critics of the Internet are mostly skeptical about the value of choice.
But choice validates freedom and substantiates individuality. Choice accords
with the inexorable genetic diversity of humans. It makes possible individual
aspiration and creativity. It is the lowest-common-denominator offerings
of mass-broadcast media that lower humans to the animal level, eclipsing
the differences that make us human, cutting off the higher aspirations and
inspirations that elevate us beyond our appetites, reducing us to an impressionable
crowd, zapping through the channels looking for a splash of blood or flash
of nudity or demagogic spiel of hate. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In prophesying centralization and tyranny, the Cassandras miss the centrifugal
forces of the Law of the Microcosm, overthrowing all monopolies, hierarchies,
pyramids and power grids of established industrial society and endowing
individuals with the power to be transcendent and free. <BR>

It is a portion of George Gilder's book, Telecosm,which will be published in 1996 as a sequel to Microcosm, published in 1989and Life After Television published by Norton in 1992/1994.

Take George Gilder's Aug. 28 ForbesASAP piece, &quot;The Coming Software Shift.&quot; Lucky Forbes readersgot their copies in mid-August, smack between the year's two biggest technologyevents--Netscape's record-hot IPO and the release of Windows 95. Gilderused the timing to explain why creative energy and profits in desk-top softwarewould soon migrate from Microsoft to the Internet and toward companies likeNetscape. Needless to say, Gilder's point is controversial, drawing fireand praise from a host of computerdom's biggest names </H3></BLOCKQUOTE><H3>Nathan Myhrvold, Group Vice-President, Applications and Content Group,Microsoft </H3><BR><BR>As usual, George Gilder's diagnosis is dead-on. The software industry functionsby turning its fuel-cheap processing power, as described by Moore's Law--intovalue for consumers. In turn, software soon soaks up CPU power, fuelingmarket demand, which sustains Moore's Law. The software-hardware twosomeis about to become a m&eacute;nage &agrave; trois, with the addition ofcommunications. The three-way cycle will drive growth and value creationin each area at an even faster rate than we've seen so far. I begin to differwhen George frames the computer industry in lurid terms of battle. In reality,computer industry shifts are quite dull affairs. The multidecade declineof the mainframe has been a lot like watching a glacier melt. A leadingcompany fails to invest in new technology and ultimately finds its productobsolete. New entrants might capitalize on this, but most--including Netscapeand HotJava--blaze new trails instead. When an established leader does fall,the proximate cause is almost always slow suicide or atrophy through internalmismanagement; not the wounds of combat. The Internet means opportunityfor all software developers--new and old. Mosaic and its commercial descendantsare currently at the center of the cyclones, but their day in the sun willpass just as surely as it did for previous Internet standards like Gopheror FTP. The instant rise of Mosaic and Netscape foreshadows what Georgemight dub another Law of the Telecosm: In a world with easy electronic distribution,it is very hard to hang onto your position--easy come, easy go. A particularweakness of HTML is that it is a data format no different in spirit fromthe protocols of 1970s-vintage mainframe terminals. Next-generation Internetsoftware will use programmability at both ends of the pipe. Java is noteworthyand may play a role, but its hype falls into a very old trap. Every newprogramming language is heralded as a breakthrough. Fortran was going tocomputerize science and engineering, Cobol would revolutionalize business,and Lisp (and later, Prolog) would deliver us to the promised land of AI.The reality is quite different--new languages offer some modest benefits,but all of the real value resides in the programs created with them. Finally,I must comment on the obsession with finding the next Gates. Bill has beenmy friend and colleague for nearly 10 years, so the topic is familiar. Writinggreat software and founding a company is a first step, but that only matchesBill Gates circa 1976. The secret that made the Bill Gates of 1995 is tohave the technical and business skills to develop new product lines repeatedly.Microsoft is unique in this accomplishment. Our competition is invariablysingle-product companies, or ex post facto assemblages of them. I don'tdoubt that the next Gates will eventually appear, and the Internet may fuelher rise, but it's one hell of a tough act to follow. Scott Mcnealy, ChiefExecutive Officer, Sun Microsystems I'd like to compliment George Gilderfor so eloquently articulating Sun's nearly decade-old credo: &quot;Thenetwork is the computer.&quot; I believe in Gilder's thesis that we are,indeed, at the onset of the age of network-accessed, disposable software.Desktop operating systems, utilities and applications will soon be relegatedto peripheral status. The network will be the operating system, and, asGilder points out, this change is being brought about the almost incomprehensiblemomentum of the Internet. The ultimate change agent, Gilder suggests, mayin fact be Java, yet another technology that Sun has offered to the industryin an open and barrier-free way. Java is a programming language that createsthe first true network operating system for the globe, because it is safe,secure, robust, fault tolerant and, among many other attributes, platform-independent.Here's how we see it playing out. three computer science students from Berkeleyhacking code late at night will create a Java word processing program. Let'scall it &quot;NetWord.&quot; They put it on their Web server at http://www.netword.com.It will be free because these kids want fame first, knowing that will leadto fortune as with their hero, Marc Andreessen. It will be 100,000 linesof code versus 1.5 million for WordPerfect, because NetWord isn't boggeddown with all the APIs [applications programming interfaces] and other extraneousbaggage of typical applications that must interoperate with a specific operatingsystem, or have become overfeatured. So you're shopping for a new word processingprogram. You've seen the ads offering Word on sale for $249. Of course,you know that means you get the privilege of upgrading in a year for another$89. Your buddy sends an e-mail and says check out NetWord. You take a testdrive. It works! Cool! You are not alone. A few million others have heardabout NetWord. Now the makers have a following and in a few months theystart a company and offer NetWord 2.0 for a mere $2 per copy. You and 10million other avid followers have no qualms about paying the nominal fee.It sure beats the competition. In fact, at that price, you'll be checkingthe NetWord home page monthly to download the latest copy. As of the threecollege kids, they are now millionaires. Suddenly the OS that controls theCPU on your desktop is a legally of an old paradigm, relegated to a secondarytier in the software food chain. This means that Microsoft is now a severelyoverpriced personal productivity tools applications vendor with an OS businessthat is no longer able to &quot;captivate&quot; the end user by being theonly platform to run desired applications. Keeping API's secret won't workanymore. Controlling the interfaces won't work anymore. The wall is downand there's no turning back. So where will that leave Microsoft? Scramblingto explain to investors why the company's market cap is 10 times revenues,scrambling to explain how they can survive in the world of disposable, run-anywhereInternet software. Of course, the marketing muscle up in the Northwest willtry to figure out a way to play in this space. But playing now means playingon a level field. The rules are the same for everyone. They're spelled TCP/IP,Mosaic, WWW, HTTP, HTML and now Java--all the open protocols and languagesthat make up the Internet. It's barrier-free computing. It's consumer choice.It's a free-market economy in the information age, finally. From there,just about anything is possible. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Tesler, Vice President and Chief Scientist, Apple Computer </H3><BR><BR>To report technology history accurately is a difficult task requiring percipience,perspiration and perspective. Gilder has done it. He has combed throughthe attics of computing and assembled for the family a gripping album ofthe events and circumstances that created the phenomenon we call the Web.If the past is buried in clutter, however, the future is still more difficultto perceive, especially before the dazzle of Netscape and Java. In my view,the Web is a catalyst, but it is not all that matters about the Internet.The browser is to the Internet what the spreadsheet was to the desktop computer.Mosaic is the new VisiCalc, Netscape Navigator the new Lotus 1-2-3. Microsoftwould like to make Explorer the new Excel. Wall Street is as enamored withNetscape today as it was with Lotus when that company went public. Netscapeis a winner, but is the winner? With the aid of its ally, the Sun King,will it inherit the throne? Not necessarily. Where is the proprietary operatingsystem that runs not merely the equivalent of spreadsheets, but thousandsof applications? Where is the PI that some megalomaniac weaves into, well,a web, to attract, ensnare and ultimately consume hapless applications developersand most of the profits they worked so hard to earn? I hope that the namelessidealists who create the Internet on a daily basis succeed in their resistanceto central control more successfully than did their computer club counterpartsa decade ago. If they do, there may be no single successor to Bill Gates.If they don't then it's anyone's guess who will maneuver into that role.The drama promises to remain gripping. <BR><HR><H3>Howard Anderson, Founder, Yankee Group </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George - what took you so long? What is so surprising isthat you were so surprised that the Netscape revolution may supersede theMicrosoft revolution. Think back! Fifteen years ago, the office automationhype was about word processing, but the real revolution was electronic mail.Today 36 million Americans get their mail electronically and no one reallygives a damn about new word processing packages. Your beatification of MarcAndreessen is a little premature, don't you think? There are many visionaries,but few company builders. We in the venture community intuitively know thatthere is little likelihood that the visionaries will turn into the operatingmanagers new industries need. Other than Gates, who? What you have proposed(correctly) is that the peripheral becomes the major focus. Five years ago,the thought that IBM and the clone industry would become &quot;value-addedresellers&quot; for Intel and Microsoft would have been heresy. Now youare suggesting that the Internet will become the major focus--and Inteland Microsoft will be relegated to that &quot;value-added&quot; focus. Youare right. Nonetheless, quite frankly, the Internet needs three years tobe ready for prime time. Meanwhile, we will go through a sine curve of hype,backlash, then reality. Just when the naysayers sound and seem logical,the Internet will begin to fulfill its destiny, and that destiny is to becomethe most potent force in technology. And George, invite your mother to dinnerfor me. Of your technobabble family, she seems the most interesting! <BR><HR><H3>John Perry Barlow, Rancher, Writer, Web Guru, <BR>Grateful Dead Lyricist </H3><BR><BR><BR>I am enormously encouraged by George Gilder's discovery of the World WideWeb. I'm tempted to stoop to catty remarks about how long it took him. Lately,he's seemed almost alone among intelligent commentators in continuing tocredit the myth of the information superhighway--a belief that you can sustainonly if you don't know about the Web or if your perceptions have been profoundlyaltered by the reality-distortion fields generated within large contentconglomerates, telcos or cable companies, or the vast cluelessness thatis Washington, D.C. In fact, anyone using the phrase information superhighwayis almost certainly in the thrall of some large and doomed institution,or is a complete nimrod who knows only what he hears on television. Whichis, for obvious reasons, filled with people who believe in it. They're notgoing to be roadkill on it, by golly. They're going to find that on-ramp. . . hey, they're going to be the on-ramp! No way, San Jose! The futureof the Industrial Era media megaliths, whether Disney, Time Warner or, moreto the point, Microsoft, will arrive over the Web, not the mythical infobahn.The Web will be the end of them. We are up against a discontinuous leapas we hit the next layer of interactive complexity, both in software andin thought. It has now reached a point where about the only way to developall the scripts, scraps and code objects from which the next World WideOperating System (WWOS) will assemble itself is to grow them in the distributed,massively parallel amalgam of minds and processes that make up the Net.The Web is alive, and filled with life, nearly as mysterious, complex and,well, natural as a primordial swamp. Microsoft is a factory. You can't manufacturelife in a factory. You have to grow it in nature. This ___________ so new,really. _______________'s proprietary claims notwithstanding, I take thefirst WWOS, Unix, as proof that if enough graduate students type into enoughterminals long enough, they will eventually produce an operating system.And given enough graduate students, you can be sure that somewhere amongthem will be a Bill Joy or a Marc Andreessen. In accordance with Joy's Law,they won't be working at Microsoft. Furthermore, the Web and most browsersgive them a way to crib from one another, lavishly and easily. All that'snecessary to see the code that generated what's on your screen is to click:&quot;View source.&quot; All that's necessary to get your page employingsome of the same innovations is to copy and paste. This creates an environmentof dense autocollaboration. To see how productive it's already been in lessthan two years of existence, get on the Web now. This will make the micromputerrevolution look like a good start. Gilder's article is a fine thing. I'vebeen talking about the End of Microsoft for a couple of years and have feltlike a madman parading a ragged sign. When it starts coming from such impeccableseersuckers as George Gilder, it may be time to short a little of that Microsoftstock. <BR><HR><H3>Bert C. Roberts, Jr., Chairman &amp; CEO MCI Communications </H3><BR><BR>Gilder is dead-on right that hardware and operating systems will becomesubordinate to the network; that the network will, in effect, become subordinateto the network; that the network will, in effect, become everything andthe only thing. And he's right, too, about the evolution and impact of theInternet and the resultant focus on content. Gilder's allusions to Gatesand Microsoft, however, yield a very real question: Can they deal with thecoming transformation? Doing so will require a new vision of the futureand a new understanding of merging industries, evolving ways of computing,and some hard new facts. Here's a key one: Companies that don't addressand act on the need for collaborative work from a widening universe willfall hard--and fast. Confronting any rival with the market dominance ofMicrosoft will be very difficulty. But trying to run in place could be evenharder. The challenge is not only to understand, as Gilder writes, &quot;thatyour computer will never be the same&quot;--but also that it's your companythat will never be the same. Dan Lynch, Founder, Interop Chairman, CybercashGilder has got it figured out. His article is dead-on about how the Internetis the architecture of the future for information dissemination. Want proof?Pouring huge resources into its Microsoft Network and Microsoft Navigatorofferings, Microsoft admits that it does not really know the business modelfor how to make money in this new arena, but it is determined to get onthe playing field in a big way. Meanwhile, Sun is too hooked on hardwareprofits to make a new fortune on this round. No doubt that Java is the righttechnology for making the Net be the center of the universe. Sun shouldsimply spin that group out as a new company unfettered by dragging alonghardware. The only fault I find with Gilder's article is his picking MarcAndreessen as the next Bill Gates. Marc only has a few percent of Netscapestock; Bill has tons of Microsoft stock. Marc will make a lot of othersmuch richer and he surely won't suffer, but he will not become a feared/lovedmogul because of Netscape. Maybe he and Bill Joy should bolt and start theirown company? Marc is still younger than Gates was when Microsoft got itsplum from IBM. I asked Marc one question when I met him during his briefstint at EIT in Menlo Park. What was the central design assumption for Mosaic?He said 45 megabits per second! I asked why. He said that it makes it easyto program because you do not have to develop hairy mechanisms to mask outthe slowness of the network. Then commercial reality set in when he andJim Clark got together and they recentered their Netscape Navigator forthe 14.4 kilobit world, thus giving us the MS-DOS of the Internet. It isa good start, but Marc was right about 45 megabits--only it is not justto make the programmer's life easy, it is to make the consumer's life joyful.<BR><HR><H3>Nicholas Negroponte, Director, MIT media Lab Author, Being Digital </H3><BR><BR>Once again, George Gilder's got it right. His guide to the past and futureof the Net is on the digital dime and, as best I hear from my colleaguesat the MIT Media Lab, Java is really hot. We're betting our house on it.The Net, however, is no place for kings. It is a collective intelligencethat will work in spite of government and any attempts to control it. NoCarnegies, Rockefellers or Harrimans this time. The white envelope, George,is empty. When Larry Roberts invented the Internet in 1969, his decentralistapproach made the idea interesting for the military, because it was fail-safe.More than 25 years later, after the Vietnam and Cold wars, the Net is alsosafe from dominance of any kind. Supercomputer &eacute;migr&eacute;s, Unixhackers and Media Lab alumni have moved it forward (not Windows or Mac users),because they are made of the right stuff. This is serious media and computerscience, not the world of Windows applications. Here is where George iswrong. The next Bill Gates is not Marc Andreessen. Yes, Marc will do verywell. However, if you were a sucker to pay $75 per share for Netscape atthe opening on Aug. 9, keep it to yourself (if I hadn't been traveling betweenRio and Buenos Aires that day, I would have sold short and made 25 pointsin a few minutes). There will be many browsers, hundreds of them. Today,I'll bet on Niki Grauso's, which will come out in 37 languages. Browsersare the surface of a much deeper phenomenon. Sun Microsystems has it right:Java. Why? Because Java is a language and many smart people will expressthemselves and invent new applications in that language. Netscape is butone awning on the Virtual Boulevard of Digital Cafes. Java is the coffee.<BR><HR><H3>Andy Grove, President and CEO, Intel </H3><BR><BR>George, George, George--you haven't met a new technology you didn't like,and conversely you haven't met an older one that you don't think is readyto be toppled by the new. Do you remember when you wrote that &quot;specializedcomputers-to-a-chip will become the prevailing product category&quot;? Well,it didn't happen. Not that silicon compilers were back, not that ASICs areinsignificant, but the general-purpose computer that you pooh-poohed hasbecome the prevailing paradigm of the subsequent six years since the publicationof Microsm. Now you predict that the PC will become a peripheral attachedto an all-knowing, all-powerful Internet. I don't think so, George. Notthat the Internet won't be important; I look at it as one of the most importantapplications that will be used on my PC in the future. And that is the differencebetween us. What matters to me is my computer. I use my computer. I am usinga word processor to write this response; I use e-mail to communicate withhundreds of coworkers from my desk and from my home; I use CompuServe toget updated industry news; I use ProShare conferencing to do business withpartners across the world in real time. And I use Netscape to check outa new home page that I have hears about. A couple of years from now, I mayspend more time in the Net-based applications than in some of the others,just as today I spend my time differently among my applications than I didfive years ago. My computer will evolve and adapt (as PCs have been so goodat doing) to the ever-changing mix of applications with which I work. Youare wrong in another area. Implicit in so much of your writing is a fantasy:the notion of high-bandwidth communications reaching every PC. Today mycomputer is connected with ISDN to other computers; it is also connectedto LANs and to an ordinary phone line. Five years from now, my computerwill still be connected to an ordinary phone line and to ISDN, but alsoto broadband networks via a cable modem and to an ATM network to reach otherluck computer users; and probably to do some kind of wireless connection.Ten years from now, it will be another set of communications transport media.But it will never be a single superconnection, because goodness doesn'tarrive in a sing step. It comes a little at a time. To be sure, if God erasedall computers and networks and forced us to start from scratch, we wouldcertainly come a lot closer to your utopian view of broadband to the computer,with intelligence cleverly distributed between network and computers. Butthen, if God erased New York City, it would not be rebuilt the way it istoday. In real life, both cities and computer networks evolve, incrementby valuable increment. The bottom line is this: The magic of the PC businessis that there is a computer that I can look at, put my hands on and say,&quot;This computer is mine, and it opens the universe of tens of millionsof computers to me through its screen and keyboard--and whatever connectionscheme is available to me.&quot; Don't bury this magic; cherish it. <BR><HR><H3>Andy Kessler, Partner, Unterberg Harris </H3><BR><BR>Once again, my colleague and trendtender, George Gilder, has eloquentlyset forth the next wave of innovation. But in the process, the PC or clientdevice will not be hollowed out. Rather than living with fast servers andPCs acting as relatively dumb terminals, which is the architecture of Mosaicand the Web and even Java so far, the endgame is instead a network whereevery device is a server, even your own lousy PC. This means terribly intelligentand &quot;fat&quot; clients, enabling rather than just hanging off the network.Moreover, it is much too early to be handing out crowns to the new kingsof the network. George's trends are dead-on, but the kings are coronatedby natural selection, not by just showing up and claiming the throne. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen Manes, Columnist, New York Times, Author of Gates</H3><BR><BR><BR>Slow down, George! Sake's alive! Ma missed signs four and five! What sprangto mind upon reading Gilder's latest panegyric was not the rosey technologyfuture, but a Burma Shave ditty from my youth. I don't know Colombian beansabout Java, but I've been watching this industry too long not to reach formy methane detector when somebody announces in the language of corporatepropaganda that &quot;your computer will never be the same.&quot; This particularlocution almost always signifies too much time spent amid the rarefied gasesthat hove around chairmen and CEOs. A particularly toxic dose is to be suspectedwhen the proclaimed agent in change is an interpreted language. Interpretedlanguages have a long line of champions, not the least of whom is that greatBasic patron, William Henry Gates III (who seems less &quot;Archimdean&quot;than Charles Foster Kancan). But their magic has its limits, as Gates himselffound out when Microsoft developed its Multiplan spreadsheet on the interpretedruns-on-everything (but kinda slow) model and watched the compiled runs-on-DOS-only(but really fast) Lotus 1-2-3 force some massive recalculations at Microsoftheadquarters. Wasn't it only a few months ago that the press went gaga overGeneral Magic's interpreted Telescript, which now reportedly has, uh, someproblems? The runs-everywhere promise of interpreted languages generallymanages to get broken when it hits some Least Common Denominator--say, anotherLCD, the liquid crystal display. If you want to run Gilder's helicoptermodel on your crappy little Personal Digital Assistant, you may not haveto worry about having AutoCAD on your hard drive, but you probably willhave to worry about having a hard drive, not to mention a screen with enoughdetail and contrast to make the thing look vaguely like the original. TheIBM PC version of Multiplan was no prize, but it looked and felt great comparedwith the on that ran on the toy Commodore 64. Software is never truly independentof the hardware it runs on, interpreting programs tend to run with all thespeed of a tricycle, and bandwidth is still a long, long way from beingfree. <BR><HR><H3>Jesse Berst, Editor, Windows Watcher </H3><BR><BR>Mr. Gilder's article on the coming software shift is 10% fact and 90% wishfulthinking. Fact: Windows's dominance will come to an end when it is renderedirrelevant by a new platform. Wishful thinking: hoping the new platformwill be owned by somebody other than Microsoft. Gilder's fantasy of a Microsoft-freecomputer industry might come to pass if Bill Gates spent his time in hisvault counting his money. he doesn't He obsessively watches the horizonfor threats to his hegemony. When he spots a danger, he works feverishlyto use his current monopolies to leverage his way into the new arena. Hespotted the Internet danger about two years ago and has already spent morethan $100 million to make sure that Microsoft isn't left out. Yes, George,we will all eventually emigrate from the Windows desktop empire. But whenwe get to the new promised land, we're likely to find that Bill Gates hasalready acquired the prime real estate. Scott Cook, Chairman, Intuit Gilderchronicles invention like no other. He finds the history in the most recentevents. He finds the significance in invention before that significanceis real or realized. But Paul Saffo of the Institute for the Future tellshow the innovations that reshape our lives follow their enabling inventionsby years or decades. Gutenberg invented movable type. It took another 40years for an entrepreneur named Aldus to assemble what created book publishingas we known it. Marconi invented radio exactly 100 years ago. It took another25 years for entrepreneurs in Pittsburgh and New York to create broadcasting.It was through broadcasting that radio reshaped our lives. None of us expectit will taken 25 years for this chapter of the Internet story. But I hopeGilder will tackle the next question: How will these inventions change ourlives? Gordon Bell, Research Fellow, Microsoft, Inventor of Digital VAXcomputer Telecosm, like microcosm, is another interesting Gilder story.Like transistors that follow Moore's Law, bandwidth increases at 60% peryear. The Gilder Fallacy is that transistors and bandwidth will also becheap. This may be true in the very long run, and I hope to live long enoughto see it. Meanwhile, the memory cartel has kept prices constant at $50per megabyte and the telephone cartel has metered out bits in 64 kilobitPOTS [plain old telephone service] = chunks for decades. For example, fullISDN lines (two voice lines) cost at least twice POTS. ISDN is also veryinelegant since it makes poor use of the precious last mile, and is notadequate or scaleable. Only modems, created by a new datacom industry, havegotten faster. My version of the Internet story is at http://www.uvc.com.It is called &quot;Internet 1.0 (Arpanet), 2.0 (today), and 3.0 (what weneed),&quot; subtitled: &quot;It's bandwidth and Symmetry, Stupid.&quot;In 1987, I chaired the cross-agency federal task force that proposed NREN[National Research and Education Network], aka NII [National InformationInfrastructure], aka GII [Global Information Infrastructure]. Our recommendationwas &quot;that an advanced network be designed and developed to interconnectacademic, industrial and government research facilities in the U.S.,&quot;with the plan for a factor of a ten thousandfold increase in bandwidth by2002. Things have gone according to our &quot;vision&quot; to maintain constantdoubling for the last 25 years. Thank goodness Berners-Lee created the http://wwwnetwork, aka the Web, so that Andreessen could build Mosaic and its viewers;that's the serendipity part. Public funding of research (this time at Illinois'National Center for Supercomputing Applications) &quot;saved&quot; us again.Intermixed in Gilder's piece is another story about a new Sun programminglanguage, Java, which when combined with the Web, will render Microsoftineffective. If that's the case, then Sun needn't support the anti-Microsoftlegal consortium and should concentrate on toppling it with their products.However, as a newly hired Microsoft researcher, anxious to work his waydown the corporate hierarchy to programmer, I hope that he's wrong aboutour undoing. Microsoft is its own greatest enemy if it fails to make everyproduct embrace the Internet. In an organization that has to keep with chaotichardware platform evolution, having an external standard and threat is thebest thing that could happen. Of the 50-plus million Word and PowerPointusers, however, perhaps 10,000 will see Java as an Internet developmenttool. More likely it's a tool for developing Internet tools. Word alreadyproduced HTML pages and PowerPoint should have the goal of being the mostused Internet content editor. I'll bet that Windows NT (created by DaveCutler, who also happens to be the world's greatest programmer) will becomethe &quot;standard&quot; server platform, just as the Wintel platform, likethe Gilders use, runs nearly all the viewers. As for staying in the centerof the sphere---Gilder's right: Andreessen's there, but I wouldn't countGates out . . . yet. <BR><HR><H3>Charles Mann, Contributing Editor, Atlantic Monthly </H3><BR><BR>The vision Mr. Gilder proposes is wonderfully attractive--who could notlike the idea of a future in which nobody has to struggle with the maddeninglimitations and incompatibilities of the PC? But the idea of plugging everyoneinto the Net for their work and play poses problems of its own, pride ofplace perhaps going to security. The number of Internet crackers and wannabecrackers is rising; worse, the very speed and ubiquity of the Net meansthat each new break-in technique becomes instantly available to all of them,as the spread of Root Kit an its analogues attests. Putting the whole worldonline will increase the opportunity for mischief enormously. At present,we have two basic means for fending off these guys--firewalls and encryption.Put crudely, firewalls are small computers that stand between you and theNet, scanning for unwanted incoming bits. (CheckPoint Software Technologiesin Israel, makes one of the more interesting examples). In one way or another,firewalls intercept and read parts of every Internet packet that comes yourway. If everyone's software is based somewhere &quot;out there&quot; onthe web, the computing power and bandwidth required to filter every screendump and rewrite through the firewall is interesting to contemplate. A worseproblem comes when the information is encrypted--how is the firewall toread it without decoding it? And if it does decode it, aren't you decodinginformation outside the intended recipient network? It's a problem. Forthis reason, most Net aficionados argue that some form of public-key encryptionis the answer. Leaving aside the extraordinary reserves of computing powerthat will be required to encrypt every bit of info going in and out of everysystem in the world--and the even more vexing question of who will pay forit, a subject on which I am not nearly as sanguine as Mr. Gilder--one hasto worry about the possibilities of breakthroughs such as those reportedrecently in Science, where researchers took advantage of the vagaries ofquantum mechanics to reduce the time required to factor large numbers enormously.Because encryption in its present form depends on the huge amount of timeit now takes to factor such numbers, these advances have dismaying implications.We could face a future in which advances in encryption and decoding raceeach other, Red Queen-style--hardly a situation favoring the confident useof a global network. Until these problems are resolved, they will be a bigdamper on the kind of bustling, productive, interconnected future that Mr.Gilder and I both hope is just around the corner. <BR><HR><H3>Bob Metcalfe, Ethernet Inventor and 3Corm Founder, <BR>InfoWorld Columnist </H3><BR><BR>To refind Gilder's model for how Gates gets dethroned, I'll briefly explainhow Gates made his billions. Gates came of age just as Grosch's Law aboutthe scale economies of bigger computers was giving way to Moore's Law aboutthe volume economies of smaller computers. Gates saw early and clearly theprofit potential in controlling standards, like the horizontal protocolstandards for communicating back and forth among computers, and like thevertical interface standards for communicating up and down between applicationssoftware and underlying computer operating systems software. I went withhorizontal protocol standards, namely Ethernet, which I advanced by givingit away to all other comers. Gates went with vertical interface standards,namely IBM's PC-DOS, which he advanced more shrewdly by giving it away toIBM but selling it to all comers. To build the value of PC-DOS, Gates gathereda huge flock of application software developers and got them committed tohis interface standards. Then by controlling changes to DOS's interfaces,upgrading them step-by-step all the way up to Windows 95, Gates was alsoable to sell them over and over again in upgraded forms. With that money,he could exploit inside knowledge of his own interface changes to pick offone after another of the larger application developers, like those in wordprocessing, spreadsheets, presentations and, now, electronic mail and databases.His only major failure to date has been in networking, where he's failedso far to kill Novell. That failure involved control of Novell's protocolstandards rather than interface standards where Microsoft is king. Gildersays that Moore's Law is giving way to Metcalfe's Law, which projects therunaway value of numerous internetworked computers. According to Gilder'spoint of view, this exponential effect shifts importance from the verticalprogramming interface standards upon which the Redmond Rockefeller's fortuneis built to horizontal communication protocol standards which the likesof Marc Andreessen might be expected to dethrone Gates, perhaps becomingthe Microsoft of the Internet. But Gates, of course, aims to be the Microsoftof the Internet. And he need only broaden his tried-and-true interface strategyto include the protocols from the World Wide Web, now threatening his standardsdominance. Gates has the advantage of his current Windows monopoly, whichhe is now trying to leverage into control of the Web--let's hope our antitrustsheepdogs eventually arrive on the scene. Andreessen and company have thedisadvantage of coming from the virtuously open but fractious Unix world.Unless they can keep their Web standards act together, they will lose theWeb to the Windows Microsoft Network in the same way they lost Unix to DOS.MSN and Netscape will likely shape up to be the major opponents in the comingWeb Wars. MSN is making its play to replace Berners-Lee's Web standardswith its own under Blackbird. Microsoft is now giving away MSN browserslike Netscape and can be expected at some point to sell MSN servers andtools directly opposite Netscape's servers. Netscape, on the other hand,with its very busy Web pages is looking more and more like an on-line servicein competition with MSN, advertising and all. I must say that this battleis one that my InfoWorld readers will enjoy, as the fierce competition willdrive the Web toward its full potential. Gates doesn't need it, and certainlydoesn't expect it from me, but I do have to defend him. Andreessen and companyhave not yet made their billions, and they now look innocently charming,gregarious and eager, attractive compared with the shrewd and intense Mr.Gates. But, I've seen close up what even $1 million can do to people, andfrankly Gates handles his billions about as well as it is reasonable toexpect. <BR><HR><H3>Stephen S. Roach, Chief Economist, Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. </H3><BR><BR>Gilder's gushing hype has finally come full circle. He has come to the keyrecognition that there's more to the information age than the alluring powerof Moore's Law. This time-worn mantra of a vendor-driven rhetoric extolsthe miracles of performance of payback--the productivity paradox wherebystartling advances in computational speed fail to deliver the value-addedsolutions that truly matter for society as a whole. But now Gilder heraldsa new &quot;killer app&quot; in user-friendly browsers and new &quot;minimalist&quot;programming languages such as Java. But don't count on it--at least notyet. In the fast-track 1990s, technology must still come to grips with aprofound upheaval in American lifestyles. For the first time ever, white-collarworkers--fully two-thirds of the U.S. workforce--are being asked to up theante of their own productivity contributions through longer and harder work,squeezing family and leisure time as never before in the last 50 years.Surfing the Net in a quest for the &quot;best&quot; application--and learninghow to use each of the new tools--takes considerable time. And that's therub: Time-intensive surfing is in direct conflict with the harsh realitiesof a time-constrained era. In the end, it all boils down to return. Theaverage U.S. worker who has toiled under the burden of stagnant real wagesfor more than a decade will insist on measurable improvements in personalproductivity before squandering ever-greater amounts of leisure and familytime on an open-ended journey on the telecosm. However alluring the latestbreakthroughs in electronic shopping, banking, and video selection may seemto be, my guess is that they don't meet the hurdle rate for the averageAmerican. That's the crux of the dilemma that Gilder still doesn't get:The promises of the telecosm will ring hollow until new means of incomegeneration and wealth creation for society as a whole are created. At best,a flexible software paradigm is merely another means to automate existingtasks. The big steps come with applications that truly change the functionsof work and leisure. And they have yet to be taken. <BR><HR><H3>Larry Ellison, Founder, CEO and Chairman, Oracle Systems Corp. </H3><BR><BR>I believe George has it half right. The center of gravity is indeed shiftingaway from the personal computer and toward the network--specifically towardthe Internet's World Wide Web. Despite the Clinton administration's mostdetermined regulatory efforts, networks are getting faster and cheaper.Various telecommunication bills pending in Congress will decrease regulation,increase competition and accelerate this trend. Cost and ease-of-use improvements,plus video capability, will make the World Wide Web as popular as the familiarTV and telephone networks for communication and commerce, as well as forinformation and entertainment. Bandwidth will expand exponentially and sowill the quality and quantity of information on the Net. The informationage will move from dawn to full daylight. And our world will be changed.But probably not by Netscape: Wall Street and Mr. Gilder are greatly charmedby he most exciting startup since 3DO, but it is important to remember thatNetscape's improbably $2.4 billion valuation comes without earnings or anyquick hope thereof. In the absence of any commercial competition, Netscapewas able to achieve a 70% =&quot;market share&quot; by distributing itsbrowser for free via the Internet. When a clearly superior Browser becomesavailable, people will replace their Netscape browser just the way theygot it--with the touch of a button. The most important new feature announcedfor a future version of the Netscape browser in Sun's hot new Java programminglanguage, which Sun is trying to make an open standard. We're all for it,but you don't get to be the next Microsoft by distributing Sun softwareand helping create open standards. You get to be Microsoft by creating yourown proprietary standard, while convincing everybody it's actually an openstandard. Fortunately, this trick usually works only once, so there willbe no new Microsoft. One is quite enough, thank you. Marc Andreessen isnot Bill Gates. It's probably possible to be great without being Bill. Butit takes a lot of work. Gates is the chairman of Microsoft, the CEO, itsfounder and the man who makes every key hiring decision. Andreessen is neitherchairman (that's Jim Clark), nor CEO (that's Jim Barksdale), but a hiredgun. Hired, in fact, by Jim Clark. History generally shows us only one Rockefellerper industry--the first one tends to get rid of future rivals. If a cosmicshift causes King Bill to lose his throne, it will not be filled by Andreessenor anybody else. There is no next Bill Gates--in software--at least. <BR><HR><H3>Steve Case, President and CEO, America Online </H3><BR><BR>I have a simple request: Let's not forget about the customer. A &quot;realitygap&quot; exists between technologists (breathlessly enchanted with thelatest and greatest revolutionary developments) and the mass consumer market(inevitably preferring evolutionary incrementalism). Invariably, developershave powerful workstations, superfast networks, and a certain affinity forcomplexity. Meanwhile, tens of millions of people out there struggle withmemory-deprived 386s, painfully slow modems (in the real world 14.4 kbpsis considered pretty fast, and 28.8 kbps is the promised land), and a tremendousthirst for simplicity. Yes, telephone companies are getting more aggressivewith ISDN pricing and marketing, and developers are reaching for plug-and-playsolutions, but it's still too hard and still too expensive. Yes, cable companiesare testing cable modems, but the tests are going slowly and broad deploymentis likely to take many years. Switching gears to software, Gilder embracesthe commonly held notion that Netscape's browser is the standard, commandinga dominant (&quot;70%&quot;) market share. But all of the commercial on-lineservices now provide Web access, and they have overnight become the dominantforce in the consumer Web. Neither of the two largest existing players (AOLand CompuServe), nor the most significant entrant (Microsoft), are Netscape'slicensees, so Netscape's market share is therefore zero in this emergingsegment. The already fragmented Web market is likely to get even more fragmented,creating havoc for publishers and confusion for consumers. Ultimately, theservices with the largest audiences will drive standardization. So whenI read about the &quot;dynamically portable&quot; Java, linked with theNetscape browser &quot;standard&quot; and coupled with a &quot;bandwidthtidal wave,&quot; leading a &quot;telecosmic advance&quot; towards a worldchock-full of custom applets filled with tasty morsels of &quot;executablecontent,&quot; Exciting, but I wonder how -- and when -- it will all cometogether into a mass market for interactive services. People don't buy browsers.They don't buy objects. They don't buy bandwidth. They buy services. Theywant access to a broad range of content, packaged and presented in a friendly,useful, engaging manner, priced simply and affordably, with a strong underlyingsense of community. At AOL, our aim is to reach tens of millions of peopleand help shape this new medium. We will continue to leverage technologyto do -- but we'll also remind ourselves that although technologists believethe journey is the reward, for everybody else, the destination is what reallycounts. <BR><HR><H2><CENTER>George Gilder Replies: </CENTER></H2><BR><BR>When the responses to an article exceed the original in pith and pertinence,the writer may be tempted merely to step back, point and applaud. However,at the risk of revealing Forbes ASAP trade secrets, I will correct the impressionthat I am some kind of sappy seersucker who gets his information from dotingCEOs, perhaps in the telephone and TV industries. In fact, much to the irritationof the PR firms surrounding large companies, I invariably rely mostly onengineers, programmers and other technologists and consult the imperialsuits chiefly en route to the illuminati in the nether reaches of theircompanies. <BR><BR><BR>As Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley has noticed with some impatience, I alsogive short shrift to the kind of macrovisions, strategies and statisticsthat float up to the top of economic models. These data are too light onthe technical details in which reside the angels and devils of industrialdestiny. For example, Roach remains perplexed by the &quot;productivityparadox,&quot; the lack of evident payoff of information tools, the failuresof the industry to surmount the hurdle rates of humbler households, allin the face of some 60 million worldwide prospective PC sales in 1995, exceedingTV unit sales in the U.S., with e-mail passing the U.S. Postal Service inmessage units. Meanwhile, U.S. companies are capturing some 50% of all theprofits of the industrial world and maintaining market share between 60%and 90% in most leading-edge products, while deploying three times as muchcomputer power per capita as either Europe or Japan. <BR><BR><BR>Roach trusts government productivity data and wage levels more than thedemonstrable achievements of U.S. companies and calls the conflict a portentousparadox. I say that both the wage and productivity data are largely bunkum,based on silly deflators that mostly fail to capture the plummeting pricesin the industry, while U.S. leadership in PCs, peripherals, networks andsoftware is the real payoff. PC companies alone have generated some $250billion in market caps over the last decade; Internet companies will generatetrillions. These bonanzas answer all the questions on hurdle rates and socialyields (though if you want to see some real high-speed hurdling in homes,wait until cable modems proliferate next year). The payoff of informationtechnology is the global leadership of the U.S. economy despite appallingpolicy mistakes from the Bush and Clinton administrations. <BR><BR><BR>Like me, Andy Grove likes to wrangle and I hesitate to deny him his pugilisticjollies. Among the new technologies I did not like from the outset are HDTV,interactive TV, TV shopping, game machines, Japanese fifth-generation computers,NMOS, videophones, flash memories, serial Crays, Thinking Machines, 3DOand pencentric PDAs. But perhaps we can make a deal. I will concede to himand Andy Kessler that the use of the term &quot;hollowing out of the computer,&quot;borrowed from the estimable Eric Schmidt of Sun, is hyperbolic, even misleadingin an absolute sense. But they should acknowledge that in relative terms,the balance between desktop and network is shifting sharply. After all,in five out of the six PC uses Grove cites, most of the value originateson the network. Nonetheless, I do cherish the PC; indeed, using the Internet,I believe it will displace both the telephone and television over the nextfive years or so.<BR><HR><BR><H4><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="177"HEIGHT="54" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></H4></BODY></HTML>

would be fundamental . . . like being at the center of a sphere, where there
were opportunities--and problems, of course!--in all directions.&quot; <BR>

<HR>What will it take to launch a new Bill Gates--an Archimedean man who
sharply shifts the center of the sphere, alters the axes of technology and
economy, and builds a new business empire on new foundations? Who can inherit
the imperial throne in the microcosm and telecosm currently held by the
Redmond Rockefeller? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I will open the envelope in a minute. But first I want to tell you about
a new software program called Netscape Navigator Personal Edition. I brought
it back from Silicon Valley in late June and put the package next to my
PC. The PC was proudly running a beta version of Windows 95. I had presented
Windows 95 with great fanfare to my 11-year-old son Richard as his route
to the most thrilling new frontiers of the computer world. Multitasking,
32-bit operation, flat memory! Object linking and embedding! &quot;Information
at your fingertips!&quot; But, all in all, he preferred his Mac Quadra 840AV
or even Windows 3.1. They don't crash so often, he explained. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I live out in the boondocks of western Massachusetts where there are no
convenient full-service connections to the Internet. So I was much less
excited about Netscape than I was about Windows 95. I hoped Windows 95 would
put me on line through the Microsoft Network system. Some 10 minutes later,
though, Richard wanted to know my credit car number so I could choose an
Internet service provider. A couple of minutes after that, linked through
internetMCI's 800 number, Richard was on the World Wide Web, using the InfoSeek
service to examine my chapters from Telecosm on line, searching the secrets
of Sim City 2000 at Maxis, exchanging messages with Microsoft Flight Simulator
buffs, and exploring Disney. As far as I know, he is still there. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing I knew, my brother Walter came by. He worked for a computer
company, New World Technologies in Ashland, Mass., that builds customized
Pentium machines and delivers them to value-added resellers within 48 hours.
Walter wanted the Netscape program. He took it back to my parents' farm
down the road and booted it up on a four-megabyte 386SX Dynatech previously
used to map the pedigrees of a flock of Romney sheep. Soon he was on the
Web scouting out the competition from Dell and Micron and showing off the
Gilder Web page. This intrigued my 77-year-old mother, who had scarcely
even noticed a computer before. I don't know how it happened, but before
the night was out, she too was on the Web, exploring catalogs of British
colleges for her namesake granddaughter who was soon to leave for London.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now let me tell you about my introduction to Java, a new programming language
that menaces Microsoft's software supremacy. I encountered Java in early
June at a Sun Microsystems conference at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in
downtown San Francisco. For a speech I was to give, I had planned to use
a multimedia presentation, complete with Macro-Mind Director images and
QuickTime video that I had contrived with an expensive professional some
months earlier. The complexities of Director prompted me to convert the
program to Astound. However, it required an external disk drive and ran
erratically with the eight megabytes of RAM on my PowerBook. I decided to
speak nakedly from notes on the coming technologies of sand and glass and
air. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following me immediately to the stage was Sun's amiable chief scientist,
John Gage. He decided to illustrate his speech entirely from the World Wide
Web. He began with a handsome page, contrived minutes before, giving an
account of my speech, headlined: &quot;Gilder Addresses Sun, Tells of Technologies
of Opaque Silicon and Transparent Silicon.&quot; Then he moved to the Gilder
Telecosm archives run by Gordon Jacobson of Portman Communications at a
Web site of the University of Pennsylvania's engineering school. Gage illustrated
his talk with real-time reports on traffic conditions in San Diego (where
I was about to go), weather conditions in Florida as a hurricane loomed,
and developments on Wall Street as IBM bid for Lotus. He showed the Nasdaq
ticker running across the screen. He showed animations of relevant charts,
cute little Java gymnasts cartwheeling across the screen, three-dimensional
interactive molecular models and an overflowing coffee cup, entitled &quot;HotJava.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
None of his information and images used a desktop presentation program,
whether from MacroMind or from Microsoft. None of them used a database engine,
whether SQL or Oracular. Indeed, except for the Gilder speech report, none
were created beforehand. Incurring no memory or disk drive problems, Gage
summoned all the illustrations to his PowerBook directly from the Internet.
The animations employed a new computer language, Java, written for the Web
by the venerable Sun programmer James Gosling. Java allows transmission
of executable programs to any computer connected to the Net to be interpreted
and played safely and securely in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Clifford Stoll, calls it &quot;Silicon snake oil.&quot; But I call it a
fundamental break in the history of technology. It is the software complement
of the hollowing out of the computer described in Forbes ASAP (&quot;The
Bandwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December 5, 1994). Almost overnight, the CPU
and its software have become peripheral; the network, central. I had spent
working on a presentation on my desktop computer, using an array of presentation
software. But Gage improvised a more impressive and animated presentation
without using any desktop presentation programs at all. The World Wide Web
and the Java language were enough. Restricted to the files of my computer,
I struggled with storage problems and incompatible research formats, while
he used the storage capacity and information resources of more than five
million host computers on the Net. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Similarly for my family, the limitations of my parents' barnyard four-megabyte
386SX didn't matter. The operating system also didn't matter. What was crucial
was the network gear and software. My brother Walter had installed a modem
that linked to the Web at an average of 24.6 kilobits per second. With the
Netscape Navigator, that was enough. Actually 14.4 would have been enough.
Enough to launch a new Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Admit it, the legacy version, once so luminous, is beginning to lose its
shine. You thrill no longer at his vaporware $50 million house, fenestrated
with $40 billion Windows, offering misty views of Daytona, Memphis, Cairo,
and other far-off places you no longer really care to go, even if--OLE--they
are swimming with GML 3D screensavers from London's National Gallery endlessly
hurdling the 640K barrier as if it were flat as a Mac. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the most essential level, Bill Joy of Sun illuminated Gates's dilemma
at Esther Dyson's PC Forum conference in 1990. Known as one of the great
minds in software, yet losing share inexorably to Microsoft, Joy seemed
to be moving into the role of conference crank. Year after year, he lamented
the prolix inelegance of the triumphant waves of Microsoft programs sweeping
through the industry: &quot;As we add more and more of these features to
older systems,&quot; he said, &quot;the complexity gets multiplicative.
I have 10 different packages that interact in 10-to-the-10th different ways.
I get all sorts of surprises, and yet because these things don't play together
well the power is only additive. I get this feature and that feature but
the combinations don't work. What I'd really like to see is a system where
the complexity goes up in a linear way but the power goes up exponentially.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In software, complexity has long been rising exponentially, while power
has been rising additively. In response, Niklaus Wirth, the inventor of
Pascal and other programming languages, has propounded two new Parkinson's
Laws for software: &quot;Software expands to fill the available memory,&quot;
and &quot;Software is getting slower more rapidly than hardware gets faster.&quot;
Indeed, newer programs seem to run more slowly on most systems than their
previous releases. Compare Word 6.0 for the Mac, for example, with Word
5.0 or WordPerfect 6.0 for Windows with WordPerfect for DOS. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But none of this matters. Gates has moved from triumph to triumph by shrewdly
exploiting the advances of microcosmic hardware. With Moore's Law and the
Law of the Microcosm, the number of transistors on a chip doubles every
18 months, and cost/performance rises as the square of the number of transistors.
The complexity sinks into the microcosm and power rises exponentially on
the chip to absorb all the complexity grenades rolling down from Redmond.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gates travels in the slipstream behind Moore's Law, following a key rule
of the microcosm: Waste transistors. As Nicholas Negroponte puts it, &quot;Every
time Andy [Grove] makes a faster chip, Bill uses all of it.&quot; Wasting
transistors is the law of thrift in the microcosm, and Gates has been its
most brilliant and resourceful exponent. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, in the face of Gates's ascendancy, Bill Joy seemed to grow curls
and shed influence, as Sun played rope-a-dope with Hewlett-Packard and other
workstation rivals. In 1990, he retreated to a sylvan aerie in Aspen, Colo.,
to pursue &quot;advanced research&quot; for Sun. But his talk of small programs
and handheld consumer appliances seemed irrelevant to the company. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, in early 1990, showing up late--in a Hawaiian shirt--to address
a formal dinner in Silicon Valley, Bill Joy had a great prophetic moment.
He cited the Moore's Law trends as grounds for granting the first five years
of the 1990s to Bill Gates. &quot;It's pretty much determined,&quot; he
said. Indeed, in the late 1980s, Joy had personally made a separate peace
with Microsoft by selling a large portion of his Sun holdings and buying
Microsoft shares, thus becoming the second richest of Sun's four founders.
(The richest, Andy Bechtolsheim, jumped even deeper into Microsoft.) But
then, around 1995, predicted Joy, everything would change. There would be
a &quot;break-through that we cannot imagine today.&quot; He even acknowledged
that the breakthrough would not come from Sun, but &quot;from people and
companies we cannot know today.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to software innovation, he said, was smart programmers. Smart programmers
are hundreds of times more productive than ordinary programmers. And &quot;let's
be truthful,&quot; said the sage of Sun, propounding what has become known
as Joy's Law, &quot;most of the bright people don't work for you--no matter
who you are. You need a strategy that allows for innovation occurring elsewhere.&quot;
To the Justice Department, Microsoft's overwhelming OS market share and
its teeming armies of programmers seem a barrier to entry for other software
competitors. To Joy, Microsoft's size and dominance could become a barrier
to entry for Microsoft, blocking it from the key new markets of the late
1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is now clear that Joy was on target. The breakthrough is here in force,
invading and occupying all the commanding heights of the information economy,
from the media to the universities. It is the World Wide Web and its powerful
browsers, servers, languages and programming tools. Software on individual
machines still bogs down in the macrocosmic swamps of complexity. But in
the telecosm, yields rise exponentially almost without limit in proportion
to the number and power of the machines on the network. No matter how much
memory and other storage is created on the desktop, no matter what information
resources are assembled on CD-ROMs, no matter how powerful are the database
tools created for the LAN, the desktop imperium will pale and wither before
the telecosmic amplitudes of the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, the number of machines on the network has been
rising between five and 10 times faster than the number of transistors on
a chip. With 1,300 miles of fiber-optic lines being laid every day in the
U.S., band-width is sure to rise even faster than the number of networked
computers (see Forbes ASAP, &quot;The Bankwidth Tidal Wave,&quot; December
5, 1994). This awesome transition presents a supreme chance for new leadership
in developing software focused less on wasting transistors than on wasting
bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A computer on every desktop and in every home? Information at your fingertips?
SQL Server 6.0? My son Richard yawns. Let's face it, Bill, that stuff is
yesterday. In the new era, Microsoft cant continue to feed on the microcosm.
But the leading-edge companies will move to the frontiers of the telecosm,
where collectively they will grow far faster than Microsoft. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So, open the envelope. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Let's find a new Bill Gates. Start by adding 100 pounds of extra heft, half
a foot of height and two further years of schooling, then make him $12.9
billion hungrier. Give him a gargantuan appetite for pizza and Oreos, Bach,
newsprint, algorithms, ideas, John Barth, Nabokov, images, Unix code, bandwidth.
Give him a nearly unspellable Scandinavian name--Marc Andreessen. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Put him to work for $6.85 per hour at Illinois's National Center for Supercomputing
Applications (NCSA) writing 3D visualization code on a Silicon Graphics
Indy for a Thinking Machine C-5 or a Cray YMP16. Surround him on all sides
by the most advanced computers and software in the world, under the leadership
of cybernetic visionary Larry Smarr. What will happen next? &quot;Boredom,&quot;
Andreessen replies. Supercomputers, already at the end of their tether,
turned out to be &quot;underwhelming Unix machines.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then, for a further image of the end of the world, take him in the fall
of 1990 off to Austin, Tex., for two semesters at IBM. &quot;They were going
to take over the 3D graphics market, they were going to win the Malcolm
Baldridge Award, they were going to blow Silicon Graphics [the regnant Silicon
Valley 3D workstation company] off the map, all in six months.&quot; Andreessen
began by doing performance analysis and moved on to work on the operating
system kernel. In mid-1991, after constant delays, the company was finally
ready to ship a world-beating 3D engine. But the new IBM machine turned
out to be four times slower at seven times the price of the equivalent Silicon
Graphics hardware that IBM had bundled a year and a half earlier with its
RS6000 RISC (reduced instruction set computing) workstation. Austin IBM
returned to the drawing board and Andreessen returned to Illinois to get
his degree. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In both commercial and academic settings, Andreessen thus had the good fortune
of working at the very heard of the old order of computing in its climactic
phase. As Andreessen saw it, little of long-term interest was going on at
either establishment. But both did command one huge and felicitous resource,
vastly underused, and that was the Internet. &quot;Designed for all the
wrong reasons--to link some 2,000 scientists to a tiny number of supercomputers,&quot;
it had exploded into a global ganglion thronged by millions of people and
machines. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Many people saw the Internet as throbbing with hype and seething with problems--Clifford
Stoll's book, Silicon Snake Oil, catalogs many: the lack of security, substance,
reliability, bandwidth, easy access; the presence of porn, fraud, frivolity
and freaks guarantees, so he says, that no serious business can depend on
it for critical functions. But to Andreessen the problems of the Internet
are only the other side of its incredible virtues. <BR>
<BR>
&quot;By usual standards,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;the Internet was
far from perfect. But the Internet finds its own perfection--in the millions
of people that are able to use it and the hundreds of thousands who can
provide services for it.&quot; To Andreessen, all the problems signaled
that he was at the center of the sphere, gazing in wild surmise at &quot;a
giant hole in the middle of the world&quot;--the supreme opportunity of
the age. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen saw that, for all its potential, there was a monstrous incongruity
at the heart of the Internet. Its access software was at least 10 years
behind. &quot;PC Windows had penetrated all the desktops, the Mac was a
huge success, and point-and-click interfaces had become part of everyday
life. But to use the Net you still had to understand Unix. You had to type
FTP [file transfer protocol] commands by hand and you had to be able to
do addressmapping in your head between IP addresses and host names and you
had to know where all the FTP archives were' you had to understand IRC [Internet
relay chat] protocols, you had to know how to use this particular news reader
and that particular Unix shell prompt, and you pretty much had to know Unix
itself to get anything done. And the current users had little interest in
making it easier. In fact, there was a definite element of not wanting to
make it easier, of actually wanting to keep the riffraff out.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The almost miraculous key to opening up the Internet was the concept of
hypertext, invented by Theodor Holm Nelson, the famously fractious prophet
of the &quot;Xanadu&quot; network, and son of Celeste Holm, the actress.
A hypnotic speaker, with a gaunt countenance and flowing golden hair, Nelson
seems an Old Testament Jeremiah from Central Casting as he rails against
the flaws and foibles of current-day computing. Hypertext is simply text
embedded with pointers to other text, instantly and full available by a
point and click. For the source of the concept, Nelson quotes an essay by
Vannevar Bush written in 1945 and read to him by his father as a boy: &quot;The
human mind . . . operates by association. With one item in its grasp, it
snaps instantly to the next that is suggested by the association of thoughts,
in accordance with some intricate web of trails carried by the cells of
the brain.&quot; Projecting this idea from a single human brain to a global
ganglion, Nelson sowed the conceptual seeds of the World Wide Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen can explain both the power of hypertext and its slow emergence
in commercial products: &quot;Xanadu was just a tremendous idea. But hypertext
depends on the network. If the network is there, hypertext is incredibly
useful. It is the key mechanism. But if the network is not there, hypertext
does not give you any of the richness.&quot; Hence, Apple's HyperCard and
similar schemes failed to ignite. The link is not hyper if it is restricted
to your hard drive or CD-ROM. Connected to millions of computers around
the globe, it becomes exponentially hyper. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The other thing about hypertext,&quot; says Andreessen, &quot;is that,
even on networks, traditionally it had been developed by theoreticians and
people very deep in the computer science community, and they tended to worry
very deeply about problems like, 'Well, what happens if the information
moves?'&quot; As Gates put it in 1992: &quot;The idea of locating things
that move by their properties and dealing with the security and efficiency
issues, including using replication to do this stuff well, is a very tough
problem. That's what Windows's Cairo is all about. Three or four Ph.D. theses
talk about this, but a commercial system has never done it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen brings the issue down to earth: &quot;You've got a pointer at
a piece of information on the network, but Joe, who's running that information,
moves it somewhere else. Computer scientists would take a look at the problem
and say, 'Oh, the system doesn't work.' On the Internet, we look at that
problem and say, 'Oh well, here's another 20,000 pointers that do work.'
And may be we can send e-mail to Joe and he'll put his information back.&quot;
In other words, you don't wait for Cairo or Xanadu to try to solve every
problem. You go with the fabulous flow of opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nelson's idea led to what Gary Wolf, a contributing writer of Wired, calls
&quot;one of the most powerful designs of the 20th century&quot;--a universal
library, a global information index and a computerized royalty system. But
Nelson's quest for perfection led to a 20-year adventure in futility. &quot;The
opinion of the Xanadu people to this day is that the Web and the Internet
are much too simple. They don't solve the problems. For instance, the links
aren't fully bidirectional. You don't know exactly who's pointing to your
page, and there's two ways to look at that. The way that Ted Nelson looks
at it is 'That's bad!' The way I look at it is 'That's great!' All of a
sudden anyone can point to your page without permission. The Net can grow
at its own rate. You get the network effect, you get Metcalfe's Law, it
spirals completely out of control. Isn't that fantastic?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1988, Xanadu found funding from John Walker, the charismatic recluse,
taxpatriate in Switzerland, and founder of Autodesk, the desktop computer-aided
design (CAD) company. As Walker prophetically declared in 1988: &quot;In
1964, Xanadu was a dream in a single mind. In 1980, it was the shared goal
of a small group of brilliant technologists. By 1989, it will be a product.
And by 1995, it will begin to change the world.&quot; All truer than Walker
could have imagined, but it would not happen, alas, at Autodesk. Haunted
by dreams of perfection and hobbled by hyperventilation at the helm, Xanadu
misted over. Autodesk sustained the effort until it was mercifully terminated
by the new CEO, Carol Bartz, in 1993 at the very moment that a real Xanadu,
deemed hopelessly imperfect and inadequate by Nelson, was about to burst
forth efflorescently on the Internet. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demiurgic step came from Tim Berners-Lee at CERN in Switzerland, creating
the World Wide Web based on a universal hypertext function. He launched
initial HTTP (hypertext transfer protocol) governing transport on the Web.
He developed URLs (uniform resource locators) as a common addressing system
that joined most of the existing Internet search and linkage technologies.
He conceived the HTML (hypertext markup language), a kind of PostScript
for the Web. He made the system ignore failures (Joe's moving data could
not crash your machine). Thus, invoking a browser (i.e., a hypertext reader),
the user could point and click to information anywhere on the Net, unconscious
of whether it was in the form of a file transfer, an e-mail, a Gopher search
or a news posting, or whether it was in the next room or in Tasmania. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Berners-Lee addressed a basic problem of the Internet from the point of
view of an academic researcher. But the real opportunity was to open the
Internet to the world and the world to the Internet, and that would require
more than a facility for cruising through textual materials. After all,
the bulk of human bandwidth is in a person's eyes and ears. For absorbing
text, as Robert Lucky, author of Silicon Dreams, has pointed out, the speed
limit is only some 55 bits per second. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To burst open the Internet would require reaching out to the riffraff who
travel through pictures and sounds at megahertz speeds. To critics of a
more vulgar Net, such as Stoll, more riffraff sending a callipygian naked-lady
bitmaps and voluminous digital ululations from the Grateful Dead and QuickTime
first-step baby videos traipsing down the lines and wriggling through the
routers would soon cause a gigantic crash. Even some of Andreessen's main
allies at the NCSA shared some of these fears. At CERN, Berners-Lee opposed
images and video on these grounds. The technologists all held a narrowband
view of the world, imagining bandwidth as an essentially scarce resource
to be carefully husbanded by responsible citizens of the cybersphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Tim Berners-Lee alone could not burst open the Internet pi&ntilde;ata
and give it to the world. As Richard Wiggins, author of Internet for Everyone:
A Guide for Users and Providers, observes, &quot;During 1992 and early 1993,
graphical Gopher clients for the Macintosh and Windows evolved, and it appeared
that Gopher would outstrip the fledgling Web.&quot; It was the ultimate
broadband booster, Marc Andreessen, working with NCSA colleague Eric Bina,
who ignited the Web rocket. One late December night in 1992 at the Espresso
Royale cafe in Champaign-Urbana, Andreessen looked his friend Eric Bina
in the eye and said: &quot;Let's go for it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every Gates has to have his Paul Allen (or Jobs, his Steve Wozniak). Andreessen's
is Bina--short and wiry where Andreessen is ursine, cautious where he is
cosmic, focused where he is expansive, apprehensive where he is evangelical,
bitwise where he is prodigal with bandwidth, ready to stay home and write
the code where Andreessen is moving on to conquer the globe. Wildly contrasting
but completely trusting and complementary, these two--in an inspired siege
of marathon code-wreaking between January and March 1993--made Mosaic happen.
A rich image-based program for accessing the World Wide Web and other parts
of the Internet, Mosaic requires no more knowledge of its internal mechanics
than is needed by the user of the steering wheel of a car. With a mere 9,000
lines of code (compared to Windows 95's 11 million lines, including 3 million
lines of MSN code), Mosaic would become the most rapidly propagated software
program ever written. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Andreessen could defy all the fears of an Internet image crash because he
lived in a world of bandwidth abundance and fiber galore. He fully grasped
the law of the telecosm. Every new host computer added to the Net would
not only use the Net; it would also be a new resource for it, providing
a new route for the bits and new room to store them. Every new flood of
megabyte bitmaps would make the Net more interesting, useful and attractive,
and increase the pressure for backbones running at gigabits per second and
above. The Internet must be adapted to people with eyes and ears. They won't
abuse it, he assured Bina without a smile. After all, he knew he would have
to rely on Bina for much of the graphics coding. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;I was right,&quot; Bina says now. &quot;People abused it horribly.
People would scan in a page of PostScript text in a bitmap, taking over
a megabyte to display a page that would take maybe 1,000 bytes of text.
But Marc was also right. As a result of the glitz and glitter, thousands
of people wasted time to put in pretty pictures and valuable information
on the Web, and millions of people use it.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Working night and day at the NCSA, wrangling over issues, arts and letters,
music and Unix code at the Espresso Royale down the street, the two programmers
achieved a rare synergy. &quot;We each did the job that most appealed to
us,&quot; says Bina, &quot;so each of us thinks the other did the hard stuff.&quot;
Bina wrote most of the new code--in particular, the graphics, modifying
HTML to handle images, adding a GIF (graphics interchange format) decoder,
incorporating color management tools. Andreessen took the existing library
of communications code from CERN and tore it apart and rewrote it so it
would run more quickly and efficiently on the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As time passed, they brought in other young programmers from the NCSA--among
them Chris Wilson, Jon Mittelhauser, Chris Houck and Aleks Totic--to port
the system to Windows and Mac machines. With help from them, they designed
dynamic forms with type-in fields, check boxes, toggle buttons and other
ordered ways of entering simple text for searches and other functions, beyond
simple hypertext pointing at a URL. For example, a dynamic form is now used
by Pizza Hut for ordering a pizza on line. Finally, because every change
in the browser required complementary changes in the servers at CERN--where
the physicists tended to be busy and glitz-averse--Bina and Andreessen decided
to do their own servers. The NCSA's Rob McCool took charge of this crucial
project. I<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
n the end, they had created an entirely new interface for the Internet and
new communications software to render it crisply accessible--a look and
feel that almost immediately struck everyone who used it as an amazing breakthrough.
In February 1995, Bob Metcalfe wrote a column in InfoWorld predicting that
Web browsers would become, in effect, the dominant operating system for
the next era. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Browsers are now ubiquitous. Every major company and many minor ones are
building them. Some eight million people use them. IBM, AT&amp;T, Novell,
Microsoft, NetCom, Sun, Silicon Graphics, America Online, Net-Manage, Quarterdeck,
Quadralay, Apple, SPRY-CompuServe, Frontier Technologies, Delphi, MCI, Wollongong,
even the Spyglass spinoff from the NCSA--you name it--all these companies
are building, licensing, enhancing or bundling a browser. Many of these
ventures, led by Quarterdeck's smart hotlists and &quot;drag-and-drop&quot;
ease of use, have outpaced Mosaic and prompted a leapfrogging contest of
can-you-top-this. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That is what happens when an entrepreneur performs a truly revolutionary
act, supplies the smallest missing factor, as Peter Drucker puts it, that
can transform a jumble of elements into a working system--the minimal mutation
that provokes a new paradigm. In 1977, the relevant jumble was small computers,
microprocessors and assembly language programming. Bill Gates and Paul Allen
supplied the key increment: software tools and the Basic language for the
embryonic personal computer. In 1993, Andreessen and Bina set out to supply
the minimal increment to convert the entire Net, with its then one to two
million linked computers (today it's an estimated seven million computers)
and immense information resources, into a domain as readily accessible to
an 11-year-old as a hard drive or CD-ROM on a Mac or Windows PC. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the same forces of exploding bandwidth, the same laws of the
telecosm that are wreaking revolution in hardware, hollowing out the computer--rendering
the CPU peripheral and the network central--are also transforming software.
All forms of desktop software--operating systems, applications and utilities--are
becoming similarly peripheral. The ever-growing gigapedal resources of the
Internet will always dwarf any powers and functions that can be distilled
on a desktop or mobilized on the backplane of a supercomputer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Last year, for example, four researchers at MIT, Iowa State, Bellcore and
Oxford (U.K.) triumphantly claimed a $100 reward for solving a grand challenge
problem. They announced that they had broken an RSA encryption code of 129
digits that one of RSA's inventors, R.L. Rivest, when offering the $100
prize in 1977, calculated would take four quadrillion years for a supercomputer
to crack. They did not accomplish their feat on a single machine (none yet
exists that can perform these computations) but on a virtual machine consisting
of 1,600 mostly modest workstations scattered around the Internet. Similarly,
Gordon Bell in 1992 for the first time granted his achievement award for
price and performance in the application of supercomputers, not to a single
machine, but to a distributed Internet virtual system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The success of the Internet model even in these high-powered processing
applications portends and symbolizes a definitive reality, which gathers
increasing force as network bandwidth begins to exceed the internal bandwidth
on computer backplanes. From now on, the relevant computer is the network
and the ascendant software is Internet software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Giving the program away on the Net, Andreessen released Mosaic in binary
form, already compiled for any popular computer platform, and helped bring
more than a million newcomers to the Web in six months. In that time, such
an upheaval would even reach the notice of the management of the NCSA. At
the National Science Foundation in Washington, D.C., a friend eagerly showed
Mosaic to Larry Smarr, who was visiting from Illinois. He was startled to
see that this new marvel was a creation of his own shop at the NCSA. Perhaps
he should look into it. Perhaps there was more to sell to Washington than
Fiber Channels between scientists and Crays. From that moment on, pushing
Mosaic became the chief &quot;grand challenge problem&quot; of the University
of Illinois Supercomputing Center. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After Andreessen's college graduation in December 1993, Joseph Hardin, head
of the NCSA, asked him to stay on at the center. But he added one condition,
namely, that the young programmer leave the Mosaic project. &quot;Some 40
people had a role in creating Mosaic,&quot; he said. &quot;Don't you think
it's time to give someone else a chance to share the glory?&quot; Reasoning
that they would have a still better chance in his absence, Andreessen left
for Silicon Valley. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
After a few months doing Internet security functions at a company called
EIT, Andreessen attracted the attention of the legendary Jim Clark, founder
of Silicon Graphics Inc. and inventor of the Geometry Engine, capable of
3D graphics, that impelled SGI's growth. At loose ends, like most of the
industry's venturers, Clark was looking for opportunity in all the wrong
places--3D games, interactive TV, Hollywood. He found himself increasingly
entranced with the Mosaic browser. Hearing that the author of Mosaic had
arrived in Silicon Valley, he sent Andreessen an e-mail in early February
1994. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The rest is history, in the accelerated from familiar in the Valley. Jim
Clark met with Andreessen and signed him up as the first employee of a new
company. &quot;What has happened to the other NCSA programmers?&quot; he
wanted to know. Hearing that Chris Wilson, who had helped port the system
to the PC, had left the center to join SPRY, Clark decided to act fast.
He invited Bina to come to Silicon Valley and meet with him on his yacht.
Avoiding temptation (Bina's wife was a tenured professor of database technology
at Champaign-Urbana and is wary of snake oil), Bina spurned the invitation.
Andreessen wrote him a glum e-mail: &quot;Sorry. It would have been nice
to have had you here.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The next thing Bina knew, Andreessen called him to announce that he and
Clark were flying to Champaign-Urbana and wanted to meet with Bina and the
rest of the key programmers the next day at the local University Inn. &quot;When
I got off the elevator at the hotel,&quot; Bina recalls, &quot;this blond
guy who reminded me of my dad stepped back, looked me slowly up and down,
and spoke: 'Marc said you could walk on water. I have never seen anyone
who could do that before.'&quot; Clark soon assured him he could stay in
Illinois. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
According to Bina, Clark spread a contagion of entrepreneurial excitement.
Then one by one he made seven of them offers. All signed up. By the first
week of April, Mosaic software was on the way and Jim Clark forgot about
interactive TV. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Greeting this bold new company, however, were rumblings about a possible
intellectual property suit from the NCSA. This surprise banished any idea
of using Mosaic in any form. That was fine with them. They knew Mosaic was
a quickly written hack designed for T1 and T3 lines running at up to 45
megabits a second at the NCSA. &quot;We knew that everyone had Mosaic,&quot;
says Bina. &quot;We were glad to start from scratch again.&quot; Moving
into a small office in Mountain View at a cost of less than $1 per square
foot, they set to work. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the new company, then called Mosaic Communications, Andreessen ascended
to management. Bina, working in Illinois for all but one frenzied week a
month, immersed himself in creating the new code. They revised it to work
over a 14.4 modem. They focused on making it the only system that is fully
secure. They added new supports for more elegant layouts and richer documents.
Giving the program away on the Net, within a few months Netscape won 70%
of the Web browser market, which it still holds. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important for the future of the company, they developed a stream of
new server products, which they sold to most of the existing and aspiring
on-line services and Internet service providers, from internetMCI and marketplaceMCI
to IBM's Prodigy and Murdoch's Delphi. Altogether, they had released a total
of 11 new products by midsummer of this year, from $50,000 secure server
applications to the $39 Netscape Navigator Personal Edition complete with
TCP/IP stack for full connection to the Internet in 10 minutes anywhere
in the country. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Wall Street began pouring money on any rival company with an Internet
Product, the stock market became a Netscape imperative. This posed a problem
from Clark. There would be no difficulty attracting a frenzy of interest.
The question was, Where would they hide Andreessen during the road show?
Introducing him to John Doerr of Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers and
other Silicon Valley clout, however, Clark instead resolved to teach the
young bear how to chew with his mouth closed, tie a tie and get to work
earlier than 8:30 . . . p.m. Then he prepared to place him in the nose cone
of an Initial Public Orbiting that would value the gang at hundreds of millions
of dollars, point Andreessen towards the Millenium and, with luck and the
right characterological chemistry, have a new Bill Gates for the late 1990s.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here he is, well after 8 p.m., roaring down El Camino Real in his '94 red
Mustang, filled with pizza rinds, empty cans of Sprite, a mostly shredded
copy of the San Jose Mercury News and a bulging issue of MicroTimes smeared
in popcorn butter, talking with both hands to a writer from Forbes ASAP
hunched amid the clutter and stealthily searching for a seat belt. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly free of the NIH (not invented here) syndrome afflicting many of
his elders--his browser combines products from some 17 sources--Andreessen
was discoursing on the virtues of Java, a language he says portends a telecosmic
advance even more profound and enduring than the browser and related servers
themselves. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For creating innovative stuff on the Web, Andreessen explains, &quot;The
alternative languages are grim, Perl is limited to text strings. Telescript
from General Magic doesn't pass because it's proprietary. Tickle [Tcl] lacks
power and features. Scheme and LISP are dead. Visual Basic lacks expressiveness
and it is too much controlled by Microsoft. Dylan is still an Apple research
project. None of them are truly suited to the Web environment. Java is as
revolutionary as the Web itself.&quot; Tying Netscape to Java assures the
company a central role in a coming efflorescence of the Web more significant
in its implications than even the current manifestation. In the process,
it will invert the entire world of software in a way that may permanently
displace Microsoft from the center of the sphere. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Behind this development is not some 24-year-old geek from a supercomputer
center, but the industry's most venerable leader after Bill Gates, not only
Microsoft's most persistent critic and nemesis, but also its most eminent
defeated rival: Bill Joy of Sun. In engineering Mosaic and Netscape Navigator,
streamlining the communications functions and putting it all on the Net,
Andreessen was following in the codesteps of Joy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Joy was not only a founder of Sun Microsystems, he was also the primary
champion of the Berkeley brand of Unix--BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution)
Unix--that he husbanded as a student at the university. BSD Unix was not
only Sun's essential software technology, but also the reference code for
TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol), the basic protocol
stack of the Arpanet in its evolution toward the current Internet). <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By upgrading the TCP/IP protocol to run on an ethernet rather than on only
50-kilobit-per-second Arpanet lines and then giving away the Code, Bill
Joy made the Internet possible. When Sun declared in 1988 that the network
is the computer, the network it had in mind was run by Bill Joy's Network
File System (NFS), and it incorporated TCP/IP. Says Eric Schmidt--Bill Joy's
Berkeley colleague, now chief technical officer at Sun and leading prophet
of the coming software inversion--&quot;Sun was selling the Internet before
the Internet was there.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, because Sun computers running BSD Unix were the most robust vessels
for TCP/IP, the lion's share of all host computers on the Web are still
Sun's, and Sun is experiencing an unexpected surge of earnings in the wake
of the Web. Now the computer world is wielding Marc Andreessen's browser
to rush toward the Net, wrenching the sphere from its moorings in Redmond,
and allowing it to oscillate toward a new center in Silicon Valley. Even
Bill Gates, the last holdout against Joy's network standard, is now bundling
TCP/IP with Windows 95. Joy must feel that the industry is coming home at
last. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Gates ignited the person computer market by writing Basic for the
PC, Joy is launching a new era on the Net by supplying a suitable software
language, Java. Joy foreshadowed Java at the 1990 PC Forum conference when
he said, &quot;Large programs are embarrassing because they have a fixed
set of ideas and so much code that it's very difficult to change them. And
they all tend to reflect existing metaphors, not the new metaphors. Everybody's
using C++. That's a 'crufty' language. It's very hard to understand. &quot;I'm
starting a small group to try to do something small--Sun Aspen Smallworks.
I believe it's possible to do small systems of a few hundred thousand lines
of code that live in this world of persistent distributed objects with open
protocols [and] make an incredible difference--much more than an extra 100,000
lines on a 10-million-line system. So I'm looking for a few great hackers.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The one he found was redoubtable Sun engineer James Gosling. Called by John
Doerr of Kleiner Perkins &quot;perhaps the world's greatest living programmer,&quot;
Gosling is a bearded man with shaggy blondish hair. He displays a subtly
wounded look that is possibly the effect of a career that, to that point,
had consisted mostly of brilliant failures. But, like Joy, Gosling was eager
to do something small to bring Sun into the world of consumer electronics
where a large program used no more than a few thousand lines. In 1992, the
company spun out a subsidiary named FirstPerson Inc. to pursue this market.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The goal was to conceive a way to take news, images, animations and other
real-time functions in cell sites and base stations and download them to
handheld devices such as digital cellular phones. But with the Newton fiasco,
personal digital assistants began to fall from favor and Sun and the rest
of the lemmings decided to pursue the suddenly seductive siren of interactive
TV. Again, they would use the Java (at the time called &quot;Oak&quot;)
programming language, this time running not on cellular phones, but in set-top
boxes. Here, too, the programs would have to be elegant and compact to use
the sparse memories affordable for a consumer appliance. However, Like Jim
Clark--and everyone else--Sun would soon discover that interactivity merely
offers cosmetics for the corpse of a dying television industry. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At this point, the project was in turmoil and former Apple designer Wayne
Rosing, its first manager, was on his way out. In May of last year, Sun
technical chief Eric Schmidt entered the breach, collapsed the set-top project
into a joint venture with Thomson Consumer Electronics, which had bought
RCA, and summoned Joy from Aspen. Joy returned and spent the entire summer
last year in Palo Alto working with Schmidt and Gosling to figure out a
strategy for Java. As the work proceeded, it became clear that the characteristics
of a language suitable for PDAs not only gratified Joy's Laws of software,
but also fit almost perfectly the needs of the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like many technology projects that seem to spring full-blown from the brow
of a genius, Java is in fact the fruit of a near-lifelong quest. Gosling's
career began at age 14 in Calgary when, during a high school tour, he memorized
the code to the locks on the doors of the computer center at the University
of Calgary. He then regularly admitted himself to read computer texts and
use DEC PDP-8s. He became so proficient that he was hired a year later by
Digital Equipment to write machine code to be used for analyses of data
on the aurora borealis from Isis satellites. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on to Carnegie Mellon University to study under the eminent Robert
Sproull and Raj Reddy, he wrote a text editor called EMACS, a Pascal compiler
and a thesis entailing the creation of a program to do drawings of levers
and strings in visual, interactive models. After graduation in 1981, he
joined an IBM lab in Pittsburgh, where he developed the Andrew Windows system.
The first major program that could control a window on a computer remotely
across a network, it never found a home. But it launched Gosling on a 15-year
struggle with the challenge of how to send programs across a network that
could be executed on other computers. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling had a breakthrough in 1983 at a Sun Microsystems conference at the
Red Lion in San Jose. There, Joy observed Gosling's Andrew Windows system
dramatically outperforming a workstation running Sun View, and began a concerted
effort to recruit him. Soon after, Gosling came to Sun to develop a remote
windows system called NeWS (Networked Extensible Windows System). Initially
received with great critical acclaim in the industry, it was eventually
blocked by the X-Windows consortium despite performing far more efficiently
over a network. Long a student of object-oriented programming beginning
with the Simula language, Gosling followed his NeWS project with a compound
doc<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ument architecture, joining text and images. It, too, garnered much praise
and paltry use. Then came Sun's ill-fated pursuit of consumer electronic
products. Gosling set out to develop appropriate programs in C++. But it
soon became clear to him that this language failed on nearly all the crucial
criteria. In particular it was neither reliable nor secure, which, funnily
enough, turned out to be two sides of the same coin. &quot;The gun you shoot
the burglar with can also shoot you in the foot.&quot; That was C++. It
had pointer code that allowed rogue programs to invade and corrupt a target
operating system. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So Gosling began revising C++ code into something that has been termed &quot;C++
minus minus.&quot; Returning to the inspiration of Andrew and NeWS, he adapted
the language to enable real-time operations across a network. In order to
run a variety of different programs on a variety of linked devices, from
set-top boxes to palmtop remotes, he made it inherently platform-neutral
and nomadic. It would have to be a language at home on a network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The project ended with Java, an efficient programming language that is safe,
simple, reliable and real-time, yet familiar to anyone who has used C or
C++. Designed for PDAs on infrared networks, it turned out to be perfectly
adapted for the Internet. Many of Java's virtues are made possible by the
fact that it is interpreted rather than compiled--that means that it is
translated line by line in real time in the user's computer rather than
converted to machine language in batch mode by the software vendor. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most languages are written in two stages. The first is source code, couched
at a level of abstraction that rarely reveals its purposes or algorithmic
procedures. Normally, source code is proprietary and not revealed to the
user. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The second stage is compilation. The compiler translates the abstractions
of the source code into &quot;binaries&quot;--the machine language of a
particular computer, locked into the set of instructions that its central
processing unit can perform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java, by contrast, is compiled not to an instruction set peculiar to a particular
microprocessor but to a virtual machine or generic computer. Putting the
language into an intermediate binary form allows creation of programs that
are not locked into any particular hardware platform, but that can still
be adapted to run fast. The intermediate code is translated line by line
by a software program called an interpreter located in the target computer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Java's interpreters take up a parsimonious 45 kilobytes of memory. Sun already
has Java interpreters in the works for Microsoft Windows 95, the Mac, Windows
MT and several flavors of Unix. Netscape will include the appropriate interpreter
in future versions of the Netscape browser. This means that any program
written in Java will be portable to any common computer platform. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, this portability does not seem remarkable. All programs
written in C, C++ or other compiled languages can be ported to any target
platform simply by running the source code through the appropriate compiler,
just as Mosaic was compiled for various platforms at the NCSA. The difference
is that Java can be &quot;compiled&quot; line by line in real time. That
is, it is interpreted in byte-level code in the client machine. This makes
all the difference. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It means that programs no longer have to reside in the machine where they
are used, or be written for that machine in order to be executed by it.
Potentially, a Java program can reside anywhere on the entire Internet and
be executed by any computer attached to the Internet. The little interpreters--sure
to become cheap and ubiquitous as they are distributed by Netscape and by
other suppliers of browsers--make Java programs &quot;dynamically portable&quot;
in real time. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Dynamically portable programs are suitable for a nomadic existence on the
Net, rather than a mere settled life on the desktop. Java thus emancipates
software from computer architecture. It offers a software paradigm radically
different from the Microsoft model, which is based not only on static compilation,
but on often-concealed, proprietary source code. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly, the entire world of new software is potentially available to every
computer owner. Rather than being restricted to the set of programs you
own, you can use any program on the Net, just as now you can tap any information
on the Net. You not only have data at your fingertips, you have programs
at your fingertips. This means &quot;executable content,&quot; as Joy describes
it and as John Gage demonstrated in his speech at the West St. Francis Hotel
this June. Whether a film, a graph, an animation, a real-time bit stream
on the Nasdaq ticker or the Reuters wire, a virtual reality visualization,
or a game, it can be downloaded to your machine with its program in tow.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Owning the operating system and associated tool libraries becomes irrelevant
to selling applications. Owning the application or channel becomes irrelevant
to selling the content. To the extent that Java or a similar language prevails,
software becomes truly open for the first time. The Microsoft desktop becomes
a commodity; the Intel microprocessor becomes peripheral--the key &quot;microprocessor&quot;
is the software code in the Java interpreter. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Interpreted or not, however, nomadic programs will not be permitted to range
the Net unless they are also secure programs. By several judicious alterations
of C++ procedures, Gosling made Java above all a secure language. Many viruses
depend on taking an integer in the program and using it to &quot;point&quot;
to a low address in the memory where operating code resides. Java removes
this pointer conversion function. In addition, incorporated into the Java
interpreter is a code verifier. As soon as an application shows up in a
machine, the interpreter does an instant virus scan. Finally, when Java
binary arrives at a machine, it will bear an RSA data signature that verifies
the source of the code and guarantees that it has not been altered or corrupted.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These security provisions make Java programs the first certifiable citizens
of the Net. As Java interpreters become ubiquitous, any application program
that is anchored on a particular platform and desktop will eventually become
a cripple, like a pro athlete who fears to fly. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The computer hollows out, and you no longer are concerned with its idiosyncrasies,
its operating system, its instruction set, even its resident applications.
Instead, you can focus on content--on the world rather than on the desktop
architecture. If you want to run a helicopter model on your screen, you
don't have to worry about whether you have AutoCAD on your hard drive. You
can run a video of the helicopter without owning the right decoder, whether
Indeo (Intel's standard) or MPEG-4 (designed for portable appliances) or
dynamic JPEG. The helicopter flies over the Net with its own executable
code. The network is no longer a threatening place. If you want to use a
program from Finland, you don't have to worry that it will introduce a malignant
virus to your machine. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Your computer will never be the same. No longer will the features of the
desktop decide the features of the machine. No longer will the size of your
hard drive or the database in your LAN server determine the reach of your
information processing. No longer will the programs in your machine determine
the functions you can perform. The network is the computer. The computer
becomes a peripheral to the Internet and the Web. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since the release of Java and a demonstration Web browser called HotJava,
written in the language on the Sun home page, Gosling has experienced the
kind of sudden Internet celebrity undergone by Andreessen and Bina. Unlike
Andreessen, he seems somewhat baffled by it all. But in the long run, his
contribution may be greater. Browsers and servers may come and go, but successful
new languages are extremely rare. Java, or something like it, is the key
to a truly interactive Internet and a fully hollowed-out computer. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently, Bill Joy made a presentation to the Sun board, outlining an upgrade
path for the future of the language. Joy is resolved that Java will not
go the way of Andrew and NeWS. Like Jim Clark, he has even turned to the
troubled supercomputer arena to find a treasure trove of new hackers. Sun
hired some 20 new programmers from the recently defunct but boldly pioneering
Thinking Machines and Kendall Square Research. Presumably, they can learn
to think small. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Gosling shakes his head at all the uproar. He now finds himself falling
thousands of messages behind in his e-mail. Linked to the Net by a mere
T1 line, even Sun's Java server broke down under the overload. But Gosling
himself seems to be holding up better. His speaking schedule has multiplied
to a rate of three talks a week. Scores of people tell him they are using
the language as a replacement for C, for IR (information resource) tools
and for other general-purpose applications. Giant Japanese companies such
as Sony and Sega besiege him. Finally, late in June, even Berners-Lee gave
Java his imprimature as &quot;one of the most exciting things happening
on the Web right now.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A movie buff, Gosling sees Java, Netscape and similar programs changing
the image of the cypersphere from an alien and menacing dystopia, as depicted
famously in Blade Runner, into a realm resembling Star Trek, where computers
are trusted tools. Perhaps this transformation will favor the emergence
of the amiable and gregarious young Marc Andreessen as the paladin of cyberspace,
replacing the fiercely brilliant but widely feared Bill Gates. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But as Andreessen admits, a more likely outcome is a massive move by Microsoft
onto the Net where the two will enter battle with scores of contenders.
This month, Microsoft announced an array of Internet services, under the
rubric Blackbird, with many interesting features. But it works only with
Microsoft Network Services, which will not become truly widespread for another
year. Beginning with virtually no market share and a year or so behind,
Gates will become an under dog at last. Perhaps even the Justice Department
will notice. In the age of the hollowed-out computer, the king of the desktop
rules an emigrating empire. <BR>

<P>U.S. Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska wants to know: With deregulation of telecommunications,
who will bring connections to Unalakleet, to Aleknagik and to Sleetmute?
Who will bring 500 channels up the Yukon with the salmon to the people in
Beaver? What will happen to the Yupik, the Inupiat and the Inuit? Will we
leave them stranded in the snow while the world zooms off to new riches
on an information superhighway?<BR>
<BR>
A senior Republican on the Senate Commerce Subcommittee on Communications,
Stevens is a key figure in the telecom deregulation debate on Capitol Hill.
As he contemplates the issues of restructuring communications law, he has
reason to be suspicious of the grand claims of an information age. He knows
that universal service--the magic of available dial tone in your own home--has
hardly reached rural Alaska at all. As George Calhoun points out in his
sort invented by Alexander Graham Bell in 1881 and now extended to some
95% of American households) are simply not feasible, either technically
or economically, in many remote regions.<BR>
<BR>
In Beaver, for example, there is one telephone in a hut linked to a nine-foot
satellite dish. Permafrost and cold economic reality make it impossible
to extend dial tone to the several hundred households of this town, even
though its average household income, mostly from salmon fishing, is some
$120,000.<BR>
<BR>
Ted Stevens is right to be concerned. Portentiously sharing his concern
are other powerful Republicans from rural states, including Larry Pressler
of South Dakota, the chairman of the subcommittee. Extended now from phone
service to broadband digital superhighways, their concerns could pose a
deadly obstacle to true deregulation of communications and thus to continued
American leadership in these central technologies of the age. At stake is
some $2 trillion of potential value to the U.S. economy (see Forbes ASAP,
April 10). The problems of universal service in Alaska disguise the more
profound paradox of telephone service in most of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that the universality of telephones is crucial to their usefulness;
yet universal service using current technology is totally uneconomical and
impractical. Snow and ice are the least of it. The basic problem is the
architecture of the system, with a separate pair of lines, on average two
miles long, devoted exclusively to each user. It simply does not pay to
lay, entrench, string, protect, test and maintain miles of copper wire pairs,
each dedicated to one household that uses them on average some 15 or 20
minutes a day.<BR>
<BR>
Connections in cities are one thing. Urban access systems comprise a bramble
of millions of wire loops, each linking a home or business telephone to
a nearby central office switch. Under a half mile in length, these lines
still represent some 80% of the cost of the system. But because the lines
are short and often bundled together, city telephony benefits from economies
of scale and convenience. In rural areas, however, the copper lines cost
between 10 and 30 times as much per customer as they do in cities.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Calhoun reports that in general, phone companies cannot supply
ISDN (integrated services digital network) and other digital services over
twisted-pair wire more than 18,000 feet (some 3.5 miles) from the central
office. Perhaps a third of all the nation's phones are more than 3.5 miles
from a central office.<BR>
<BR>
What saves us is socialism. Closing the huge differential between the costs
of serving rural and urban customers is a Byzantine web of cross-subsidies,
whereby inner-city and business callers in urban areas subsidize the worthy
citizens of Kirby, Vt.; Vail, Colo.; Mendocino, Calif.; Round Rock, Texas,
and Tyringham, Mass., among other bucolic locales, to the tune of billions
of dollars. Overall, subsidies from business and urban customers to rural
and other expensive residential users total some $20 billion a year. In
case the cross-subsidies do not suffice to guarantee universality, Congress
has established a $700 million &quot;Universal Service Fund.&quot; For all
that, some 5% of homes still lack telephone service (compared with 2% unreached
by TV, which faces no universal service requirement).<BR>
<BR>
Lending huge physical authority to this Sisyphean socialist scheme are some
65,049,600 tons of copper wire rooted deep in the rights of way, depreciation
schedules, balance sheets, mental processes and corporate cultures of the
regional Bell operating companies and other so-called local-exchange carriers.
The minimum replacement cost of these lines deployed over the last 50 years
or more--and still being installed through the mid-1990s at a rate of at
least five million lines a year--is some $300 billion. By comparison, Calhoun
estimates, the telcos could replace every telephone switch for one-tenth
that amount while radically upgrading the system.<BR>
<BR>
In this cage of twisted copper wires writhe not only the executives of the
telephone companies, but also the addled armies of telecommunications regulators,
from the Federal Communications Commission and other Washington bodies to
50 state public utilities commissions and the towering hives of lawyers
in the communications bar. The coils of copper also subtly penetrate the
thought processes of MIT Media Lab gurus, libertarian lobbyists from the
Electronic Frontier Foundation and myriad political analysts who see this
massive metal millstone as a fell weapon of monopoly power. The copper colossus
even intimidates scores of staunch Republicans who have arrived in Washington
determined to extirpate every government excess, but who bow before the
totem of universal service in their districts.<BR>
<BR>
Like any socialist system, the copper colossus will die hard. But die it
must.<BR>
<BR>
Some 20 years ago, AT&amp;T's long-distance lines comprised a similarly
imperious cage of copper wires, installed over the previous 50 years and
similarly impossible for rivals to duplicate. Then too, analysts termed
telephony a natural monopoly because the system could handle additional
calls for essentially zero incremental cost and because network externalities
ensured that the larger the number of customers, the more valuable the system.
These assumptions had led to government endorsement of the Bell monopoly
as a common carrier committed to universal service.<BR>
<BR>
Regulators, politicians and litigators always imagine that they can control
the future of telecom, awarding monopoly privileges in exchange for various
high-minded goals, such as universal or enriched services. But their actual
role, as Peter Huber and his associates show in their new text, Federal
Broadband Law, is mostly to promote monopoly at the expense of such values
as universality, which ultimately depend not on law but on innovation. As
a form of tax, regulations reduce the supply of the taxed output. It is
technological and entrepreneurial progress, impelled by low tax rates and
deregulation, that brings once- rare products into the reach of the poor,
always the world's largest untapped market.<BR>
<BR>
In this case, the decline and fall of the long-distance monopoly was not
chiefly an effect of politics or litigation but of technology. Effectively
dissolving the copper cage of long distance were the millimeter waves of
microwave radio. Over the years, it turned out you could set up microwave
towers anywhere and duplicate long-distance services at radically lower
cost without installing any new wires at all. But this realization came
woefully slowly to the regulators.<BR>
<BR>
In the &quot;above-890-megahertz&quot; decision of 1959, made possible by
new Klystron tubes and other devices that opened up higher frequencies to
communications, the FCC permitted creation of private microwave networks.
On the surface, it was a narrow decision affecting a few large corporations.
But as AT&T planners noted at the time, it represented a clear break from
the previous principles of common carriage, cross-subsidy and nationwide
price averaging in the telephone network.<BR>
<BR>
Sure enough, over the next two decades a cascade of further decisions climaxed
with the authorization of MCI to emerge as a direct competitor to AT&amp;T.
Within less than a decade, MCI added to its panoply of aerial microwaves
the yet more advanced technology of single-mode glass fibers. Issuing some
$3 billion of junk bonds over a four-year period, MCI built the first nationwide
network of advanced fiber optics. GTE made comparable investments in Sprint,
and AT&T rushed to excel its new rivals. Combining microwave with fiber,
long-distance telephony became a technologically aggressive and openly competitive
arena; AT&amp;T's monopoly was a thing of the past.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the remaining monopolies in local phone service face a threat from
radio technology still more devastating than the microwave threat to AT&T in
long distance. As with microwaves, the government--in the name of preventing
monopoly--dallied for decades before acting to allow elimination of the
monopolies it had earlier established. After the invention of cellular at
Bell Labs in 1947, some 34 years passed before the FCC finally began granting
licenses for cellular telephony. By the 1980s, the FCC and Judge Harold
Greene, managing the Modified Final Judgment breaking up AT&amp;T, permitted
limited competition in wireless telephony. However, the FCC allocated half
the metropolitan licenses to existing RBOCs, which had no interest in using
wireless to attack the local loop monopoly. The other licenses it assigned
by lottery to gamblers and financiers with no ability to create an alternative
local loop. The process of buying out the spectrum speculators required
leading wireless carriers to hobble themselves with huge amounts of junk-bond
debt. Although McCaw Cellular Communications created a robust national system,
its financial structure prevented aggressive price competition with wireline
service.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the idea persists that wireless telephony is an expensive supplement
to the existing copper colossus rather than a deadly rival of it. The installed
base of twisted-pair wire still appears to many to be a barrier to entry
for new competitors in the local loop, rather than a barrier to RBOC entry
into modern communications markets. The conventional wisdom sees the electromagnetic
spectrum as a scarce resource. Few believe that it will soon emerge as a
cheaper and better alternative to the local loop, in the same way that microwave
emerged as a cheaper and better substitute for copper long-distance wires.

Making Waves</B></PRE>
At the foundation of the information economy, from computers to telephony,
is the microcosm of semiconductor electronics. It reaches out in a fractal
filigree of wires and switches that repeat their network patterns at every
level from the half-adder in a calculator chip or the SLIC in a telephone
handset to the coaxial trees and branches of a cable TV system or the mazes
of switched and routed lines in the global Internet. In computers, engineers
lay out the wires and switches across the tiny silicon substrates of microchips.
In telecommunications, engineers lay out the wires and switches across the
mostly silicon substrates of continents and seabeds. But it is essentially
the same technology, governed by quantum science and electrical circuit
theory.<BR>
<BR>
Semiconductor engineers may still spend more of their time with circuit
theory, contemplating the operations of resistors, inductors and capacitors
on currents and voltages in the device. But quantum theory is most fundamental,
because it allows humans for the first time to manipulate matter from the
inside--to control the conduction bands and energy-band gaps of the internal
atomic structure of silicon and other elements, and to make electrons, holes
and photons leap and lase at the behest of the designer. It is quantum theory
that allows chip engineers to control with exquisite precision, gauged in
tenths of microns and trillionths of seconds, the movements of electrons
at the heart of electronics.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of quantum theory, however, is a perplexing duality. Most of
contemporary physics seems to deal with particles--electrons, quarks, leptons,
neutrons, protons. In 1994, for example, scientists at Fermilabs in Chicago
announced &quot;discovery&quot; of the &quot;top quark,&quot; which they
described as the &quot;last building block of matter.&quot; Yet these entities
manifest themselves only in the midst of explosions in which their wave
signatures can be identified. So-called quantum particle theory is unintelligible
without quantum wave theory.<BR>
<BR>
The elements of quantum physics intrinsically combine the characteristics
of particles--definite specks of mass--with the characteristics of waves--
an infinite radiance of fields and forces. Entirely unlike particles, waves
merge, mingle and mesh in vectors and tensors propagating boundlessly through
space.<BR>
<BR>
It is this paradoxical combination of the definite with the infinite that
gives the microcosm its promise as a medium, not only for computation in
one place, but for communications everywhere. Spectrum unfolds in a global
ethersphere of interpenetrating waves that reach in a self- similar fractal
pattern from the plasmas of semi-conductor lasers through the ethers of
the planet.<BR>
<BR>
Today, the telecosm of modern communications brings decisively to the fore
the wave side of the quantum duality. Wires may seem more solid and reliable
than air. But the distinction is largely spurious. In proportion to the
size of its nucleus, an atom in a copper wire is as empty as the solar system
is in proportion to the size of the sun. The atmosphere and wires are alternative
media, and to the electron or photon are only arbitrarily distinguishable.
Whether insulated by air or by plastic, both offer resistance, capacitance,
inductance, noise and interference. In thinking about communications, the
concept of solidity is mostly a distraction. The essence of new devices
emerges more and more as manifestations of waves.<BR>
<BR>
Whether in the air or in a wire, the electrons or photons do not travel;
they wiggle their charges, causing oscillations that pass through the medium
at close to the speed of light. As in waves of water, the wave moves, but
the molecules of water stay in the same place. Thus belied is the analogy
of particles or even bullets favored by physics teachers who give primacy
to the mass rather than to the wave. Since the age of carrier pigeons and
catapults, communications systems have transmitted masses only in the postal
services.<BR>
<BR>
Today, even in entirely stationary electronic systems, the wave action is
increasingly dominant. The microchip itself--a Pentium processor, say--now
runs at 120 megahertz, a rate in cycles per second that puts it in the middle
of the FM radio band. New computers must pass the FCC requirements for radio
emissions. Texas Instruments now advertises its 486 SXL-66 microprocessors
as selling for under 50 cents per megahertz. Increasingly in the world of
computers, people speak of bandwidth and cycles, reserving the discussion
of mass chiefly for the batteries. The world of the telecosm is subtly shifting
from electronics, with its implicit primacy of electrons, to what might
be termed spectronics, seeing the particle as an expression of the wave
rather than the other way around--moving from Bohr's atom and Heisenberg's
electronic uncertainty to Maxwell's rainbow and Schrodinger's wave equation.<BR>
<BR>
In a global marketplace increasingly unified by telecommunications at the
speed of light, the vision of waves as fundamental affords not only a better
image of physics, but also a better purchase on economic reality than a
spurious search for solid states, physical resources, national economies
and commodity products.<BR>
<BR>
Conceived as some irreducible essence, the particle of mass, whether in
the form of a top quark or Higgs boson, wire conduit or central switch,
pushes our thinking about the world toward a vision of ultimately discrete
and confinable entities, with electrons moving through the p-n junctions
of microchips like so many steel ingots crossing a national border. Conceived,
by contrast, as a continuous span of waves and frequencies, tossing and
cresting, reflecting, diffusing, superposing and interfering, the telecosmic
vision accords with the ever-rising global commerce in information services--ubiquitous,
simultaneous, convergent, emergent.<BR>
<BR>
To grasp the next phases of the information economy, one begins not with
the atom or any other discrete entity, but with the wave. In 1865, in a
visionary coup that the late Richard Feynman said would leave the American
Civil War of the same decade as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by
comparison, Scotch physicist James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic
spectrum. This spread of frequencies usable for communications is both the
practical resource and the most profound metaphor for the global information
economy.<BR>
<BR>
Is it a domain of limits, to be husbanded by governments and appropriately
allocated by auctions at a price of billions of dollars for a tiny span
of wiggle rates? Is it beachfront property to be coveted as a finite and
unrenewable resource? Is it a constricted domain to be exploited under the
iron laws of diminishing returns? Is it a zero-sum game to erupt in Star
Wars and street fights as satellite magnates and personal communications
entrepreneurs crowd into a feudal fray of frequencies? At the heart of the
gathering abundance of the information economy, would it sustain a new economics
of scarcity?<BR>
<BR>
So one might imagine from today's conventional wisdom. Contemplating these
limits, diminishing returns and zero-sum economics at Richard Shaffer's
Mobile Forum in March was industry guru Carl Robert Aron. He sees the world
of wireless entering a &quot;new ice age,&quot; like the recent ordeal of
the tire industry in the face of radials. He predicts that customers, capital
and revenues will become increasingly scarce and many species of company
will become extinct. Offering a similarly grim vision, BellSouth Vice President
of Corporate Development Mark Feidler declares that the price elasticity
of demand for telephony is negative--you lower the price and revenues will
sink. On the same panel, AT&amp;T-McCaw executive Rod Nelson asserted that
he could see no threat from personal communications services, because McCaw
was already offering &quot;a low-priced, high-quality service.&quot; Even
Martin Cooper of ArrayComm saw spectrum as a limited resource sure to grow
more valuable over time.<BR>
<BR>
What would Maxwell say? As he discovered it, the spectrum is infinite, ubiquitous,
instantaneous and cornucopian. Infinite wave action, not the movement of
masses, is the foundation of all physics. It ushers in an age of boundless
bandwidth beyond the dreams of most communications prophets. As industry
guru Ira Brodsky concludes in his authoritative new book, Wireless: The
Revolution in Personal Communications, &quot;We are quickly moving from
the era of spectrum shortage to the age of spectrum glut.&quot; This expanding
wavescape is the most fertile frontier of the information economy. In its
actions are the essential character of the coming economics of abundance
and increasing returns.<BR>
<BR>
In contemporary networks, as Nicholas Negroponte stresses in his best-selling
book, Being Digital, all bits are fungible. In spectronics, all spectrum
is fungible. In particular, the distinction between wireline and wireless
service dissolves. A wire is just a means of spectrum reuse. Down adjacent
wires, appropriately twisted or insulated, you can transmit the same frequencies
without fear of interference or noise.<BR>
<BR>
Using new digital radio technologies, such as code division multiple access
or smart and directional antenna systems, you can similarly beam the same
frequencies through the atmosphere, insulated by air. The chief difference
is that the wire system costs far more to install and inhibits mobility.<BR>
<BR>
The only wire technology commanding a decisive edge over wireless for critical
applications is fiber optics. The intrinsic bandwidth of a fiber thread
is nearly 1,000 times larger than the bandwidth of all the &quot;air&quot;
currently used for terrestrial radio communications. In both media, capacity
is largely governed by the need to avoid the water molecules that absorb
many frequencies of electromagnetic <BR>
waves--in air, from humidity or precipitation; in fiber, from the unremovable
residue of water in the structure of the glass.<BR>
<BR>
Compared with perhaps 30 gigahertz of currently accessible frequencies in
the air, every fiber thread can potentially bear 25,000 gigahertz. This
huge bandwidth derives from the possibility of using infrared light frequencies
for long-distance communications rather than radio or microwave frequencies.
When you are dealing in terahertz (infrared light encompasses some 50 trillion
hertz worth of frequencies between 7.5 X 10[11] and 3.5 X 10[14]), there
is a lot of room for sending messages.<BR>
<BR>
One fiber thread the width of a human hair can potentially use about 25
trillion of those hertz for communications (the rest tend to be fraught
with moisture). This span is enough to carry all the phone calls in America
on the peak moment of Mother's Day, or to bear three million six-megahertz
high-definition television channels--all down one fiber thread the width
of a human hair. As Paul Green sums it up, fiber commands 10 orders of magnitude
greater bandwidth than copper telephone lines and 10 orders of magnitude
lower bit-error rates. Optical engineers have packed as many as a million
such threads in one bundle with a cross-section a centimeter square. Such
feats plausibly support the assertion that, as a practical matter, spectrum
is infinite.<BR>
<BR>
The capacity of fiber is so large that the best way to think of it is as
a radio system in glass--a fibersphere that can potentially accommodate
as many as 10,000 separate wavelength bitstreams. Under a system called
wavelength division multiplexing, users will tune in to a chosen frequency
band in the same way they currently time in to a chosen radio or television
channel, whether in the air or in a coaxial cable. Indeed, engineers can
take the same infrared frequencies used in fiber and move them to the air
for shorter distance applications such as local-area networks, point-to-point
connections between buildings, links between handheld computers and desktop
hosts, and even television remote controls. As tunable laser transmitters
and photodiodes, along with other optoelectronic gear, become more sensitive
and efficient, airborne infrared will become more robust and useful. Experiments
by the Israelis with ultraviolet frequencies suggest that even these superhigh
frequencies above visible light might someday be used for communications
through the atmosphere (offering tens of thousands of TV channels, for example).<BR>
<BR>
Now the FCC has auctioned off 120 megahertz of frequencies for personal
communications services. The most prominent winning bidders were consortia
led by Sprint, TCI, Comcast and Cox (a long-distance carrier and three cable
companies going under the name Wireless Co.); by AT&T; and by AirTouch,
Bell Atlantic, NYNEX and U S West as PCS PrimeCo. Most analysis has focused
on what is called the wireless market and has assumed the major competitor
to PCS to be the current cellular companies. Aron's ice-age ruminations
stemmed from contemplation of this radical increase in competition for a
limited number of cellular customers who currently cost some $540 each to
sign up (counting handset subsidies) and whose per-capita revenues are declining
at a pace of some 8% per year. Remember BellSouth's Feidler's vision of
a negative elasticity of phone markets, meaning that lower prices bring
lower revenues?<BR>
<BR>
From a spectronic perspective, all this analysis is deeply misleading. Whether
channeled down wires or through the air, spectrum is spectrum. Digital wireless
is a cheaper and better way of delivering service. The market for PCS is
not the cellular customer, but the one billion wireline customers in rich
countries and the several billions of potential phone and teleputer customers
around the globe. In pursuing these customers, the price elasticities will
be dramatically positive, with various price points reachable with new wireless
technologies releasing torrents of new demand and new revenues. What Aron
calls an ice age will in fact prove to be a gigantic global warming, unleashing
huge new growth in telephony, using spectrum in all its various forms (except
perhaps the twisted-pair copper wires that currently dominate the installed
base of the industry).<BR>
<BR>
The winning bidders from AT&T and Sprint did not put up their $3.7 billion
in order to join a zero-sum straggle for new cellular customers. These bidders
are dominated by long- distance businesses that can use PCS to reduce their
some $30 billion in access charges to the local exchange carriers by creating
an alternative local loop. Similarly, MCI, though avoiding the auction,
created a subsidiary called MCI Metro that may seek to manage service for
spectrum winners in 17 cities, again harvesting the benefits of obviated
access charges. Then all these companies can use their PCS technologies
to pursue customers around the world without any thought of wire.<BR>
<BR>
A chart created by industry analyst Herschel Shosteck illustrates the opportunity.
The Shosteck chart is a bell curve relating the incomes of the world's households
to telephone penetration rates. He shows that telephony has so far penetrated
only to countries representing the top tail of the curve, where national
wealth suffices to reduce the cost of telephony to a threshold of between
4% and 5% of incomes. As incomes rise around the globe, more and more people
cross the telecom threshold. A chart of GDP in real dollars per capita versus
telephone penetration shows that a 40% rise in incomes could bring a 1,600%
increase in potential customers.<BR>
<BR>
Compounding the surge in incomes, however, will be the plummeting cost of
wireless telephony. Shosteck estimates that between 1985 and 1994 the price
per customer dropped 80%, from $5,000 to $1,000. Combining these two trends,
he calculates that there will be between 400 million and 800 million new
wireless subscribers by the end of the year 2000. These numbers represent
an awesome upsurge from the world's current level of some 60 million cellular
customers. Any further acceleration in income growth or decline in telephone
prices will increase these numbers. A 50% further drop in telephone prices
combined with a 50% rise in incomes would quickly thrust the vast bulk of
the world's population above the Shosteck threshold. Far from the negative
elasticities that U.S. phone executives see in their saturated wireline
voice business, the world-wide communications market will be a financial
trampoline.
<PRE>
<B>
Just Chips And Antennas</B></PRE>
In an ordinary industry, a 50% drop in price seems a major obstacle. But
telephony is becoming a branch of the computer industry, which doubles its
cost effectiveness every 18 months. The wireless convergence of digital
electronics and spectronics will allow the industry to escape its copper
cage and achieve at least a tenfold drop in the real price of telephony
in the next seven years.<BR>
<BR>
Sen. Stevens should meet Martin Cooper, a former research chief at Motorola
and now CEO of ArrayComm. Located in San Jose, ArrayComm is devoted to drastically
reducing the cost of telephone access over the next two years while entirely
obviating the problems of twisted-pair wiring that afflict Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
The current pitch of ice-age cellular providers is &quot;pay more and get
less. . .and don't even think about universal service.&quot; Although they
claim penetration rates in industrial countries of nearly 10%, most cellular
users make most of their calls on wireline systems. The real market share
of cellular is in fact under 1% in the industrial world. The cellular companies'
formula for success is to exploit the public hunger for mobility by charging
more money for worse service--extracting premium prices for calls with acoustics
and reliability far inferior to wireline telephony. Followed by both sides
of the cellular duopoly--by Bells, McCaws and other suppliers--this pay-more-
for-less-and-worse formula has concealed from much of the industry the basic
technological fact that wireless will soon be acoustically better than wireline
and drastically cheaper as well. As the CD example shows, after all, digital
sound systems are superior to analog. And without wires, phones finesse
the largest capital and labor costs of conventional telephony.<BR>
<BR>
In economic terms, the intrinsic cost advantage of wireless is concealed
by the colossal installed base of copper. Already mostly paid for and largely
written off, the 154 million twisted-pair access lines will allow the Bells
to compete in price for some time with wireless rivals that have lower real
costs.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, technical reality will prevail in the end. Spectronics offers
technologies in four dimensions for dividing and conquering spectrum: Frequency
division, time division, code division and space division. All address in
various ways the issue of frequency rouse--how many times in a system particular
frequencies can be roused without causing interference in other calls using
the same frequencies. Of the four techniques, so far only frequency division
has been widely exploited. As these other methods come on line, the cost
of telephony will go over the same kind of digital cliff long familiar in
computers.<BR>
<BR>
Surveying all these proposed schemes and their promised upgrades (see sidebar
next page), it is safe to project between a 60% and 90% drop in the cost
of wireless telephony over the next five years, depending mostly on the
progress of CDMA. Qualcomm's CDMA could reduce costs tenfold, compared with
the threefold gains from current global services mobile (GSM) technology,
which contemplates an upgrade path chiefly through downgrading the voice
quality with a half-rate vocoder.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains in wireless efficiency from dividing by time, code or frequency
are compounded by dividing spectrum by space. Mathematically, every 50%
reduction in the cell radius yields a 400% increase in the number of customers
who can be served in a given area with a given technology. Huge theoretical
gains accrue from cell-splitting--reducing the physical extent of cells
and multiplying their numbery--converting current macrocells as large as
35 miles in diameter into microcells a mile or so in width, and into picocells
measured in hundreds of yards in buildings, shopping centers or congested
urban streets.<BR>
<BR>
All these gains, however, could be nullified by the expense and difficulty
of implanting base stations all over cities and neighborhoods. The key to
the gains of space division, therefore, is creation of base stations drastically
cheaper, smaller, more discreet and more functional than the current cell
sites, costing between $500,000 and $1 million, occupying 1,000 square feet
and containing between 55 and 416 radios, depending on the frequency reuse
factor. The most notable breakthrough in base stations is the Steinbrecher
MiniCell, to be demonstrated in July and launched at the end of the year.<BR>
<BR>
Putting a base station into a briefcase, Steinbrecher uses a single broadband
digital radio to perform the functions of between 55 and 416 analog transceivers.
The key breakthrough is a proprietary mixer that can flawlessly down-convert
all the waveforms in the entire cellular spectrum into a stream of baseband
digital bits without losing any information or introducing spurious signals.
Containing all the electromagnetic contents of the cell, this digital bitstream
is broken into channels by a 0.4- micron technology application-specific
integrated circuit and is interpreted by digital signal processors. Governed
by the learning curves of semiconductors, the MiniCell promises to reduce
the cost of a cell site by an initial factor of 10 and by an eventual factor
governed chiefly by the Moore's Law exponentials manifested in the PC industry.<BR>
<BR>
In an important article in the April issue of IEEE Personal Communications,
Donald Cox, former Bellcore wireless leader who is now at Stanford, calculated
that such digital base station technologies soon could lower capital costs
per wireless customer to $14, compared with a current cellular cost of $5,555
(assuming, in both cases, 180 channels per unit).<BR>
<BR>
Using leading-edge silicon technology, the broadband digital radio can transform
the entire landscape of wireless. It takes the channeling, tuning, filtering,
modulation, demodulation, coding, decoding and other processing out of the
analog radio domain, where a different radio system is needed for each frequency
band or modulation scheme. Moved into a digital signal processor or ASIC,
these functions yield to the huge efficiencies of the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate in space division, for example, is devoting the entire available
spectrum to every caller. Using broadband digital radios fed by arrays of
smart antennas, Cooper's ArrayComm is approaching this ultimate. &quot;We
believe that over the next few years, everyone will be using broadband radios,&quot;
Cooper says, pointing to Watkins- Johnson and Airnet joining Steinbrecher
in this business (though with far narrower bandwidths).<BR>
<BR>
All base stations, one way or another, have to find all the callers in a
cell and link them to callers outside. Broadband digital radios move the
search function from an array of radios to a single computer. Cooper contrasts
the technology with radar. As he puts it, traditional radar systems use
active beams to scan a location and find a targeted object; ArrayComm uses
a passive array of antennas and a digital radio to provide a broadband snapshot
of a cell 20 times a second, and employs computers to locate the targeted
object, in this case a handset.<BR>
<BR>
Like the Craig McCaw-Bill Gates low-earth-orbit satellite scheme called
Teledesic, the ArrayComm IntelliCell originated with work done for the Strategic
Defense Initiative program. Inventor Richard Roy developed algorithms for
rapidly calculating the source and trajectory of missiles from their electromagnetic
emissions as detected by satellite antennas scanning the surface of the
earth. Now he is using similar algorithms to identify the position, direction,
distance and amplitude of electromagnetic emissions from handsets in a wireless
cell, as collected by arrays of smart antennas at a base station. Once the
information is digitized, Roy's algorithms can sort out all the calls by
their location in the cell, excavating signals otherwise buried in neighboring
noise or shrouded in cross- talk, and conducting several calls at once on
the same frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper gives the analogy of human hearing. &quot;You close your eyes and
I walk around talking, and you can point to me at any moment. Add another
voice and you can still listen to me, or shift to the other voice. You can
hear the voice you want to hear twice as loudly as the voice you want to
suppress. You null out the interference. This is not a physical process.
You don't move your ears. Your brain calculates and correlates the different
sounds or signals. That's what Dick Roy's algorithms do in our smart base
stations.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Roy explains further: &quot;That works if you have a variety of frequencies.
Suppose, though, you were faced with a chores of monks all chanting in monotone
in the same frequencies. This is more like the cellular telephone or PCS
situation in the presence of interference or cross-talk. This is what prevents
frequency reuse in adjacent cells. Amid the drone of the monks, you could
not isolate the sound of one monk. What you need is more ears. Then you
could resolve the source of a particular sound by its location. That is
what we do with antenna arrays.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Adding a spatial dimension to the frequencies, time slots or codes tracked
by ordinary cell sites, an ArrayComm system can distinguish signals entirely
unintelligible to other systems. For example, an array with eight antennas
can effectively magnify the signal by a factor of eight. There is no theoretical
limit to the number of antennas, but as a practical matter, the size of
the array becomes a problem in urban cells. By moving up spectrum from 900
megahertz 15 centimeters to 1,800 megahertz, PCS reduces the size of the
antenna array from two meters across to one meter across (antenna size drops
in proportion to the decline in wavelength at higher frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
As a result of the effective magnification of signals, an eight-antenna
array could double the range of a base station, quadruple the area covered,
reduce to one-third or one-fourth the number of cell sites, and raise frequency
reuse to 100%, without CDMA. Because CDMA doesn't define channels by frequency
at all, but by codes, its limit is the number of codes that can be differentiated
in the cell. Thus, Roy believes that among all the competing technologies,
CDMA can benefit most from using the spatial dimension. Spatial processing
can help differentiate the calls in a cell as the noise of call codes accumulates
toward the limit where further traffic is impossible. As Qualcomm leader
Andrew Viterbi declared in a paper released on Jan. 13: &quot;Spatial processing
remains as the most promising, if not the last frontier, in the evolution
of multiple access systems.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm is part of what Don Steinbrecher calls &quot;the transformation
of wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot; As a computer
business, wireless will share in the gains of Moore's Law. It will double
cost effectiveness every 18 months, rather than continuing on the stagnant
price curves of wireline telephony in its cage of copper, dominated by the
costs of rolling out trucks, digging trenches, laying wire and climbing
poles.<BR>
<BR>
Cooper predicts that over the next five years, the combination of broadband
digital radios, ArrayComm smart antennas and a stream of other advances
in wireless telephony will reduce the cost per minute of wireless phone
calls to a penny a minute, one-quarter the average wireline level and one-twelfth
the current cellular price. This price collapse will ignite huge positive
elasticities in demand, reaching for the first time billions of new customers
in India, China and Latin America who are now untouched by telephony.<BR>
<BR>
ArrayComm's first customers are Alcatel in Europe, which is creating a system
for GSM, and DDI Tokyo Pocket Telephone. The fastest growing company on
the Tokyo stock exchange for the last five years, DDI is often termed the
MCI of Japan. Using transceiver chipsets from Cirrus Logic's PCSI subsidiary,
DDI is already the world leader in low-cost wireless telephony. The ArrayComm
technology should lower its costs to the point where these pocket telephones
can break through as a wireless local loop throughout the huge new markets
of Asia and elsewhere. Earlier this year, the DDI technology, called Personal
Handy Phone, was combined with a Bellcore-Motorola proposal as a new low-end
wireless standard under the name Personal Access Communications Systems.<BR>
<BR>
By transforming the technical landscape of communications, spectronics are
also transforming the lawscape. Indeed, by entirely closing the gap between
the costs of serving rural and urban customers, digital wireless phones
will obliterate the need for cross-subsidies that underlie the entire regulatory
edifice. In the new world of bandwidth abundance, the only group that will
need cross- subsidies and emergency aid is the communications bar.<BR>
<BR>
As a guide to the era ahead, telephone executives, regulators and Washington
politicians should contemplate the computer industry. The market share of
centralized time- shared computer systems dropped from 100% in 1977 to less
than 1% in 1987. International Business Machines and Digital Equipment Corp.
lost nearly $100 billion in market cap in five years.<BR>
<BR>
Or, for a more recent example of the power of wireless technology in the
digital age, the telcos, regulators and politicians should consider the
video distribution industry, Last year, Washington was so obsessed with
the cable industry and its apparent monopoly power that Congress enacted
a reregulation bill that ultimately imposed 700 pages of new rules on the
distribution of video news and entertainment. Politicians and pundits let
forth a stream of lamentations about the future access of the poor and the
rural to the new services of digital television and proposed a series of
new requirements for universal service.<BR>
<BR>
A year later, however, the very survival of the cable industry as a distributor
of point-multipoint video is in doubt. Before Congress could enact broadband
universal service rules, Direct Broadcast Satellites were propagating 150
channels of digital video with supreme universality over the entire expanse
of the continental United States. Attaching 18-inch dishes to the tops of
their igloos, the Inuits might acquire television images of a variety and
resolution far excelling any offering of cable television in the midst of
the nation's capital. With a software upgrade to MPEG-2 video planned later
this year, the number of channels will rise to some 200.<BR>
<BR>
Privately dubbed &quot;deathstar&quot; by cable industry executives, digital
DBS became the fastest growing product in the history of consumer electronics.
Just seven months after its introduction, it had already surpassed the combined
first-year sales of VCRs, CD players and big-screen TVs.<BR>
<BR>
Today, in the name of deregulation, politicians are preparing to impose
a series of new competitive requirements upon the Bell operating companies,
on the assumption that they still wield monopoly power. Pundits still seem
to believe that the copper cage protects local telephone companies from
outside competition. But in fact, the cage incarcerates them in copper wires,
while the world prepares to pass them by.<BR>
<BR>
The digital future is not wired or wireless. It is spectronic and spectacular.
To participate in this explosive market, all telephone companies will have
to escape from their copper cages into the infinite reaches of the spectrum.<BR>

<PRE></PRE>
MICHAEL MILKEN IS BACK! Back, so the story goes, from the orgies of '80s
greed, back from the best-selling den of thieves, back from his preening
at the predators' ball, back from soft time at Pleasanton pen, back from
prostate cancer and plagues of litigation, back to tell his own book to
William Novak and to buy his redemption with the spoils of his crimes. Yes,
so they say, Milken is back, while thousands of plundered companies and
communities labor to regain their standard of living and jobs, long lost
in the shuffle of his dismal deals and loaded down with his &quot;high yields.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Yes, Milken is back. Back from the gutters of Ponzi finance, the rot of
junk and S&L sleaze, angling: to launder his weaseled wealth with educational
hype and charity hustles. Back, aiming now at history and posterity rather
than at new opportunity, but hitting it big instead with Michael Jackson,
Doonesbury laughs and Clifton compassion photo ops. Meanwhile, even the
ascendant Republicans in Washington try to steer clear of &quot;eighties
excesses&quot; of debt and deficits and supply-side economics.<BR>
<BR>
Or so it looks to media observers of the Milken saga. And yet slowly and
arduously, there is emerging from the carrels of the Harvard Business School
and other institutions a distinctly different tale.<BR>
<BR>
Under the leadership of Michael Jensen, a small group of Harvard Business
School scholars has been scrutinizing all the statistics of corporate behavior
during the 1980s. They have laboriously appraised the results of all the
leveraged buyouts, junk bond issues, venture capital, and other tools of
corporate making and remaking. They have arrived at unexpected conclusions
and have developed a new body of theory to explain them. From this perspective,
the events of the 1980s--and Milken's role--assume a wholly new meaning.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen puts the Milken episode in the context of another form of wretched
excess for which Milken was the remedy: namely, the excesses of corporate
waste and conglomeration by empire-building managers with scarcely any ownership
stake in their companies. Amid the sieges of deregulation and tax rate reduction,
amid the obvious tumult in the markets for oil, tires, tobacco, real estate,
gold and commodities, many industries needed profound restructuring. But
their entrenched managements were set to expand their domains through acquisition
and investment in new capacity. Meanwhile, a thousandfold rise in the cost-
effectiveness of microchips, governed by the centrifugal law of the microcosm,
rendered obsolete the dominant architecture of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
Most conspicuously, between 1977 and 1987 the percentage of total computer
power commanded by centralized systems dropped from nearly 100% to under
1%. Less obviously, but no less profoundly, the equally centralized structures
of television and telephony were also falling before the distributive force
of the microcosm. Ordaining that the price performance of microchips rises
by the square of the increase in the number of transistors on a single chip,
the law of the microcosm exalts single chip systems, led by the PC. Pushed
into obsolescence were all monopolies and hierarchies, pyramids and power
grids of the old information structure, epitomized by the mainframe computer,
the broadcast network and the central telephone switch.<BR>
<BR>
The old establishment of AT&amp;T, the big three TV networks and some 1,400
over-the-air broadcast stations was breaking down into a new formation of
cable and wireless schemes. Affecting virtually every company in the economy
and threatening most existing management plans and practices, these trends
created huge opportunities for wealth creation and disruption.<BR>
<BR>
Beginning with his move to Century City in Los Angeles in July of 1978,
Milken aggressively rode the microcosm--inside and outside of Drexel. Inside,
he concentrated on what Jensen describes as a key role of information technology:
&quot;taking the specific knowledge previously scattered through a firm
and making it into general knowledge usable by all.&quot; In this case,
it was a matter of turning Milken's command of the details of hundreds and
then thousands of high-yield issues into the foundation for a company that
could make these bonds the prime venture capital in the U.S. economy. From
the beginning, crucial to this goal was computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
A specialist in finance, information systems and operational research at
Wharton, he had begun his career at Drexel in 1970 with a computerized move
to speed up the delivery of securities to its customers, thus saving the
company some $ 500,000 in interest charges and setting a new standard in
the industry.<BR>
<BR>
In Los Angeles, he created an advanced system for trading based on what
was then a state-of-the-art Prime 550 Model 2. Through the RS-232 9600-baud
serial ports of up to 250 Televideo terminals, the Prime computer time-shared
a Fortran database containing the trading history of all Drexel customers,
some 1,700 high-yield securities and some 8,000 securities in the public
market.<BR>
<BR>
With a quick query, a member of Milken's team could determine the customer's
history, the amount of his potential profits or losses, his investment philosophy
and ability to buy new issues. Thus the team could link the buyers and sellers
of securities in a uniquely targeted and opportunistic way and could command
the detailed knowledge needed to counteract the strong prejudice and ratings
stigma against high-yield securities.<BR>
<BR>
Under William Haloc, a former systems analyst for Prime who joined Drexel,
the team also developed real-time analytics to allow instant calculation
of pricing for these intricate securities. These functions allowed salespeople
to view the name, issue and ratings of a security and to compute complex
yields and cash flows involving call features, sinking funds, refund schedules,
puts, warrants and prices, all instantly calculable on line. Meanwhile,
at rival firms, many dealers still fumbled with the levers on $ 3,000 Monroe
calculators.<BR>
<BR>
The entire system was monitored by Drexel Burnham's New York headquarters
and linked indirectly to the floors of the exchanges by Quotron, Reuters
and 10 other on-line services, each with a separate Rich monitor, switchable
from a keyboard. These arrays of small black monitors spread across the
desk collectively functioned like a present- day Windows display.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the features of Milken's system are Common today. But in 1980 they
were novel. This customized $ 2 million computer scheme, with five times
that amount for programming and maintenance, gave the Drexel team a mastery
of 5 the high-yield market that sometimes seemed positively sinister to
outside observers and competitors. But it was not magic or malfeasance;
it was the microcosm of the new technology joined with the knowledge and
investment genius of Michael Milken.<BR>
<BR>
More famously, Milken's grasp of the information age extended well beyond
Drexel's IS department. Focusing on emergent information companies responding
to the tectonic and regulatory turmoil unleashed by the microchip in TV
and telephony, Milken channeled a total of some $ 26 billion into MCI, McCaw,
Viacom, TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Cablevision Systems, News Corp. and other
cable, telecom, wireless, publishing and entertainment companies. At the
time, virtually none of these firms commanded substantial collateral acceptable
to a bank, and thus they could have raised these billions nowhere else.
Now, these companies are collectively worth some $ 224 billion and comprise
the foundations of a national information infrastructure unrivaled in the
world.<BR>
<BR>
With an eventual $ 2.5 billion from Drexel, MCI built the first national
single-mode fiber-optic network and spurred AT&T and Sprint into action
to give the U.S. a global lead in the technology. With another $ 1.2 billion,
McCaw launched the first national wireless telephone system. And with $
8 billion, TCI, Viacom, Time Warner, Cablevision Systems and Turner, followed
by many other Drexel high-yield issuers, made U.S. cable television a unique
national asset, with unequaled programming and broadband links. Redeemed
in the process were troubled companies providing equipment and services.
One of them was Corning, which supplied 62, 112 miles of state-of-the-art
fiber to MCI's pioneering network at a time when Corning had no other customers
for this crucial technology developed over the previous 17 years.<BR>
<BR>
Milken's influence reached well beyond his actual transactions. A once-lame
Disney was restructured with Milken's guidance and takeover pressure in
some three years of 5 a.m. meetings with Roy Disney, Frank Wells and Stanley
Gold. Then worth $ 1.8 billion, Disney emerged as a revamped Hollywood colossus
worth $ 30 billion 11 years later in 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Comprising more than half of all high-yield bond issues, Milken's activities
also embraced thousands of companies beyond the telecom, cable TV and entertainment
field--for example, building Hasbro into the world's leading toy company
and Barnes & Noble into the leading independent bookseller. His example
helped inspire many rivals, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann
Little, and Morgan Stanley, who also made heroic contributions to this campaign
of corporate renewal. In particular, Morgan Stanley channeled crucial billions
in high-yield funds to the computer, semiconductor and hard-disk drive industries
during extreme industry crises in the mid- and late 1980s as Drexel was
leaving the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Between 1976 and 1993, Jensen calculates that in these campaigns of corporate
restructuring, American corporations conducted 42,621 merger and acquisition
deals worth a total of $ 3.1 trillion. In these transactions, selling: firms
won premiums of some 41%, generating $ 899 billion in constant dollar gains
to the shareholders. Since buying firms also gained on average, by increments
that increased over the years, Jensen's estimate represents a lower bound
on the yields of the restructuring movement.<BR>
<BR>
No substantial evidence supports the speculations by Larry Summers (now
Treasury Undersecretary) and others that these gains disguise large wealth
transfers from bondholders, workers, suppliers and communities. Indeed,
the evidence assembled by Jensen, Steven Kaplan of the University of Chicago,
Harvard economist Andre Schleifer and Jensen colleague Karen Wruck, among
others, shows that capital expenditures, employment, and research and development
all rose in the aftermath of these transactions.<BR>
<BR>
As Jensen now sums it up: &quot;These are lower-bound estimates because
they do not include gains that came about later or voluntary gains that
were achieved as a result of hostile offers. I don't know any way to add
up all these benefits. But it is clear that the impact was dramatic and
it left us much more competitive as a country. Today the Japanese and the
Europeans are suffering from their delay of restructuring and the U.S. is
much leaner and more efficient.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Both Jensen and Milken agree that the opportunities today exceed even the
gains of the 1980s. Impelled by the restructuring campaign, the real value
of the equity of public firms more than doubled between 1981 and 1990, rising
by $ 1.6 trillion, or from $ 1.4 trillion to $ 3 trillion. Since then the
pace of technical change has accelerated and the possibilities for a deregulatory
breakthrough have soared with the election of a new Congress. Forbes ASAP
projects possible stock market gains for the rest of this decade of another
$ 2 trillion.<BR>
<BR>
The heightened pace of change, however, creates a desperate need for restructuring.
This $ 2 trillion opportunity depends on emancipating into the markets the
resources currently trapped in obsolete structures by capital gains taxes
near 40%, compounded by inflation, and by new antitakeover rules and outdated
telecom regulations. Flowing again into a new communications infrastructure,
into venture funds and into restructuring campaigns, freed capital can endow
entrepreneurs with the power to align their companies with the most potent
force in the history of technology.<BR>
<BR>
But first, America needs a new Milken. 
<PRE>
<B>
The Onrush of the Telecosm
</B></PRE>
With chip densities still doubling every 18 months and chip sales up nearly
30% each of the last two years, with computer MIPS (millions of instructions
per second) per dollar doubling every year and computer sales up over 25%
in each of the last two years, with hard-disk cost- effectiveness doubling
every nine months, and fiber-optics bandwidth exploding a thousandfold while
fiber deployment spreads at a pace of 1,300 miles a day--the onrush of technology
is now accelerating well beyond the pace of the 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm is now potentially converging with
the law of the telecosm. This law ordains that the value and performance
of a network rise apace with the square of the increase in the number and
power of computers linked on it. As these forces fuse, the world of computers
and communications can ride an exponential rocket.<BR>
<BR>
The 50 million new computers sold into America's homes and offices over
the last two years guarantee a huge market for broadband networks. Half
of the PCs sold in December bore Pentium microprocessors, and 60% of the
PCs went into homes. These computers process data at a pace rapidly approaching
100 MIPS. Early in the next century, just five years from now, most American
households will command multimedia teleputers processing data in billions
of instructions per second and pouring it out at gigabit-per-second rates--or
as much as a million times the current digital dribble of 9.6-kilobit modems.<BR>
<BR>
But not today. This computer-rich, bandwidth-poor situation means a crippling
and unnecessary mismatch between microcosm and telecosm, between the power
of PCs and the bandwidth of the networks that serve them--between PC instructions
per second on single-chip silicon and telco bits per second on twisted-pair
copper wires. Tens of millions of PC owners are demanding electronic commerce,
distance learning, full-motion videoconferencing, and ready access to the
graphics and hypertext of the Internet. World Wide Web.<BR>
<BR>
Yet phone and cable executives dawdle with market surveys and experiments
with interactive TV that amazingly manage to prove that people don't even
want full-motion movies. Meanwhile, the values and sales of their companies
languish. In the last 12 months, for example, the 24 leading telecom and
cable companies, led by the Regional Bell Operating Companies, lost an average
of 12.8% of their market value. Facing a world of shining broadband opportunities
in their own businesses, narrowband executives grope for glamour in Hollywood
and grasp for growth overseas.<BR>
<BR>
American industry is still cowed by overreaching regulators obsessed with
corporate power. In a world of exploding competition in the telecosm -galvanized
by new wireless and wireline technologies emerging every week--the administration,
the FCC and Congress have long been paralyzed by nightmares of John Malone
of TCI and a possible single- wire stranglehold in St. Louis or of a blight
of disinvestment in phone service for South Dakota or Alaska.<BR>
<BR>
If current fears of monopoly result in a contrived two-wire mandate on America's
communications infrastructure, however, all the hopes for an integrated
broadband two-way net will die until well into the next century. With oceans
of bandwidth languishing just out of reach, the tremendous resource of broadband
home computers will waste away, gasping on the beach for two-way channels
for teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine and telecommerce, while
the telephone and cable companies &quot;compete&quot; with rival offerings
of mostly one-way floods of movies, shopping and the Sega Channel for TVs.
By betraying its precious world- leading endowment of PCs in order to save
its existing telcos and TV companies, the U.S. still could make a literal
$ 2 trillion mistake. 
<PRE><B>

The Amazing Vindication of Junk
</B></PRE>
To grasp the size of possible opportunity and the possible mistake, let
us return to Milken and his achievement of the 1980s, which set the stage
for the current drama. Never in history has a convicted white- collar felon
been so luminously vindicated by the passage of time. His six alleged felonies
dwindled to a series of debatable violations, devoid of insider trading
and essentially costing their victims nothing (or a total of $ 318,082,
according to a dubious estimate by the court that forced him into a plea
through RICO threats against him, his family and Drexel). Returning to the
volumes of the 1980s peak, his supposed Ponzi scheme of junk finance became
the most profitable class of domestic fixed-income securities of the early
1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, if the few Savings & Loans that held a substantial portfolio of
junk had been permitted to keep it, they would have survived, prospered
and paid millions of dollars of taxes rather than collapsed into the hands
of the FDIC. For example, the shareholders of Columbia Savings & Loan may
have suffered from Thomas Spiegel's undue extravagance in company jets and
bullet-proof bathrooms. But the government crackdown cost them $ 700 million
and cost the taxpayers $ 1 billion, though the bank was on track to profit
massively from falling interest rates on its deposits and thriving high-yield
securities.<BR>
<BR>
Entrepreneurs such as ex-Drexel luminary Leon Black, who purchased the bonds
from the government at bargain-basement rates, became billionaires on the
proceeds and were charged with gulling the regulators. Meanwhile, the companies
that Milken financed with these securities now form the foundations of a
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
A minor triumph came at the end of 1994 when Vanity Fair magazine, avid
vessel of many a lurid exposed of Milken and his team, published a lavishly
photographed story on &quot;America's New Establishment.&quot; Among the
19 names were Ted Turner, Craig McCaw, Sumner Redstone, Gerald Levin, John
Malone, Rupert Murdoch, Barry Diller, Michael Eisner, Ronald Perelman and
Bill Gates. Although Milken was never mentioned, all these high fliers--with
the exception of Gates--rose to prominence largely or partly on a cresting
tide of Milken's junk.<BR>
<BR>
Why does junk work! Primarily because it frees capital from corporate bureaucracy
and gets it into the hands of entrepreneurs. During the 1980s, lower taxes
and new technologies had transformed the economic environment. What was
precious in the 1970s--metals, minerals, real estate and collectibles, all
mashed together in diversified conglomerates and tax shelters-became disposable
junk in the 1980s. What was junk in the 1970s and early 1980s--Milken's
array of leveraged cable, fiber, wireless and content schemes--became the
precious foundations of a new information infrastructure.<BR>
<BR>
How could this be so? How could one man with a poorly named venture-debt
financing vehicle contribute so hugely to the U.S. economy while, according
to Jensen's analysis, the nation's 500 largest corporations, led by a $
100 billion opportunity loss at General Motors in 11 years, incurred negative
returns with their free cash flow (cash flow beyond the amount needed to
fund all internal investments with a positive net present value)?<BR>
<BR>
Did not Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller win a Nobel prize for their
so-called M&M theorems showing that the performance of corporations is independent
of their capital structure? Have not scores of economists pursuing the Efficient
Market Hypothesis demonstrated that in general the capital exchanges are
fully efficient, that company prices reflect all of the available information
and no individual investor can systematically outwit the tape without illegal
manipulation or insider trading?<BR>
<BR>
In his presidential address to the American Finance Association in 1993,
however, Jensen answered all these arguments. On the basis of new research
on the experience of the 1980s, he declared that the M&amp;M theorems, &quot;while
logically sound, are empirically incorrect.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The central problem of the corporation, according to Jensen, is the &quot;agency&quot;
dilemma-the divergence between the interests of the managers and the owners
of large businesses. This problem is inherent in all cooperative human endeavor:
the interests of the individuals always deviate at the margin from the goals
of the group. But in times of rapid technological and political transformation,
as Jensen argues, the agency gap becomes a gulf. The structure of the corporation,
the training of its engineers, the skills of its executives, the costs of
its processes all become misaligned with the realities of a new technological
base, a rapidly changing state of the art, and a political environment in
upheaval.<BR>
<BR>
General Motors was the worst example, investing $ 121.8 billion during the
1980s in R&amp;D and capital equipment while the value of the company dropped
to $ 22.9 billion. IBM invested $ 101 billion while its value was dropping
to $ 64.6 billion by the end of 1990 (on the way to further collapse to
$ 41 billion in early 1995). Collectively, the 500 largest U.S. corporations
wasted hundreds of billions of dollars of free cash flow. What was needed,
according to Jensen, was a total overhaul of most of these companies, their
strategic redirection, and the replacement or redeployment of roughly half
of the existing managers. What occurred was a prodigal waste of resources
in defense of the obsolete structures and practices of the incumbent management.<BR>
<BR>
Creating most of the new value during the 1980s were companies funded or
restructured by corporate raiders, venture capitalists and even--in the
case of a $ 75 billion gain from the AT&T breakup--the courts (disbanding
a monopoly previously created by government). Using equity, venture capitalists
overcome the agency gulf by playing an active controlling role on company
boards and managements and by insisting that executives are compensated
chiefly through stock and options. Using venture debt and an array of complex
securities, Michael Milken overcame the agency gulf by similarly active
intervention.<BR>
<BR>
Millken channeled billions of dollars into companies such as McCaw or MCI
largely owned by the management, to compete with industry leviathans. For
companies not owned by their executives, he funded leveraged buyouts that
transformed nonowner managers feeding on free cash flow into heavy owners
of equity with virtually no liquid resources. Contracted to divert all their
free cash flow to the holders of high-yield debt, the new owner-managers
were forced to please the capital markets in order to fund any new projects.
<PRE>
<B>
The Productivity Boom</B></PRE>
With the agency problem solved, these companies became lean and mean leaders
of the global economy. Contrary to the claims of many economists, from Alan
Blinder to Lester Thurow, productivity soared. Mired in the murky data on
service-sector productivity--which was stultified by the practice of measuring
most outputs by the cost of the inputs--economists tended to miss the prodigious
real growth of the 1980s. For example, in the brokerage and finance arenas,
productivity stagnated in the data, but between 1973 and 1987 the number
of shares traded daily grew from 5.7 million to 63.8 million, while employment
only doubled in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Manufacturing productivity numbers, though more accurate, also suffer from
severe miscalculations. In a world of creative destruction, they tend to
assume that products, such as computers, that decline in price are dropping
in value. And while registering every new steel ingot, automobile or chocolate
bar, they assume that novel products represent no productivity gain at all.
These are not trivial mistakes. During the past 20 years, the cost of computers
has dropped approximately one millionfold. Yet the Bureau of Labor Statistics
shows merely an annual drop varying between 14.9% in 1992 and 6.7% in 1994.
The government has finally recognized the flaws in this statistical series,
and is moving ever so slowly to correct it. But the problem is fundamental.<BR>
<BR>
Using the criteria applied to productivity in the auto industry, the statisticians
would have to multiply the improvement in computing cost-effectiveness by
the increase in the number of computers sold. Thus, with the explosion of
sales of billions of microcomputers of all kinds, from desktop systems to
embedded devices, a consistent BLS would find that the contribution of computers
to gross domestic product was close to a billion times larger than the entire
GDP of 1970. Of course, such an exercise would be preposterous. But hardly
more preposterous than mostly ignoring the productivity gains in these industries
of rapid advance, plummeting prices and cornucopian innovation.<BR>
<BR>
Even using existing data, total factor productivity in the U.S. manufacturing
sector more than doubled during the 1980s from the level during the previous
30 years. From 1950 to 1980, this productivity index rose an average of
1.4% per year; between 1981 and 1990, it rose at a rate of 3.3%. Labor productivity
rose from 1.4% per year in the earlier period to 3.8% in the `80s. Contrary
to the usual claims, wages rose at least 10%, according to Social Security
system data, while the number of jobs rose by 18 million.<BR>
<BR>
But the most striking productivity surge came in the growth of the productivity
of capital. In essence, Milken, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Forstmann Little
and others took the vast incarcerated capital resources trapped in old-line
businesses and put it back into the markets. Not only was the productivity
of the capital left behind hugely enhanced by the disciplines of restructuring,
but the freed capital flowed into venture funds and high-yield markets where
it fueled what Jensen calls &quot;a Third Industrial Revolution.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The results were dramatic. In decline for 30 years, at an annual rate of
minus 1.03%, the capital productivity index has long been beloved by Marxists
as a portent of the collapse of capitalism. During the 1980s, however, this
decline was decisively reversed. The productivity of capital as measured
in the data rose by 2.03% annually as computerized information systems transformed
the technology of finance.<BR>
<BR>
Decisively reversed as well was a long decline of U.S. market share in the
global economy. By the period between 1987 and 1992, U.S. corporations were
generating 47.7% of all the profits in the industrial world on 37.5% of
the revenues. Spearheading the U.S. economy were information firms, with
some 70% of global profits.<BR>
<BR>
Thus was overthrown by the restructuring of the 1980s all the indifference
theorems, Efficient Market Hypotheses, corporate optimality concepts, macroeconomic
monotheories wielded in business schools and economics departments to explain
away the power and &quot;wash&quot; away the paramount worth of individual
entrepreneurs and investors. Indeed, the giant corporation, with managers
largely free of ownership claims, gained its preeminence as a way of diffusing
risk among millions of stockholders with diverse portfolios. But with the
securitization of venture debt by Michael Milken and others, these behemoths
emerge as marketplace survivors largely because of their prowess at politics,
litigation and media management--core competencies that in the course of
a decade succeeded both in derailing the Milken threat and enacting laws
and regulations to forestall any followers.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps because of a bias in favor of the capitalists, Jensen's course vies
with Michael Porter's similarly entrepreneurial class as the most popular
in the last 15 years with students at Harvard Business School--a fact which
bodes well for the future of the economy.<BR>
<BR>
Jensen and Milken agree that today's economy faces technological transformations,
agency misalignments and restructuring chances even greater than the economy
of the late 1970s and early 1980s. &quot;The opportunity is truly huge,&quot;
says Jensen. ASAP estimates that in this 40% larger economy, there should
be a chance for Milkenesque investors to raise stock market value by more
than 67%, implying both a revitalized U.S. economy, a Dow level over 6500,
a Standard & Poor's Index exceeding 700, and a Nasdaq over 1400.<BR>
<BR>
The question remains, however, how to realize these gains. Because of the
incredible continuing grip of obsolete regulations and the huge mismatch
between microcosm and telecosm, the fabulous new fiber and wireless technologies
have yet to force a corresponding industrial restructuring. The same old
players are still on the field protected by the same government rules, administered
still by Judge Harold Greene in the Modified Final Judgment breaking up
AT&T 11 years ago, and regulated still by the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission,
the Justice Department and 5O state Public Utilities Commissions as if history
had stood still. Forty million computers with multimedia powers remain stranded
in homes with four-kilohertz copper connections to the world while communications
companies still ponder the perplexities of interactive TV and regulators
ruminate about how to prevent monopoly and preserve universal service.

Cable TV's Impending Death</B></PRE>
Capsizing this entire teetering apparatus of petty fears and pettifoggery
will be this year's ascent of new wireless technologies. The basic problem
of universal service is that with current wireline telephony and cable TV,
it costs 10 to 30 times as much to serve rural customers as urban customers.
By nature, the U.S. Senate is dominated by rural customers. Many are Republicans.
Therefore, universal service has posed a paralyzing problem for programs
of deregulation. But new wireless digital technologies have utterly banished
this problem.<BR>
<BR>
At a time when all voice telephony is rapidly moving to wireless, new digital
cellular systems will soon lower the price of wireless telephony tenfold
and totally close the gap in costs between rural and urban customers. At
the same time, with supreme universality across the entire continent, Direct
Broadcast Satellite already delivers service superior to cable. Already
in the sky, DBS is a big bang that will ultimately transform the entire
corporate landscape of U.S. communications with a cascade of imperious new
realities.<BR>
<BR>
In digital DBS, GM Hughes, Hubbard Broadcasting and Thomson's RCA have delivered
a knockout new conduit for delivering one-way video. In image resolution,
in audio quality, in number of channels and in raw reach and efficiency
of point-to-multipoint transmission, DirecTV not only decisively outpaces
even the studio offerings at cable company headends but also vastly and
instantly excelled them in coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Currently the only weakness of DBS is a lack of certain critical content
such as local and broadcast network programming. The lack will be addressed,
with the help of Michael Milken, by major new restructuring this year.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely devastating to broadcast cable TV, a still more powerful DBS
will send reverberations throughout the broadcast industry and profoundly
affect computers, government regulators and telephone companies as well.
As Milken explains, &quot;Everything in the information economy is connected
to everything else.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As government regulators will be the last to notice, DBS utterly overthrows
the prime premise of cable regulation: the view that cable commands some
kind of monopoly in delivering one-way video programming. Far from a monopoly,
one-way cable TV is essentially dead. In response to DBS, cable has no choice
but to change its business radically to two- way computer services.<BR>
<BR>
The market opportunity is obvious and immense. The Internet boasted five
million host computers and over 30 million estimated users in January, and
growth of 26% in the last quarter of 1994. The largest spurt of expansion
in recent history, this surge came despite acute frustration at the narrow
bandwidth of available phone connections.<BR>
<BR>
At present, only the cable TV industry commands conduits to homes capable
of accommodating these multimedia teleputers. One-gigahertz cable TV coax
can accommodate some eight billion bits per second of two- way data or some
5,000 channels of the kind of MPEG1 video now offered in one direction by
DBS. Such bandwidth could accommodate ubiquitous videoconferencing and commerce.
By contrast, your phone line modem labors to transmit 14.4 thousand bits
per second, or enough to send one MPEG movie in two weeks.<BR>
<BR>
Reaching 63% of U.S. households, including at least 92% of homes with PCs,
cable supplies the obvious conduit for the exploding computer business.
Intel, General Instrument, Digital Equipment, Hybrid and Com21, among other
companies, are supplying cable modems and software for high-speed bidirectional
traffic over the existing cable plant. But consummation of the network will
entail large investments in fiber and switching at a time when cable is
just emerging from its regulatory shadows into the deadly Ku-band radiance
of DBS.<BR>
<BR>
The most obvious source of capital is the RBOCs, the local telephone companies
(though Milken stresses that the public utilities are a major alternative).
The Bells already command nine times as much fiber as cable TV does and
invest every year more money than the total $ 23 billion of cable revenues.
What they lack is bandwidth for broadband access to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The key to access to these huge new computer markets, therefore, is forthcoming
congressional action to permit collaboration between the RBOCs and the cable
companies within their own regions. If necessary, the telephone companies
must be allowed to buy cable companies and merge their systems. The coming
ascent of DBS should relieve the fears of monopoly that have long deterred
action. If it does, the cascade of change spurred by DBS will lead to a
flood of new commerce and communication on the networks of America.<BR>
<BR>
The endowment of DBS with new programming clout, however, will prove to
be the last triumph of conduit-content convergence. The restructuring paladins
of the broadband era will devote much of their efforts to dismantling the
content-conduit conglomerates that currently dominate the cable industry
and that are now in formation by the telephone companies.<BR>
<BR>
In a broadband era, content-conduit combines no longer make sense. Consider
that you are Warner Entertainment, a content company. You do not want to
restrict your movies to one conduit. You want to sell them through everyone's
conduit. Consider that you are Warner Communications, a cable firm. With
eight gigabits per second--enough for 5,000 movie channels--you want to
sell everyone's movies, not restrict yourself to Warner's.<BR>
<BR>
Efforts to mix content and conduit--artists and engineers-produce misaligned
companies that need restructuring. Content follies crowd into the agency
gulf. Nynex, Bell Atlantic and Pacific Telesis gave superagent Michael Ovitz
$ 14 million to pursue more &quot;content&quot; while Ameritech, BellSouth
and Southwestern Bell (SBC) romanced Disney.<BR>
<BR>
What would a new restructuring king do in the face of such ham- handed diversification?
Bring on the raiders. Sic some junkyard Doberman on the succulent bells
and whistles acquired by cable and telephone firms. Let him spin off their
recent acquisitions and interactive TV experiments and game channels and
refocus these companies on the computer networking business where they belong,
and where they can harvest the bonanza of a global economy rapidly uploading
onto the Net.

The Two-Wire Delusion
</B></PRE>
Washington has to make a choice. Is it going to allow a freedom model that
permits telephone companies and cable companies to combine as common carriers
to build a true broadband infrastructure, in which millions of entrepreneurs
can cavort and compete in content and context? Or will regulators impose
a spurious competitive model, with two or more wires to every home, all
imitating the current cable strategy of wannabe content-conduit monopolies.<BR>
<BR>
As venture capitalist Roger McNamee warned in the Feb. 27 issue of ASAP:
&quot;There is an unspoken assumption in government circles that we can
move local loop communications to a fiercely competitive business model
and build an information superhighway at the same time...an implicit assumption
that the regional Bell operating companies and the cable companies are a
bunch of knuckle-dragging dimwits who will build the superhighway no matter
what... [But] telecom businesses are characterized by high fixed costs.
There is no such thing as limited competition... As you infuse competition...the
value model of the industry collapses. And when it does, the effect will
be exactly the same as stepping on a large cow pie in your hiking boots.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Congressman Jack Fields, new Republican chairman of the House Telecom Subcommittee,
disagrees: &quot;I am convinced that the [industry] people we talked with
will respond to telecom reform. They have tens of billions of dollars parked
on the side of the information superhighway waiting for us to pass a piece
of legislation to give definition and certainty to the scene.&quot; But
the people he consulted--chiefly the leaders and the lobbyists of the RBOCs
and cable companies--are not the ones who will decide whether the highway
is built.<BR>
<BR>
Making that decision will be the same capital markets that punished Bell
Atlantic and TCI for their broadband plans and thwarted the merger between
them. As soon as it became clear--through the passage of the cable re-regulation
act of 1992 and related policies of the FCC--that the regulators would permit
collaboration only in regions where the two companies had no competitive
advantage, the case for the combine collapsed. Under a regulatory system
in which the government can sweep down and confiscate profits and channel
them into quixotic schemes of universal service in three dimensions for
the homeless or require irrational competitive behavior in a two-wire multisubsidiary
world, a true broadband two-way network makes no business sense. What will
emerge instead is an array of dueling brands of 500-channel TV, claiming
to be interactive for the benefit of Congress and the press.<BR>
<BR>
Capital markets will avoid cow-pie competition at all costs. Under these
circumstances, a true broadband system will not be completed until 2020
in the U.S. But the competitive model is fundamentally misconceived.<BR>
<BR>
To the Washington regulators and their elected allies, competition has always
meant rivalry between the existing competitors--long distance, broadcast,
Baby Bells and Cable TV--and the regulation succeeds as long as all the
teams stay on the field. But all technological competition--all innovation--consists
of the pursuit of fugitive positions of monopoly. Current legislative proposals
from the administration and its congressional allies resemble a broad national
effort in 1981 to defend the mainframe BUNCH (Burroughs, Univac, NCR, Control
Data, and Honeywell) from imperial IBM. Just as the IBM &quot;monopoly&quot;
was about to fall before the microcosm, led by Intel and Microsoft, so the
RBOC and broadcasting &quot;monopolies&quot; are about to fall before the
telecosm of broadband digital computer networks, which will also sorely
challenge Intel and Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
The new information infrastructure will bring a cornucopia of new services
from a variety of new sources that cannot even be defined as yet. All we
know is that none of the existing rivals is likely to survive in recognizable
form. Only a true freedom model that allows a complete reconstruction of
the world of communications--with anyone collaborating or competing, merging
or metamorphing with anyone rise--can allow this new era to come to fruition.
Only a freedom model can release the $ 2 trillion of new asset value that
the scholars of restructuring promise for the U.S. economy of the 1990s
and beyond.<BR>
<BR>
This result the Republicans on Capitol Hill command the unique and precious
and passing opportunity to achieve. So open the floodgates of capital for
new corporate raiders and remakers, venturers and reinventors. Rejoice in
the return of Milken and pray that he be joined by scores of rivals, including
those allowed to use the securities markets. Virtually all the cable and
telephone companies, from MCI to TCI to SBC, should be up for grabs, by
each other and from outside firms. Sitting on $ 10 billion of cash, IBM
could fruitfully enter the fray, or be frayed itself. IBM could combine
its global ATM network with cable access to homes. For many of these companies,
capital is far less scarce than vision.<BR>
<BR>
Milken cites MCI. &quot;Twelve years ago, they had a cash shortage with
billions of dollars of capital expenditures to make. They had a clear understanding
of what their business was. We supplied them with billions of dollars of
capital and that fueled the spread of fiber optics throughout the country
during the 1980s. Today their situation is far less clear. They have $ 3
billion in cash, they could borrow $ 6 billion more; they've got a strategic
worldwide partnership with British Telecom. Today the challenge is not capital.
It is vision. It is, what should MCI's future be?&quot;<BR>
<BR>
With MCI's current resources, it could buy cable facilities across the country,
join them with its fiber network, complement them with wireless personal
communications services and Internet connections, and outwit AT&T as brilliantly
as it did in the 1980s. But it has to be willing to bet the company again.
The question is whether the current management, with Bill McGowan in his
grave, can escape the agency trap, shun the cushions of large corporate
life, and become a real competitor again rather than a protected player
in a continued government sham of &quot;competition.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
When a visitor at one of the Capitol Hill offices in charge of telecom policy
points to the benefits of real competition and restructuring, the politician
will usually respond: &quot;The companies do not tell us that.&quot; The
dirty little secret of all too many telephone and cable companies is that
they prefer government-regulated &quot;competition&quot; to real entrepreneurial
risks and rewards. As long as telco and cable lobbyists fail to urge true
competition, these companies deserve much of the blame. for the Third World
regulations that still limit the horizons of their industry.<BR>
<BR>
Amazingly, however, the situation is changing from an unexpected source.
While much of industry still lags, the politicians seem ready at last to
seize the day with a new freedom model. Now the congealed glaciers of telecom
can begin to break up under the blows of a reinvigorated market for corporate
control.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps, the best solution will be again to deregulate Milken. 
<PRE><B>

Postscript: The Return of Mike Milken</B></PRE>
One morning, in his office on a quiet street in Los Angeles near Bel Air,
Milken is probing some of the outward edges of the new regime, delving into
a business plan for ridefilms. Ridefilms are a brand new industry of convergence
that blends features of theatrical films, theme- park rides and arcade games.
Giving the viewer the sensation of plummeting motion and soaring flight
on platforms that move in sync with motion on the screen, these systems
are virtual reality that really works.<BR>
<BR>
Presenting the project of the day is Whitmore Kelley of Berkshire Motion
Pictures, the firm that created the pioneering &quot;Back to the Future:
The Ride&quot; for Universal Theme Parks. He is proposing Ridetime, a low-cost
system of theater capsules for children between the ages of four and 10.<BR>
<BR>
These turnkey theaters could bring ridefilms to malls, shopping centers,
toy stores, theme parks, resorts, restaurants and family entertainment centers
at a toll of $ 1.50 per child, eight children at a time. Offering four-minute
musical adventures with engaging plots and educational themes, these systems
would be the first to shun the &quot;testosterone market&quot; of the arcades
and focus on young children.<BR>
<BR>
Milken had heard enough. He confessed he had only been able to read five
sections of the business plan during the two or three minutes that had elapsed.
But with a quizzical Columbo look, he said he had some questions. He had
recently seen similar systems in Norway and Sweden. Small groups of parents
and kids together paid the equivalent of $ 4 apiece to plummet down an Olympic
Alpine downhill or bobsledding course. No, they weren't real ridefilms,
with synchronized physical movement, but they were cheap to produce and
offered a similar experience and there would be a lot more where those came
from. How would Berkshire compete with these? Let's say he owned space in
an arcade. Teenagers pump in money all day long and deep into the night.
Why would he give space to a children's ride that takes up twice as much
room and closes down at bedtime? Interactivity? Watch out for that. Kids
today get real interactivity on their computers and Nintendo machines at
home. Any effort to provide interactive features for eight kids at once
might well turn them off. Where would the parents be? They would see the
show for nothing, standing behind the kids, without the motion that makes
it interesting. That's a downer. A four-year-old will demand that the parents
sit with him. The parents are your customers. Make them pay and let them
ride.<BR>
<BR>
Commenting that Kelley had described other ridefilm companies as the competition,
Milken demurred. The computer software industry would be the competition.
He grilled Kelley on the size of the capsule, its cost per square foot,
its yield to the owner of the space in a mall, the quality of the images,
the nature of the liquid crystal projection technology.<BR>
<BR>
As Kelley described it, &quot;Milken is so mentally aggressive and determined
I was astonished. I came in and he began playing the flute and several other
instruments at once, and I had to figure out what the dance was and start
moving and shaking in time. Teaching, learning and testing at the same time.
. .he was amazing.&quot; At the end of the presentation, Milken announced
that he was impressed and would go visit a prototype of the new system nearby
in the L.A. suburbs.<BR>
<BR>
Or watch him on President's Day in a paneled room in Atlanta's Occidental
Grand Hotel. He is contemplating a new learning network as a climax to some
25 years and $ 250 million of Milken family ventures in the field of education.
Milken has assembled leading experts on education, film and finance to consult
with the CEO of the new project, Hamilton Jordan, recently of Whittle Communications.<BR>
<BR>
Milken began with the crucial rule that the educational network &quot;go
first to the home, later to the schools,&quot; rather than the other way
around (which was Whittle's mistake). &quot;The teachers themselves will
bring any good material into the schools,&quot; he said. He ended by suggesting
that the group had radically underestimated the size of their potential
market. He pointed to his earlier investment in Interface Group, the sponsor
of Comdex, recently sold to Japanese entrepreneur Masayoshi Son of Softbank
Corporation for $ 800 million. Virtual conferences and teleconferences for
training and education and lifelong learning could become a leading vehicle
of convergence, joining software, computers, consumer electronics, telephones
and even public utilities.<BR>
<BR>
As he summed up, he declared that the size of the educational market, appropriately
defined today to include corporate training, was not $ 400 billion as Jordan
had said, but more than $ 1 trillion. Visionary and trenchant as ever, lifting
the horizons of all around him, Milken was clearly back.

Breakup Candidates?
</B></PRE>
AT&amp;T: In both history and promise, AT&T may be the world's greatest
technology company, combining microcosm with telecosm more intimately than
any other. With Bell Labs, 59% of the long-distance market, and McCaw's
access to the local loop, AT&T today also should be one of the most valuable
companies in the world. But its management has reduced its market cap to
just over one times sales, making it nearly the cheapest major phone company
in the country. Bell Labs performed much of the early work on the vital
new multimedia communications technology of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM),
but a new startup named Fore Systems dominates the market with scores of
other companies. Judge Green broke up AT&T once. Smart management would
break it up again.<BR>
<BR>
TIME WARNER: Time Warner went to the well for high-yield securities in 1984
at the time of the Atari crash. It plunged deep into debt to save the company
and preserve it film assets. With Lorimar, it produced more than a third
of all TV programming; with Warner films, it was the dominant Hollywood
force; with Warner records, it ruled music; and with Warner Communications,
it was the second-biggest cable system. In other words, it followed the
content-conduit strategy. Unfortunately, this strategy twisted its Orlando
project into unprofitable knots. Mobilizing some of the best technology
in the world- Silicon Graphics 3D interface and servers, AT&amp;T ATM, Scientific
Atlanta's 64QAM transmission-Warner compressed it into a TV set-top box
and centralized server system focused on delivering movies over cable conduits.
This business won't pay for the plant. Perhaps belatedly recognizing this
problem, the company is now veering in the oppsite direction, ordering 1.5
million new analog set-top boxes for $ 250 million from General Instrument.
Don't they grasp the deadly meaning of the DBS big bang?<BR>
<BR>
This company needs restructuring to get ready for a broadband world. It
must spin off its precious content and transform its conduit to accommodate
the only real interactive machines with market penetration, namely PCS.<BR>
