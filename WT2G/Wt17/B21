<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Dutch Development Cooperation</h3>



The Netherlands development cooperation is based on several types of motives. The importance attached to

new international relations in foreign policy after a colonial past, a strong religious sense of solidarity with

poor people, and commercial motives relating to the position and economic characteristics of the

Netherlands. Official bilateral development cooperation started in the early sixties, built also on a long and

active church-related NGO-tradition and on an active and critical governmental support since World War II

for the functioning of the UN institutions. The first Minister for Development Cooperation was appointed in

1965. Parliamentary and public support for development cooperation has always been very strong, and at the

same time watchful. The Dutch media play an active role in public monitoring. Although domestic issues

appear to become more predominant in the attention of the public, a large part of the population is actively

and often personally involved in development cooperation. 

<p>

Net official development assistance of the Netherlands in 1992 amounted to US $ 2 753 million, being 0.86

per cent of GNP. Multilateral disbursements amounted to about one-third of ODA over the years, usually

equally shared by the UN, the Bretton Woods institutions and the EU. Multilateral ODA grew in 1991 and

1992, recovering the earlier one third share (23 per cent of ODA plus 9 per cent to the EU in 1992), but

dropped in 1993 to an estimated 28 per cent of ODA. 

<p>

Presently a discussion is conducted about the future contents and financial targets for Dutch development

cooperation. In 1967 the Netherlands have set themselves a total aid budget target (the 'ceiling') of 1 per

cent of the net national income (NNI), in 1977 set at 1.5 per cent of NNI (roughly 1.2 per cent of Dutch

GNP). Since 1990 a decrease set in and a growing number of other expenses that "contaminated" ODA and

non-ODA parts of budget: growing emergency aid to non-DAC countries, aid for Eastern European

countries, peace-keeping activities and reception and care of refugees in the Netherlands. The actual total

'ceiling' in 1993 reached 1.39 per cent of NNI (= 1.10 % of GNP) including 0.81 % of GNP for ODA

with an estimation for 1994 of 1.42 per cent NNI (0.8 per cent of GNP). In 1992 the ceiling was left. These

developments resulted in an effective reduction of the available volume for assistance to developing

countries.

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

The Netherlands' official development cooperation is not laid down in an organic law. It started in 1964 as

an annex to the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of which it still a part. The Minister for

Development Cooperation is a Cabinet Minister without portfolio; he has no budget or staff of his own. The

Ministry of Foreign Affairs includes a Directorate-General for International Cooperation (DGIS). Officials at

the DGIS are integrated with the Dutch Foreign Service. Parts of the development budget of DGIS are

implemented by the Cabinet of Netherlands-Antilles and Aruban Affairs, by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

and by the eleven other ministries. Voluntary multilateral contributions are under the responsibility of the

Minister of Finance, but only after consulting the Minister for Development Cooperation).  

<p>

The core structure of the DGIS is a three-dimensional matrix, organised around sectors, countries and

channels (bilateral, multilateral and NGOs), supplemented by functional departments and sub-departments

according to specific implementation modalities. The total lay out reflecting the firm (and sometimes

complex) set of objectives, points of attention, criteria and tests per programme, project and country. Over

the years the administrational set-up of the DGIS has been changed several times, under influence of

changing policy priorities and efforts to improve efficiency, effectiveness and financial accountability. Since

some time actions are undertaken to simplify procedures.

<p>

Preparation, formulation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of activities are, for the majority,

either sub-contracted to external consultants, firms or independent institutions and NGOs, or to several -

government related- institutions. Moreover, the Netherlands promote spending of cooperation funds in the

Third World, use and support local capacity and follow Europe-wide tendering procedures. The Government

intends to focus more on priorities set by developing countries, and on local implementation and capacity

building. Among the government funded organisations that implement specific programmes are: the Centre

for the Promotion of Imports from Developing Countries (CBI) that stimulates imports into Europe from

LDCs; the Netherlands Finance Company for Developing Countries (FMO), a bank for the development of

the private sector in the Third World; the SNV-Netherlands Development Organisation for project and

personnel assistance. A number of government programmes exist with a wide range of NGOs for various

policy areas, based on long term block grant contracts (see further 3. Other Actors). For emergency aid

Dutch and international NGOs are sub-contracted. Direct funding by the DGIS to NGOs in the Third World

and to International NGO-networks does occur. The DGIS has programmes for cooperation with Dutch

industry and banks, that are relatively limited in volume and number. The Netherlands Investment Bank for

Developing Countries (NIO) handles financial programme aid for which the developing country concerned

has full executive responsibility.  

<p>

The Policy Planning Section of the DGIS concentrates on long term strategic policies as well as mid and

long term budget planning. Country and sector policies are designed at the desks concerned with a large

input from the embassies and local expertise. Approximately 70 sector specialists and technical advisers

have been appointed at embassies and at the DGIS. Within the DGIS matrix many consultations take place

between the various departments, with or without external advisers and/or on the basis of external studies.

Implementation of the earlier mentioned policy changes generates a greater need for internal and external

policy coordination.

<p>

There are several instruments for coordination of the Netherlands development policy. International

environmental concern and peace-keeping activities are increasingly becoming subjects for interministerial

policy coordination. Besides the bilateral consultations between the DGIS and the ministries on the above

mentioned budget items for which the Minister for Development Cooperation acts as policy coordinator, two

important interministerial committees operate. Ministers who are responsible for a certain policy area that is

subject to interministerial coordination, cannot take a decision without consulting other ministers, or without

discussion in the Cabinet. The Minister for Development Coordination is responsible for coordination of

development policy. He appoints the members of the Interministerial Coordination Committee for

development Cooperation (COCOS), which prepares the discussions for the Ministerial Council for

Development Cooperation (ROS) that is chaired by the Prime Minister. Both committees meet frequently.

The Minister for Development Cooperation is also a member of the Council for Economic Affairs that

prepares Cabinet discussions about economic, financial, monetary and social policy. DGIS participates in

meetings of the Council for Trade Policy and in the Coordinating Committee on International Environment

Issues. 

<p>

The Independent Operations Review Unit (IOV) at the DGIS reports directly to the Minister. IOV reports

are sent to Parliament, and they are translated and published. IOV activities are to be distinguished from

ongoing project and programme evaluations (annually: 150) which are an obligatory component of the

project cycle. IOV studies influence DGIS policy. 

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

In 1964 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation (NAR) was installed, following the

example of the Belgium Government. Its installation was motivated by the wish to develop a consistent

development cooperation policy and to involve as many sections of Dutch society as possible in its aid

policy. The Council provides policy and scientific advice to the Minister for Development Cooperation, and

through him or her to the Netherlands Government. As a Sector Council for development cooperation, the

NAR may address its recommendations also to other Ministers. The Council generally advises on topics of

mid- to long term policy. Occasionally matters of more immediate relevance are treated. After its installation

in 1964, the Council used to comment on the annual budget for development cooperation.

<p>

The NAR has 70 members, who are appointed on the basis of their personal expertise, their active interest

in development cooperation, and their availability for advisory work. NAR members come from many

sectors of Dutch society, a.o. industry and banks, religious organisations, politics, universities and research

institutes, labour unions. The composition of the Council is meant to include the ideas on development held

in Dutch society as a whole. The chairperson and the members of the Council are appointed by the Minister

for Development Cooperation for a period of four years, after which they can be reappointed. The NAR

may make reports on its own initiative or at the request of the Minister; around 80 % of the NAR reports

were prepared on request by the various ministers. Thus the NAR may be considered to have two main

functions, 1) to provide information not directly available at the DGIS, and 2) to function as a bridge

between government and society. The functions of chairperson, vice-chairperson and special activities of

NAR-members are renumerated.

<p>

The NAR is assisted by an official secretariat, which forms part of the Policy Planning Section of the DGIS.

At the secretariat, headed by a Secretary, currently work five persons. The Council has its own budget,

provided by the MFA.

<p>

The Minister for Development Cooperation is bound to respond to NAR recommendations. The written

reply of the Minister is sent to the Chairman of the Council and to Parliament. In preparing a

recommendation, the Council may organise hearings, sub-contract additional expertise, undertake studies,

and organise conferences. Recommendations are written by working groups of Council members and

finalised in a Plenary Meeting of the Council. A recommendation may be followed up by conferences,

discussions and other publications. In addition the Council prepares position papers and commentaries on

current issues in development cooperation. 

<p>

Since its start the Council has produced around 135 policy recommendations and reports on a wide range of

subjects. Currently it prepares recommendations on technology and development; on conflicts, security and

development; on an interministerial discussion paper about the 'joint implementation' (i.e. of emission

reduction measures) of the Framework Convention on Climate Change (1992). The Council is preparing

recommendations for the UN International World Conference on Women and Development (1995), for the

UN Social Summit (1995). Recent recommendations are: on the UN International Conference on Population

and Development (1994), on urban poverty combating, on development cooperation after the Treaty of

Maastricht, on norms and policy of the Dutch development cooperation. 

<p>

NAR recommendations, commentaries and other reports are summarised, translated in French and English,

and distributed to a wide public in the Netherlands -and abroad-, including Parliament. The NAR issues an

annual report and a publications list. 

<p>

Regular consultations between the administration and representatives of institutions and organisations in

Dutch society are an essential part of the Dutch political system. Advisory councils have a long tradition in

the Netherlands. There are presently 135 permanent and temporary advisory councils in the Netherlands.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has seven advisory councils (including the NAR), a.o. on human rights,

peace and security, and research. Recommendations by several Councils on the same subject area(s) are

coordinated. The presidium of the NAR annually discusses its work with members of both Chambers of

Parliament, with the Minister and with the Director-General of the DGIS. Several members of the NAR are

also involved in the work of other advisory councils. 

<p>

The Government has decided to reduce the number and the status of Dutch advisory councils, within its

efforts to renew and streamline administrative structures and procedures. Councils will have to focus on

advisory tasks, which will be separated from consultation processes. Within a new set-up the Parliament

may also directly request advice from these councils.

The annual budget for development cooperation is discussed extensively in both Chambers of Parliament.

The Minister has regularly discussions with the Standing Commissions of the Second Chamber of

Parliament. Till 1993 with the Standing Commission for Development Cooperation, thereafter with the

Standing Commission for Foreign Affairs. 

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

The Netherlands have an extensive network of NGOs, in nearly all sectors of society, that follow

government policies critically. The NGO-community for development cooperation plays an active role in

policy formulation, implementation and development education. The numerous development NGOs can

roughly be classified in 3 groups. Firstly the 4 Co-financing Organisations CEBEMO, HIVOS, ICCO and

NOVIB, the trade-unions FNV and CNV, the employers associations VNO and NCW (for management

assistance), the Organisation for Cooperation in Development Research and Education (NUFFIC, for

international education), the Foundation for Communication (the media), the Union of Dutch Municipalities,

the Hindu-Islamic HIMOS, and the expert-sending organisation PSO. These are all umbrella organisations

for large numbers of NGOs that are involved in development policy cooperation through long term

arrangements with the Government. Secondly, more than 300 local and national NGOs and action

committees involved in development cooperation on a project-by-project base and third, NGOs for

development education receiving support from the government funded NCO (National Committee for

Development Education).

<p>

When the budget for development cooperation is up for discussion in Parliament, representatives of the

NGOs are consulted by the Standing Committee on Development Cooperation. Since 1965 the DGIS has

built up an effective working relationship with the NGOs, which includes formulated formal procedures for

implementation, monitoring, consultation, evaluation and policy dialogue. Meetings between the Minister, or

representatives of the DGIS, with representatives from NGOs and boards are held monthly. Important

developments in developing countries are regularly discussed. 

<p>

Areas of concern for the Dutch NGOs in the current discussion with the Government are amongst others:

the consequences of the new development policy for the availability of funds for long term structural

development in the poorest countries, the claims other ministries might lay on the budget for non-

development purposes (in the Netherlands).

<p>

The 1991 OECD/EADI survey qualifies 48 institutes in the Netherlands as Development Research and

Training Institutes, some of which cooperate in the NUFFIC for training of foreign students. The Advisory

Council for Scientific Research in Development Problems (RAWOO), a sector council in 1990 installed by

the Minister for Development Cooperation, of Education and Science, and of Agriculture, Nature

Management and Fisheries, advises the Government on research policies for development cooperation. Its

main activity is to assess project proposals for research.

<h1 align=center>Simply... The Ideal Home</h1>


<br>
<font size=4>

For consumer societies the ideal home is the ultimate buy, a

private shelter from the outside world, packaged with gadgets

and comforts supplied by industries that spend a fortune

peddling a fantasy. But this 'ideal' creates more problems than

it solves in an outside world that won't go away. In the South,

some innovative housing projects for homeless people have

started a thoughtful process by asking themselves what their

ideal home would be like. The NI goes back to the drawing board

to set out some of the basic principles on which decent homes

have to be built.</font><br clear=all><p>


<hr width=71%><p>


<br>



<h3>AVAILABILITY </h3>





<li> There must be enough homes to go around.<p>




<li>Availability is not just dependent on the number of houses but

the type of household - in the West smaller households and more

people living alone mean more homes are needed (and of a

different kind).<p>




<li>World population growth means more homes are needed - and the

resources to build them.<p>




<li> A 'market in homes always leads to a deficit - high-rent slum

accommodation makes more profit than building decent homes for

the poor.<p>




<li> If housing shortages have ever been solved, it is as a result

of public policy and shared initiatives.

<p>
<hr width=71%><p>





<br clear=all><br>



<h3>SUITABILITY</h3>


<li>The best homes are 'culture specific - they reflect how people

live in a particular culture, as well as in private life.<p>



<li>They adapt to local conditions and materials: e.g. cooled by

ventilation in a hot climate, warmed by insulation in a cold

climate.<p>



<li>Modern city buildings are a major problem because they

require vast energy inputs for heating or air conditioning.<p>




<li> Good, secure homes are protected by clean water, sanitation

and appropriate siting (with no danger of flooding or landslip).

They conserve energy and materials.


<p>
<hr width=71%><p>



<br clear=all><br>





<h3>AFFORDABILITY</h3>



<p><li>We spend a huge proportion of our income on our home. Housing

scarcity increases this price, playing on insecurity and fear of

homelessness. Property speculation and use of homes as status

symbols have a similar effect.



<p><li>The housing market neglects affordable homes for the poor:

profits on property will decrease if houses are less scarce.



<p><li>The key to affordable housing is the participation of those

needing decent homes. Grandiose schemes without such

participation invariably turn into housing disasters (even if

they make money for construction companies).



<p><li>Violent swings in the market value of houses contradict the

idea that the ideal home provides financial security.



<p>
<hr width=71%><p>


<br clear=all><br>



<h3>FLEXIBILITY</h3>



Our housing needs vary through life...



<p><li>As children - somewhere safe for our parents to look after us.



<p><li>As young people/independent adults - somewhere free of

restrictions.



<p><li>As parents - somewhere with space for children.



<p><li>As individuals in old age, sickness, disability, distress -

somewhere adapted to our physical limitations or need for

support.



<p><li>A house designed for a young family (e.g. stairs, large

garden) may be useless for elderly or infirm people.



<p><li>People can end up trapped in houses that are too large or too

small, too quiet or too noisy. These feel less and less like

home.



<p><li>In extreme cases people are put in institutions called

'homes'.



<p>
<hr width=71%><p>


<br clear=all><br>



<h3>ACCESSIBILITY</h3>



<p><li>A house that is distant from work, schools, health and social

care networks, is no home at all. More time is spent travelling

than at home.



<p><li>Car-based societies that neglect public transport leave the

carless (often a vulnerable group anyway) locked in their houses.



<p><li>Deregulated economies demand that people move to where there

is work. This kills communities and promotes migration to cities

that lack housing already.



<p><li>There is no sign yet that the 'information superhighway' will

reverse this trend by turning homes into workplaces. If it did

there would be the problem of homes 'invaded' by work from which

there is no escape.



<p>
<hr width=71%><p>


<br clear=all><br>



<h3>RESPONSIBILITY</h3>



<p><li>The best housing is created by communities and reflects their

participation. Mass housing - whether by governments or private

developers - rarely achieves this. Both tend to result in

ghettos - public spaces shrouded in fear or private homes as

'secure' bunkers. (Makes one more line)



<p><li> Communities that take reponsibility into their own hands or

build 'informal' homes for themselves often face official

hostility, inadequate capital finance and no access to public

services.



<p><li>Making housing and living conditions an urgent public

priority would improve health standards more than any other

single factor.

When heavy rains and flooding threatened widespread hunger last year, WOMANKIND made an appeal to the ODA's Emergency Aid Department to assist the 700 BEWDA members until the next harvest. The appeal was successful and the first bowls of subsidised grain were distributed in March.<p>The scheme has been very successful, distributing 10 bowls of grain fortnightly to each member during the hungriest period. One of the main aims of the scheme was to ensure that the women were not forced to sell their goods and livestock in order to buy food before the next harvest came in. Being able to buy grain at nearly half the inflated market price has meant that the women have not lost the productive assets they worked so hard to acquire. One family spoke of the relief they felt that they would not have to sell their last remaining plough bullock, their main source of income.   <p>By July, BEWDA members were harvesting their early staple crop and no longer needed to rely on the subsidised grain. Furthermore, having had food throughout the hungry season, the women are now in good enough physical shape to plant the Autumn crops. It is important that the assistance this year is viewed as an emergency measure only. Already, the women are thinking about what actions they need to take to help themselves in the next hungry season. We support the determination of the BEWDA members to find their own solutions that will lead to the long term and sustainable development of their communities.<p><b><a href="index.html">Contents Page</a></b><p><hr><p>©Copyright:1996 Womankind Worldwide<hr></body></html>

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Austrian Development Cooperation</h3>



Official Austrian development cooperation started in the mid 1970s, based on charitable church-related and a

voluntary tradition of assistance to post-war European countries and refugees. Attention and assistance

traditionally were more focused on the consequences of East - West conflicts than on North - South

relations. Its neutral position in international politics facilitated Austria's intermediary role in UN affairs.

North - South development cooperation received rather belatedly attention in Austrian politics. Although the

majority of the Austrian public has a positive attitude towards development cooperation, it does not yet

appear to be well informed on this point, and appears to overestimate current Austrian development efforts.

Development education activities are stepped up by the Government. 

<p>

Net official development assistance amounted to US $ 556 million in 1992, which was 0.30 per cent of

GNP. This percentage was 0.25 cent in 1990 and 0.34 in 1991. The Government has stated the intention to

reach the DAC average (1990) for ODA of 0.35 per cent of GNP and, later, the EU average for ODA of

0.51 per cent. In 1992 24 per cent of Austria's ODA was disbursed through multilateral channels.

Multilateral contributions increase faster than the bilateral component, and will continue to do so as a

consequence of Austria's EU membership. 

<p>

<hr><a name="ins"><h3>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

<p>

The legislative basis for Austria's aid programme is the Development Cooperation Act of 1974 and

subsequent Acts in 1977, 1983 and 1989. Development cooperation is not the responsibility of one minister,

but is spread over several ministries. Till 1989 development cooperation was the responsibility of the

Federal Chancellor and thereafter the competence of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Since 1991 a State

Secretary for Integration and Development Cooperation, who heads the Department for Development

Cooperation in the Federal Chancellery (BKA) is responsible. The State Secretary is responsible for:

bilateral technical aid, co-financing programmes, humanitarian and emergency aid and parts of the

multilateral financial assistance. The financial efforts in these areas however, amount to less than 30 per

cent of the bilateral programme in 1992. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is responsible for multilateral aid.

The Ministry of Finance is responsible for financial aid (a.o. debt relief) and concessional official export

credits. The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for aid to refugees (in Austria), the Ministry of

Agriculture for food aid and the Ministry of Science and Research as well as the Ministry of Education are

both partly responsible for the scholarship programme. 

<p>

Since Austrian law does not allow the government to carry out its own programmes (principle of

subsidiarity), there is no governmental aid agency for the implementation of project. Implementation is

contracted out to private firms and NGOs or implemented by the federal L„nder and Municipalities.

<p>

The Secretary at the BKA is responsible for the overall coordination, programming and reporting on aid

policies, with the above mentioned extensive limitations. Policy planning is done by a Planning and

Programming which comes under the competence of the Department for Development Cooperation of the

BKA. During the coming re-organisation the number and expertise of the currently small number of staff in

the department will be enlarged and up-graded. 

<p>

To strengthen the coordination of the aid programme an Interministerial Committee for the Coordination of

Aid was established in 1992, including a dozen senior officials of the various ministries. The Committee is

chaired by the Director-General of the Department for Development Cooperation. The Committee can issue

non-binding recommendations only. 

<p>

<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Formal Advisory Structures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

<p>

In 1974 an Advisory Council on Development Cooperation (Beirat) was established in order to guarantee a

coordinated development policy and implementation. The Council could advise the Federal Chancellor on

these matters. The ca. 50 members of the Council are appointed by the Federal Chancellor and represent all

major sections in society, including Members of Parliament of the Standing Committee for Foreign Affairs,

representatives of NGOs, industry, and trade unions. It is chaired by the State Secretary for Integration and

Development Cooperation.

<p>

The Council meets three or four times a year. Meetings are held at the request of the State Secretary. The

Council does not write reports or recommendations. It is a panel for discussion with the State Secretary.

Discussions are considered as an input for policy formulation which is executed by the State Secretary and

the officials involved. The Council's main function is preserving the support for development cooperation in

Austrian society. It discusses amongst others: DAC reports, the negotiations with EU and the government's

Three-Year Programme for Development Cooperation. The operational criteria for Austrian development

cooperation were elaborated in 1979 and 1980 by a working group of the Council, based on the 1974 Law.

The Council appears to play a minor role since. The Council has no Secretariat. Members can be contacted

through the Federal Chancellery. The Council does not publish any documents of its discussions and its

present agenda is not known.

<p>

In order to improve its functioning working groups were established in 1992 on environmental questions and

on human rights. In the DAC Aid Review of 1992/93 the Austrian government is invited to reconsider the

role of the Advisory Council with regard to obtaining the necessary support of the population for an

enlarged and improved aid programme. In view of greater efficiency, a reduction of the number of Council

Members should be considered. 

<p>

Parliament has a Standing Sub-Committee on Development Policy (under the responsibility of the Standing

Committee for Foreign Affairs) which sets its own agenda. Parliament apparently does not show great

interest in questions of aid. Debates on government reports submitted to Parliament have been held

belatedly. In 1988 Parliament conducted an enquiry into the development assistance, but there has been no

active follow up reported.

<p>

<a name="ngo"><HR><h3>Non-State Sources of Advice</h3></a>

<p>

There are many small, mainly church related NGOs and a number of large ones. In 1991/1992 sixty per

cent of the bilateral aid was channelled through fifty NGOs. Four NGOs accounted for two-thirds of funds

made available. The NGOs continuously urge the government to improve the performance of its aid

programme and to raise the volume of aid. Discussions with the government concentrate on the question

whether 

NGOs can be discussion partners for the government in development cooperation policy matters or whether

they are subcontractors for implementation of projects only. In 1993 the Government and NGOs entered into

serious negotiations in order to establish a long term cooperation programme between government and

NGOs. An umbrella organisation of several development NGOs, the Working Association for Development

Cooperation (AGEZ), is acknowledged by the Government as a discussion partner on issues such as the

quality of Austrian aid and the consequences of Austria's EU membership. 

<p>

The NGOs can be roughly divided into four categories: firstly, organisations for the care of foreign students

in Austria (which originated in the late 1950s at the universities); experts and volunteer sending

organisations, organised in the Institute for International Cooperation and in the Austrian Development

Service; third, NGOs that implement projects in developing countries and fourth, NGOs for information and

development education.

<p>

According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey 11 institutes qualify as Development Research and Training

Institutes. Several contribute to the debate on development policy and implementation, such as the Vienna

Institute for Development Cooperation, the Austrian Foundation for Development Cooperation and the

Austrian Research Foundation for Development Cooperation. The latter institute publishes an annual survey

and analyses of Austria's development cooperation.

<a name=intro><h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>





Finland has had a development aid programme financed out of public funds for nearly thirty years now. During this time, Finnish development cooperation policy has emerged from a large number of individual policy statements.  As the overall picture of development cooperation at both the national and the international level is changing rapidly, there is a more pronounced need for a comprehensive new steering instrument. Both the nation's political leaders and the machinery responsible for development cooperation need a steering tool comparable to the strategic planning systems familiar in the business world.<p>





The present document is the highest level of this new strategic planning system, defining the general goals of development cooperation and the means to achieve them. The shaping and processing of the lower levels do not necessarily assume the same public significance; they are designed for use over a shorter term than the present principles and, following these general goals, define the individual targets by country, sector and organization.  Thus sectors important for Finnish development cooperation - such as agriculture and forestry, food aid, water supply and other areas basic to human development - may well have detailed action plans of their own within the framework of the present document, explaining why the latter does not go into such fundamental issues.  Rather, it establishes a hierarchy of goals and means to clarify and guide operations and ensure their goal-orientation, while also permitting more flexible adjustment to changing circumstances or viewpoints.<p>





In speaking of developing countries and development cooperation, the document bases itself on the OECD definitions in force at the time of writing.  The strategy does not, therefore, apply to other foreign aid given by Finland outside the scope of development cooperation.<p>


<hr size=3>





<a name=changes><h4>CHANGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION CLIMATE</h4>








<a name=global><li><h4>Changes in global politics and economics</h4>





The end of the Cold War has altered the relations between the great powers and their allies.  The effect on other countries, too, has been profound and intense.  In relations between the developing and developed countries, the first sign was the solid progress made in solving certain regional conflicts. In the longer term, the new situation in world politics has permitted various universal problems to be viewed from a new standpoint.  Thus, as well as concern for natural resources, trade and indebtedness, other issues such as <br>


- the environment <br>


- demographic problems, including mass movements of population <br>


- problems connected with drugs, terrorism and organized crime, and <br>


- epidemics <br>


have become priority concerns in terms of the interdependence between developing and developed nations.<p>





The factor common to all these problem groupings is that they cannot be solved other than through cooperation between the industrialized and developing world.  In practice, this means that the <strong>financial burden</strong>, among other things, must be shared by the two groups.<p>





The end of the Cold War has also meant that development cooperation can no longer be justified by the same <strong>security policy arguments </strong> as before, when the great powers and their allies often gave aid to developing countries in order to keep them 'in the same camp' or prevent them allying themselves with the other side.  Developing countries also have to <strong>compete with the CEE countries and the CIS </strong> for political attention, markets, and first and foremost development funds.  There is no longer the same solidarity between developing countries as was created by political means in the '60s and which served them well as late as the '70s, during the debate about 'a new international economic order'.  Today, the developing nations fall into several different groups both economically and politically: there are countries already integrated into world economics and approaching the standing of a developed nation, countries which can look forward to integration in the near future, and - mainly in Africa - countries for which this is only a remote possibility.  There is no economically and politically homogeneous 'developing world' any more.<p>





Views of what comprises development and how it can be achieved have varied greatly since the Second World War.  A process began with the oil crises in the '70s that drew the developing countries into a rapid debt spiral and led economists to study macroeconomic policy.  According to the familiar <strong>neo-liberal development model </strong> - which has won wide support, particularly since the socialist option fell into disrepute - there are four basic factors in development:<br>


- a sound macroeconomic base<br>


- the widest possible integration into the world economy <br>


- investment in human resources (education, training, health, nutrition, etc.) and <br>


- an economic system that promotes free competition.<p>





This model is, however, justifiably criticized, partly because, if it is applied, it may well conflict with other components such as equality, environmental demands or cultural values.  It also fails to sufficiently recognize that development is not just an economic and social phenomenon, but derives most emphatically from history, culture and politics.<p>





The changing world picture has also altered ideas about the relationship between development cooperation and other aspects of relations with developing countries. The idea that dominated, say, Nordic development cooperation thinking until way into the '80s, i.e. that developing countries should be the objects of a global social policy, is now discredited and being replaced by belief in the interdependence of the whole of mankind.  This view leads us to examine the relationship between development cooperation and other policy areas affecting the developing countries (those on agriculture, trade, competition, labour, immigration, etc.).  Reducing these contradictions, that is, <strong>promoting coherence </strong> is one of the main problem issues of the '90s in the relations between OECD countries and developing countries. The outcome may be a change in the scale of development funding in the future, assuming that the same goals can also be reached by means other than development cooperation. <p>








<a name=percep><li><h4>Changing perceptions of development cooperation</h4>





In the past, discussion of the developing countries' own economic policy was pushed into the background by the desire of colonies for economic as well as political independence, a form of economic thinking that stressed dependence on the industrial countries as the initial cause of the developing countries' problems ('schools of dependency'), and the assumption that investment was the key to development.  Things began to change in the '70s, with the oil crises, and particularly in the '80s, as indebtedness forced the developing countries to re-examine their economic policies and the project-by-project approach led to failure in a growing number of cases, ultimately in part because of the economic and social policy pursued by the recipient country concerned. Restructuring the economies of developing countries also seemed to have had an impact on the preconditions for effective development cooperation. Donor countries' support for structural adjustment, including a shift to a more open economy and integration into world trade, came to be as important a goal of development cooperation as well planned and executed projects. At the same time, the negative social effects of structural adjustment began to be felt, though initially, at least, donor countries failed to pay enough attention to them.<p>





During the '80s, development cooperation authorities gradually changed over to a form of financing in which the 'unit' was not a project, but rather economic policy at various levels, or in different sectors of the economy, and in which <strong>certain economic conditions </strong> were attached to funding granted ('<strong>policy-based aid'</strong>). This formed an integral part of the broadly accepted principle that all countries are ultimately responsible for their own development, and that it is primarily the policy adopted by the developing country concerned which determines the course of its development.  Programme assistance tied to economic policy must be viewed as support from donor countries for economic structural adjustment in the developing country concerned.<p>





Today, conditions are attached to other social features, and not just to economic policy.  All the OECD countries are committed to promoting respect for human rights, democratic government and the rule of law in developing countries.  Many developing countries are indeed carrying out reforms to these ends, prompted by changes in the international political arena.  Donors have begun to discuss the possibility of using <strong>negative sanctions </strong>, i.e. withholding aid, if the recipient country does not meet their expectations in this respect. Indeed, there has been growing acceptance of the use of negative sanctions within the donor community in recent years. Decisions made within the European Community's political coordination system to withhold development assistance because of unsatisfactory human rights or progress towards democracy are clear examples. <p>





The term <strong>sustainable development </strong> is best known in an environmental context, where it means protection of the environment and the rational use of natural resources. In development cooperation, however, sustainable development can also be viewed from an economic, social and governmental standpoint.  It includes the idea of ensuring adequate resources and well-being in the long term, also for future generations.  The impact of an individual project or programme must remain viable even after all outside aid has come to an end.  In practice, this means basing operations primarily on the recipient country's own resources and know-how. This may presuppose the creation or reinforcement of governmental or technical institutions ('capacity building').<p>





An interesting new feature in international development cooperation is the rapid growth in <strong>humanitarian assistance </strong>. Though the distinction between humanitarian assistance and development cooperation proper has never been exactly defined, the former is obviously on the increase. The reason could well be the growing perception among the citizens of developed countries, as a result of more efficient information, of humanitarian needs, wars, natural catastrophes or political change.  In any case, humanitarian assistance takes on a political dimension which is often more explicit and immediate than in other development cooperation.<p>








<a name=climate><li><h4>Changes in the climate in Finland</h4>





Finland cut its development cooperation appropriations in 1991, just when its long-awaited and consistently pursued quantitative goal of 0.7% of GDP, as recommended by the UN, had been reached,. Several other OECD countries have also had to reduce their funding.<p>





This change in a policy pursued persistently for some fifteen years compels us to reassess the policy foundations, goals and achievements of our development cooperation. The present strategy document has been prepared as part of this process.<p>





The recession has also altered the climate because the development cooperation administration has to adjust to the retrenchment and efficiency programmes currently under way in public management.  In this respect, too, the formulation of a strategy should provide us with some useful tools.<p>





Among the factors dealt with in the section on 'Changes in global politics and economics', assistance to CEE countries and the CIS and funding for global environment programmes, in particular, have indirectly caused changes in the climate within which development cooperation operates. With the present cutbacks in the public sector, it is practically inevitable that these programmes compete for appropriations with development cooperation, even though they could with equal justification be seen as only one expression of international responsibility and interdependence, and thus as approaches parallel to development cooperation. All Finland's foreign aid must be managed efficiently to allow decision-makers and citizens to distinguish clearly between the various forms it takes.<p>





Possible membership of the EC is another factor that will influence the climate for Finnish development cooperation in future.  It is, however, likely to have substantially less direct impact on our development cooperation than on our trade with the developing world or our political relations with developing countries. In principle, at least, Finland should not have any difficulty in accepting EC approaches. Political cooperation between the EC states (EPC) may well have indirect effects on development cooperation, but they cannot be precisely forecast.  The biggest impact of EC membership would be on how development cooperation is financed.  According to preliminary estimates, Finland's contribution to development cooperation financed out of the EC's regular budget would be around 1.5%, or FIM 250 million, a year.  In addition, an estimated FIM 350 million would have to be channelled through the European Development Fund (EDF).  This gives a total of some FIM 600 million a year, though this could well change considerably as the exact date of accession and other relevant information can be used in calculations. The effect of EC foreign policy coordination on Finland's overall relations with developing countries would gain considerably in importance as a result of accession.  This would be most obvious, perhaps, in human rights issues, together with the enhanced demand for coherence between development cooperation policies and other aspects of relations with developing countries, including trade policy.<p>


<hr size=3>





<a name=premise><h4>GENERAL PREMISES AND CONDITIONS FOR FINNISH DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION</h4>








<a name=why><li><h4>Why is Finland involved in development cooperation?</h4>





The enormous discrepancies in wealth and well-being between the developed and the developing countries are not acceptable by any human standard. They constitute a threat to the prosperity and security of all nations. Finland, together with other developed countries, is doing what it can to reduce and eliminate these discrepancies through its foreign and economic policies.<p>





Finland is working to combat global environmental problems, using development cooperation as one, but certainly not the only, means. Similarly, Finland supports the developing countries in their efforts to reduce population growth and control massive movements of population caused by over-exploitation of nature's regenerative capacity. <p>





Finland supports international cooperation in solving the problems faced by developing countries, thereby furthering global security and well-being.<p>





Development cooperation is one of the most important channels for interaction with developing countries. It offers an opportunity for growing international awareness and interaction between peoples and societies.<p>





In favourable conditions, development cooperation can also serve as a step towards broader commercial, cultural and other interaction between nations and peoples.<p>





The <strong>general objectives guiding Finnish development cooperation </strong> can be formulated as follows: Development cooperation is that part of foreign policy through which Finland strives, by transferring material and human resources to the developing countries,<br>


- to promote sustainable development and well-being in developing countries;<br>


- to contribute to the establishment of peace, equality, democratic conditions and human rights in these countries; and <br>


- to further interaction between Finland and the developing countries.<p>








<a name=what><li><h4>What kind of development does Finland support?</h4>





The states, international organizations and other bodies with which Finland is engaged in development cooperation must commit themselves to the following three objectives:<br>


- to reduce the widespread poverty in developing countries;<br>


- to combat global threats to the environment by helping the developing countries to solve their environmental problems; and <br>


- to promote social equality, democracy and human rights in the developing countries.<p>





If a cooperation partner fails to adhere to these objectives, Finland will use constructive dialogue in an attempt to influence the situation and, if this is not possible, will reconsider continuation of the cooperation relationship.<p>





In both multilateral and bilateral development cooperation, Finland applies the following principles:<p>








<i><strong>Responsibility of the developing countries for their own development</i></strong><p>





The main principle of Finland's development cooperation is that a developing country is responsible for its own development.  Thus the donor's role is always merely a supportive one.  Any other premise would not allow the achievement of sustainable development.<p>








<i><strong>The will to develop</i></strong><p>





One precondition for sustainable and economically viable development is that the developing country, its citizens and the organizations and institutions operating there all have the will to develop.  This is also, in each case, the precondition for Finnish assistance.<p>








<i><strong>Sustainable development</i></strong><p>





Emphasis on the responsibility of the recipient country also implies that development cooperation supports the creation of economically, environmentally, socially and administratively sustainable structures or functions.  Development cooperation must also aim to make itself superfluous, and the existence of structures or functions built up with its assistance must not be dependent on external support.<p>








<i><strong>Structural change</i></strong><p>





The global economy has been going through a process of structural change since around 1980 as a result of the oil and debt crises.  The economies of the developing countries will not survive these crises unless fundamental reforms are made in both poor and rich countries, e.g. in industrial policy and marketing mechanisms, and in the role played by the state in economic life.  These structural reforms are outlined in the adjustment programmes for individual countries, in the form of action by the countries' own political leadership and by international donors, especially the financing institutions.  The guideline is to achieve economic balance externally and internally and to promote export-driven growth.<p>





Finland supports action by the developing countries to reform and adjust their economic structures to the demands of sustainable development, using both bilateral and multilateral channels, assuming that structural adjustment and environmental concerns, equality and cultural considerations can be reconciled.<p>








<i><strong>Development cooperation and other relations with developing countries</i></strong><p>





Finland engages in development cooperation fully aware that this is only one component in its overall relations with the developing countries, though an important one both now and in the future. As interdependence grows, Finland will increase the coherence of its policies vis-…-vis the developing countries (e.g. policy on trade and competition, agriculture, labour, immigration and refugees, and culture) and reconcile these with the goals of development cooperation better than at present.<p>


<hr size=3>





<a name=goal><h4>THE SUBSTANTIVE GOALS OF FINNISH DEVELOPMENT 


COOPERATION</h4>








<a name=econo><li><h4>Promoting economic development and reducing poverty</h4>





The preconditions for economic development can be defined as investments in human beings and the use of market forces.  Finland is working towards the latter goal by supporting structural change in the economies of developing countries, together with economic reforms aimed at exploiting market forces and developing price mechanisms.<p>





In supporting activities designed to promote economic growth and structural change in the developing countries, Finland stresses measures related not only to growth but also to greater distribution of well-being, together with alleviation of the adverse effects that will inevitably accompany structural adjustment.<p>





In supporting private enterprise and the necessary infrastructure investments in the developing countries, Finland will avoid any distortion of competitive conditions and thereby the creation of unsustainable production. Support will be channelled especially to small-scale enterprises and to farming and forestry that is economically and environmentally sustainable. Impact on labour will be taken into account and labour-intensive solutions favoured.<p>





Finland aims to promote planning and decision-making systems based on popular participation, on the principle that every individual has the right to help make decisions that affect him/her.  In local economic decision-making, the necessary preconditions will be created by supporting the formation of associations or organizations of businesses, employees and farmers, or of cooperatives.<p>





Because most of the poor in developing countries live in rural areas, action to develop the countryside must play a central role in strategy to alleviate poverty.  In practice, this means projects giving the rural population access to natural resources (i.e. land and water) and to production technology, as well as access to markets for their products.<p>





When targeting both its bilateral and its multilateral assistance, Finland will continue to give priority to the poorer countries and disadvantaged population groups in developing countries .<p>








<a name=enviro><li><h4>Environment, population and development</h4>





In a poor developing country, sustainable development means finding the right balance between growth, environmental considerations and income distribution. This is a task for the developing country itself. Assistance will be targeted at activities promoting this end. Finland will channel its support to areas where this problem has been satisfactorily solved, or where Finland can help to solve it.  Hence, Finland will <p>


- stress consideration for environmental factors in all development cooperation projects, not merely to combat existing threats but also to create the preconditions for security and well-being based on multiple use of natural resources;<br>


- pursue the principle of equality between genders in all development cooperation projects and also strive to utilize fully female and male resources and redevelop them equally;<br>


- support population policy programmes;<br>


- support training and education;<br>


- when targeting resources, give particular stress to projects aimed at the sustainable development of basic services and farming and forestry in rural areas;<br>


- develop its know-how in implementing forestation projects according to the principles of sustainable development and thus promote the solution of global environmental problems.<br>








<a name=democ><li><h4>Democracy and human rights</h4>





Democracy is the only lasting basis for the rule of law. In the long term, it has also proved more effective than other options as a basis for economic and social development.  Each nation must find its own way to democracy and respect for human rights, building on its own history and political situation. Finland respects the principle in international law of non-interference in the internal affairs of another state, and will thus use the means available to development cooperation to consolidate democracy and human rights.  Hence, Finland <br>


- supports a pluralist and open social order in all countries, including broad political participation and the right to a distinctive national or minority culture;


- supports the values and practices characterizing society based on the rule of law, such as conformity to law, the rejection of corruption, and the political and legal accountability of decision-makers;<br>


- requires all its development cooperation partners to comply with international agreements on human rights and basic freedoms;<br>


- promotes projects that encourage consolidation of both the forms and the substance of democracy at all levels of social life; and <br>


- supports the principles of freedom of speech and independent media in recipient countries.<p>


<hr size=3>





<a name=opinion><h4>PUBLIC OPINION AND DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION</h4>





Effective, long-term international cooperation is impossible without broad public support.  In a democratic and pluralist society like Finland, it is obvious that a number of competing opinions prevail on development cooperation policy. It is the function of the authorities to ensure that public opinion on development cooperation is founded on as complete, many-sided and impartial information as possible.  It is precisely this requirement regarding the impartiality of information provided by the authorities that points up the effectiveness and efficiency of development cooperation as a factor of crucial importance in the process of shaping public opinion.<p>





As development cooperation is a relatively new function of public authorities and is exercised mainly abroad it tends to remain alien to public opinion.  That is why it is so important for the authorities to provide frank and free information, and for civil servants to contribute to public debate on development cooperation.<p>


<hr size=3>


<a name=action><h4>ACTION PLAN FOR FINNISH DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION IN THE 1990s </h4>








<a name=resource><li><h4>Development cooperation resources</h4>








<i><strong>Financial resources</i></strong><p>





In April 1992, the Finnish Government decided to temporarily reduce funds available for development cooperation to a level corresponding to 0.4% of GDP for the period 1993-1995. This is below the Nordic (0.98%), EC (0.43%) and EEA (0.46%) average for 1991.  The Government has also announced that it intends to restore the level of appropriations to 0.7% of GDP by the year 2000. This target was reiterated at the 1992 UNCED meeting and in other Government statements. <p>








<i><strong>Other resources </strong></i><p>





The administration of development cooperation will remain a part of the Ministry for Foreign Affairs even in the future. The aim is to delegate as much as possible of the practical administration of assistance to the recipient countries.  The Finnish missions in the countries and the organizations concerned will function as the focal points, giving the Ministry an opportunity to concentrate on planning and monitoring.  This kind of delegation presupposes more efficient steering of operations, which is also one aim of this strategy.<p>





The new situation poses new demands for the training of development cooperation officials and our understanding of conditions in recipient countries. Therefore new training programmes will be essential.<p>





Existing expertise in the civil service, particularly in the sectoral ministries, boards and other public institutions, must be used as effectively as possible in development cooperation. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs will be responsible for development cooperation as part of the foreign policy, for its financing and selection of targets, and for supervision and coordination of its implementation.<p>





The sectoral ministries and their various departments and institutions will be responsible for carrying out development cooperation projects subject to the resources in their respective fields and as agreed with the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.  This will form part of a general and constantly widening range of international relations in the specific area of administration.<p>





As well as using public management services, Finland will also continue to procure goods and services from the private sector in its development cooperation.  Modes and methods designed to produce the best possible results for all those involved must therefore be created and developed for collaboration between the development cooperation authorities and the private sector.<p>





Finland aims to develop personnel with a wide range of experience of developing countries and other international skills for the use of public service, business & industry, non-government organizations and international bodies.<p>








<a name=multi><li><h4>Multilateral development cooperation</h4>





Multilateral development cooperation includes <br>


- development cooperation through UN bodies and organizations;<br>


- development cooperation through international development financing institutions;<br>


- debate and decision-making on development cooperation in these bodies; and <br>


- debate within the OECD on development cooperation policy.<p>





If Finland joins the EC, Community development cooperation will become one channel for Finnish multilateral development cooperation.<p>





As one of the general objectives of development cooperation policy, multilateral assistance promotes Finland's foreign policy objectives within the UN and the international development financing institutions.<p>





Multilateral assistance provides an opportunity, through international organizations and financing institutions, for universal and politically unaligned action, calling upon broad expertise in a variety of sectors and areas.  In addition, an increasing number of problems, such as environmental degradation and AIDS, recognize no frontiers, so efforts from the entire international community are needed to solve them.  Development cooperation objectives and targets adopted internationally are also achieved through other forms of cooperation with developing countries, e.g. in trade and culture.  The normative work by international organizations lays a foundation for a coordinated approach to development issues.<p>





Finland's multilateral development cooperation consists on the one hand of participation in the work of the decision-making bodies of the UN and other international organizations and financing institutions, and on the other of provision of financial and other assistance to be implemented through these bodies. In the UN, development cooperation policy is discussed in the General Assembly and in its subsidiary bodies. Decisions are based on the one-country-one-vote principle.  In the case of development financing institutions, operational policy is made by the boards of directors and in periodic negotiations on capital replenishment, and also at annual shareholders' meetings. The decision-making system is based on voting power, which is determined by each country's contribution to the capital stock and on the principle of working in - and as - a constituency.<p>





The most important difference between multilateral and bilateral development cooperation activities is that the former is much more visible and comprehensive internationally, and this naturally heightens its foreign policy significance.  The nature of the UN system, and to some extent that of international development financing institutions, adds to this effect.  Further, policies on programmes and financing are influenced by the various organizations' decision-making bodies, and not directly through agreements with recipients, as is the case in bilateral activities. The significance of multilateral cooperation can be assessed not only in terms of foreign policy but also in terms of its effectiveness or appropriateness, compared with direct bilateral assistance.  It also provides feedback that can be utilized in the implementation of bilateral programmes.<p>





Finland supports the principles laid down in the United Nations Charter and UN ideals in both political and economic fields. Finland therefore expects the highest possible quality from UN bodies and organizations in the planning and implementation of development cooperation and related administrative functions.  The above also applies to other channels of multilateral assistance, as relevant.  In international development financing institutions, Finland considers it particularly important for sufficient weight to be attached to the views of recipient countries.<p>





Finland selects the channels for its multilateral assistance according to its own development objectives.  In deciding the organizations through which Finnish multilateral assistance will be channelled, the most important consideration, therefore, is how effectively each organization will achieve these objectives.  Decisions regarding channelling of multilateral assistance will be made in connection with the national budget, incorporating the provision that multi-year commitments can be made.<p>





The entire field of multilateral assistance, particularly the UN system, is undergoing rapid change and restructuring, prompted by the ending of the Cold War and its effects on the UN's role and operating potential in general.  In the reform of the UN system, Finland's objective is to restore to the UN its role as laid down in the Charter, that is, to make it one central forum of worldwide political dialogue.  Finland takes the view that achieving this goal would strengthen the UN system as an efficient channel of development cooperation.  The <strong>UN specialized agencies </strong> should concentrate on their own special fields of expertise, i.e. the normative functions originally intended for them, the administration of which has suffered over the years from expansion of the operational functions, i.e. actual development cooperation.  Finland supports a greater concentration of the administration of the <strong>UN's operational activities </strong> and also aims to assist international development financing institutions and UN bodies to reach better mutual understanding regarding the division of labour between them in the field of development cooperation.<p>





Because achieving the objectives of multilateral development cooperation depends essentially on coordination between donor countries, Finland underlines the importance of better coordination within the UN, the development financing institutions and the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD.<p>








<a name=bi><li><h4>Bilateral development cooperation</h4>








<i><strong>Regional and sectoral orientation</i></strong><p>





In its bilateral development cooperation, Finland considers choice of regions and countries of prime importance.  The choice of sectors takes place only after this.  In the case of the latter, decisions are laid down in strategies for the individual recipients, based on the particular development priorities of the countries concerned and Finland's ability to offer quality resources in the key sectors thus selected.  There must therefore be sufficient flexibility in the choice of sectors.<p>





Choice of countries also has a broad political dimension. In order that all relevant aspects could be taken adequately into account, decisions in principle concerning recipients must be made at the political level.<p>





The forms and priorities of cooperation will be based on the special features of each geographical area and each recipient country.  Development cooperation can be a useful way of strengthening cooperation among developing countries, provided that they themselves are committed to it.<p>





In the UN, its specialized agencies and development organizations and in the financing institutions Finland contributes to the international debate on development issues and to the preparation and approval of common norms, principles and action programmes.  These also provide a framework for bilateral development cooperation.<p>








<i><strong>Country priorities in bilateral cooperation </i></strong><p>





The present priorities in Finland's bilateral development cooperation are the result of choices made over nearly thirty years.  They reflect one distinct basic principle, that development cooperation should concentrate on the poorest countries (in terms of per capita GDP). Only few exceptions to this general rule have been made.  The poverty criterion continues to be the prime argument in selecting recipient countries.  Any other grounds would be hard to reconcile with the ethical ideology on which our development cooperation rests.  Our development cooperation relations so far, the experiences of it, and the importance of sustained effort should continue to be the primary criteria in the choice of recipients.  Another important precondition for the choice of recipients is a country's own expressed desire to develop, which should be in conformity with the main goals of this strategy.<p>





In addition to the poverty criterion Finland will take the following factors into account:<br>


- the compatibility of the recipient country's development policy with the goals and means of this strategy; and <br>


- how effectively Finland can administer assistance in the country concerned.<p>





The Government decides the countries with which Finland will engage in extensive, long-term development cooperation <strong>(primary cooperation countries).  Project-based assistance </strong> may also be provided to other developing countries.  The actual project is then the prime criterion for selection, though the choice of recipient may not essentially differ from the criteria for primary countries.<p>





Within authorizations granted by Parliament, the Government confirms annual commitment authority for future development cooperation in individual primary countries, and commitment authority for project-based assistance to other developing countries and regional programmes. The Government and Parliament can also make recommendations on these issues in their handling of the budget bill and the annual development cooperation report. Parliament plays an important role in development cooperation and can state its position on matters such as strategies for individual countries.<p>





Permanent, long-term cooperation with primary cooperation countries may also call for commitment and some level of involvement in promoting economic reforms and structural change in the individual countries.  This may take the form of involvement in the countries' international loan arrangements, programme assistance or involvement in other ways in the promotion of such international schemes.  This also requires wide knowledge and understanding of the recipient country's economy and social issues.  In the interests of consistency, the various donor countries must be ready to coordinate their development assistance contributions to a given country.<p>





<i><strong>Issues related to the substance of bilateral cooperation</i></strong><p>


Further to the general principles of Finnish development cooperation dealt with above, in the section 'What kind of development does Finland support?', the following deals with various specific questions likely to be crucial for development cooperation in the '90s (either because of their general importance or because they involve new considerations), on which Finland should therefore take a clear stance in principle. <p>





<strong>Programme assistance </strong> (see above under 'Changing perceptions of development cooperation') has become an increasingly important element in development cooperation in the '80s, side by side with conventional project-based aid. The term is used to mean balance of payments or budgetary support, or support to a specific sector which is not tied to any particular projects, but the preconditions for which are normally changes in the recipient country's general economic and sectoral policies.  If an economic reform programme has been, or is being, drawn up for any of Finland's recipient countries, Finland endeavours to participate in its preparation and implementation, according to the basic principles laid down in this strategy document. Finland's own programme assistance will be coordinated with the recipient country and the international donor community.<p>





Broad support for the <strong>public </strong> sector of developing countries is an important object of development cooperation, both to bring about the rule of law and efficiency, and to prompt economic and social change.  Because programme assistance is designed to promote the recipient country's administrative, economic and ultimately financial independence, it should be supplemented with action to further the country's ability to formulate, plan and implement economic policy on its own.<p>





Keeping in mind what has been said above (in the section 'Promoting economic development and reducing poverty'), Finland considers it important to improve the general conditions (legislation, training) in developing countries, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.<p>





The developing countries' ability to utilize the <strong>technological advances </strong> being made around them is a fundamental condition for their future development.  Finland will encourage the building-up of technological knowledge and capacity to this end in the countries it assists.<p>





Finland considers that one important social, political and economic goal of development cooperation is to raise <strong>the status of women </strong> and to increase their opportunities to participate and influence decisions.  This is important for the advancement of democracy and human rights, population and family planning, and economic and social development in general.<p>





Culture is considered a vital development resource. Finland will support <strong>cultural projects </strong> in developing countries that play an important role in creating or preserving the country's national identity and cherishing its cultural heritage.<p>





Objective and independent <strong>research </strong> will be developed in accordance with the priorities of the strategy and as development cooperation needs require.  In research, too, the aim is to establish effective contacts between Finnish research institutions and those in developing countries themselves.<p>





<strong>Environmental considerations </strong> will be taken into account in the appraisal of projects financed by Finland.  Attention will further be paid to the contribution made by projects to the development of rural areas, the satisfaction of basic needs, and consolidation of the infrastructure in recipient countries.<p>








<i><strong>Non-government and missionary organizations</i></strong><p>





Finnish non-government and missionary organizations are development cooperation channels that can be used to achieve goals that may be difficult to reach by official means.  The most important of these are:<br>


- implementation of such projects in developing countries that would be difficult to implement or influence through official channels;<br>


- the extension of contacts between Finland and developing countries to countries where there is no official development cooperation; and <br>


- giving personal experience of development cooperation to large numbers of ordinary people.<p>





Finland therefore implements some of its development cooperation activities through non-government organizations as long as the projects conform to the current rules and do not conflict with the general goals of the strategy.  Special attention is then given to:<br>


- choice of project and mode of execution;<br>


- ensuring that the aim is to assist a target in a developing country and not to consolidate the Finnish organization; and <br>


- the organization's ability to achieve its stated goals.<p>





Assistance to <strong>international non-government organizations </strong> operating in several countries or worldwide follows the same principles as in the case of Finnish organizations, except that <br>


- funding must be more selective and advance screening of the organization more thorough, because these projects are on the whole more difficult to monitor, even retroactively, than those of a Finnish organization; and <br>


- the cost-sharing principle must be exercised more flexibly and more to suit the particular situation than with Finnish organizations.<p>





The same principles also apply to <strong>non-government organizations operating in developing countries </strong>.<p>








<i><strong>Economic and industrial cooperation</i></strong><p>





One specific form of project cooperation funded is the kind of economic activity or planning that will have the effect on development aimed at in this strategy, and that will promote trade or other economic cooperation between Finland and developing countries.  Such forms of funding include interest subsidy on commercial loans, the Fund for Industrial Cooperation (FINNFUND), the promotion of imports from developing countries and funding for economic, industrial and technological cooperation.  The principles of this strategy also apply, as relevant, to this form of financing.<p>


<hr size=3>





<a name=humani><h3>HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE</h3>





Humanitarian assistance is a fast-growing part of the overall field of development cooperation (see above in the section 'Changing perceptions of development cooperation') though it is hard to make distinctions between this and development cooperation proper.  The main way in which humanitarian assistance differs from development cooperation is that the main reason for assistance is human distress.  It should, however, be pointed out that an emerging need for humanitarian assistance can be mitigated or reduced by means of development cooperation.  Reducing economic and social inequalities also reduces the possibility of violent conflict; alleviating poverty and reducing population growth decrease the likelihood of environmental catastrophes causing displacement of populations and refugees; etc.  It is also often necessary to utilize development cooperation means at different stages of humanitarian assistance.<p>





A decision to provide humanitarian assistance is made in the manner called for by its foreign policy context.<p>





UN bodies are used as the main channel for humanitarian assistance, together with the various non-government organizations specializing in humanitarian assistance that coordinate their activities with them. Finland considers it urgent and important to reform and rationalize the administrative mechanisms responsible for the UN's humanitarian assistance. Finland will also make its own efforts to improve the coordination between countries providing humanitarian assistance.<p>





Humanitarian assistance to refugees will as far as possible also be provided to prevent the refugees from having to move any further away from their home regions than is absolutely necessary.<p>





Finnish products will be used for humanitarian assistance whenever they are internationally competitive in price, quality and terms of delivery.<p>





Increasing attention has to be paid to the kind of development cooperation that will prevent situations calling for humanitarian assistance from arising and to improving the disaster preparedness of developing countries.<p>


<hr size=3>





<a name=supplies><h3>DEVELOPMENT COOPERATION SUPPLIES FROM FINLAND</h3>





Purchasing the goods and services needed for development cooperation from Finland both increases contacts between Finland and developing countries and reduces the inevitable negative effects of development cooperation on our balance of payments.  Supplies must come from Finland as far as possible, assuming that <br>


- the interests involved do not decisively influence the choice of and preparations for projects and programmes;<br>


- the price, quality, other characteristics and terms of delivery of the commodities concerned are what the recipient country needs;<br>


- development cooperation funds are only used to buy the kind of commodities that would be competitive internationally in any case.<p>


<hr size=3>





<a name=audit><h3>APPRAISAL AND EVALUATION OF DEVELOPMENT 


COOPERATION</h3>





As stated earlier (in the section 'Popular opinion and development cooperation'), the efficiency and effectiveness of development cooperation are crucial in shaping public opinion in donor countries.  This in turn largely decides the kind of political backing that development cooperation can expect from Finnish society.<p>





The development cooperation administration must therefore improve both its internal auditing and its evaluation mechanisms.  These goals are parallel to some extent, though evaluation concentrates more on long-term results and is more outwardly oriented.<p>





Internal auditing must provide the development cooperation administration with continuous information about the legality, appropriateness and efficiency of the activities, and highlight any changes needed.<p>





Evaluations must<br>


- be carried out by impartial parties;<br>


- be conducted as openly as possible and their findings made public;<br>


- produce results which can be used in planning, administering and deciding about development cooperation; and <br>


- be applicable to all forms and channels of assistance.<p>

<title>Newsflash 1995 - British Government accused of 'playing race card'</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>
<h2>British Government accused of playing 'race card'</h2><p>

Legislation to be introduced in Britain in the next year has outraged asylum-seeker and refugee support groups.<p>

It has been a longstanding aim of the governing Conservative Party to seek to tighten up controls on illegal immigrants and applications for asylum.<p>

While Prime Minister John Major claims that tighter rules will help streamline the processing of asylum-seekers, opposition parties claim that the Government - which is trailing in the opinion polls - is playing on racist fears in a bid for re-election.<p>

Most controversial is a proposal to establish a 'white list' of countries which are considered safe.  Claims of political asylum from people from these countries would be assumed to be unfounded.  Social security benefits for these applicants would also be stopped, leaving them with no means of support - they are prohibited from seeking work in the UK.<p>

Refugee support groups were outraged when leaked documents showed that countries on this 'white list' might include Turkey and Nigeria - both reknowned for human rights abuses.<p>

Nigeria has become an international pariah after <b><a href="news_top_africa.html#nigeria">executing</a></b>  nine pro-democracy activists on 10 November.  <b><a href="../amnesty/ai_press.html#east">Turkey</a></b> has been repeatedly criticised by Amnesty International for imprisoning journalists who criticise the war against Kurdish rebels.<p>

Human rights campaigners were shocked last week as Government figures showed that all but one of the 2,032 applications for asylum from Nigerians had been refused.  These included people who had been tortured for taking part in demonstrations against General Abacha's military government.<p>

"This is a country in which human rights abuses are going on on a massive scale and yet when they seek asylum in the UK more than 99 per cent are refused.  It is simply not credible that less than 1% of these people are genuine refugees," Nick Hardwick of the Refugee Council told British newspaper 'The Guardian'.<p>

Also controversial in the new legislation are measures to penalise companies that employ illegal immigrants.  Campaigners fear that this might lead to job applicants being refused or harassed because of their skin colour.<p>

Challenged in the House of Commons over the measures, Prime Minister John Major said: "I believe passionately in the equal rights of anyone in this country, whether they be black, brown, yellow or white.<p>

However, demonstrators splashed Conservative Party Chairman Brian Mawhinney with orange paint outside Parliament yesterday, to show their disapproval of the proposals.<p>

The Conservatives were further embarrassed at remarks made by a Party press officer, who acknowledged that fanning fears over immigration and race had been an electoral asset to the Government and had "played particularly well in the tabloids" in 1992.<p>

Development Co-operation Review of Sweden<br>Summary and Conclusions<p>

<i>OECD Development Assistance Committee</i><p></h3>

<h5>June 1996<br>

For a copy of the full report, please contact OECD Publications, 2 rue Andr&#233; Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France

<br>

Home Page: <a href="http://www.oecd.org/dac/index.htm" target="_top">http://www.oecd.org/dac/index.htm</a></h5>

</center><p>

<hr>

The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.

<p>

The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report of the team is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.

<p>

Sweden's development cooperation programme is at a critical juncture.

New Swedish policies both contribute to and reflect evolving international

approaches to development. But at the same time, the organisational

structure is being overhauled and the historically high levels

of aid attained in 1992-93 are being sharply cut.

<P>

In its review of Sweden's programme on 5 June 1996, the Development

Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD concluded that changes

in the Swedish aid programme will influence the international

development community, where Sweden has been a leader and pacesetter.

Mr. James Michel, Chair of the DAC, summarised the findings of

the review based on these main points of policy, organisation

and aid volume.

<P>

Sweden's development cooperation programme aims to improve the

standard of living of the poorest people. Its established goals

include: growth of resources; economic and social equality; economic

and political autonomy; democratic development and society; and

a far-sighted utilisation of natural resources and concern for

the environment. The Parliament has recently approved the addition

of a sixth goal: equality between women and men.

<P>

In response to the recommendations of a Task Force on Poverty

Reduction, the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency

(Sida) has prepared a poverty profile for each of its 21 main

co-operation countries and is working with its development partners

in those countries to prepare participatory country strategies.

The DAC welcomed this approach. It also commended Sweden's many

analytical contributions on aid policy issues more generally.

<P>

The Committee also welcomed Sweden's efforts in promoting the

reform of multilateral development institutions, both in the United

Nations and the multilateral development banks. Those efforts

include the identification of new and more reliable methods of

financing the multilateral development cooperation system. 

<P>

A new element in Sweden's multilateral programme is its contributions,

as a Member of the European Union since 1 January 1995, to the

development cooperation programme of the European Communities

(EC). Sweden is bringing to bear on the EC programme its long

experience in participatory development and cross-cutting social

areas, and is working to ensure greater coherence in EC policies

impacting on developing countries.

<P>

A sweeping reorganisation of Sweden's development co-operation

system has taken place. Five autonomous entities previously responsible

for development activities have been merged into a single Sida.

A reorganisation of the Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs,

also underway, will integrate country aid strategies and programming

into overall political and commercial relationships. These changes

hold the promise with strong effort and over time, of greater

coherence and effectiveness in the Swedish aid effort.

<P>

Sweden has traditionally been among the leaders in the DAC in

the volume of its official development assistance (ODA). In 1995,

however, ODA volume, at $2 billion, was down 3.3 per cent in real

terms from the previous year. The ODA/GNP ratio fell from 0.96

to 0.89 per cent. As a part of its effort to reduce its public

sector budget deficit, Sweden has temporarily abandoned its target

of 1 per cent of GNP for official development assistance and will

reduce the level of budgeted ODA to 0.7 per cent of GNP in 1997,

an estimated reduction of 11 per cent from the 1996 budget. The

level of ODA as a percentage of GNP is expected to remain constant

at 0.7 per cent through 1999. The Committee expressed its concern

at this reduction and its apprehension regarding future trends.

Sweden has stated its intention to regain the 1 per cent target

when economic circumstances permit. The Committee noted that rebuilding

aid levels is never an easy task and raising ODA as a per cent

of a growing GNP will require significant increases in the aid

budget.

<P>

The Summary and Conclusions as agreed by the Committee and the

Report prepared by the OECD Secretariat will be published in the

Development Co-operation Review Series of the DAC.

<P>

The Delegation of Sweden at the Peer Review Meeting was headed

by Mr. Jan Cedergren, Assistant UnderSecretary, Ministry for Foreign

Affairs. The examining Members were Japan and the Netherlands.

Mr. Michel chaired the review.

Development Co-operation Review of Austria<br>Summary and Conclusions<P>

<i>OECD Development Assistance Committee</i><p></h3>

<h5>March 1996<br>

For a copy of the full report, please contact OECD Publications, 2 rue Andr&#233; Pascal, 75775 Paris Cedex 16, France

</center><p>

<hr>

Since the last review of the Austrian aid programme by the Development

Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD in 1993, the Austrian aid

administration has introduced several changes intended to make

the programme more coherent and efficient. These changes included

a reduction in the number of priority countries, the beginning

of sector and country programming, the nomination of local/regional

aid coordinators and new rules for relations with nongovernmental

organisations (NGOs) which implement the bulk of bilateral technical

assistance. Another important change involves Austria's membership

in the European Union (EU). This membership affects the volume,

composition, coordination and other aspects of the overall Austrian

programme.

<P>

The impact of the changes introduced by the Department of Development

Cooperation (DDC) in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is, however,

greatly limited by the small share of official development assistance

(ODA)  less than 15 per cent  for which the DDC is responsible.

Responsibility for Austrian ODA is distributed over a number of

ministries and there is a need for more and improved interministerial

coordination. Austria does not have a clear overall strategy to

guide its development cooperation. The ThreeYear Programme of

Austrian development cooperation (which is updated annually) in

effect binds only the small part of ODA administered by the DDC.

Consequently, any positive initiative taken by the DDC can be

offset by actions in other parts of the aid programme and such

instances have occurred.

<P>

The ThreeYear Programme is not discussed in Parliament and the

report on development cooperation, which has to be submitted to

Parliament every three years, appears to receive little attention.

Development assistance has apparently sunk only limited roots

in Austrian politics and public opinion. Development NGOs, which

try to drum up support, do not have a sufficiently broad base.

By contrast, there appears to be relatively strong support in

public opinion and political circles for humanitarian assistance

and for assisting the transformation of Central and Eastern Europe.

<P>

The aggregate volume and financial terms of Austrian aid have

improved in recent years, but its composition and targeting have

continued to raise serious questions. The increase of Austrian

ODA claims in recent years exceeded by far the DAC average, with

the result that in 1994 Austrian ODA in relation to gross national

product (GNP) (0.33 per cent) exceeded the DAC average  a change

facilitated by a decline of the DAC average to 0.30 per cent.

On the other hand, Austria's ODA/GNP ratio is still well below

the average for EU members.

<P>

In relation to GNP, Austria has been the leading donor to the

Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) and the New Independent

States of the former Soviet Union (NIS). Until 1993 it was also

one of the largest donors in absolute amounts. Austria's total

aid effort for developing and Eastern European countries is far

above the average of OECD/DAC countries.

<P>

Since 1992 Austrian ODA commitments have been in compliance with

the DAC recommendation on terms, but the share of tied aid has

remained high.

<P>

The Austrian programme has continued to be characterised by a

high share of components for which development considerations

are not the prime motivation. These claims are for aid for refugees

in Austria, imputed costs for developing country students in Austria

and official concessional export credits. The combined share of

these components  which had declined in 1992 and 1993  exceeded

half of ODA disbursements in 1994. There is no doubt that Austria

has for many years assumed a heavy burden with regard to refugees

and is one of the most generous OECD countries in this respect.

At the same time the ODA share claimed for refugee costs in Austria

is four times the DAC average, and the reporting of this expenditure

is probably not entirely in conformity with DAC rules. The reporting

of imputed costs for developing countries students in Austria

also requires review. As to concessional export credits, development

considerations are not the main motive for their extension. A

much stronger involvement of the DDC in the selection and screening

of these credits and their integration into sector and country

programming could strengthen the development linkage.

<P>

Austrian payments to the European Community aid programmes resulted

in an increase in the total volume of aid in 1995. However, this

increase in multilateral aid was at the expense of a small reduction

in DDC

<P>

administered assistance. It appears possible that Austria's EU

membership and its related reordering of the country's ODA could

provide a welcome opportunity to review the composition and reporting

of Austrian ODA and to pursue more vigorously improvements in

various areas, including country programming, policy dialogue,

aid coordination and evaluation.

<P>

With a view to increasing effectiveness and coherence, and in

line with recommendations at earlier DAC reviews, the aid administration

has reduced the number of priority countries for Austrian aid

from nineteen to eight. Most of the remaining former priority

countries have been designated &quot;cooperation countries&quot;.

Both groups of recipient countries are now located in five subregions.

However, since DDC administers only a small share of ODA none

of the priority countries are among the major recipients of Austrian

aid. Concessional export credits and refugee support claims have

a far greater impact on the geographic distribution. Former Yugoslavia

(i.e. Bosnia) has, therefore, been the largest recipient, followed

by Algeria, China and Thailand. Poland has been by far the largest

recipient among CEECs due to debt relief.

<P>

Realising that with the limited volume of its aid, Austria can

only be a &quot;niche donor&quot;, DDC now clearly intends to

concentrate its aid not only geographically but also on sectors

where Austria possesses a comparative advantage. Until now the

sectoral distribution has remained widely dispersed. Education,

transport, energy and manufacturing have been the sectors obtaining

the largest commitments. Debt relief made up a large share in

1993/94 and is likely to remain important in the coming years.

<P>

Nongovernmental organisations occupy a special and important position

in the Austrian aid programme since they initiate and implement

a large share of bilateral technical assistance. This situation

is the result of there being no official agency for the implementation

of Austria's bilateral aid. Since many NGOs raise little or no

funds of their own they rely mainly or exclusively on official

funds and in some respects resemble subsidiary organs of the public

administration in spite of their different legal status. While

in the past NGOs could carry out their activities in many countries

and sectors, they are now under increasing pressure from DDC to

orient their activities towards priority countries and sectors.

As implementing agencies for official aid, the DDC wants the NGOs

to be guided by its sector and country programming. The number

of NGOinitiated projects is declining in favour of projects proposed

by the administration. These changes have created tension since

the NGOs want to be treated as equal partners rather than as implementing

agencies. NGOs also complain about stricter control by the DDC

over their activities and late commitment and payment of funds.

Budget reductions, late payments and a strict application of Austrian

budget rules indeed created serious problems for NGOs in 1995,

and this is likely to be repeated in 1996. While certain changes

and reforms are necessary in the relationship between the administration

and NGOs, there is also a need to maintain a fruitful dialogue

and mutual trust.

<P>

Austria attaches great importance to the protection of the environment

and its declared policy is that all its development cooperation

projects should be environmentally sustainable. Thus the administration

has sponsored assessment of the environmental impact of DDC projects.

Austria initiated a threeyear programme (1993/9S) for the protection

and conservation of rain forests, and its agricultural, tourism

and other projects have a strong environmental component. Almost

all agricultural projects are directed to environmentally friendly

bigagriculture.

<P>

Gender issues are officially considered a priority issue, but

practical measures in this area are still limited. Projects are

not systematically assessed from a gender point of view, and there

are few genderspecific projects. Austria supports relatively few

projects in the fields of human rights and democracy  most are

related to electoral assistance, legal training, resettlement

and reintegration of refugees. The Austrian Government has stated

its belief that starvation and extreme poverty are the most serious

violation of human rights.

<P>

Regarding poverty alleviation, no guidelines have been drawn up

to date and no assessment of poverty reduction programmes has

been made. Relevant activities in the programme involve land and

agricultural reforms to promote equitable distribution of resources

and means of production and integrated rural development schemes.

<P>

The effectiveness and efficiency of Austrian aid is impaired by

the lack of a strategy covering the whole aid programme, the distribution

of responsibility over many ministries, the large number of implementing

agencies and the dispersion of aid over many countries and sectors.

The repeated transfer of DDC between the Federal Chancellery (Prime

Minister's Office) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and its

small staff have also been handicaps. Certain measures taken in

recent years  which are mentioned in the first paragraph  should,

however, lead to improvement. The move towards sector and country

programmes instead of the many isolated projects is particularly

welcome. A first country programme was finalised in 1993. These

programmes, discussed and agreed upon with the partner country,

state the objectives and planned cooperation over a threeyear

period. Being aware of its limited resources and its role as a

&quot;niche donor&quot; Austria intends to concentrate its aid

on small and mediumsized recipient countries and on two or three

sectors per country where it possesses a comparative advantage.

The rising number of local aid coordinators should facilitate

and accelerate this process, and permit Austria's participation

in local aid coordination. The DDC has also carried out a certain

number of midterm evaluations  but no <I>ex post</I> evaluations

 and the Division responsible has submitted proposals to improve

the feedback of &quot;lessons learned&quot;.

<P>

This review suggests that further improvements and a more coherent

development cooperation programme for Austria would be facilitated

by the following measures:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>The articulation of a basic policy by the Federal Government

which would be binding for all components of the aid programme.</li>

<P>

<li>A concentration of most aid activities under a single administration

and a single minister. In particular, the aid administration should

have the appropriate responsibility for those concessional export

credits which are reported as ODA loans to ensure their conformity

with aid policy orientations as well as their integration with

technical assistance.</li>

<P>

<li>Additional staff for the aid administration.</li>

<P>

<li>Clear rules for the selection of implementing agencies and competition

among them for contracts.</li>

<P>

<li>A reform and activation of the Advisory Board for Development

Cooperation and of interministerial coordination.</li>

<P>

<li>The submission of an annual report on development cooperation

to the Austrian Parliament, followed by an appropriate debate.</li></ul>

<h1> From this month's editor</h1>

<BR>
<BR>
There is a fresh spirit of international solidarity abroad, and it's rising
from the grassroots.<BR>
The street-paper movement, one of the brightest new publishing ventures
in recent years, has had an international perspective from its inception,
trading ideas and inspiration across national boundaries and oceans with
astonishing ease. Even small activist organizations are bridging the gap
between continents: two groups mentioned in this magazine - The People's
Dialogue on Land and Shelter in South Africa and SPARC in Bombay -
have worked closely together at a local level for several years. Their international
exchanges have not been of abstract resolutions in cosy conference centres,
but of immediate practical value. We can only hope that the UN 'City Summit'
which takes place in Istanbul in June will be half as useful. <BR>
<BR>


The slum dwellers of Cape Town and Bombay have little difficulty in making
the best use of each other's hard-won experience. This kind of response
to the much-vaunted globalization of the world's power structures has been
a long time in coming. It is ironic - though instructive - that
those who are usually thought of as the clearest losers, the third of the
world's people without decent homes, are now leading the way. <BR>
<BR>
So it is only fitting that the <b>NI</b> and <b><i>The Big Issue</i></b>, Europe's leading street
paper, have formed an alliance to produce this magazine on homelessness
around the world (you can find out more about the international street-paper
movement from &quot;<a href="exclusive.html">World Exclusive</a>&quot;).<BR clear=all><p>




A great many writers, photographers and activists have contributed to this
magazine for little or no material reward, but we owe an exceptional debt
of gratitude to Diana Mitlin and David Satterthwaite at the International
Institute for Environment and Development (IIED), for giving us access to
their fund of  knowledge and for their patient help and advice.<BR>
<BR>
Co-operation can, in theory, produce more than the sum of its parts -
what big business likes to call 'synergy'. What big business aims for, however,
is a synergy of greed; what we're after here is a synergy of solidarity.<BR>
<BR>
There is an urgent need for this. It is clear to us that, contrary to what
the dominant channels of communication usually suggest, there is a sickness
of human destitution spreading through the world. The only known antidote
is the determination of its intended victims, in alliance with everyone
of good will, to resist and work for something better. <BR>
<BR>
We would like to think that the alliance between the <b>NI</b> and <b><i>The Big Issue</i></b>
marks the beginning of a grand international alliance against homelessness
and the conditions that produce it. This may sound more like a grand dream
than a grand alliance, but greater things have come from weaker vessels.
The power of an international voice that fights for the interests of homeless
people could be a power to be reckoned with.<BR>

<br>


Homeless people are making their presence felt on city streets in a new
and challenging way. Tessa Swithinbank tells the unique success story of
The Big Issue in Britain and of 'street papers' around the world.<BR>
<BR>
Pat is adamant. 'If it hadn't been for The Big Issue my only other choice
when I first became homeless would have been to beg or become a prostitute.
It has changed my life radically,' she adds, 'given me back my confidence'.<p>

Outside shops, theatres, cinemas and malls, in hundreds of towns and cities
throughout Europe and North America, and in South Africa, marginalized people
are selling street papers. They are earning a living without having to beg.<p><br clear=all>

<br>

Pat, aged 40, sells the weekly Big Issue in a craft market in Merton, a
suburb of London. Her story is typical of many who become homeless in the
First World. The causes are myriad: losing your job; losing your home through
not being able to pay rent or the mortgage; divorce, with one partner not
being able to afford alternative accommodation; abuse at home.<p>



Pat's two teenage daughters and son were sexually and physically abused
by her partner. One day she decided to leave home and, with only a carrier
bag in her hand, told him she was going out shopping. She ended up living
on the streets and in 'bed-and-breakfasts' with her children.<BR>
Determined to move off the streets, Pat sold The Big Issue for 12 hours
a day and earned enough money to buy food and clothes, even saving a little.
'I met my present partner through The Big Issue,' she says. 'He was a vendor
on the Strand. We met at The Big Issue office and have now built our home
together.'<p><br clear=all>

<br>

So how does the paper work? The principle is simple. A person is allocated
a selling pitch and given a badge. Then they buy copies of the paper for
30p (50 cents) - getting the first ten copies on credit if necessary
- and sell each one to the public for 70p, keeping 40p for themselves.<p>



Profits from the business go to its social-support system for people who
have often been excluded from society for many years. Drug and alcohol counselling
is available, while staff in the housing unit obtain either short-term or
long-term accommodation for homeless people, most of whom are single men
in their 20s and 30s. 'Micro-enterprises', such as candle-making and a unit
training people in desk-top publishing and computer skills, put them in
a better position to get back into the job market.<p>

<br clear=all>

<br>

The training and support are absolutely crucial, believes Pat. 'A roof over
your head is not enough. Homelessness is not just a situation, it is a state
of mind. To rejoin society a homeless person needs help.'<p>

Nobody likes to see people wrapped in blankets and huddling in doorways.
But there is a general feeling of powerlessness. What The Big Issue has
done since its launch in September 1991 challenges society's perception
of homelessness. A quarter of a million people talk to the vendors every
week about why they are on the streets. 'I always buy my Big Issue from
Andy outside Waterloo Station,' says one commuter who travels to London
from Surrey every day. 'Now I know more about his life I don't feel so critical.
I really admire his determination to get back on his feet.'<p><br clear=all>

<br>

Why does the paper have so much public support? Well, it's a good read.
'Exclusives' with celebrities, musicians and artists combine with news and
features on issues not tackled elsewhere. The 'Street Lights' section is
for homeless people and their writing - the paper also campaigns for
their rights. It's a way, too, for individuals to feel they are making a
difference - the public responds well to a positive example. Together
with its sister papers in Scotland and Ireland, it now has combined sales
of nearly one million a month. Its high profile means that it is talked
about on the radio, on television, in the papers and even scripted into
soap operas.<p><br clear=all>

<br>

The street-paper phenomenon has mushroomed worldwide. You can now buy almost
60 different titles in 12 European countries. Travelling around Germany,
for example, you will find at least 25 street papers with such colourful
names as Hinz &amp; Kunzt (Hamburg), Asphalt (Hannover), Bodo (Dortmund),
Motz &amp; Co (Berlin), Biss (Munich) and Kippe (Leipzig).<p>

The papers work with a variety of marginalized groups - unemployed,
drug addicts or refugees, as well as homeless people. They sell anywhere
between 3,000 and 120,000 copies a month. There is a wide diversity of approach
to both editorial content and the support of vendors. Some papers only provide
an income, but the majority make a much broader response to the needs of
their vendors.<p>

In Eastern Europe homelessness has increased steadily since the demise of
communism, with higher rents, property scams and unemployment. Welfare systems
and safety nets have disappeared. In St Petersburg, Russia, the problem
is at its most acute. Over 50,000 bomzhi (people with no fixed address),
including thousands of children, are sleeping under bridges, in stairwells
and on the streets. <p><br clear=all>

<br>

At the Nochlyezhka project 24 dedicated staff work with 13,000 homeless
people every year who come through the doors needing food and medical care.
Director Valeriy Sokolov was inspired by a copy of The Big Issue brought
to the shelter in 1992 and raised money to launch Eastern Europe's first
street paper in September 1994. Aptly named The Depths after Maxim Gorky's
low-life novel, the paper is the only way that homeless people can earn
a legal wage. Without a resident's stamp, which gives every Russian citizen's
official address, they have no civil rights or access to health and education,
leaving them totally outside the system.<p>

The Depths covers issues from human-rights abuse to off-beat culture. Increasingly
popular, the monthly print-run of 12,000 is often sold out within days of
publication. Sokolov believes the paper is changing society's attitude to
homeless people in a country where, under communism, it was a criminal offence
to be homeless. 'The state must see a ragged, flea-ridden, foul-smelling
person not as an anti-social element but as its own citizen, whose rights
and liberty are incontrovertible,' he says.<p><br clear=all>

<br>

New York is the home of the world's first street paper, Street News, which
was the inspiration for The Big Issue. Street papers are now sold in North
American cities from coast to coast. Paul Cohen is editor of Street Scene
in Los Angeles, the only street paper for youth in the US. 'We work with
runaway youth who are still coming to Los Angeles searching for the Hollywood
Dream,' he explains. He knows their lives can easily become sordid and difficult.
Involving them in writing Street Scene is good both for them and for the
readers. 'The paper allows them the opportunity to be creative,' says Cohen;
most American and Canadian papers focus heavily on the involvement of homeless
writers.<p><br clear=all>

<br>

The first street paper in the South has been launched in South Africa. Homeless
Talk  started two years ago as an initiative of the Central Johannesburg
Partnership and other church groups. Each edition is compiled by a weekly
writing group attended by about 30 homeless people. Vendors buy the paper
for 20 cents and sell it for one rand.<p>

The Big Issue's Maria Clancy visited Homeless Talk  last year to share ideas
and experiences with the staff and vendors. In a country where housing is
high on the political agenda she believes Homeless Talk  is a dynamic and
creative force: 'One female vendor told me: &quot;My shack was washed away
in the recent rains. My three children and I now live with our neighbours.&quot;
Homeless Talk  has been her lifeline. &quot;The paper has given me the means
to buy what I need to rebuild my life,&quot; she told me.'<p>

Many of the vendors are drawn from the hundreds of homeless residents of
the Park bus and rail station in Johannesburg. 'I was talking to Michael,
who used to live in Park Station,' says Maria. 'He was elated because he
is now able to rent a flat through his earnings from Homeless Talk. He was
very positive about his future.' Plans are now underway for street papers
to be set up in Durban and Cape Town.<p><br clear=all>

<br>

This month Australia's first paper hits the streets of Melbourne. In Eastern
Europe more will follow, notably in Budapest and Warsaw. There are sure
to be further launches elsewhere.<BR>
Street papers won't solve the problem of homelessness on their own. Getting
homeless people out of the street, and getting the street out of homeless
people, needs an alliance of homeless people with the public, government
and the voluntary sector. <p>

But street papers are giving marginalized people the chance to bring about
change through their own action. Pat is in no doubt about what The Big Issue
has done for her: 'You are not a prisoner of the system any more, not caught
in the poverty trap. You can hold your head high and know that you are doing
it yourself.'	<br><br><br><br>

Les incertitudes autour de Lom&#233; IV

</H2>

<P>

<H4>

Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>ECDPM Points cl&#233;s 1995</i>: page 4

</H4>

</CENTER>

<HR>





Dans le cadre de la Convention de Lom&#233;, l'Union europ&#233;enne accorde l'acc&#232;s

pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel au march&#233; le plus large du monde. En termes d'ampleur aussi, il s'agit d'un

des programmes majeurs d'aide . Mais ses jours semblent compt&#233;s.

<P>

Le glas a sonn&#233; pour la Convention bien avant les d&#233;buts de la r&#233;vision &#224; mi-

parcours de Lom&#233; IV. Les chicaneries, les modifications apport&#233;es et la d&#233;cision des

Etats membres de l'UE de ne pas augmenter leur financement en termes r&#233;els, soulignent le fait que

des innovations consid&#233;rables doivent &ecirc;tre faites si l'on veut arriver &#224; une Convention

de Lom&#233; V.

<P>

Peu de concessions ont &#233;t&#233; accord&#233;es aux pays ACP durant l'&#233;valuation de la

Convention &#226;g&#233;e de 20 ans, un contrat global d'aide et d'&#233;change entre l'Europe et 70

pays de l'Afrique sub-saharienne, des Cara&iuml;bes et du Pacifique. Bien que l'Europe ait consenti

quelques compromis apr&#232;s la conclusion de l'accord de financement, de nombreux pays ACP ont

exprim&#233; leur d&#233;ception quant au r&#233;sultat de la r&#233;vision.

<P>

<H3>Pays ACP:  d&#233;sappoint&#233;s et soulag&#233;s</H3>

<P>

"Bien s&ucirc;r que nous sommes d&#233;&#231;us. Cela ne suffit pas", d&#233;clare l'ancien

ambassadeur de Zambie, Kapembe Nsingo. "Etant donn&#233; l'adh&#233;sion des nouveaux membres,

ils auraient d&ucirc; augmenter l'enveloppe."

<P>

Le d&#233;sappointement s'accompagnait d'un soulagement car, &#224; certains moments des

n&#233;gociations, les pays ACP n'&#233;taient pas s&ucirc;rs que la r&#233;vision d&#233;boucherait

sur un accord quel qu'il soit.

<P>

"A un moment donn&#233;,...il semblait que nous n'allions arriver &#224; aucune conclusion et en outre,

la menace de r&#233;ductions importantes de l'enveloppe planait &#233;galement", remarque Carl

Greenidge, secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral par int&#233;rim du Groupe des Etats ACP et membre

du conseil d'administration de l'ECDPM. "Nous avons &#233;t&#233; soulag&#233;s et sommes

tr&#232;s reconnaissants des contributions apport&#233;es par les pays de l'UE, la France en particulier,

pour r&#233;soudre cette affaire."

<P>

Au cours des cinq ann&#233;es &#224; venir, les pays ACP recevront 14,965 milliards d'ECU de

l'Europe, ce qui repr&#233;sente une augmentation de 23,3 % par rapport au financement durant le

premier protocole (1990-1995). La contribution des &Eacute;tats membres &#224; cette somme

s'&#233;l&#232;ve &#224; 12,8 milliards d'ECU (en comparaison des 10,9 milliards d'ECU lors du

premier protocole). Cela peut para&icirc;tre impressionnant de prime abord, mais, en termes r&#233;els,

cela ne repr&#233;sente qu'une goutte dans l'oc&#233;an de l'aide.

<P>

Cela d&#233;&#231;oit les pays ACP qui avaient esp&#233;r&#233; 15,8 milliards d'ECU,

essentiellement destin&#233;s &#224; am&#233;liorer la commercialisation de leur production afin de

se maintenir dans un march&#233; europ&#233;en de plus en plus comp&#233;titif. "C'est normal quand

on re&#231;oit moins que ce que l'on avait demand&#233;", observe John Morns, ministre de

l'information de la Papouasie-Nouvelle-Guin&#233;e.

<P>

Cependant, comme le fait remarquer Greenidge, les pays ACP sont dans une position d'&#233;change

pr&#233;caire parce que l'Europe se retrouve avec un exc&#233;dent de produits du type de ceux fournis

par le groupe. 

<P>

<H3>Contr&ocirc;le accru pour l'UE</H3>

<P>

Bien que la pr&#233;occupation primordiale des pays ACP soit l'importance du financement de

Lom&#233;, ils sont &#233;galement inquiets des tentatives de l'Europe pour exercer une influence et

un contr&ocirc;le accrus sur ses partenaires. Mais comme l'admet Greenidge: "Le groupe comprend assez

bien le probl&#232;me des conditionnalit&#233;s: un certain degr&#233; de conditionnalit&#233; est

in&#233;vitable."

<P>

La r&#233;vision, elle-m&ecirc;me combattue par les pays ACP, a eu lieu parce que l'Europe veut

r&#233;duire les mises &#224; fonds perdus. Elle a d&#233;cid&#233; que le meilleur moyen d'atteindre

cet objectif &#233;tait d'associer plus &#233;troitement l'allocation de fonds &#224; la performance. Les

pays qui r&#233;alisent de bons r&#233;sultats - selon les normes europ&#233;ennes, bien que personne

ne sache tr&#232;s bien comment cette performance sera &#233;valu&#233;e -, recevront de l'argent.

<P>

Au lieu d'accorder une somme fixe pour une p&#233;riode de cinq ans et de laisser les

b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires d&#233;cider relativement librement de son utilisation, les allocations couvriront

trois ans et les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires devront absorber 70 pourcent de la totalit&#233; des fonds

octroy&#233;s. Si le b&#233;n&#233;ficiaire ne le fait pas, les fonds pourront &ecirc;tre

redistribu&#233;s. Bien que certains pays ACP affirment que cette condition abolit les principes de base

du partenariat, Greenidge ne partage pas cet avis.

<P>

Cette condition n'annule pas le partenariat, affirme-t-il. "Elle laisse aux mains de la Commission un

degr&#233; peu souhaitable de libert&#233; dans l'allocation des fonds", explique-t-il. "Mais la question

de la mise en oeuvre a &#233;t&#233; soulev&#233;e avec la Communaut&#233; et l'on esp&#232;re

que durant la p&#233;riode initiale, nous pourrons convenir des crit&#232;res objectifs qui seront

utilis&#233;s pour &#233;chelonner les d&#233;boursements et d&#233;terminer s'il y a lieu d'effectuer

un deuxi&#232;me versement."

<P>

<H3>Accent sur les priorit&#233;s de l'UE</H3>

<P>

Certains pays ACP pensent &#233;galement que l'Europe associe trop &#233;troitement la performance

&#224; des questions politiques telles que les droits de l'homme. En effet, l'un des changements les plus

importants effectu&#233;s fut l'introduction d'une "clause de suspension" relative aux droits de l'homme

dans l'Article 366 de la Convention.  Toutefois, l'UE a conc&#233;d&#233; aux pays ACP qu'une telle

suspension ne pourrait se produire qu'apr&#232;s consultation et prise de d&#233;cision bilat&#233;rales

ACP-UE.

<P>

Un autre changement est que, d&#233;sormais, la Commission va assumer une plus grande

responsabilit&#233; dans la pr&#233;paration des projets. Elle &#233;valuera les projets seule, mais

collaborera avec les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires pour la r&#233;daction des plans de projets (autrefois, les

pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires le faisaient eux-m&ecirc;mes). Cela ne surprendra pas, c'est

&#233;galement l&#224; une pr&#233;occupation des pays ACP.

<P>

"Nous ne sommes pas oppos&#233;s au fait qu'ils examinent les projets, mais le fait que la Commission

ne financera que les projets qu'elle voit d'un bon oeil nous inqui&#232;te", affirme Greenidge et il ajoute:

"Elle a tendance, dans certaines situations, &#224; poursuivre les projets en fonction de son

int&#233;r&ecirc;t."

<P>

Pendant la r&#233;vision, l'UE a signal&#233; qu'elle commencerait &#224; pousser plus vivement les

pays ACP &#224; prendre bonne note des priorit&#233;s des donateurs lorsqu'ils demandent des fonds.

Parmi les domaines consid&#233;r&#233;s comme n&#233;cessitant une attention particuli&#232;re,

citons l'enseignement, la sant&#233; et la formation; la Commission estime en effet qu'ils sont essentiels

au d&#233;veloppement. Cette question est d&#233;licate et les pays ACP se sont oppos&#233;s &#224;

ce qu'ils consid&#232;rent comme des tentatives de l'UE pour dicter la politique de l'aide.

<P>

N&#233;anmoins, &#224; la fin de la r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours de Lom&#233; IV, les pays

ACP ont d&#233;cid&#233; qu'il &#233;tait raisonnable que la Convention refl&#232;te leurs

priorit&#233;s mais aussi celles de l'Europe. "C'est formul&#233; de cette mani&#232;re", d&#233;clare

Greenidge au sujet du document. "En fin de compte, le groupe est parvenu &#224; faire modifier les

propositions afin qu'elles soient plus tol&#233;rables que les propositions originales ne l'auraient

&#233;t&#233;. L'accord global ne nous a pas &#233;t&#233; impos&#233;; nous l'avons

n&#233;goci&#233;."

<div align=right><a href="index.html" target="_parent">About TVE</a></div>
</font>
<h2>Producing the Programmes</h2>
<font size=2 face=helvetica,arial>One of the ways TVE works is by acting as a bridge - or broker - between
organisations
which want to get an issue aired (United Nations agencies, bilateral agencies and organisations such as
Oxfam, Panos or WWF) and the television industry.<p>


TVE's skill is to take the seemingly complex priorities of the agencies it works with and turn them into
television programmes that will attract audiences worldwide: to take issues like child development,
primary health, poverty or desertification, and translate them into mainstream TV programmes -
drama, 'soaps' and children's programmes, as well as documentaries - that focus on the human stories
involved in sustainable human development.
<p>

In 10 years TVE has helped catalyse the production of over 200 environmental films and videos, winning at
one time or another all the major broadcast prizes.</font>

E-mail stands for excess mail, the additionalcommunications that seek you out and pour in on you immediatelyyou set up an electronic connection. Some is psychic junk mail:"Have a nice day" addressed to everyone in the organization;"What does arcom mean?" (I don't know). "Why are you nowhulm@itu.ch when you were hulm@itu.arcom.ch a few months ago?"(I don't know!). No wonder one of the commercial accessproviders goes by the name of panix.  By <b>Peter Hulm, </b>Managing Editor of Crosslines.</i><hr>The secrets of e-mail came out during a presentation at theGeneva Internet Day organized on 28 March by the InternationalTelecommunication Union (actually it proved so popular it wasscheduled for repetition on 29 March). Inayet Syed of ITU'sInformation Services Department (yet another mystery guest for<i>What's My Line</i>) revealed that 36,000 e-mail messages wereexchanged through ITU's system last month and its gopher menusystem recorded a peak of 180,000 accesses in one week. By myrough calculation that's one access every 3.5 seconds. So that'swhy I have such a hard time getting through some days.<p>Tony Rutkowski, Executive Director of the Internet Society, hadsome more mind-boggling statistics to offer the presentationsaudience: "World-Wide Web traffic growth is so stunning that ifit were to continue, in the year 1996 it will exceed the world'stelephone traffic." He also said that by the year 2000 therewould be 4,000 PetaBytes of traffic, enough to fill 10,000 1.2Gigabit/sec digital pipes.  And you know what that means (don'tyou?).<p>My point is: how much of the e-mail you receive would youotherwise get through the post? Syed explained: "If I don't readmy e-mail for a week it will take me half a day to process it.If you are on [an Internet news] list, that will add to it." YetITU has only 3,500 registered users, compared to the 20 millionhanging in the net at the moment and the 187 million internettedcomputers projected for 2000.<p>ITU, which started up a Web server last Friday (23 March 1995),prepared 18,000 pages for access through the new system. Syedlifted the corner on another much-hidden truth about W3 [=WorldWideWeb - Ed.] Thoughmuch of the formatting work was automated, "we did a handful ofpages [manually] to make it look nice. It took --," he said,sounding incredulous --"For two weeks I have been working onthis."<p>ITU is the home of engineers and PTT officials rather thanhackers. But you can't blame Michael Minges for pointing outthat 90% of Internet networks are in developed countries andthat the number of Internet users is overshadowed by the 600million telephone subscribers and more than one billion TV setsworldwide. Information consultant Michael Jensen noted that onlyAlgeria, Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia and Zambia havefull-powered lease lines to the Internet. Zambia's and Algeria'sconnections are only a few months old.<p>Some contrasts within international organizations are glaring:Tony Rutkowski passed on the estimate that 80% of all scientistswho have ever lived are now reachable on the Internet. But a fewweeks ago UNESCO Director General Federico Mayor circulated aReport by an eminent panel that the single most effective actionthat could be taken to enhance science today would be to ensurethat "all scientists everywhere had effective Internetconnectivity." The weird reality is that UNESCO itself has tocall on an outside University and commercial organization tohandle its electronic documents system because it lacks theskills and capacity to operate the system on its own, as Sayedpointed out.<p><hr>©Copyright: Crosslines Global Report April 1995<hr><a href="index.html"><img src="crosslines_pix/crosslines_logo2.gif"> CROSSLINES Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<h1>Current follies</h1>

<font size=+1>While delivering electricity - and to some degree controlling flooding  - the 'conquest of nature' approach to river-engineering creates as many problems as it solves</font><p>
<hr><p>



<center></center><br clear=all>

Straightening out and diking rivers increases the speed and volume of the river's flow creating serious flooding in very wet years when dikes might not hold. Deforestation increases damaging erosion and destroys a river's watershed.<p>



Silt is trapped behind dams, reducing fertility downstream as well as the capacity and life-span of the dam. Downstream silt must be replaced by expensive chemical fertilizer.<p>


Dams always carry the danger of collapse due to earthquakes, flooding or sabotage. Casualties from dam collapse will be much higher than those from normal flooding.<p>

Riverine fisheries are destroyed as nutrients (fish food) become trapped behind dams and fish are unable to move up rivers to spawn. Downstream agriculture, with reduced water and silt flow, is subject to much higher dangers of salination (salt-poisoning.<p>


Reservoirs flood the often-fertile land at the bottom of valleys and displace thousands of people to less suitable land or overcrowded urban areas. Large reservoirs, particularly in hot climates, have enormous losses of precious water through evaporation. Irrigation channels spread disease, particularly malaria (300 million sufferers) and bilharzia (200 million affected),<p>

Diking cuts off wetlands which are natural absorbers of flood and provide a wildlife habitat.<p>

The following reports are typical of the 90 small grants projects we were able to support last year thanks to generosity of our many supporters.</font><h3>Society for Community Development Project, Tamil Nadu, India</h3>Many of the voluntary organisations in the Salem District of Tamil Nadu are deeply concerned about the growing incidence of Female Infanticide in this area. The profound poverty of the people, increasing dowry demands and the poor social standing of women all contribute to the intense pressure and shame a family feels when a baby girl is born.<p>The Society for Community Development was set up in 1990 to support the rural poor of the Salem district. They applied to WOMANKIND for a small grant of £500 to run a campaign to combat the practice of Female Infanticide in their local area. Seminars and cultural programmes re-establishing the value of girls and women in society were held in three of the villages where the practice is traditionally most widespread. Issues such as dowry payments, education for girls and family planning were raised and thoroughly discussed. The parents of girl children were given gifts to promote the feeling that having a baby girl is a cause for celebration and not a source of shame and despair. Information pamphlets and posters were distributed to the surrounding area.<p>The campaign was widely welcomed and received considerable coverage in the local press. Nearly 1000 people attended the meetings and many signed a pledge promising to protect girl babies in their own families and villages from infanticide and neglect.<p><h3>Proyecto Independiente de Salud Indigena Lenca (PISIL), Honduras</h3>PISIL was set up 1993 to provide health training to the scattered communities of indigeneous people around San Jose. These communities are extremely poor and isolated. Indeed some of the villages are only accessible by foot. Over the last two years, PISIL has extended its work to include training in income generating activities such as pottery, embroidery, sewing, tile making. The aim of the training has been to build on the traditional skills of the villagers and to restore pride in their own rich culture and customs. <p>Many of the villagers are seasonal workers on the local coffee plantations. For much of the year, there is no work and the villagers have to survive on nothing more than a few tortillas to eat each day. The women wanted to use this time to make clothes for their families and to sell for a much needed income. WOMANKIND gave PISIL a small grant of £300 to buy a sewing machine, scissors, fabric, needles, thread etc to help them set up a sewing project.<p>The project has been a tremendous success. PISIL organised training for the women in cutting patterns, sewing, dressmaking and sewing machine maintenance. Three sewing groups were set up and with PISIL's two existing machines, each group now has its own sewing machine. The women meet once a week to work together and help each other out. This has the first opportunity for some of the women to earn an income of their own.<p> <h3>Madina Women's Development Programme, Sierra Leone</h3>Long periods of war and civil upheaval  have taken their toll on the poorest people of Sierra Leone. The Madina Women's Development Programme was formed by 100 rural women in the villages around Madina in central Sierra Leone. These women wanted a forum where they could come together to talk over their problems and offer each other mutual support.<p>More than three quarters of Sierra Leone's population do not have access to safe drinking water. A pressing concern expressed by many members of the Madina group was that their health and that of their families is badly affected by poor nutrition and  insanitary conditions. The programme agreed to organise workshops to train representatives from each of the villages in diet and nutrition, healthcare, safe drinking water and sanitation.<p>Many of the women have no means of earning money. The programme also set up a soap making project to enable their members to generate an income. Good quality soap is expensive and up until now has only been available in the urban areas some distance away. So the women were confident that there would be a market for their produce but the group needed training, materials and the basic tools necessary to start up their enterprise. <p>The Madina programme approached WOMANKIND for support and all this work has been made possible by a small grant for £792 to fund the healthcare workshops, training in soap making techniques and the purchase of materials and tools for their project. Already, some of the profit from selling the soap has started up a revolving fund which makes loans available to members who want to set up other small businesses.<p><h3>You can help other groups put their intitiatives into practice</h3><b>Our partners in developing countries have the courage and determination to improve their situation for themselves - what they often lack is funding to support their initiatives. Even small sums of money can make an enormous difference. If you would like to make a donation towards our small grants fund, please send it to us at 4 Albion Place, Galena Road, London W6 0LT.</b><p><b><a href="index.html">Contents Page</a></b><p><hr><p>©Copyright:1996 Womankind Worldwide<hr></body></html>

<h2>Find me a war</h2>
<font size=+1><b>

By Cecilia Valenzuela</b></font>
<p>
<i>With elections due in April, the war with Ecuador has become President Fujimori's most powerful campaign tool.  </i>
<hr>
A well-known comic strip in a Lima daily recently showed President Fujimori asking a journalist on his re-election campaign trail: 'Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?' 'Yes, your honour,' the cartoon journalist replies. 'Then you're not coming along with me!' retorts the president.<p>

The cartoon neatly encapsulates the way the government is now manipulating public opinion through television news and current affairs programmes.<p>

For the last three years, Peru has been living under a subtle and well-managed dictatorship. The president of the republic, constitutionally elected in 1990, violated that same Constitution in 1992 when, with the help of the military, he instigated a coup d'etat, closed down Congress and took over the judiciary. The only people with advance warning of Fujimori's surprise, were the proprietors of the country's television stations.<p>

The National Intelligence Service gave Fujimori good advice on the management of a society predominantly concerned with survival: bribe media bosses, or pressurise them through official control over advertising. The mass media have been obedient spokesmen ever since, orchestrating the disinformation campaign that Fujimori needs to maintain his regime. Fujimori's government also retains the services of two public relations companies. Both have profited from lucrative contracts to represent Peru's biggest companies, public as well as private. As a result, their ability to influence the media agenda is enormous.<p>

Most Latin American constitutions - with the exceptions of Argentina and now Peru - prohibit their presidents from serving two successive terms. In Peru the power of the executive is out of all proportion to that of the other branches of government, making it impossible to minimise the built-in advantages of an incumbent presidential candidate. <p>

The National Electoral Commission - a fully autonomous body, according to the new Constitution - was set up to regulate the presidential re-election campaign, thereby guaranteeing conditions of equality for the other candidates. The pro-Fujimori majority in Congress, however, set the commission on the right track by refusing to pass the electoral law unamended. As it stood, they argued, the law would have 'imprisoned' Fujimori in the presidential palace.<p>

So the president was allowed to continue on the campaign trail, touring the country in the presidential plane or in army helicopters, handing out election leaflets at rallies orchestrated by military personnel. And always accompanied by a select group of reporters accredited by the palace.<p>

He was also allowed to interfere unchecked in the campaigns of his opponents. Javier Perez de Cuellar was surprised early on in the campaign, at a rally in Cuzco's main square, to see a group of supposed supporters bearing placards that read: 'Perez de Cuellar, the Shining Path Communist Party salutes and supports you.'<p>
<p>
<ul> 
<p>
<i>On the streets of Lima: fully armed and ready to go.<p>
  <font size=-2>CAROLS REYES/ANDES PRESS AGENCY</font></i>
<p></ul>
<br clear=left>

But on 26 January the course of the campaign suddenly altered: overnight Peru had become embroiled in cross-border war with neighbouring Ecuador. This was no simple border skirmish. While neither party admits to firing the first shot across the disputed territory, they have, between them, brought their countries to the brink of total war.<p>

After almost three weeks of fierce fighting, Fujimori announced that the invading Ecuadorian army had been successfully repelled and declared a unilateral ceasefire. He also signed a peace accord that, according to most analysts, was far from being in the country's best interests. <p>

Nothing could have been further from the truth: Fujimori's announcement of victory was calculated to increase his standing in the opinion polls and it soon became clear from sources in the army that Ecuador's most important strategic positions had not been, and would not be, retaken. The fighting continued and the numbers of dead and wounded mounted up.<p>

At which point, Javier Perez de Cuellar announced that, given the situation, he would not continue with his campaign. The other candidates also became markedly more muted and all the opposition groups agreed that it would be more seemly to put the interests of the nation above partisan politics.<p>

Fujimori saw no conflict of interest between his election campaign and his conduct of the war. Nor did he see any need to keep Congress or the other presidential candidates informed about the progress of events. By default, Fujimori became the only presidential candidate still widely visible in the media - in his role as president.<p>

With a permanent smile glued to his face, Fujimori tours the villages of Peru's northeastern border zone, accompanied by his favourite and most loyal reporters. Independent reporters are routinely denied a place on the presidential bandwagon and on official press tours of the area around the Rio Cenepa, where the war is most fierce.
The loyal press have presented these tours of the war zone as martial epics with a heroic protagonist, disguising the reality of a war that is maiming the countryside. The electoral value of such excursions, however, has not gone unremarked in certain sectors of the independent press.<p>

The conflict with Ecuador exposes Fujimori's lack of scruple. It also highlights the submission of those substantial sectors of the media, whose lack of scruple matches that of the president, and who promote his electoral interests regardless of the facts. <p>

<TITLE>The Week in Europe</TITLE>

The Week in Europe, 14 November 1996</h2>

<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>

<p>

Executive Director of the <A HREF="cce.htm">Caribbean Council for Europe</A></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

Sometime in the next few weeks a document may emerge from the European

Commission's Development Directorate in Brussels setting out the broad

thinking of its Commissioner, Professor Pinheiro, about options for a post

2000 EU/ACP relationship.

<p>

The document may not be the full Commission green paper (discussion

document) so widely expected and advertised since late l995, but instead a

much shortened and slimmed down version of the original eighty page paper.

What its status will be is still unclear as at least two other directorates

of the European Commission have expressed reservations about how it relates

to Europe's commitment to global convergence in its foreign and development

policy and its impact on the EU's trade and agriculture policies in the

context of the GATT.

<p>

These divisions within the European Commission before the debate between

the ACP and EU has even begun, do not bode well for the outcome. They point

to the likely fault lines that will develop in Europe as the different

directorates of the Commission and then Europe's member states try to

determine a common EU negotiating position with the ACP for when formal

discussions begin in l998.

<p>

At the heart of this argument is the question of whether Europe should

continue to pursue a partnership with the 70 ACP states by conferring on

them a special relationship or whether, post 2000, this widely different

grouping of nations should be drawn into a common EU approach which will

integrate over time all foreign, trade and development policy. It is a

debate that has far reaching implications for the creation and maintenance

of a common ACP negotiating position and the future of the ACP as a group.

<p>

Speaking about this in Brussels in the week past with senior officials from

a number of directorates I was struck by a growing sense of unease that

Prof. Pinheiro's  paper may raise questions not just about future relations

with the ACP, but about Europe's future approach to the world. Among the

disturbing  questions they posed were: Has the Development Directorate a

future? Is its post 2000 development role better located in an enlarged

International Relations Directorate in which sub groups with

responsibility, for instance, for the Caribbean, South Africa and Tropical

Africa, come to deal with the world by sub-regions? Is the Pacific's future

not with Europe at all but with the nations of the Pacific rim? Should the

delivery of aid programmes be undertaken by an independent agency dealing

with the world as a whole and leaving just policy issues to the Commission?

And will the Dutch Government, which will hold the EU Presidency in the

first half of l997, attempt to marginalise Professor Pinheiro's thinking by

insisting that policy towards the ACP must be convergent with all other EU

development and trade policy? 

<P>

Other more Caribbean specific questions raised included: Why does the green

paper not propose policies that embrace the future of remote parts of

Europe such as Martinique or Guadeloupe or the British or Dutch dependent

territories? How can solutions be proposed for the ACP when in the case of

the Caribbean for example, its future may be bound up with its neighbours

in Latin and Central America in the context of the Free Trade Area of the

Americas? And will Cuba be left isolated by the type of options proposed by

the reflection group?

<P>

For the Caribbean these questions are likely to haunt those who have to

determine first a Caricom and then a Cariforum position and its subsequent

integration into a negotiating mandate that is acceptable to African and

Pacific states while meeting other criteria for entry into the FTAA and

advanced relationships with Mercosur and Latin partners. They will also

worry those in the private sector who hope to establish the longest phase

out possible for preferential trade arrangements.

<P>

In Europe, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom are all

at advanced stages of thinking about the shape of any future arrangement.

While few public statements have been forthcoming it is clear that Germany

and the Netherlands are likely to promote the thinking on convergence

contained in the Maastricht Treaty while Britain and France may argue for

special and differential treatment for at least a fixed period after the

year 2000.

<p>

Caribbean Heads of Government have made clear that they regard the

maintenance of solidarity with the African and Pacific states as a

prerequisite for maintaining a strong negotiating stance with the EU. This

position, which might be accommodated in a framework arrangement that

embraces a policy of continuing partnership that takes account of regional

and sub-regional variations, will not be easy to achieve. The devil will be

in the detail.

<p>

However, problems of a completely different order arise if powerful EU

member states prompted by changing public opinion and diminishing resources

are not prepared even to accept the notion that the ACP should have a

special relationship with Europe. 

<p>

Unfortunately the background atmospherics are very mixed. Images of the

horror and suffering in Zaire and Rwanda set alongside pictures of

prosperous and well fed ministers seated in Rome at the World Food Summit

negatively affect popular sentiment on Africa. On the other hand, this is a

far cry from the widely welcomed remarks of Jamaica's Prime Minister, P J

Patterson. Visiting London in the week past, he made clear his vision of a

strong relationship with Europe in which Jamaica, through sound economic

policies and good government would with Europe's continuing assistance be

able to manage its way into a more liberal global economy.

<p>

Faced with all these contradictions, the Caribbean will have to give

careful thought as to how it encourages the ACP to take forward a common

negotiating position.

<h2>3. ROUTES TO HEALTH</h2>
<p>

Clearly, health policy in 1996 exists in an environment radically different from that of 15 years ago. The changing economic climate and the new conditions caused by increasing global competition have brought benefits to some while impoverishing and marginalising many others.<p>


In 1981, in the belief that the world economy would continue to grow and governments of rich and poor countries would continue to make money available for health, the goal of universal health care by the year 2000 was approved by the Health Assembly reinstating the aims enshrined in the 1978 Alma Ata Declaration (<a href="../health/box4.html">see also "health for all"</a>)<p>


The 1980s turned out to be plagued by economic recession, declining terms of trade and falling aid. The decade crippled the economies of the poorest countries. Many faced the bitter pill of structural adjustment. Debt repayments swallowed up budgets. The market's dominance grew and the role of the state was increasingly reduced. Public sector health systems collapsed. In the global economic crisis, the most vulnerable suffered first - and worst.<p>
<p>


<h2>3.1 THE WORLD BANK MODEL</h2>

In this changed environment in 1993, the World Bank made its first major international policy statement on health in 15 years. It stated that:<p>



<ul type=disc>
<li>governments should provide the basic package of health care; but
<li>hospital-based health care should be charged for; and
<li> the free market and non-government organisations should supply other services.
</ul>

Firmly endorsing the belief in the competitive market as the arbiter of growth and social policy, it emphasised solutions which broadly imply a major contraction in the ambitions of state health systems and strongly support private sector health financing and provision:<p>


<i>"The challenge for most governments is to withdraw from areas of health care provision best left to the private sector while concentrating resources and attention on things that only government can do: responding to market failures (such as externalities associated with infectious disease control: ... and investing in health and education for the poor."</i><p>

<center>World Bank, World Development Report, 1993</center><p>


The basic premise of the new recipe for health was, and is, that money must be spent 'efficiently'. Cost effectiveness, measured by 'DALYs' (disability adjusted life years) per dollar, determined whether or not a treatment should be provided. Treating one child might save x years of impairment, while treating another may only improve a condition without sparing him/her the impairment - which according to the World Bank model is less cost effective. If a treatment is cost effective on these terms, it should be provided; otherwise it should not.<p>


In practice this means that in a poor country, resources would be available for, say, measles immunisation, which is effective and reasonably cheap, but treatment would not be available for a disabled child whose condition was not wholly remediable; nor for a child with HIV which led to secondary infections, because he or she would be bound to die anyway.<p>

<i>"Greater economic efficiency ... often brings with it greater inequity and inequality of opportunity".</i>
<center> World Health Organisation, Health in Social Development, Copenhagen 1995</center><p>
<p>


<a name="flaws"><h2>3.2 FLAWS IN THE MODEL</h2></a>

In 1996, The World Bank World Development Report 1993 remains the authority on health policy and is interpreted as the orthodoxy by many donors. While it welcomes the ports as an important contribution to the health policy debate, Save the Children opposes the model of health proposed in the report on the following grounds:<p>

<ul type=disc>
<li>It fails to acknowledge the absolute lack of resources available to the poorest countries to secure even minimum levels of quality in health care delivery to minimum numbers of people. It underestimates the real costs of effective health system.<p>

<li>It under-estimates the time needed to implement radical policy changes in environments that are poor. This will result in either no change or partial change with unforeseen consequences.<p>

<li>The cost-effectiveness model - as opposed to one which examines the cost of effectiveness - will fail the poorest and remove the notion of equity from health policy. It may lead to the further fragmentation of health services, inefficiency and waste through duplication and a failure to build strong health systems which are integrated and coordinated.<p>

<li>It repeats mistakes made by the World Bank in other sectors which have shown that if you standardise models of development across the world and impose solutions from above they will fail because of lack of ownership and failure to adapt to local circumstances (a href="../health/box5.html">see also "paying the price for health"</a>).<p>

<li>It assumes that private and NGO suppliers of health services are comparatively better on quality of care, access and coverage grounds than the government - an unproven assumption. It does not outline the role of government in regulating private provision to preserve standards of cost, quality, safety and coverage.<p>

<li>It relies too much on a US-style model of health services which has been shown to be inefficient overall and to exclude the poor. The US spends 13.8 per cent of its GDP (Gross Domestic Product) on health, a level of spending at which such a model may function. In poor countries, which spend less than one per cent of GP on health, the application of this model cannot work. <p>

</ul>
<p>
<p>

<a name="reforming"><h2>3.3 REFORMING THE MODEL</H2></a>

Since 1993, and in response to continual lobbying the health policy debate has begun to use a new language which supports Save the Children's own experience. Papers published  by the World Bank on health in Africa have acknowledged the lack of resources there, including insufficient levels of aid, and have proposed an annual increase in funds for health services in low-income and low health expenditure countries in Africa of $1.6 billion (Towards Better Health in Africa, 1995). It states that where governments of the poorest countries cannot afford to contribute to this, richer donor countries must.<p>

In further statements, the World Bank remains true to its mandate that growth is essential for poverty reduction but also stresses the need to look at the pattern and distribution of growth - who is losing and who is gaining. The world Bank's recent poverty assessments in Ghana for example, show the average rate of poverty has dropped; but that the gap between rich and poor has widened.<br> (Forthcoming paper, working title: Taking Action for Poverty Reduction in sub-Saharan Africa).<p>

Using language that echoes Save the Children's position, the World Bank describes a situation where African countries take charge of their own health; determine their own health policies, priorities and goals and build true consensus; assume responsibility for their health programmes; develop the ability to coordinate donor contributions; and make their own decisions - in the house, village and country. Thereby, donor countries and institutions work within the framework of national policies, reducing and eventually eliminating separate donor-financed and largely 'vertical' programmes. (Towards Better Health in Africa, 1995)<p>


The time is right to seize on these changes in emphasis and to reform the World Bank's recipe for health care. Unless we do, the goal of the universal right to health for all children will remain a pipe dream.<p>

<hr width=71%><p>



<font size=+1>



<b>Richard Swift</b> uncovers the real reasons why people - and beavers - want to mess with rivers. He
charts the growing movement in defense of our great waterways.</font>
<p>
<br>

There is something strangely compelling about a river. It is at the same
time comforting and exhilarating. Part of it is the hypnosis of constant
movement - like the flames of a fire or waves on a beach. But part
of it is that sense that there is something eternal here that will keep
on going long after the car engine conks out, the nuclear power station
has been decommissioned and we have all turned to dust.<p>

Rivers are much more than flowing water. As Max Finkelstein of Canada's
Heritage Rivers Program points out: 'They are the threads that bind the
fabric of nature and humanity and define the world's mosaic of cultures
and landscapes. Throughout the world, rivers are imprinted on the land, and in the hearts and minds of the people who live along their banks.' <p>

Different rivers 'imprint' in different ways. A lazy stretch of the Mekong or the Amazon is a world away from the violent rapids of the Colorado or the treacherous eddies of the Yangtze. And rivers can be whimsical in their changes of mood; the Mississippi on a lazy late summer's afternoon flowing by New Orleans's Jackson Square is a very different beast from the Mississippi in full flood sweeping away fields, farms and towns in the American Midwest as it did back in the spring of 1993. It is little wonder that when humanity set out to 'conquer nature' the wayward and uncontrolled river was a prime candidate. <p>



The imprint of the river will be different if you spend your time catching the giant Mekong catfish for your food or are the deckhand on a colourful Zaire river barge, or rely on the Amazon to carry you to the nearest market, or are related to a river only as a distant source of water and power. For those of us who live with a river every day, its moods shape our moods. For those who visit to holiday or for religious purposes (as do hundreds of thousands in India) it is vital to the renewal of spirit and body. Then there are people whose livelihoods and prosperity are dependent on conquering the river and bending it to human purpose. It is increasingly difficult for rivers to meet all such competing needs.   <p>
 
There are in fact two cultural strains to indicate how human beings think about rivers. In the oldest the river is taken as circular and self-regulating with flooding cycles and water web accorded an almost spiritual status. This reverence for and modesty about the natural wonder of rivers comes from people whose food and drink are drawn directly from its waters. Indigenous peoples the world over have passed this sensibility down to farmers and fishers and now ecologists have taken up the torch. <p>

A more recent notion of the river is that of a straight line running from point A to point B. This dates from the Roman water-supply aqueducts -the first rivers without curves. It is a notion that concentrates on military and commercial uses and is tied to the fate of states and empires. Here the river is a highway to be shaped for transportation -or latterly something to dam and divert -displacing its natural cycles with ones more convenient to the master designer. <p>

Only one other species treats flowing water in this fashion. It said that North American beavers can't stand the sound of running water. Under laboratory conditions they will almost immediately seek to dam it up. There are lots of Canadian clichŽs about beavers being 'nature's little engineers'. They are the only other mammal to alter their habitat but unlike human engineers the wetlands they create are of some use to other species. Fish, waterfowl and a profusion of plantlife flourish there. Beavers are like their human engineering counterparts in another way as well -they have a lot of nerve. This point was brought home forcefully to me this summer when a beaver swam right up behind me (stick in mouth) as I tried to free a culvert from its dam of mud and sticks that was overflowing our country road. It was as if the little beast was saying 'you can do what you want but I'm going to dam it right back up as soon as you leave'. And sure enough that's just what happened. <p>



I am generally quite willing to leave nature to its own devices but I find beavers a pain in the butt. I am sure that this is how most other species think about the humans who alternately drown or dry up their natural habitats by damming, diverting and channelling river flows. Increasingly that's also how a great deal of humanity is coming to feel about hydraulic engineers and their political masters -the people who shape the rivers and thus the lives and livelihoods of those who live with them. <p>

<h4>Cementing the river</h4>
Around the world this process is well advanced. A massive hydrological infra-
structure comprised of huge dams, hydro-generating stations, major water diversion canals, thousands of kilometres of dikes and levees and vast irrigation systems has fundamentally altered most of the world's populated river eco-systems. There are now 36,000 large-scale dams and they are still going up at the rate of 170 a year, displacing a million-odd 'reservoir refugees' -mostly in the South where they lack the political clout to resist. <p>

Vast bodies of water like Russia's Aral Sea and Africa's Lake Chad are being systematically dried up. Whole riverine fisheries have been wiped out. Upstream wildlife habitat and some of the most fertile valley-bottom land has drowned. Downstream agriculture is robbed of vital nutrients that used to come from the silt which now clogs up dam reservoirs. There it slowly eats away at electrical potential and reduces storage capacity. Farmers are forced to rely instead on expensive fertilizers and are plagued with problems of waterlogged soil and of course salt -the curse of all civilizations based on large-scale irrigation. In some parts of Sind province in Pakistan more than half of once-productive land irrigated from the heavily-dammed Indus river is now barren and covered with salt. River eco-systems are not only over-engineered but are poisoned by industrial chemicals and agricultural run-off. In the worst cases, such as Poland, three-quarters of river water is unfit even for industrial use.<p>



Giant mega-dams are the largest-ever structures built by humans and as such provide ample opportunities for cost overruns and corruption. A great deal of the Third World's crippling debt load comes from trying to pay off such bills. But financial costs are born by individual taxpayers and entire economies (usually meaning the 'structurally adjusted' poor) while profits tend to accrue to those better-placed to influence decisions. Such projects are not altruistic acts taken in the public interest. Benefits are unevenly distributed. The big growers of California are a classic example. Some of the most extensive riverworks in the world have ended up providing a subsidy that runs as high as two million dollars for a large farm to produce crops that the US already has in surplus. Similarly with the Bangladesh Flood Action Plan where supposed flood protection was transformed into a tool for agricultural 'modernization' which benefited larger commercial farmers. So even fiscal conservatives (at least those who don't stand to gain) these days are becoming quite wary of  major river projects.<p>

Large-scale river engineering means the centralization and arrogant use of political power that inevitably goes hand-in-hand with any mega-project. From the beginning of recorded history in the valleys of the Tigres-Euphrates or the Yellow River in Ancient China major riverworks were used by autocratic states to control the labour and crops of previously autonomous villages. To this day decisions as to how and where to build big dams or divert river flows are often hidden from public scrutiny. Remote bureaucratic organizations staffed by ambitious technocrats such as the US Bureau of Reclamation, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Mekong Secretariat in South East Asia or the Lake Chad Basin Commission in West Africa shape projects and then look for political sponsors to push them through. Those most affected are often the last to know. <p>

There is of course a credit side to the ledger. Defenders of river engineering point to tens of thousands of kilowatts of electricity generated and thousands of acres of arid land brought into agricultural production. Some of its achievements have verged on the fantastic: concrete rivers criss-crossing deserts from Libya to Arizona to carry water to thirsty crops and consumers, staircases of dams that climb US rivers like the Colorado and the Columbia (and are planned for the Mekong) and the growth of heavily water-dependent crops like cotton in the desert conditions of Egypt and Central Asia. Billions of dollars have been spent and hundreds of thousands of people are now employed either building or maintaining riverworks from the steamy heat of the Volta in Ghana to the frozen tundra of 
Siberia. Indeed mega-dams
and large-scale irrigation are now so important a part of  modern industrial
infrastructure and the power grid underpinning it that to question them
seems an absurdity. <p>
<p>


<h4>Defending the river</h4>
Yet that is precisely what is being done. In an address printed in the May
1993 issue of the slick trade monthly Water Power and Dam Construction 
W Pircher, a big cheese at the International Commission of Large Dams, expresses
alarm at the growing movement against river engineering. 'Today the resistance
to new dams... is more fundamental, better organized, more spectacular...
it is a serious counter-movement that has already succeeded in reducing
the prestige of dam engineering in the public eye, and it is starting to
make work difficult for our profession.'  This is not idle propaganda. The
defense of river eco-systems has been most pronounced in North America and
in Asia where river engineering has remade the geography of countries like
the US and India. But it is now finding echoes from the Rhine to the Amazon.
The movement typically combines concern for poor people's livelihood and
land rights usurped in the name of hydrological progress with issues of
long-term environmental impact -  the destruction of wetlands, natural
habitats and watersheds. <p>



Oddly it was the Left of the political spectrum, back in the salad days
of post-war prosperity when growth and progress seemed the same thing, who
championed major water works. Everyone from US New Dealers to Soviet Communists
encouraged job-creating public works that would modernize for the benefit
of all. The autocratic structures and dis-economies of scale such projects
demanded are now being rethought by new generations of radicals with a greener,
more decentralist outlook. This is the core of the counter movement that
so worries the International Commission of Large Dams and its fellow-travellers.
And well they should worry. The dam-building era in the industrial North
has largely ground to a halt because of the potent alliance of anti-dam
activists. In the South the World Bank has been pressured to withdraw from
several large but dubious projects on the Indian sub-continent. Both Thailand
and Bangladesh have witnessed victories over major river engineering schemes.
<p>

A big issue for all these campaigns is waste. Not only are we destroying
the beauty and integrity of our great rivers but we are turning renewable
resources into non-renewable ones. It is a characteristic of any predatory
economy to 'mine' such resources, thus destroying their potential for infinite
renewal. The scarcity of good fresh water, mostly drawn from rivers, is
a classic example. Modern hydraulic systems lose masses of this water to
evaporation from reservoirs and cement diversion canals. Less than 40 per
cent of  the water that finally gets taken for irrigation actually reaches
the roots of plants. Industrial and municipal water is wasted at similarly
startling rates. Expensive hydro-generated electricity (rivalling nuclear
power in costs) is often in oversupply and is underpriced especially to
industrial users. There is so much waste here that there is a consensus
amongst energy economists that the best new source of power is conservation.
All the best hydro-dam sites have now been used up so new hydro-electricity
is likely to become even more costly. <p>

Water scarcity is also beginning to provoke tensions between riverine nation-states
over who gets to use what amount of river water. This is being played out
from the River Jordan (Israel vs Jordan and Syria) to the River Ganges (India
vs Bangladesh). But it is the Turkish plans for mega-engineering on the
upper (Kurdish) reaches of the Euphrates that may be the most explosive.
Downstream, arid Syria and Iraq have been dependent on its flow for irrigation
and drinking water since biblical days. It may be that water rather than
oil will be responsible the next time the troops mass at a mid-east border.
	<BR>
<h4>Conserving the river</h4>
The case for a new approach that respects river ecology will only be convincing
if it is accompanied by a vision that allows for a transition to sustainable
human use. Major existing river dams are unlikely to be abandoned even then
- although their capacity will gradually be reduced with the inevitable
build-up of silt in their reservoirs. Appropriate and intermediate technologies
are at hand both to generate electricity and use river water in a more ecologically
sound fashion. Run-of-the-river dams that do not impede flow have worked
for a longtime in Western China and could have an even brighter future if
new progress is made in technologies to store electrical power in cells
(rather than storing water in reservoirs). There are also the usual cheaper
power alternatives of sun, steam and wind that are badly underutilized.
Radical conservation could also reduce demand for water to sustainable levels.<p>



The highly water-conscious (some would say water-grabbing) Israelis lead
the way here with drip irrigation systems that use a fraction of what waterlogs
the soil elsewhere. Most farmers, particularly those in the South, practice
irrigation in the informal sector using a variety of micro-dams, rainwater
harvesting and low-cost pumps. Despite the millions poured into industrialized
diversion of riverwater for irrigation this informal sector remains much
more resource-efficient. With proper public sector support and advice these
methods could be fine-tuned and extended, reducing the mounting pressure
on river flows.  <p>

But there can be no question of going back to some pre-industrial utopia
of pristine riverbanks and absolutely pure water. While it is crucial to
keep some wilderness stretches of riverbank flourishing, far too many people
live beside rivers and depend on them for their livelihoods. And the human
spirit also needs those precious flows - who can imagine Florence without
the Arno, Paris without the Seine or Khartoum without the Nile? The way
some cities have dealt with their rivers gives hope that the rivers and
large numbers of people can prosper together. A well-used and relatively
clean river can centre a city and bring life with walkways, handsome bridges,
accessible quays and green spaces. Intelligent use of rivers by avoiding
over-engineering or burying their waters under cement can allow a city to
breathe - the way that Rome does but Los Angeles doesn't. In a traffic-clogged
metropolis like Bangkok travelling by passenger-launch on the Chao Phraya
is both more efficient and far more pleasant than sitting for hours bumper-to-bumper.
Painters from Caneletto to Pizzaro to Turner have brought city rivers and
their bridges to life in their work. There seems to be no equivalent school
of hydro-dam painters.<p>

Despite its impressive growth the odds remain long that the movement in
defense of rivers will be able to reverse the substantial momentum of hydrological
society. Fundamental interests are at stake and it will take a great deal
to shake them. Ultimately the fate of our rivers rests on our ability to
turn around a predatory economy and the wasteful patterns of consumption
that it sustains. A civilization that prizes thirsty golf-courses and cotton
crops in the desert over wetlands and clean drinking water simply cannot
last. There is, after all, little left of the great riverworks of earlier
hydraulic societies. Will aliens visiting our planet a thousand years from
now find our only monuments to be silted-over dams that relentless rivers
have turned into magnificent waterfalls? T S Eliot had it that: 'I do not
know much about gods; but I think that the river is a strong brown god -
sullen, untamed and intractable.' As the farmers who settled too close to
the Mississippi learned at their cost - the river always wins.<p>

<b><li>The Future of Community Lands<br>
Human Resources</b><br> 
<i>Emmanuel Ndione, Philippe De Leener, Mamadou Ndiaye, Pierre Jacolin and Jean-Pierre Perier</i><br>
This book traces the history of relationships between external
agents and the local people.  It seeks simply to indicate a
number of methodological points of reference which might serve
as beacons for anyone entering into a contractual relationship
with rural people.<p>


Taking experiences in the community lands of francophone West
Africa as examples, the book aims to help development agents take
better account of the experience and thinking of farmers, not by
providing ready-made answers but rather by suggesting new
approaches. It demonstrates that it is up to the fieldworker to
support local people in creating the right conditions for
effective action, facilitating the farmers' own research, action
and learning.<br>

<b><li>Africa and the Africa Bibliography</b><br>
The Africa Bibliography has been published annually since 1985 and has established itself as an authoritative guide to the previous year's publications relating to African studies. Covering the whole of Africa and including works in many languages, the Bibliography regularly contains well over 5000 entries, categorised by region, country and discipline. Full author and subject indexes add to its value as an important work of reference. It can be bought as part of a subscription to Africa, or as a separate volume.<br><br><br>

<b><li>History and Underdevelopment in Morocco<br>
The Structural Roots of Conjuncture</b><br>
<i>Benson Akutse Mojuetan</i><br>
History and Underdevelopment in Morocco is a wide-ranging interpretation of the history of Morocco. Drawing not only on the relevant literature of the Maghrib, but also on the more extensive literature on ~pre-capitalist formations' elsewhere, the author attempts to link the ~micro-history' of Morocco with the ~macro-history' of Europe and the Middle East. Covering the mediaeval period through to the present, and using a Marxist approach, he seeks to explain the roots of Moroccan underdevelopment in terms of Morocco's internal and external relations. It is a worthwhile contribution to understanding of Moroccan history and serious analysis of some crucial issues in the theory of historical change.

<b><li>Savannah Nomads<br>
A Study of the Wodaabe Pastoral Fulani of Western Bornu Province Northern Region, Nigeria</b><br>
<i>Derrick J. Stenning [reprinted with a new introduction by Philip Burnham]</i><br>
This account of the Nomadic pastoral Fulani of Bornu, Northern Nigeria, begins with a brief historical sketch of the ancient kingdom of Bornu and its vicissitudes, of the Holy War of the nineteenth century and its repercussions on the Fulani pastoralists themselves. There follows a detailed analysis of the family structure of the pastoralists (or Wodaabe), their organization into lineage groups, their forms of marriage and of inheritance, the status and functions of leaders in the lineage group and the cattle camps, and the central place in the whole structure occupied by the herds. Part II is concerned with changes in the traditional structure and way of life consequent on the British administration, in particular the effects of the introduction of village headships and of new methods of taxation. A concluding chapter describes current plans for improving the general economy of the pastoralists, by developing various modifications of their methods of agricultural and animal husbandry, and by establishing forms of settlement.

<b><li>Land, Labour and Diet in Northern Rhodesia<br>
An Economic Study of the Bemba Tribe</b><br>
<i>Audrey I. Richards [with a new introduction by Henrietta Moore</i><br>
In this study Dr Audrey Richards describes the living conditions of the Bemba of North-Eastern Rhodesia, with special reference to the effects of migrant labour on the social and economic life of a mainly agricultural society. Although primarily concerned with the production, distribution, and consumption of food, and with conditions of labour and standards of living, the book gives a vivid picture of the social structure of the Bemba - their political organisation and the functions of the chief, systems of land-tenure, kinship groupings, and the whole complex of economic, social, and magico-religious factors which arise in any community.

<p>The book has been widely recognised as an authoritative study particularly among economists and anthropologists. 

<p>Audrey Richards (1899-1984) studied under Malinowski at the London School of Economics before teaching at Cambridge for many years.<br>

<b><li>Peoples of the Horn of Africa<br>
Somali, Afar and Saho</b><br>
<i>IM Lewis [new edition with supplementary appendices]</i><br>
The disintegration of the Somali Republic in the internal conflicts of the 1990s has added to the demand for this book, out of print for several years. First published in the Ethnographic Survey of Africa series, this new edition departs from previous editions (the first in 1955 and the revised edition of 1969) in including a report on the population, social organisation, and land holding situation in the Inter-Riverine Area of southern Somalia which was written for FAO in 1964 (Appendices I, II and III). This new material is based on the author's field research carried out in the region in 1957, 1962 and 1964. Although much has happened in Somalia since then, the groups described are still the main protagonists in the region and this account of their relationships and patterns of land use may help in planning the region's reconstruction when conditions permit. 

<p>IM Lewis has been Professor of Anthropology at the London School of Economics since 1969.<br>

<b><li>A Handbook of Tswana Law and Custom<br>
Compiled for the Bechuanaland Protectorate Administration</b><br>
<i>Isaac Schapera [reprinted with a new introduction by Simon Roberts]</i><br>
When Professor Schapera was asked in 1934 by the Protectorate Administration to compile a record of the traditional and modern laws of the Tswana tribes he had already been working since 1929 on a comprehensive ethnographic study of the Kgatla, and his investigation was therefore based on a thorough previous knowledge of the social structure as a whole. The author gives a picture of what Tswana law was like in former times, and shows that, contrary to expectation, modern European contact and the administration of tribes by the then Protectorate Governemtn ende the original uniformity of the system, and created considerable diversity. Schapera conscientiously kept within the original mandate of the Administration and produced and authoritative, straightforward compilation. Despite its modest title it has deservedly become a classic and far exceeds its primary object, which was to serve as a handbook for the information and guidance of governmentofficials and administrators of the law. This is a reprint of the first edition published in 1938. 

<p>Isaac Schapera is Emeritus Professor of Anthropology at the London School of Economics and Political Science. He has published widely, particularly on the subject of the Tswana.<br>

<b><li>Rainforest Relations<br>
Gender and Resource Use among the Mende of Gola, Sierra Leone</b><br> 
<i>Melissa Leach</i><br>
With environmental change and conservation in West Africa's tropical rainforests becoming topics of increasing political and academic attention, Rainforest Relations brings a fresh set of perspectives to the debate: those of the forest dwellers themselves.

<p>Based on detailed research in the Mende communities around Gola North Forest Reserve in Sierra Leone, this innovative book examines the different relationships women and men have with their environment. Surveying the recent debates and literature concerning forest conservation in this area, as well as current analytical approaches to gender and the environment, Melissa Leach examines the importance of rainforest resources to the local economy and social relations, and shows that neither an understanding of forest use and change, nor adequate conservation policies, can be achieved without a concern for gender.

<b><li>Ranching and Enterprise in Eastern Botswana<br>
 A Case Study of Black and White Farmers</b><br>
<i>Isaac Ncube Mazonde</i><br>
Botswana's economic development has been extraordinary in Third World terms, yet little is known about how different social groups have adapted to the new economic opportunities. This comprehensive account studies a key group of the new entrepreneurs: the ranchers. It describes their changing life styles, their construction of personal and social space, and the way they have adapted to state-initiated political and economic change, showing through a series of case studies how ranching has grown from being the preserve of white settlers to include Botswana and other African farmers as well. The relationship between ranching and communal land tenure, and the effect of Botswana's Tribal Land Grazing Policy are analysed in detail, while the careers of non-elites, the practice of bordermanship, labour relations and the management of multiple enterprises and risks are also covered. This book will appeal to Africanists, development planners, historians and anthropologists.

<b><li>Strangers and Traders<br>
Yoruba Migrants, Markets and the State in Northern Ghana</b><br> 
<i>J S Eades</i><br>
In the inter-war years, groups of enterprising Yoruba traders from a few towns in Western Nigeria established a remarkably successful trading network throughout the Gold Coast (Ghana). Using information, skills and capital generated mainly within the family, what grew to become the largest group of immigrant traders in the country had spread to even the most remote areas, becoming a powerful force in the Ghanaian markets. Then, in 1969, they were abruptly ordered to leave the country. 

<p>At the time of the exodus, Jerry Eades was carrying out research on the Yoruba and was able to follow these traders back to Nigeria. There, on the basis of extensive interviews and archival sources, he reconstructed the history of the migration from four Yoruba towns to northern Ghana. The result is one of the fullest and most detailed accounts of chain migration and its implications for economic development ever written - of interest not only to anthropologists and historians, but more generally to anyone with an interest in trade and informal sector labour markets, and their relationship to ethnicity, economic development and state policies in Third World countries. 

<p>J S Eades is Senior Lecturer in Social Anthropology at the University of Kent, currently teaching as an Associate Professor in the Department of Cultural Anthropology at the University of Tokyo.<br>

<b><li>Black Mountain<br>
Land, Class and Power in the Eastern Orange Free State, 1880s to 1990s</b><br>
<i>Colin Murray</i><br>
Black Mountain is a chronicle of the struggles of many of the people - black and white - whose lives have been rooted in one district of the South African highveld over the last hundred years. Thaba Nchu (Black Mountain) was the territory of an independent African chiefdom until it was annexed by the Orange Free State Republic in 1884. By 1977, one third of the original territory had emerged as part of ~independent' Bophuthatswana, giving rise to acute inter-ethnic antagonisms. As a result, on an adjoining piece of bare veld, there sprang up the largest rural slum in South Africa, Botshabelo - a massive concentration of poverty and unemployment. The stories told by inhabitants of the slum in 1980 led Colin Murray to ask the questions that ultimately shaped this book.

<p>Black Mountain is a vast and complex jigsaw' assembled out of many disparate parts. The author complements detailed archival evidence with contemporary oral history. In its rigorously limited focus on the experience of one district, the book illuminates all the important themes of the political economy of the rural highveld of South Africa from the mineral revolution of the late nineteenth century to the erosion of apartheid in the late twentieth century.

<p>Colin Murray is an anthropologist who teaches in the field of development studies. He is Director of the Centre of African Studies at the University of Liverpool.<br>

<b><li>Urban Poverty and the Environment in the South Pacific</b><br>
<i>Jenny Bryant</i><br>
This book examines urban poverty issues and the changing nature of the urban environment in the South Pacific.  The author begins by discussing the nature of the relationship between poverty and the environment, and between development and sustainability objectives within the South Pacific in general, and places the urban issue within a broader context.  <p>

The discussion examines both the objectives of economic development
and "new" development institutions such as NGOs and community based organizations.  The book focuses mainly on "...the linkages between changing environments and increasing poverty in the urban centres of the South Pacific nations" (page 5) with a bias away from Papua New Guinea and towards the smaller islands.<p>

The main text starts with an introductory chapter on changing environmental management and urbanization trends in the South Pacific.  In the second half of this chapter, the author considers definitions of poverty and measures of poverty within the localities being
considered.  The following chapter examines a number of aspects of the urban environment including waste disposal and water supply facilities, solid and industrial waste disposal, hazardous wastes and atmospheric pollution, and impacts on health.  <p>

Separate sections consider economic strategies relevant to the environment, the specific role of the South Pacific Regional Environment Programme and environmental legislation and management. <p>

Chapter four focuses on urban poverty and examines the scale of poverty in the South Pacific, and related factors such as health, education and economic change; poverty issues related to the urban habitat are considered separately.  The chapter ends with a discussion
on policy related issues including the role of government and poverty alleviation strategies.<p>
 
Chapter five consists of a case study on poverty and urban environments in Fiji, and the final chapter considers "positive approaches" to the problems associated with urban poverty and environmental degradation.<p>

  The author concludes that, while the problems are complex
"...there are .... countless ways of improving the lot of the poor, but only if there is the political will , and only if the poor have the opportunities and capacity to participate" (page 94).

<b><li>The Latin American City</b><br>
<i>Alan Gilbert</i><br>
This book consists of eight chapters, each considering different aspects of the Latin American city.  Chapter one presents short descriptions of Bogot , Caracas, Guadalajara, Rio de Janeiro and La Paz to highlight the diversity of Latin American cities but also to point to commonalities - for instance the common language (except for Brazil) and cultural roots laid
during almost 300 years of rule by Spain and Portugal.  Chapter two describes the growth of the Latin American city from its pre-Columbian and colonial heritage to the present.  This includes the rapid expansion from the 1930s or 1940s to around 1980 that coincided with
large increases in national populations, sustained economic growth and industrial development, and the slower growth in the 1980s with stagnant economies and falling birth
 <p>
Chapter three describes "the move to the city", including what fuelled rural to urban migration, the different forms it takes (and how these have changed over time), and the impact of the economic recession of the 1980s.<p>

Chapter four reviews employment and work, especially
the changes evident in the 1980s.  Special attention is also given to the situation of women
and to child labour.<p>
 
Chapter five, on housing strategies, describes the major changes in recent decades including the large increases in the proportion of people living in owner-occupied dwellings (even if most developed illegally) and the large expansion of city areas. <p>

Chapter six, on urban management, notes that often too much emphasis is given to "horror stories" and that, in general, infrastructure and service provision have expanded greatly. It also gives examples of how poorer groups are generally the worst served.  <p>

There are sub-sections on transport, pollution and disasters.  The current fashion for privatization of services is also critically
reviewed. Chapter seven describes the different protests that have taken place and discusses why protest in the form of conflict has not been more common,  given the scale of poverty and inequality.  It also describes different measures by which governments have dampened
protest - including repression, clientalism and the cooption of leaders.<p>

Chapter eight considers what the author suggests are the rather poor prospects for "The Future of the City."  He notes that "...in general, Latin America's cities face a much more optimistic future than do cities in most parts of Africa or those in many parts of Asia.  But much depends on the rate of economic growth, without which it is difficult to improve most
people's lives, and much on better and fairer government" (page 169).   In each chapter, boxes are used to give examples - for instance in the chapter on urban protest are there are boxes on a description of Superbarrio in Mexico City, a portrait of a community leader in Bogota, a description of the protest in Caracas in February 1989, and "How to fend off
protest; the Solidarity Programme in Mexico".

<b><li>El Futuro de la Capital<br> 
(The Future of Bogota, Colombia's Capital City)</b><br>
<i>Various authors</i><br>
These are the first four published volumes to have come out of a two-year programme involving Colombian specialists in a major research exercise designed to provide "a vision of the desirable future for Colombia's capital city for the first decade of the twenty-first century."  More publications are planned, but nearly 30 are already available in unpublished
form covering five major areas of the city's present and future development: social and economic issues; housing, infrastructure, utilities and social services; physical development and the environment; local government; and culture.<p>

The studies were prepared by specialist teams and their conclusions were discussed at public meetings with government officials and non-governmental organizations.  The four volumes have a common format and range in length from 110 to 210 pages.  In all cases, past and future population trends, and spatially and socially disaggregated data on income and employment are used as the basis to understand the present situation and to forecast developments to the year 2010.  The studies include a diagnosis of the key issues relating to
the sector, present institutional arrangements, possible future scenarios, and concrete proposals for implementation by present and future administrations.  The conclusions suggest that multi-disciplinary approaches are the more effective way of dealing with such issues.<p>

Particular attention is given to existing social inequalities.  Although the city's inhabitants have benefited from very real improvements in living standards since population growth peaked in the early 1970s, in 1985 nearly 15 per cent of the city's households still lived in overcrowded conditions, and 6.5 per cent lacked connection to one or more of three basic services: drinking water, sewage, or electricity.  A UNICEF-UNDP funded study, in
the same year, found that the basic needs of 23 per cent of the population were still unmet.<p>

Although run independently as a non-profit organization, until December 1992, Mision Siglo XXI had the financial backing of the mayor's office and the results of these studies were to have been incorporated in a medium-term metropolitan development plan.  If maintained, this scheme would have allowed the staff of the Mision to regularly monitor changes in some key areas of the city's development.  Such a scheme did not materialize,
but the city's future mayors and, indeed, its citizens, now have a set of documents which should help them identify the most pressing issues in building a more desirable future for the city. <br>

<b><li>Nairobi's Informal Settlements: an inventory</b><br>
<i>by Matrix Development Consultants</i><br>
This report aims to "...provide accurate information on the location and characteristics of informal settlements in Nairobi... to be used as a basis for formulating policies and strategies for the city... in particular for informal settlements."  The settlements were grouped into seven areas corresponding to the city's administrative divisions and, using aerial
photography, ground visits and a literature survey, information was gathered for each division and is presented in this inventory.<p>


The first section introduces the objective, organization of the report and the methodology, followed by a short overview of the city of Nairobi.  This is followed by a definition of "informal settlements" and an analysis of various characteristics including: population growth; economic survival including income levels and generation; the provision of basic urban services including water supply, sanitation, drainage and garbage collection; education; and the implications for health of life in the informal settlements.<p>

The next section is the actual inventory.  For each of the seven divisions information is given on the following: location and history; population; housing conditions; infrastructure and services including water, sanitation, electricity, refuse disposal; access roads and transportation; health, education, church and social facilities; economic activities and sources of income; and community based organizations and NGOs which operate in the area.<p>

Annex one gives a list of references; annex two outlines the aerial photography and mapping procedure, and explains how population estimates were arrived at; and annex three gives a long list of voluntary organizations which operate in Nairobi, and includes details of the activities they undertake.  A final section consists of a map showing all informalsettlements in Nairobi, and larger scale maps of five typical settlements with greater detail.<br>

<b><li>Towards a Sustainable Urban Environment: the Rio de Janeiro Study</b><br>
<i>Edited by; Alcira Kreimer, Thereza Lobo, Braz Menezes, Mohan Munasinghe and Ronald Parker</i><br>
This study provides a broad and detailed description of environmental problems and their underlying causes in Rio de Janeiro.  It is one of a series of studies of metropolitan areas in Brazil, Turkey and the Philippines being undertaken by the World Bank, the United
Nations Development Programme and the United Nations Centre for Human Settlements (Habitat); and is based on ten papers that were presented at a seminar in November 1992 organized by the Brazilian Institute for Municipal Administration.  The papers are presented
in four sections. <p>
 
Section I has an introductory paper that summarizes the most serious environmental problems in Rio de Janeiro and their underlying causes - and why the different levels of government have been unable to address these problems. This includes a description of environmental change within the wider region and of the historic roots of contemporary
social and environmental problems.  Section II, entitled "the conceptual framework", consists of two papers.  The first describes how Rio de Janeiro's real comparative advantages are its natural beauty and its potential for higher living standards, at a lower cost than other
Brazilian cities.  It also describes how public policy has failed to protect and promote these comparative advantages.  The second paper describes the concepts and tools used in coastal zone management and their use within the metropolitan region.<p>
  
Section III consists of four papers which consider different aspects of the institutional and financial framework.  The first describes the legal and institutional framework for environmental policy and the inadequacy of its implementation.  The second paper describes the development of the institutional framework for urban policy and some of its past and
current failings.  The third reviews government financing and expenditure on the environment in Brazil and Rio de Janeiro.  The fourth paper reviews recent research on urban environmental issues undertaken in Rio de Janeiro.  Section IV has three papers on "operational experience and technological issues".  The first describes the initial two years
of the "Rio reconstruction project" that was a response to the floods and landslides in 1988.<p>
 
The second describes how the relationship developed between the World Bank and the different government institutions in Brazil for World Bank funded work in Rio.  The final paper considers the issue of appropriate technologies for urban services in Rio de Janeiro. The report includes text boxes throughout, covering such subjects as the views of
NGOs, the basic sanitation programme for Guanabara Bay and an overview of emergency planning in industrial installations.<br>

<b><li>The Struggle for Nairobi</b><br>
<i>Terry Hirst assisted by Davinder Lamba</i><br>
This is a large format book that tells the history of Nairobi and its population and the city's changing relationship with its wider environment, in words and pictures in the form of a
"documentary comic book."  Although the information is presented, as illustrated above, in the form of a comic book,  it contains a level of detail and analysis both on the city's history and on its contemporary problems and underlying causes that will surprise many readers, including those who are familiar with Nairobi.  <p>

The text includes many maps that show how Nairobi developed over time - starting with maps showing the geological and ecological context and moving onto different maps showing how the city developed 1899-1905, 1906-1926, 1927-46, the 1948 masterplan, 1964-1983 and what the city is like in the early 1990s.<p>
 
Its coverage extends up to the Nairobi City Convention organized in July 1993, attended by 800 people, which was the first public consultation on Nairobi's future.  It was initiated by the former Mayor, Steve Mwangi and a committee of Nairobi citizens.

<h2>Channel Africa to close</h2>

Channel Africa, South Africa's external shortwave broadcaster under threat of closure by the government, has launched a national and international campaign for its continuance with the backing of SABC management, staff and unions. <p>

At a special meeting held on June 6th to address the concerns of staff, Mr Govin Reddy, Radio Chief Executive, pledged the SABC's support for the campaign. The overwhelming majority of staff favoured the continuation of the station and also gave their backing to the campaign as Channel Africa was viewed as a national asset. One staffer said it was ironical that just when South Africa needed a voice on the airwaves in Africa and the world there were moves to silence Channel Africa.<p>

At present the station broadcasts in three Southern African languages (Chinyanja, Silozi and Xitsonga), one East African language (Kiswahili), as well as in English, French and Portuguese.<p>

The service was first established in 1966 as Radio RSA but repositioned itself as Channel Africa in 1992 and then embarked on  a transformation process which resulted in a  new mission statement which pledged to make the station &quot;a comprehensive and authentically African communications forum which serves Africa from Africa, is totally objective and credible and reliable, is dedicated to the promotion of positive development in Africa, is committed to the enhancement of dialogue, understanding and co-operation between all African people as their 'Channel of Goodwill'...&quot'.<p>

With more than 15 million regular listeners, Channel Africa is also extremely cost effective. According to recent estimates the station is able to broadcast at less then half a cent a day per listener.<p>


The Commonwealth Broadcasting Association notes with concern the announcement of plans to close the external service of SABC, Channel Africa, and has pledged support to the SABC to keep the station open. As the CBA Secretary-General, Elizabeth Smith, put it:<p>
<ul>
&quot;This would be a major loss to its regular audience of 15 million listeners. South Africa could not have a more cost-effective means of reaching and influencing its neighbours. It seems extraordinary that at a time when other African countries are looking to South Africa for leadership that a voice of this kind should be silenced.&quot;</ul><p>

All local support for the campaign should be faxed to Channel Africa (011) 714-2546 or 674-4325. International support to (+2711) 714-2546 or 674-4325.<p>

<a name=vor></a><h3>Entwicklungsl&auml;nder: Keine Partner f&uuml;r &Ouml;sterreichs Forschung?</h3>

<P>

Die weltpolitischen und weltwirtschaftlichen Ver&auml;nderungen,

der Beitritt &Ouml;sterreichs zur Europ&auml;ischen Union, die

technologischen Entwicklungen und das zunehmende Bewu&szlig;tsein

vom globalen Charakter vieler Probleme haben neue Rahmenbedingungen

geschaffen, die ad&auml;quate Konsequenzen in der Forschung ebenso

wie in der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit erfordern.

<P>

Die Arbeitstagung wird sich mit der Analyse der derzeitigen Situation

der &ouml;sterreichischen Forschung mit Partnern in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

und den gegebenen Defiziten und Barrieren befassen. Davon ausgehend,

sollen konkrete inhaltliche, organisatorische und finanzielle

Voraussetzung sowie Kriterien f&uuml;r die Verbesserung der Zusammenarbeit,

auch im Rahmen von EU-Projekten, definiert werden.

<P>

Ziel dieser Arbeitstagung, die sich vor allem auch als Teil der

inner&ouml;sterreichischen Vorbereitung auf die vom 11. bis 14.

September 1996 in Wien stattfindende VIII. EADI Generalkonferenz

versteht, ist die Ausarbeitung von umsetzbaren Empfehlungen f&uuml;r

ein tragf&auml;higes Fundament eines immer wichtiger werdenden

Bereichs - in der Forschungspolitik ebenso wie in der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.

<a name=glo></a><h3>Globalisierung, Interdisziplinearit&auml;t, supranationale Zusammenarbeit: Neue Herausforderungen f&uuml;r die Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik</h3>

<I>Erfahrungen aus den Niederlanden</I>

<P>

<B>Brigitte M. Holzner</B>

<P>

Die K&uuml;rze der mir vorgegebenen Zeit erm&ouml;glicht es nicht,

auf die umfassenden Themen der Globalisierung, Interdisziplinearit&auml;t

und supranationalen Zusammenarbeit ausf&uuml;hrlich einzugehen.

Hingegen werde ich einige Themen dieser drei Bereiche nennen,

die f&uuml;r den Kontext der Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik

relevant sind. Der Schwerpunkt meines Referates liegt auf den

Erfahrungen in den Niederlanden, wobei ich mich auf die Institutionen

konzentrieren werde, die den Ausf&uuml;hrungsrahmen der Forschungs-

und Entwicklungspolitik gestalten. Am Schlu&szlig; werde ich auf

einige Perspektiven f&uuml;r &Ouml;sterreich eingehen, wie sie

mir aufgrund meiner 14-j&auml;hrigen Erfahrung in verschiedenen

T&auml;tigkeiten der Forschungs- und Entwicklungspraxis innerhalb

niederl&auml;ndischer Institutionen (staatliche und nichtstaatliche,

Universit&auml;ten) wichtig erscheinen. 

<P>

<B>Globalisierung, Interdisziplinearit&auml;t, supranationale

Zusammenarbeit</B>

<P>

Das Schlagwort der Globalisierung versucht seit dem Fall des 'Eisernen

Vorhangs' und der rapiden Verbreitung der elektronischen Informationsvermittlung,

die &ouml;konomische und politische Entwicklung der Gegenwart

zu erfassen. Mit einiger Skepsis kann man sich fragen, ob 'Globalisierung'

erst in den neunziger Jahren dieses Jahrhunderts auftritt, oder

nicht schon ein jahrtausendealtes Ph&auml;nomen ist. Aus historischer

Sicht sind die Verbreitung des Bew&auml;sserungsreisbaus vor 2000

Jahren oder die Islamisierung beginnend im 8. Jahrhundert auch

globale Prozesse. 

<P>

Die Entwicklung globaler M&auml;rkte jedoch ist ein unwidersprochenes

Ph&auml;nomen der letzten zehn bis 20 Jahre. Transnationale Betriebe

freuen sich auf die 400 Millionen potentiellen Konsumenten in

der ehemaligen Einflu&szlig;sph&auml;re der Sowjetunion und auf

eine Milliarde Chinesen, die einen h&ouml;heren Lebensstil anstreben.

Parallel dazu ist Armut auch ein globales, wachsendes Problem

geworden. Ebenso ist die Rolle der Vereinten Nationen eine globale

geworden im Hinblick auf die brisanten Themen unserer Zeit, wie

sie auf den Mammutkonferenzen der UNO besprochen wurden (Umweltschutz,

Menschenrechte, Sozialpolitik, Frauenpolitik, Habitat). Jedoch

bestehen neben der Globalisierung von Markt und Politik auch starke

Tendenzen zu einer Regionalisierung, um Einseitigkeiten entgegenwirken

zu k&ouml;nnen und eine regionale Hegemonie in &ouml;konomischer

und politischer Sicht bewahren oder schaffen zu k&ouml;nnen. Die

St&auml;rkung der Europ&auml;ischen Union ist ja auch eine regionale

Antwort auf globalisierende Kr&auml;fte.

<P>

Einige aktuelle globale Themen f&uuml;r Forschung und Entwicklung

liegen in den Bereichen der neuen Arbeitsbeziehungen und Akkumulationsstrategien,

der Konfliktforschung, sozialen Entwicklung und des Umweltschutzes.

Diese Themen k&ouml;nnen nur interdisziplin&auml;r erforscht werden,

wie auch deren Praxis (in der Entwicklungspolitik wie in der nationalen

und regional &uuml;bergreifenden Politik) einen <I>interdisziplin&auml;ren</I><B>

</B>Ansatz verlangt. Am Thema Umweltschutz wird deutlich, da&szlig;

nur das Zusammenspiel von technischen Disziplinen, &Ouml;konomie

und Sozialwissenschaften die Analyse und L&ouml;sung von Problemen

erm&ouml;glicht. 

<P>

Die supranationale Zusammenarbeit der Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik

findet gro&szlig;teils auf den Universit&auml;ten und Forschungsinstituten

statt; allerdings spielen auch NGOs und Regierungsorganisationen

eine gro&szlig;e Rolle: die letzteren bei der Wahl der Forschungsthemen,

die ersteren in der Ausf&uuml;hrung. Manche NGOs favorisieren

Handlungsforschung (<I>action-oriented research</I>), teils aus

ideologischen, teils aus praktischen Gr&uuml;nden, und kombinieren

dabei sozialwissenschaftliche und techno-logische Ans&auml;tze.

<P>

Neben den interdisziplin&auml;ren und supranationalen Bedingungen

in der Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik sind folgende Ver&auml;nderungen

auf einer internationalen Konferenz signalisiert worden:

<P>

<ul>

<li>von 'reiner' Forschung zum Ausbau von Forschungskapazit&auml;ten

<P>

<li>von kurz- und mittelfristigen zu langfristigen F&ouml;rderungsprogrammen

<P>

<li>von Unterst&uuml;tzung von Projekten zur Unterst&uuml;tzung

von Programmen und Sektoren

<P>

<li>von institutioneller Unterst&uuml;tzung zur Unterst&uuml;tzung

von spezifischen Forschungsgruppen.</ul>

<P>

Diesen Ver&auml;nderungen liegen &Uuml;berlegungen zur Wirtschaftlichkeit

und Nachhaltigkeit zugrunde, die die Finanzierungsprobleme in

den Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern, aber auch die K&uuml;rzungen in

den Entwicklungsbudgets bei den Donoren widerspiegeln.

<P>

<b>Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik in den Niederlanden</b>

<P>

Die Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik in den Niederlanden basiert

auf drei Pfeilern:

<P>

<ol>

<li>auf der Entwicklung von einigen wissenschaftlichen <I>Disziplinen</I><B>

</B>(zum Beispiel Ethnologie, Nicht-Westliche Soziologie, tropische

Forstwirtschaft), Bibliotheken, Archiven und Museen;

<P>

<li>auf einer starken <I>Dritte-Welt-Bewegung</I><B> </B>mit unz&auml;hligen

Solidarit&auml;tsgruppen, die eine starke Bewu&szlig;tseinsbildung

der Bev&ouml;lkerung reflektieren und weiter ausbauen;

<P>

<li>auf einer weitgehenden <I>Institutionalisierung</I>.</ol>

<P>

Die jahrzehntelange Tradition von einigen wissenschaftlichen Disziplinen

und das 'expansive' Bewu&szlig;tsein weiter Bev&ouml;lkerungskreise

h&auml;ngen - meiner Meinung nach - sehr mit dem holl&auml;ndischen

Kolonialismus zusammen, der auch die Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik

gepr&auml;gt hat und noch immer pr&auml;gt und zu einer breiten

Struktur von Institutionen gef&uuml;hrt hat. Diese Tradition kann

zwar die Ursache f&uuml;r diese weitgehende Institutionalisierung

sein, aber die Kolonialerfahrung braucht nicht als Bedingung gesehen

zu werden, um gute Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik zu machen.

Die eingangs genannten globalen, interdisziplin&auml;ren Themen

sind auch ohne Imperialismusgeschichte in &Uuml;bersee zu analysieren.

<P>

<b>Institutionalisierung</b>

<P>

Die folgenden Institutionen sind die S&auml;ulen der Forschungs-

und Entwicklungspolitik in den Niederlanden: 

<P>

a) Ministerium f&uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit ( = Direktorat

General im Au&szlig;enministerium; abgek&uuml;rzt DGIS)

<P>

b) Ministerium f&uuml;r Unterricht, Kultur und Wissenschaft

<P>

c) Nicht-Regierungsinstitutionen (NGOs) 

<P>

d) Consultancyb&uuml;ros und -betriebe 

<P>

Das Personal all dieser Institutionen wird an den Universit&auml;ten

ausgebildet und wechselt sp&auml;ter oft von einer dieser Institution

in die andere (zum Beispiel von einer NGO ins Ministerium). Da

die universit&auml;re Ausbildung meistens Praktika in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

verlangt, werden Studenten schon fr&uuml;h mit der Realit&auml;t

und den Problemen von Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern konfrontiert.

<P>

<I>ad a) Ministerium f&uuml;r Internationale Zusammenarbeit</I>

<P>

Die Regierungspolitik wurde unter dem jetzigen Minister Jan Pronk

in zwei umfassenden Dokumenten (&quot;A World in Difference&quot;

und &quot;A World in Dispute&quot;) dargelegt, an denen mehrere

Wissenschafter mitgearbeitet haben. Thematische Schwerpunkt-programme

sind Armutsbek&auml;mpfung, Frauen und Umwelt. Zu einer Reihe

von Themen, wie Kleinkredite oder Family Planning und reproduktive

Gesundheitsf&uuml;rsorge, wurden <I>policy papers </I>ausgearbeitet,

die dem Parlament vorgestellt wurden und als Richtlinien f&uuml;r

die niederl&auml;ndische Entwicklungspraxis dienen. Au&szlig;erdem

wurden DAC-Kriterien f&uuml;r gef&ouml;rderte L&auml;nder, vor

allem das Armutskriterium, festgelegt. 

<P>

Das Forschungs- und Entwicklungsprogramm von DGIS hat folgende

Schwerpunkte mit mehrj&auml;hrigen, multidisziplin&auml;ren <I>Forschungsprogrammen</I>:

Kleinindustrie, Energie-forschung, internationale &ouml;konomische

und strukturelle Fragen. Das Programm hat eine 'bottom-up', Nachfrage

orientierte Philosophie: Die Entwicklungsl&auml;nder m&uuml;ssen

selbst ihre Forschungsinteressen angeben. Dies hat jedoch zu einiger

Polemik an den holl&auml;ndischen Universit&auml;ten gef&uuml;hrt.

Weiters gibt es ein Programm f&uuml;r Interuniversit&auml;re Zusammenarbeit

(MHO), das von der NUFFIC administriert wird. Themen sind zum

Beispiel Farming Systems Research oder das Southeast Asian Plants

Inventory.

<P>

Folgende Institutionen werden vom Au&szlig;enministerium/DGIS

gef&ouml;rdert:

<P>

<ul>

<li><B>RAWOO </B>(Advisory Council for Scientific Development

Research): ber&auml;t den Minister; Vortragsserien, Publikationen

<P>

<li><B>NCDO </B>(National Commission for Development

Cooperation): Der Staat unterst&uuml;tzt die Zivilgesellschaft

durch Bewu&szlig;twerdungsaktivit&auml;ten (zum Beispiel Jungbauern,

Frauenbewegung, Gewerkschaften, Schulen, TV-Programme; Zeitschriften

'Onze Wereld', 'Internationale Samenwerking')

<P>

<li><B>NUFFIC<I> </I></B>(Netherlands Organisation

for International Cooperation in Higher Education): konzeptualisiert

und begleitet mit 180 Mitarbeitern die Programme zur internationalen

Bildungsf&ouml;rderung (Projekte, Stipendien).

<P>

<li><B>FMO<I> </I></B>(Netherlands Development Finance

Company): vergibt Investitionsgelder f&uuml;r Betriebe in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern,

wird teilweise vom Staat finanziert.</ul>

<P>

<I>ad b) Ministerium f&uuml;r Unterricht, Kultur und Wissenschaft</I>

<P>

An den 13 Universit&auml;ten<B> </B>werden Diplomstudien und zunehmend

internationale Programme (M.Sc., MBA, M.A. etc.) f&uuml;r inl&auml;ndische

und ausl&auml;ndische Studenten angeboten. Auch die Fachhochschulen

'internationalisieren' ihre Ausbildungsprogramme durch <I>Professional

Master</I> Kurse. In vielen Programmen sind Praktika in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

in der Ausbildung eingebaut, oft als Pflichtf&auml;cher. So wird

vom Fachbereich Methoden &amp; Techniken der Ethnologie/Nicht-Westlichen

Soziologie in Leiden erst ein Praktikum im Inland (mehrw&ouml;chige

Studien in einem Dorf), dann ein halbes Jahr im Ausland (Kreta,

Senegal oder Indonesien) vorgeschrieben.

<P>

Auf den <I>internationalen<B> </B>Markt</I> sind f&uuml;nf <I>Ausbildungsinstitutionen</I>

ausgerichtet:

<P>

<ul>

<li>Institute of Social Studies (ISS) in Den Haag, 

<P>

<li>International Institute for Aerospace Survey &amp; Earth Sciences

(ITC) in Enschede, 

<P>

<li>Institute for Housing and Urban Studies (IHS) in Rotterdam,

<P>

<li>Institute for Hydraulic and Environmental Engineering (IHE)

in Delft und die 

<P>

<li>Maastricht School of Management (MSM).</ul>

<P>

Seit einigen Jahren bestehen sogenannte <I>Forschungsschulen</I>

(Research Schools) f&uuml;r Promotionen , die interuniversit&auml;r

und interdisziplin&auml;r aufgebaut sind. Zwei Beispiele, die

f&uuml;r unser Thema besonders relevant sind, habe ich ausgew&auml;hlt:

<P>

<I>CERES Research School for Resource Studies for Development</I>,

wo interdisziplin&auml;r zwischen Agronomie, Sozial- und Geisteswissenschaften

zusammengearbeitet wird. Interdisziplin&auml;r zusammengesetzte

Forschungsgruppen sind beispielsweise: Natural Resource Management:

Social Insecurity and Cultural Coping; Knowledge, Technology,

Material Artefacts and Agroecological Development, State Formation

and Disintegration; Violence, Informality and Ethnicity; Culture,

Religion and Identity Formation.

<P>

<I>CNWS Research School for Asian, African and Amerindian Studies</I>,

die mit Literatur, Sozial- und Geisteswissenschaften zusammenarbeitet.

Beispiele f&uuml;r Forschungs-gruppen sind 'Recht und Gesellschaft';

'Geschichte der europ&auml;ischen Expansion und ihre Folgen';

'Kunst und materielle Kultur in der nicht-westlichen Welt'; 'Interkulturelle

Genderstudien'; 'Kultur und Entwicklung in Afrika'; 'Politische

und &ouml;konomische Ver&auml;nderungen und die Dynamik afrikanischer

Kulturen'.

<P>

Au&szlig;erhalb der Research Schools finanziert die Stiftung f&uuml;r

Niederl&auml;ndische Wissen-schaftliche Forschung (NWO) Promotionen

und Forschungsprojekte, zum Beispiel &uuml;ber Islamische Heilkunst

in Holland oder &uuml;ber Transformationsprozesse in Osteuropa.

Zuletzt erm&ouml;glicht die Stiftung Tropenforschung (WOTRO) Stipendien

f&uuml;r Themen, wie beispielsweise 'Arbeiterinnen in der Zigarettenindustrie

in Java'. Weiters finanziert die K&ouml;nigliche Akademie der

Wissenschaften (KNAW) interuniversit&auml;re, internationale Forschungszusammenarbeit.

<P>

<I>ad c) NGOs </I>

<P>

In den Niederlanden gibt es eine Reihe von NGOs, die angewandte

Forschung im Rahmen ihrer Entwicklungsprojekte betreiben, wobei

sie f&uuml;r spezialisierte Aufgaben kurzfristige Auftr&auml;ge

an Universit&auml;ten vergeben. Diese NGOs sind teilweise ideologisch

ausgerichtet und werden von DGIS und durch Spenden finanziert.

Die vier gro&szlig;en NGOs, sogenannte Kofinanzierungsinstitutionen,

sind NOVIB (sozialdemokratisch), HIVOS (humanistisch), ICCO (protestantisch)

und CEBEMO-BILANCE (katholisch). Weiters gibt es die &auml;u&szlig;erst

einflu&szlig;reiche SNV (Stichting Nederlandse Vrijwilligers),

eine Volont&auml;rorganisation, die mittlerweile sehr professionell

arbeitet. Schlie&szlig;lich ist noch das traditionsreiche KIT

(K&ouml;nigliches Tropeninstitut) zu nennen, das in Amsterdam

eine Reihe von Trainingsprogrammen anbietet und zudem Projekte

in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern unterh&auml;lt.

<P>

<I>ad d) Consultancyb&uuml;ros und -betriebe</I>

<P>

Schlie&szlig;lich geh&ouml;ren zu den Akteuren der internationalen

Zusammenarbeit noch die profit-orientierten Consultancyb&uuml;ros,

die von DGIS, der Europ&auml;ischen Union, UN-Organisationen,

World Bank, Development Banks usw. Auftr&auml;ge bekommen. Die

dort ausgef&uuml;hrte Forschung ist policy-orientiert; die Publikationen

bleiben meistens im 'grauen Sektor' h&auml;ngen und finden selten

den Weg in wissenschaftliche Zeitschriften.

<P>

<b>Basis der interuniversit&auml;ren, internationalen Zusammenarbeit

</b>

<P>

Die interuniversit&auml;re, internationale Forschungszusammenarbeit

basiert auf den

<P>

<ul>

<li>Netzwerken der Wissenschafter,

<P>

<li>Beziehungen aus der kolonialen und post-kolonialen Geschichte

(Studienkollegen, Bekanntschaften, Familien und Personen mit aus

ihrer Biographie erkl&auml;rbaren Motivationen),

<P>

<li>Alumni-Netzwerken (gef&ouml;rdert durch Auffrischungskurse,

Alumni-Zeitschriften: Praktikapl&auml;tze werden vergeben, lokale

Counterparts f&uuml;r Forschung, Lehre und Consultancy, Hilfe

bei der Suche nach Stipendien und Posten)

<P>

<li>regional spezialisierte Studienzentren (zum Beispiel Lateinamerika-,

Afrikastudienzentrum, Internationales Institut f&uuml;r Asienstudien).

<P>

<li>Forschungsschulen,

<P>

<li>Stipendienprogrammen.</ul>

<P>

Der Dreiheit Lehre, Forschung und gesellschaftliche Dienstleistung

wird auf diese Weise Kontinuit&auml;t garantiert.

<P>

<b>Perspektiven f&uuml;r &Ouml;sterreich</b>

<P>

Was w&auml;re der &quot;&Ouml;tzi&quot;, der ein Paradebeispiel

der supranationalen, interdisziplin&auml;ren Forschung ist, der

Entwicklungspolitik? Die &ouml;sterreichischen Perspektiven der

Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik k&ouml;nnten sich - nach meiner

Einsch&auml;tzung - auf folgende M&ouml;glichkeiten ausrichten:

<P>

Mit einer internationalen/globalen Perspektive werden <I>existierende

Strukturen</I> der 'regionalen' Zusammenarbeit, wie sie zum Beispiel

durch das Erasmus-Programm vorgegeben werden, relevant. Ebenso

wichtig ist der Anschlu&szlig; und Ausbau der EU- und UN-Verbindungen,

der akademischen Netzwerke wie auch der historisch begr&uuml;ndbaren

Verbindungen in Mittel- und Osteuropa (CEEC). Jedoch kann meiner

Ansicht nach eine regionale Begrenzung auf CEEC auch zu einem

intellektuellen Provinzialismus f&uuml;hren. Die Impulse aus den

Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern, wo gro&szlig;e Kreativit&auml;t und

Dynamik besteht, werfen immer wieder neue Fragen auf, mit denen

Studenten und Dozenten konfrontiert werden sollen.

<P>

Interdisziplinearit&auml;t ist wichtig, um international <I>aktuelle

Themen</I> mit einer globalen oder regionalen eventuell vergleichbaren

Problematik zu erforschen. Zus&auml;tzlich erscheint es angebracht,

da&szlig; sich &Ouml;sterreich auf einige<I> Nischenthemen</I>

spezialisiert, in denen bereits auf viel analytische Kapazit&auml;t

und eine gute Reputation verwiesen werden kann (zum Beispiel Umwelttechnik,

Tourismus, Metallurgie, Geologie, Bergbauernforschung).

<P>

Die <I>Integration von Lehre und Forschung</I>, d.h. ein auch

international ausgerichtetes Lehrprogramm auf Hochschul- und Fachhochschulniveau,

kombiniert mit einer Reihe von Fragestellungen, die auch durch

die Studenten untersucht werden, bietet gegenseitige Impulse zur

Weiterentwicklung. Au&szlig;erdem kann durch ein Kursprogramm,

das sich auf den 'Entwicklungsmarkt' ausrichtet, ein Teil der

Kosten wieder zur&uuml;ckflie&szlig;en. In den letzten Jahren

zeigte sich die Tendenz, da&szlig; kurze Kurse bevorzugt werden,

da weniger Geld f&uuml;r M.A./Ph.D. Programme zur Verf&uuml;gung

stehen und Angestellte von Firmen oder staatlichen Organisationen

nicht zu lange ihre Posten verlassen k&ouml;nnen. Das impliziert,

da&szlig; f&uuml;r einen 'Senior-Staff' Weiterbildungs-m&ouml;glichkeiten

kreiert werden m&uuml;ssen. Solche Kurse haben einen starken Praxisbezug

und bieten Chancen zur angewandten Forschung.

<H2><U>Voraussetzungen</U></H2>

<P>

F&uuml;r eine breitere, global orientierte und interdisziplin&auml;r

ausgef&uuml;hrte Forschungs- und Entwicklungspolitik sehe ich

- in bezug auf die Erfahrungen aus den Niederlanden - folgende

Voraussetzungen als wichtig an.

<P>

<ul>

<li><I>Gesellschaftliche Verankerung:</I> Engagement und Interesse

(Rolle von einer 'NCDO' wie in Holland; Kirche, Museen, Festivals,

Publikationen);

<P>

<li><I>Institutionalisierung</I> (Ministerien, Botschaften,

Universit&auml;ten, NGOs, Betriebe)

<P>

<li><I>Finanzierung:</I> durch den Staat, die Wirtschaft, Bev&ouml;lkerung,

internationale Institutionen (EU, Weltbank etc.);

<P>

<li><I>Profilierung:</I> Spezialisierung auf bestimmte Inhalte

und Methoden;

<P>

<li><I>Rolle der Universit&auml;ten</I> in Lehre und Forschung

ist ausschlaggebend f&uuml;r die Bildung von Kapazit&auml;ten,

f&uuml;r Reflexion und Kritik &uuml;ber Entwicklungspolitik.</ul>

<P>

Auch kleine L&auml;nder k&ouml;nnen ambitioniert sein gem&auml;&szlig;

der durch die NUFFIC gebrauchten Devise: <B>&quot;Small countries

have to be smarter!&quot;</B>

<P>

<a name=for></a><h3>Forschungskooperation mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern: Die &ouml;sterreichische Situation</h3>

<P>

<I>Rahmenbedingungen - F&ouml;rderung - Leistungen - Defizite</I>

<P>

<B>Reinhard Schurawitzki</B>

<P>

<b>Einleitung</b>

<P>

Nach den Ausf&uuml;hrungen meiner Vorrednerin m&ouml;chte ich

jetzt sozusagen als Kontrastprogramm etwas zur &ouml;sterreichischen

Situation sagen. Die Darstellung kann sich auf l&auml;ngere Erfahrung

sowohl im Bereich der Forschungsverwaltung als auch als Sekret&auml;r

der Kommission st&uuml;tzen.

<P>

Ich werde also kurz auf die Vorgeschichte des Themenbereichs &quot;<I>Forschung

mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern</I>&quot; in &Ouml;sterreich und

dessen Rahmenbedingungen eingehen. Daran wird sich ein kurzer

&Uuml;berblick &uuml;ber F&ouml;rderungsm&ouml;glichkeiten und

bisherige Aktivit&auml;ten anschlie&szlig;en.  Die im Programm

angek&uuml;ndigte Darstellung der Defizite ist meine subjektive

Interpretation von Fakten. Abschlie&szlig;end m&ouml;chte ich

bei aller gebotenen Skepsis eine Perspektive vorstellen, die -

so hoffe ich - in den anschlie&szlig;enden Diskussionen einem

kritischen Testverfahren unterzogen wird.

<P>

Die Geschichte des Themenbereichs &quot;Forschung mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern&quot;

beginnt in &Ouml;sterreich mit der Konferenz der Vereinten Nationen

&uuml;ber &quot;<I>Wissenschaft und Technologie im Dienste der

Entwicklung</I>&quot; im Jahre 1979 in Wien. Obwohl die Konferenz

insgesamt nicht sehr erfolgreich war, wurde immerhin die Bedeutung

von Wissenschaft, Forschung und Technologie f&uuml;r den Entwicklungsproze&szlig;

erstmals auf internationaler Ebene in vollem Umfang anerkannt.

Das beschlossene &quot;<I>Vienna  Programme of Action</I>&quot;

ist bis heute das Referenzdokument der Vereinten Nationen.

<P>

&Ouml;sterreich pr&auml;sentierte ein ambiti&ouml;ses 6-Punkte-Ma&szlig;nahmen-Paket.

Es verschwand jedoch bald nach Konferenzende in den Registraturen

der zust&auml;ndigen Amtsstuben. Weder wurde die versprochene

Bindung von Forschungsmitteln f&uuml;r diesen Zweck realisiert,

noch gedieh die Errichtung eines nationalen Forschungszentrums

f&uuml;r Wissenschaftskooperation mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

&uuml;ber eine Studie hinaus. Als einzige &ouml;sterreichische

Folgema&szlig;nahme der Konferenz wurde zwei Jahre sp&auml;ter

bei der Akademie der Wissenschaften die <I>Kommission f&uuml;r

Entwicklungsfragen</I> eingerichtet.

<P>

<p>Rahmenbedingungen in &Ouml;sterreich</p>

<P>

Wie auch in den meisten L&auml;ndern, auf supranationaler Ebene

die EU - Kommission eingeschlossen, geh&ouml;ren die Bereiche

&quot;Forschung&quot; und &quot;Entwicklungs-zusammenarbeit&quot;

unterschiedlichen gesellschaftlichen Subsystemen an. Daher sind

sie auch kompetenzrechtlich getrennt, obwohl sie in einem weiteren

Sinne in einem Kontext stehen. Die Entwicklung der Industriel&auml;nder

w&auml;re ohne Forschung wohl anders verlaufen.

<P>

Es haben sich also unterschiedliche Kulturen entwickelt, die einander

lange Zeit mit erheblichem Mi&szlig;trauen beobachtet  haben.

Auf der einen Seite befanden sich die Tiers-mondisten, die Entwicklungshelfer,

deren konkrete Erfahrungen mit Hunger, Armut, Krankheit und Gewalt

eine kritische Sicht auf &Ouml;konomie und Politik der Industriel&auml;nder

geradezu provozierten. Auf der anderen Seite die Wissenschaft,

welche in Traditionen eines eurozentristischen Systems mit dessen

Wertma&szlig;st&auml;ben und spezifischen Karriereverl&auml;ufen

ausgebildet worden waren und dort - von Ausnahmen abgesehen -

verharrten: In der Verwaltung als den ihre Bereiche kontrollierenden

Institutionen war das wechselseitige Mi&szlig;trauen besonders

ausgepr&auml;gt.

<P>

Die daraus folgenden Denk- und Handlungsblockaden verhinderten

ein kooperatives Agieren dort, wo sich beide Kompetenzbereiche

bis zu einem gewissen Ma&szlig; &uuml;berdecken: in Wissenschaft

und Forschung. Vorrangiges Ziel war nicht die Entdeckung gemeinsamer

Interessen, sondern eher das Herausarbeiten von Trennendem. Es

war nur folgerichtig, da&szlig; kooperative Forschung in der Programmatik

der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit  keine Rolle spielte, w&auml;hrend

sie im Wissenschaftsbereich vielfach als blo&szlig;e  Entwicklungshilfe

interpretiert wurde. Diese Abgrenzung diente vor allem der Schonung

der jeweiligen Budgets, wirkte jedoch insgesamt  prohibitiv auf

die konzeptuelle Entwicklung und verhinderte den systematischen

Aufbau &ouml;sterreichischer Expertise. Umso mehr Anerkennung

verdienen jene Wissenschafterinnen und Wissenschafter, die sich

von den ung&uuml;nstigen Rahmenbedingungen nicht haben entmutigen

lassen.

<P>

<b>F&ouml;rderung</b>

<P>

Der bei weitem gr&ouml;&szlig;ere Teil der f&uuml;r Zusammenarbeit

mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern relevanten Wissenschaftsf&ouml;rderung

entf&auml;llt auf den Bereich &quot;Studium und Ausbildung&quot;.

<P>

Aus Mitteln des Wissenschaftsministeriums werden Auslandsbeziehungen

der Universit&auml;ten und sonstiger wissenschaftlicher Einrichtungen,

beispielsweise Partnerschaften, kurzfristige Auslandsaufenthalte

und &auml;hnliche Aktivit&auml;ten, finanziert. Der bei weitem

gr&ouml;&szlig;te Teil davon entf&auml;llt auf Kontakte mit Industriel&auml;ndern.

<P>

Das Bundesministerium f&uuml;r ausw&auml;rtige Angelegenheiten

finanziert mit dem bew&auml;hrten Instrument der &quot;Nord-S&uuml;d-Stipendien

f&uuml;r Angeh&ouml;rige von Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern&quot; vor

allem postgraduale Studien und die Durchf&uuml;hrung von Spezialkursen.

Diese sind f&uuml;r die Anbahnung  von Forschungskooperationen

eine hervorragende Grundlage. Sie machen einerseits die Stipendiaten

mit den Verh&auml;ltnissen in &Ouml;sterreich vertraut, andererseits

werden Anliegen der Entwicklungsl&auml;nder den jeweiligen Betreuungspersonen

an den Universit&auml;ten oder au&szlig;eruniversit&auml;ren Einrichtungen

n&auml;hergebracht. 

<P>

Ich mu&szlig; mich hier - dem Thema  der Arbeitstagung entsprechend

- auf die F&ouml;rderung der Forschung beschr&auml;nken. Interessenten

an einem umfassenden &Uuml;berblick &uuml;ber das Gesamtspektrum

der F&ouml;rderungsm&ouml;glichkeiten seien auf das von der Kommission

mit herausgegebene Handbuch &quot;Studieren. Lehren. Forschen.

&Ouml;sterreich und die Dritte Welt&quot; hingewiesen.

<P>

<b>Forschung mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern</b>

<P>

Die F&ouml;rderungsm&ouml;glichkeiten im Forschungsbereich beschr&auml;nken

sich auf wenige Institutionen. Der <I>Fonds zur F&ouml;rderung

der wissenschaftlichen Forschung</I> (FWF) ist derzeit mit rund

760 Mio &ouml;S dotiert. Er f&ouml;rdert jedoch nur Projekte der

sogenannten Grundlagenforschung. Von den im vergangenen Jahr neu

bewilligten 460 Projekten entfielen nur rund 15 auf solche in

bzw. mit Bezug auf Entwicklungsl&auml;nder. Mit China, Taiwan,

Thailand, Indonesien und Argentinien ist jeweils ein sogenanntes

<I>&quot;Memorandum of Understanding&quot;</I> abgeschlossen worden,

welches institutionelle wissenschaftliche Zusammenarbeit erm&ouml;glicht;

1995 sind insgesamt acht entsprechende Vorhaben bewilligt worden,

davon f&uuml;nf mit Argentinien. Individuelle internationale Kooperationsprojekte

wurden 1995 mit &Auml;gypten (1), Belize (1) China (1), El Salvador

(2) und Jamaika (1) genehmigt.

<P>

Bescheidene Ans&auml;tze bieten bilaterale staatliche Abkommen,

wie insbesondere Kulturabkommen oder wissenschaftlich-technische

Abkommen. Solche Abkommen bestehen aber derzeit nur mit einer

Handvoll Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern und in engem personellen Rahmen.

<P>

Mittel der Auftragsforschung des <I>Wissenschaftsministeriums

</I>wurden - obwohl bis zum Sparpaket reichlich vorhanden - nur

in seltenen Ausnahmef&auml;llen f&uuml;r Themen mit Entwicklungsl&auml;nderbezug

vergeben.

<P>

Das <I>Bundesministerium f&uuml;r ausw&auml;rtige Angelegenheiten</I>

finanziert wissenschaftliche Forschung und Studien als Begleitma&szlig;nahme,

wenn dies zur Durchf&uuml;hrung von einzelnen Projekten der bilateralen

technischen Hilfe erforderlich ist. Das Interesse wird in diesen

F&auml;llen vom EZA-Projekt her definiert.

<P>

Der <I>Jubil&auml;umsfonds der &Ouml;sterreichischen Nationalbank</I>

f&ouml;rdert zwar grunds&auml;tzlich auch Forschungsprojekte 

&ouml;sterreichischer Wissenschafter in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern,

es entf&auml;llt jedoch nur ein kleiner Prozentsatz von j&auml;hrlich

etwa 320 Projekten darauf. Au&szlig;erdem werden keine Reise-

und Aufenthaltskosten ins und im Ausland &uuml;bernommen.

<P>

Die einzige Stelle in &Ouml;sterreich, welche Forschungsf&ouml;rderungen

ausschlie&szlig;lich f&uuml;r kooperative Projekte mit einem angemessenen

erwartbaren Nutzen f&uuml;r das Entwicklungsland vergibt, ist

somit die <I>Kommission f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen bei der &Ouml;sterreichischen

Akademie der Wissenschaften</I>. 

<P>

Die wichtigste Leistung besteht zweifellos in der finanziellen

F&ouml;rderung von einschl&auml;gigen Forschungsprojekten: Bis

heute sind knapp hundert Antr&auml;ge von der Kommission behandelt

und etwa zwei F&uuml;nftel davon - &uuml;berwiegend f&uuml;r junge

Wissenschafter und Wissenschafterinnen - auch finanziert worden.

Zus&auml;tzlich nenne ich noch Postgraduate-Kurse, die Ausarbeitung

eines Forschungskonzeptes, Durchf&uuml;hrung von Symposien, Informationsveranstaltungen

und zwei Erhebungen &uuml;ber das wissenschaftliche Kooperationspotential.

(&Uuml;bersicht &uuml;ber Projekte und sonstige Aktivit&auml;ten

siehe Anhang 1)

<P>

Alles bestens in &Ouml;sterreich, k&ouml;nnte man meinen. Da&szlig;

dem nicht so ist, zeigt einerseits eine Reihe von Projektantr&auml;gen

an die Kommission, die trotz hoher wissenschaftlicher Qualit&auml;t

abgelehnt werden mu&szlig;te. Ein weiterer Indikator f&uuml;r

eine skeptischere Beurteilung der Gesamtsituation ist die schwache

&ouml;sterreichische Beteiligung an der ersten Ausschreibungsrunde

des Kooperationsprogramms mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern des 4.

Rahmenprogramms der EU. Der Erfolg war mit drei bewilligten Projekten

nicht gerade &uuml;berzeugend. Aber auch die F&ouml;rderungst&auml;tigkeit

der Kommission selbst und ihre sonstigen Aktivit&auml;ten sind

insgesamt verbesserungsf&auml;hig. Es ist an der Zeit, sich &uuml;ber

offensichtliche Defizite klarzuwerden. 

<P>

<b>Defizite</b>

<P>

Woran fehlt es also? Auf politischer Ebene ist ein gewisses Desinteresse

f&uuml;r Anliegen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit ebenso wie im

Bereich der Forschungskooperation mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

zu konstatieren. Das hat sich auch in der sehr bescheidenen Finanzierung

der Kommission und in den bereits vor dem eigentlichen Sparpaket

vorgenommenen Subventionsk&uuml;rzungen gezeigt. 

<P>

Im Themenbereich der Forschungskooperation selbst sind Defizite

gegeben. Meiner Ansicht nach ist die Ausarbeitung einer soliden

Programmatik mit klaren Kriterien vordringlich. Die immer noch

bestehenden Divergenzen zwischen Entwicklungszusammenarbeit und

Wissenschaft sind zu korrigieren und zusammenzuf&uuml;hren.

<P>

Denn bisher erfolgte die Antragstellung aus unterschiedlichsten

Interessenslagen individueller &ouml;sterreichischer Wissenschafter

und Wissenschafterinnen. Die Projekte sind daher auch kaum inter-

oder multidisziplin&auml;r angelegt. Eine Netzwerkbildung kann

mit unterkritischer Masse nicht erreicht werden. Die Projektpartner

im Entwicklungsland sind am Entwurf des Projekts nur in wenigen

F&auml;llen beteiligt. Die Herstellung dauerhafter Kontakte nach

Abschlu&szlig; des Projekts ist selten. Eine Abstimmung von Kommissionsprojekten

mit Vorhaben der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit, welche gr&ouml;&szlig;ere

Kontinuit&auml;t und m&ouml;glicherweise auch Wirksamkeit herstellen

k&ouml;nnte, erfolgt nur in Ausnahmef&auml;llen. Das eingangs

angesprochene Zwei-Kulturen-Syndrom hat sich bisher kaum &uuml;berwinden

lassen. Dies hat, nicht zuletzt, auch Konsequenzen f&uuml;r die

Finanzierung.

<P>

<b>Vorschl&auml;ge f&uuml;r die weitere Diskussion</b>

<P>

Ich meine, da&szlig; &Ouml;sterreich sich nicht auf Dauer dem

Anliegen der Erweiterung gemeinsamer Forschungsm&ouml;glichkeiten

mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern entziehen soll und kann. Auch die

Wirtschaft sollte angesichts der globalen Entwicklung daran Interesse

haben. 

<P>

Ein &ouml;sterreichisches mittelfristiges Forschungsprogramm soll

daher eingerichtet werden. Es soll gemeinsam vom Bundesministerium

f&uuml;r ausw&auml;rtige Angelegenheiten und dem Bundesministerium

f&uuml;r Wissenschaft, Verkehr und Kunst in Auftrag gegeben und

getragen werden. Damit sollen klare Zielsetzungen und Kriterien

ausgearbeitet werden. Aufbauend darauf sind eine breit angelegte

Informationsarbeit sowie die Vermittlung von Interessen zwischen

Institutionen und Sektoren erforderlich. Sind diese Voraussetzungen

und entsprechende Rahmenbedingungen f&uuml;r gleichberechtigte

Kooperationen gegeben, kann die konkrete kooperative Projektarbeit

in Angriff genommen werden. Dabei wird im jeweiligen Einzelfall

auch die Finanzierung zu kl&auml;ren sein, wobei alle vorhandenen

M&ouml;glichkeiten zu nutzen sind. 

<P>

Oberstes Ziel mu&szlig; die Vorbereitung und Durchf&uuml;hrung

von im eigentlichen Sinn kooperativen Forschungsvorhaben mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

sein.

<P>

<b>Begr&uuml;ndung</b>

<P>

Trotz langer Vernachl&auml;ssigung und minimaler F&ouml;rderung

ist unter &ouml;sterreichischen Wissenschaftern und Wissenschafterinnen

betr&auml;chtliches Interesse und die Bereitschaft zu Kooperation

mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern gegeben. Dies ist durch mehrere Erhebungen

wie auch durch die F&ouml;rderungserfahrung der Kommission belegt.



<P>

Engere konzeptive wie operative Zusammenarbeit bzw. inhaltliche

Abstimmung im Einzelfall zwischen den Bereichen Wissenschaft und

Forschung einerseits und der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit andererseits

ist f&uuml;r beide Seiten von Vorteil, ja langfristig unabdingbar.

Ohne effektive Kooperation mit dem universit&auml;ren und au&szlig;eruniversit&auml;ren

Wissenschaftssystem &Ouml;sterreichs wird die EZA eine wichtige

Komponente vernachl&auml;ssigen. 

<P>

F&uuml;r Wissenschaft und Forschung wiederum gilt nach eigenem

Anspruch das Prinzip der Internationalit&auml;t, auch sind wesentliche

Probleme heute globaler Natur. Die Wissenschaft kann und mu&szlig;

mit ihrer langfristig angelegten Probleml&ouml;sungskapazit&auml;t

Beitr&auml;ge dazu leisten. Sie kann dies allerdings nicht ohne

Ber&uuml;cksichtigung der konkreten Situation tun. In der notwendigen

und gew&uuml;nschten Zusammenarbeit bedarf es auch der Beratung

durch und der Kooperation mit Einrichtungen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.

Das Ziel eines <I>Institution-Buildung</I> und einer St&auml;rkung

endogener Kapazit&auml;ten liegt somit in beiderseitigem Interesse.

<P>

Das Ziel wird nur erreicht werden k&ouml;nnen, wenn die jeweiligen

politisch-administrativen Ebenen im Verbund mit den wissenschaftlichen

und entwicklungsorientierten Institutionen mit der Einrichtung

eines gemeinsamen Programms eine geeignete Struktur f&uuml;r Beratung,

Koordination und ein intelligentes System der Kofinanzierung schaffen.

Daf&uuml;r gibt es schon jetzt erfolgversprechende Ans&auml;tze,

vor allem seitens der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit.

<P>

Einen m&ouml;glichen personellen Ansatzpunkt f&uuml;r kooperative

Forschung k&ouml;nnten die im Rahmen des Nord-S&uuml;d-Stipendienprogramms

ausgebildeten Wissenschafter aus Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern und

deren Betreuer in &Ouml;sterreich darstellen. 

<P>

Als Tr&auml;ger eines solchen Programms bietet sich die Kommission

f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen an. Sie hat langj&auml;hrige entsprechende

Erfahrungen. Sie untersteht einer Institution von hohem wissenschaftlichen

Ruf und internationaler Anerkennung. Sie ist fachlich interdisziplin&auml;r

zusammengesetzt. Sie kann universit&auml;re und au&szlig;eruniversit&auml;re

Forschung zusammenf&uuml;hren, ist vertragsf&auml;hig und autonom

in der Gestion der Mittel und verf&uuml;gt &uuml;ber eine - wenn

auch bescheidene - materielle Infrastruktur. &Ouml;sterreich sollte

sich auf Dauer den Anforderungen nicht entziehen. Es kann auch

nicht ausschlie&szlig;lich auf Aktivit&auml;ten und F&ouml;rderungen

supranationaler Einrichtungen, wie der Europ&auml;ischen Union,

verweisen: Das sinnvolle Prinzip der Subsidiarit&auml;t fordert

vom einzelnen Staat a priori gewisse Eigenleistungen beim Aufbau

der ben&ouml;tigten Expertise. Diese Voraussetzungen auf nationaler

Ebene sind jedoch erst wirklich zu schaffen. Erst dann wird die

Beteiligung an internationaler Zusammenarbeit mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

auch im Rahmen der EU (&uuml;ber die bisherigen Einzelinitiativen

hinaus) erfolgreich sein, erst dann wird &Ouml;sterreich auch

selbst neue Gesichtspunkte in die Diskussion auf europ&auml;ischer

Ebene einbringen k&ouml;nnen.

<a name=str></a><h3>Strategie f&uuml;r die Forschungskooperation mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

am Beispiel der Schweiz</h3>

<P>

<I>Vorstellung der Schweizerischen Kommission f&uuml;r Forschungspartnerschaft mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern (KFPE)</I>

<P>

<B>Daniel Maselli</B>

<P>

<b>1.  Vorgeschichte der KFPE</b>

<P>

Der Ausgangspunkt f&uuml;r die Initiative zur Gr&uuml;ndung der

heutigen Kommission geht auf die 169. Jahrestagung der <I>Schweizerischen

Akademie der Naturwissenschaften</I> (SANW) vor einigen Jahren

zur&uuml;ck (1989), anl&auml;&szlig;lich welcher ein Handlungsbedarf

in der Neuorientierung der schweizerischen Forschung in und mit

Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern klar festgestellt worden ist. In der

Folge haben die SANW und die Direktion f&uuml;r Entwicklung und

Zusammenarbeit (DEZA, vormals Direktion f&uuml;r Entwicklung und

humanit&auml;re Zusammenarbeit/DEH) die Initiative zur Einsetzung

einer &quot;<I>Kommission f&uuml;r die F&ouml;rderung der Forschung

in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern</I>&quot; (FFEL) ergriffen.  Diese

hat in der Folge die &quot;<I>Schweizerische Strategie zur F&ouml;rderung

der Forschung in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern</I>&quot; (1993) ausgearbeitet,

welche einer breiten Vernehmlassung unterzogen wurde. Darin wurde

unter anderem postuliert, eine spezielle Kommission f&uuml;r die

Umsetzung der Anliegen der Strategie einzusetzen.

<P>

Im Fr&uuml;hjahr 1994 gelang es, die &quot;<I>Konferenz der schweizerischen

wissenschaftlichen Akademien</I>&quot; (CASS), welche die vier

Akademien - SAGW (Geistes- und Sozialwissenschaften), SAMW (medizinische

Wissenschaften), SANW und SATW (technische Wissenschaften) - vertritt,

f&uuml;r die Finanzierung des Sekretariats zu gewinnen. Es wurde

eine 50%-Stelle f&uuml;r eine Dauer von drei Jahren bewilligt

(Pilotphase). Im August 1994 nahm das Sekretariat die Arbeit auf,

und im Herbst des gleichen Jahres fand die eigentliche Gr&uuml;ndungsversammlung

statt. Im Mai dieses Jahres hat die CASS das Mandat bis Mitte

2000 um weitere drei Jahre verl&auml;ngert.

<P>

<b>2.  Zusammensetzung der KFPE</b>

<P>

Die Kommission besteht aus 15 &quot;Ad personam&quot;-Mitgliedern,

wobei neun davon Vertreter der Wissenschaft sind und aus verschiedenen

Disziplinen stammen (vgl. Prospekt, Anhang 2). Im weiteren geh&ouml;ren

dieser Mitgliedergruppe je zwei Vertreter nicht-staatlicher Organisationen,

der schweizerischen Au&szlig;enwirtschaft und des Parlaments an.

Diese stimmberechtigten Mitglieder werden durch assoziierte Mitglieder,

welche diverse staatliche und Nicht-Regierungs-Organisationen

(NRO) vertreten, die von der Forschung in und mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

betroffen sind, verst&auml;rkt (vgl. Prospekt). Schlie&szlig;lich

haben einige weitere Mitglieder Beobachter- und Beraterstatus

(&quot;Ex officio&quot;-Mitglieder).

<P>

<b>3.  Ziele und T&auml;tigkeiten der KFPE</b>

<P>

Die KFPE verf&uuml;gt nur &uuml;ber geringe finanzielle Mittel,

welche ausschlie&szlig;lich f&uuml;r die Aktivit&auml;ten des

Sekretariats vorgesehen sind. Projekte k&ouml;nnen keine finanziert

werden, hingegen versucht die KFPE als Informationsdrehscheibe

zu fungieren (vgl. unten). Sie besitzt auch keine Entscheidungsmacht,

sondern kann nur auf Ersuchen hin Empfehlungen und Stellungnahmen

abgeben. Die KFPE wirkt deshalb vor allem mittels &Uuml;berzeugungsarbeit

auf allen Ebenen (Wissenschaft, Politik, Administration, &Ouml;ffentlichkeit).

<P>

Das Hauptziel der Kommission ist es, zur St&auml;rkung des wissenschaftlichen

Potentials von Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern beizutragen. Um dieses

Ziel zu erreichen, wurde die 'Strategie' einem ZOPP-Seminar (Ziel-orientierte

Projektplanung) unterzogen und ein Aktionsplan mit neun Hauptaktionslinien

ausgearbeitet. Der aktualisierte Aktionsplan sieht folgende Linien

vor: 

<P>

<ol>

<li>Das Modul 7 &quot;Entwicklung &amp; Umwelt&quot; des Schwerpunktprogramms

&quot;Umwelt-technologie und Umweltforschung&quot; (SPP-Umwelt)

wird als 'Erfahrungspool' f&uuml;r partnerschaftliche Forschung

genutzt.

<P>

<li>Ein Informationsinstrumentarium f&uuml;r Forschungspartnerschaft

liegt vor und wird eingesetzt.

<P>

<li>Es wird &Ouml;ffentlichkeits- und Sensibilisierungsarbeit betrieben.

<P>

<li>Die KFPE verf&uuml;gt &uuml;ber ein Instrumentarium zur Beurteilung

der Forschungspartnerschafts-Komponente bei Projekten.

<P>

<li>Die KFPE fungiert als Vermittlungs- und Anlaufstelle f&uuml;r

Forschungspartnerschafts-Anliegen in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern.

<P>

<li>Die KFPE-T&auml;tigkeit und der Impact ihrer Aktivit&auml;ten

werden laufend verfolgt und evaluiert.

<P>

<li>Es werden Reglemente, Verordnungen, Statuten und dergleichen

von EZA-Institutionen (Kommissionen, Stiftungen etc.) optimiert

und auf die F&ouml;rderung partnerschaftlicher Forschung ausgerichtet.

<P>

<li>Es werden Bem&uuml;hungen um Unterst&uuml;tzung spezieller

Aktivit&auml;ten unternommen (u.a. Fund-Raising/Out-Sourcing).</ol>

<P>

In naher Zukunft sollen insbesondere &quot;<I>Leitlinien f&uuml;r

partnerschaftliche Forschung</I>&quot; und ein &quot;<I>Informationsf&uuml;hrer</I>&quot;

ausgearbeitet werden. Dabei wird auf eine breite Abst&uuml;tzung

auch im Ausland Wert gelegt werden.

<P>

<b>4.  Zur &quot;Strategie&quot;</b>

<P>

<I>4.1 Grundideologie</I>

<P>

Die Strategie gr&uuml;ndet auf der &Uuml;berzeugung, da&szlig;

die globalen Probleme unseres Planeten (zum Beispiel Raubbau an

den nat&uuml;rlichen Ressourcen, Bev&ouml;lkerungswachstum) nur

mit gemeinsamen Anstrengungen von industrialisierten und weniger/nicht

industrialisierten L&auml;ndern gel&ouml;st werden k&ouml;nnen.

Im Klartext hei&szlig;t das, da&szlig; der Norden die Probleme

nicht alleine anpacken und l&ouml;sen kann, er ist auf die Mithilfe

des S&uuml;dens angewiesen. Daraus leitet sich der Grundgedanke

der Forschungspartnerschaft ab, da dadurch einerseits an der L&ouml;sung

gemeinsamer Probleme miteinander geforscht werden und gleichzeitig

die Forschungskapazit&auml;t und die Kompetenz auf beiden Seiten

- insbesondere aber im S&uuml;den - erh&ouml;ht werden kann. 

<P>

Die KFPE versucht, die in der Schweiz t&auml;tigen Forscherinnen

und Forscher sowie die Vertreter der schweizerischen Forschungspolitik

bis hin zu den Vertretern im Parlament von dieser Notwendigkeit

zu &uuml;berzeugen. Sie versucht darzulegen, da&szlig; die Schweiz

ein ureigenes Interesse an partnerschaftlicher Forschung hat und

diese nur auf der Basis von gegenseitigem Vertrauen in langfristiger

Zusammenarbeit erfolgen kann. 

<P>

Es ist klar, da&szlig; diese Sichtweise auch auf Widerst&auml;nde

st&ouml;&szlig;t, namentlich in Kreisen, welche die Forschung

im S&uuml;den als zweit- oder drittklassig abstempeln. Die KFPE

ist &uuml;berzeugt, da&szlig; sie hier einen Beitrag zur verbesserten

Bewu&szlig;tseinsbildung zu leisten hat. Einerseits gibt es im

S&uuml;den Forschungsprojekte, deren Resultate sich international

durchaus mit denjenigen des Nordens sehen lassen k&ouml;nnen,

andererseits mag die Forschung in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern zwar

oft mehr angewandter Natur sein, verlangt daf&uuml;r aber vom

Forschenden eine Kombination von Eigenschaften, die an sich schon

eine Herausforderung darstellen (gesundheitliche Robustheit, diplomatisches

Flair, kulturelles Verst&auml;ndnis, Improvisationsverm&ouml;gen

etc.). Ohne derartige F&auml;higkeiten kann ein noch so guter

Forscher aus dem Norden kaum das Optimum bei einem partnerschaftlichen

Projekt herausholen.

<P>

Hier setzt ein zentrales Anliegen der KFPE ein, welche die verantwortlichen

Institutionen der schweizerischen Forschungst&auml;tigkeit - insbesondere

auch die Geldgeber - vom Wert und von der Notwendigkeit partnerschaftlicher

Forschung in und mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern &uuml;berzeugen

und sie dazu bringen m&ouml;chte, k&uuml;nftig die Partnerschaftskomponente

bei der Projektbeurteilung vermehrt zu ber&uuml;cksichtigen. 

<P>

<I>4.2 Erste Erfahrungen</I>

<P>

Im Rahmen des Modul 7 aus dem SPP-Umwelt konnten erste Erfahrungen

in der partnerschaftlichen Forschung mit S&uuml;dl&auml;ndern

gemacht und ausgewertet werden. 

<P>

Die dem Modul zugrunde liegenden &Uuml;berlegungen sind die folgenden:

<P>

&quot;Weltumspannende Probleme im Umweltbereich sind eng mit der

Disparit&auml;t Nord/S&uuml;d verkn&uuml;pft. Die Beziehungen

zwischen Industrie- und Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern erweisen sich

regelrecht als Kardinalfrage f&uuml;r das &Uuml;berleben auf unserem

Planeten. Die derzeitigen weltwirtschaftlichen Spielregeln sowie

die Verhaltens- und Konsummuster der Industriel&auml;nder belasten

die Umwelt erheblich. Weitgehend durchgesetzt hat sich deshalb

die Einsicht, da&szlig; eine nachhaltige Entwicklung sowohl f&uuml;r

den Norden als auch f&uuml;r den S&uuml;den zwingend wird. Nachhaltige

Entwicklung bedeutet eine ausgewogene Integration der &ouml;kologischen,

sozialen und &ouml;konomischen Systeme, die deren Potentialen

und Grenzen Rechnung tr&auml;gt.&quot; 

<P>

Die Schweizer Regierung, verschiedene Umwelt- und Entwicklungsorganisationen

wie auch Privatunternehmen bem&uuml;hen sich, das Ziel der nachhaltigen

Entwicklung und die &ouml;kologische Dimension vermehrt in ihre

Enwicklungspolitik einzubeziehen. Wissenschaftliche Grundlagen

dazu fehlen jedoch in vielen Bereichen weitgehend. Das Modul 7

hat deshalb zum Ziel, bestehende Wissensl&uuml;cken zu schlie&szlig;en

und entwicklungspolitische Leitgedanken zu entwickeln. An den

Forschungsarbeiten beteiligt sind - nach der Leitidee einer Forschungspartnerschaft

- Schweizer und Drittwelt-Forschungsinstitutionen: Probleme beidseitiger

Bedeutung sollen gemeinsam angegangen werden. Dadurch werden Umwelt-

und Entwicklungsaspekte (F&ouml;rderung des einheimischen Forschungspotentials,

&quot;capacity- and institution-building&quot;) miteinander verkn&uuml;pft.

(aus: SPP-Umwelt, 1994)

<P>

<b>5.  Was hat die KFPE bislang geleistet und erreicht?</b>

<P>

<I>5.1 Kurzbericht der internationalen Konferenz in Bern</I>

<P>

Aufgrund einer Initiative des IUED (Institut Universitaire d'Etudes

du D&eacute;veloppement) in Genf wurde die KFPE angefragt, eine

internationale Konferenz zum Thema Forschungspartnerschaft mit

Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern durchzuf&uuml;hren. Sie wurde dabei unterst&uuml;tzt

von der DEZA, dem SPP-Umwelt, der SANW und dem IUED, welche auch

im OK vertreten waren. 

<P>

Die Konferenz wurde von etwa 380 Forscherinnen und Forscher sowie

Verantwortlichen der Forschungspolitik aus 67 L&auml;ndern besucht,

wobei 50 davon aus Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern stammten, was f&uuml;r

einen derartigen Anla&szlig; wohl als au&szlig;erordentlich bezeichnet

werden kann. Die KFPE konnte so wertvolle Kontakte kn&uuml;pfen

und Erfahrungen auf internationaler Ebene austauschen sowie eine

recht beachtliche Medienpr&auml;senz verzeichnen. Am ersten Tag

wurden verschiedene Strategien und Vorgehensweisen der bislang

am meisten engagierten Industriel&auml;nder - namentlich Kanada,

Schweden und Holland - sowie die Erfahrungen weiterer bedeutender

Akteure, wie etwa Deutschland, Frankreich und England, miteinander

verglichen. Die erw&auml;hnte starke Pr&auml;senz des S&uuml;dens

hat es dabei deren Vertretern erm&ouml;glicht, ihre positiven

wie auch negativen Erfahrungen mitzuteilen und Verbesserungsvorschl&auml;ge

bei k&uuml;nftigen gemeinsamen Forschungsvorhaben vorzutragen.

<P>

Zwei Hauptreferate, beide gehalten durch S&uuml;dvertreter, welche

mit dem Norden in enger Verbindung stehen (SPAAR/WB und TWAS),

haben u.a. die Diskussion um Hindernisse und Stolpersteine der

partnerschaftlichen Forschung sowohl im Norden wie auch im S&uuml;den

in Gang gesetzt. Interessant war dabei festzustellen, da&szlig;

die S&uuml;dvertreter selber finanziell und materiell mehr beitragen

m&uuml;ssen und teilweise auch wollen, um die eigene Forschungskapazit&auml;t

zu erh&ouml;hen und um als gleichwertige Partner betrachtet werden

zu k&ouml;nnen. Dabei mu&szlig; den Disparit&auml;ten unter den

Entwicklungs- und Schwellenl&auml;ndern Rechnung getragen und

die gegenseitige Hilfe untereinander verst&auml;rkt werden (S&uuml;d-S&uuml;d-Netz).

Ein wesentliches Ziel sollte dabei die St&auml;rkung der Forschungskapazit&auml;t

und gleichzeitig die Verminderung des diesbez&uuml;glich starken

Ungleichgewichts von rund 30 Forschern im Norden auf einen Forscher

im S&uuml;den sein, das schon in Rio klar bem&auml;ngelt worden

war. 

<P>

Am zweiten Tag wurden zuerst im Rahmen eines Rundgespr&auml;chs

Probleme rund um die verschiedenen Formen des Wettbewerbs bei

Forschungsvorhaben im S&uuml;den diskutiert. Besonders anregend

war das anschlie&szlig;ende &quot;Swiss Policy Forum&quot;, wo

sich vier Vertreter der schweizerischen Forschergemeinschaft mit

vier Vertretern des Parlaments ein Streitgespr&auml;ch &uuml;ber

die bisherige und k&uuml;nftige schweizerische Forschungst&auml;tigkeit

und -politik in und mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern geliefert haben.

<P>

Nach einem Postermarkt w&auml;hrend des Lunches folgten am Nachmittag

Gruppendiskussionen zu neun verschiedenen Themata, deren Resultate

am Vormittag des dritten und letzten Konferenztages vorgetragen

wurden. Der ganze Anla&szlig; wurde durch einen Vortrag eines

Vertreters der schweizerischen Wirtschaft und durch das &quot;Executive

Summary&quot; abgerundet.

<P>

<I>5.2 Proceedings, Infof&uuml;hrer und der Leitfaden f&uuml;r

die Partnerschaft</I>

<P>

Im Anschlu&szlig; an die Konferenz wurde eine Redaktionsgruppe

f&uuml;r die Herstellung der Proceedings bestellt. Diese sollten

bereits bis Mitte September 1996 - gerade rechtzeitig zur EADI-Konferenz

in Wien - zur Verf&uuml;gung stehen. Sie sind als praktische Arbeitsunterlagen

f&uuml;r die Ausarbeitung von neuen Strategien und f&uuml;r die

Verbesserung der partnerschaftlichen Forschungszusammenarbeit

konzipiert. Sie werden sowohl im Buchhandel wie auch bei der KFPE

erh&auml;ltlich sein. 

<P>

Die KFPE hat k&uuml;rzlich ebenfalls beschlossen, die Herstellung

des Leitfadens f&uuml;r partnerschaftliche Forschung m&ouml;glichst

rasch voranzutreiben und auch den Informationsf&uuml;hrer rund

um Forschungsaktivit&auml;ten in und mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

so bald wie m&ouml;glich herauszugeben. Im &uuml;brigen kl&auml;rt

die KFPE ab, ob in rund zwei Jahren eine Konferenz &auml;hnlicher

Art mit Hauptansprechpartnern aus der Wirtschaft durchgef&uuml;hrt

werden k&ouml;nnte. Die Mittel f&uuml;r eine derartige Folgekonferenz

w&auml;ren durch Outsourcing bei Wirtschaft, Industrie, Handel

etc. zu beschaffen.

Entwicklungsl&auml;nder 1993/94' mit Daten aus 1992 klar veraltet

war, hat das IUED in Genf im Hinblick auf die obige Konferenz

die Datenbank v&ouml;llig neu &uuml;berarbeitet und gestaltet.

Die Informationen sind nunmehr als relationale Datenbank auf CD-ROM

und Disketten f&uuml;r Macintosh und PC erh&auml;ltlich und erlauben

kombinierte Suchfolgen nach Disziplinen, geographischen und inhaltlichen

Stichworten. Die Datenbank enth&auml;lt zurzeit detaillierte Informationen

zu 319 schweizerischen Institutionen, welche mit der wisschenschaftlichen

Forschung in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern zu tun haben, sowie zu 743

sogenannten &quot;resource persons&quot; und zu 549 Forschungsprojekten.

Die Angaben werden fortan periodisch und in relativ kurzen Abst&auml;nden

aufgearbeitet und interessierten Personen und Institutionen zug&auml;nglich

gemacht.

<a name=zus></a><H3>Zusammenfassung der Diskussion im Plenum</H3>

<P>

<B>Bericht des Rapporteurs Herwig Palme</B>

<P>

<ol>

<li>Es wurde mehrfach festgestellt, da&szlig; die auf der Arbeitstagung

diskutierten Probleme im wesentlichen ihre Wurzeln im ausgepr&auml;gten

Mangel an politischem Willen zur Unterst&uuml;tzung und F&ouml;rderung

der &Ouml;sterreichischen Entwicklungszusammenarbeit (&Ouml;EZA)

haben. In enger Verbindung damit ergibt sich das allgemein geringe

forschungspolitische Interesse an Entwicklungsfragen. 

<P>

<li>Es wurde die Forderung gestellt, die explizite Rolle von Wissenschaft

und Forschung im neuen Dreijahresprogramm der &Ouml;EZA zu kl&auml;ren.

<P>

<li>Die wesentliche Rolle der Forschungspartnerschaften zwischen

&Ouml;sterreich und Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern wurde betont. Dabei

spielt die Forschungskooperation nicht nur eine Rolle in der Erzielung

besserer Ergebnisse der EZA, sondern auch als Beitrag zur heute

als wesentlich angesehenen Aufgabe des <I>Capacity Building</I>

der EZA in den Empf&auml;ngerl&auml;ndern.

<P>

<li>Einzelne Wortmeldungen und Teile der Diskussion brachten die

Problematik der Kompetenzverteilung zwischen dem Bundesministerium

f&uuml;r Wissenschaft, Verkehr und Kunst (BMWVK) und der &Ouml;sterreichischen

Entwicklungszusammenarbeit im Bundesministerium f&uuml;r ausw&auml;rtige

Angelegenheiten (BMaA) in Fragen der Entwicklungsforschung zum

Vorschein. Die gegenw&auml;rtige Situation der Zuweisung der Zust&auml;ndigkeit

f&uuml;r Entwicklungsforschung an das BMaA, jene der Forschungskoordination

jedoch an das BMWVK bleibt f&uuml;r die meisten Au&szlig;enstehenden

undurchsichtig und scheint vor allem dazu beizutragen, da&szlig;

es zu wechselseitigen Schuldzuweisungen f&uuml;r Inaktivit&auml;t

in Forschungsfragen kommt. Es wurde der Eindruck vermittelt, da&szlig;

angesichts der gro&szlig;en Bedeutung der beiden Ministerien f&uuml;r

die F&ouml;rderung der Entwicklungsforschung die Herstellung eines

Einvernehmens zwischen den beiden Ministerien eine Grundvoraussetzung

f&uuml;r eine Verbesserung der Forschungssituation darstellt.

<P>

Die Tatsache, da&szlig; auf dem Gebiet der Entwicklungsforschung

als wesentliche Akteure neben den beiden Ministerien die Kommission

f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen bei der &Ouml;sterreichischen Akademie

der Wissenschaften und die Rektorenkonferenz t&auml;tig sind,

f&uuml;hrt ein charakteristisches Merkmal der Situation besonders

drastisch vor Augen, n&auml;mlich die Abwesenheit von Universit&auml;tsinstituten

und au&szlig;eruniversit&auml;ren Forschungsinstituten. Dadurch

ergibt sich einerseits eine starke Abkoppelung der Forscherinnen

und Forscher von den wichtigsten Institutionen bzw. Organisationen

und andererseits die Einbeziehung der Forschungskompetenz auf

der Grundlage von personalisierten Beziehungen zwischen Forscherinnen

und Forschern und den Hauptakeuren. Vor diesem Hintergrund ist

die mehrfach gestellte Forderung nach der - seit langem diskutierten

- Errichtung eines Senatsinstituts f&uuml;r Entwicklungspolitik/forschung

zu verstehen.

<P>

<li>Angesichts der bisher von pers&ouml;nlichem Forschungsinteresse

und pers&ouml;nlichen Beziehungen zu den Hauptakteuren gepr&auml;gten

Landschaft der Entwicklungsforschung wurde in der Diskussion auch

Kritik an der fehlenden Programmatik mit feststehenden Kriterien

f&uuml;r die Errichtung von Forschungskooperationen zwischen &Ouml;sterreich

und Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern laut. Es wurde die Ausarbeitung von

Leitlinien f&uuml;r Forschungspartnerschaften (zum Beispiel die

besondere Ber&uuml;cksichtigung von Genderfragen) gefordert. Ebenso

wurde die Notwendigkeit der Festlegung von Forschungsschwerpunkten

auf der Basis der bisher gemachten Erfahrungen betont, wobei einerseits

die Anforderungen an die Forschung seitens der &Ouml;EZA und andererseits

die Feststellung der vorhandenen Forschungskapazit&auml;ten und

die komparativen Vorteile derselben zu ber&uuml;cksichtigen sind.

<P>

Von seiten der &Ouml;EZA wurden folgende programmatische Voraussetzungen

f&uuml;r die wissenschaftliche Forschung genannt:

<P>

<ul>

<li>Schwerpunktl&auml;nder (Nicaragua, &Auml;thiopien, Uganda,

Burkina Faso, Kap Verde, Mosambik, Bhutan)

<P>

<li>sektorpolitische Schwerpunkte: l&auml;ndliche Entwicklung,

Kleingewerbe, Bildung, Wasser und Energie, makro&ouml;konomische

Rahmenbedingungen.

<P>

<li>thematische Schwerpunkte: Armutsbek&auml;mpfung, Geschlechterfragen,

Umwelt, Demokratie.</ul>

<P>

<li>Die Forschungszusammenarbeit soll in das Dreijahresprogramm

aufgenommen werden. Dabei sind die wesentlichen Ziele der wissenschaftlichen

Kooperation zu ber&uuml;cksichtigen:

<P>

<ul>

<li>Organisationsentwicklung (<I>capacity building</I> und

<I>institution building</I>)

<P>

<li>F&ouml;rderung der wissenschaftlichen Kapazit&auml;ten,

insbesondere personeller, in Empf&auml;ngerl&auml;ndern

<P>

<li>Sachleistungen an wissenschaftliche Institute in Empf&auml;ngerl&auml;ndern.</ul>

<P>

<li>Folgende Punkte, die in der Diskussion in verschiedener Weise

angesprochen wurden, enthalten Vorschl&auml;ge f&uuml;r die Erstellung

eines &ouml;sterreichischen F&ouml;rderungskonzepts:

<P>

<ul>

<li>Ausarbeitung eines gemeinsamen Forschungsprogramms von

BMaA und BMWVK;

<P>

<li>insgesamt soll mehr Informationsarbeit &uuml;ber bestehenden

Bedarf an Forschungsbeitr&auml;gen geleistet werden, wobei auch

die Frage der Ausschreibung von wissenschaftlichen Beitr&auml;gen

f&uuml;r die &Ouml;EZA aufgeworfen wurde;

<P>

<li>die Koordination der Forschungsaktivit&auml;ten in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

soll verbessert werden und Kriterien f&uuml;r die Vergabe von

Forschungsprojekten sind zu erstellen. Als best geeignete Organisation

f&uuml;r die &Uuml;bernahme der Koordinationsfunktion wurde die

Kommission f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen bei der &Ouml;sterreichischen

Akademie der Wissenschaften genannt.

<P>

<li>Die Vermittlung zwischen den betreffenden Institutionen

und Organisationen soll verst&auml;rkt werden;

<P>

<li>die Gespr&auml;che zwischen den Institutionen und den Wissenschafterinnen

und Wissenschaftern sollen intensiviert werden;

<P>

<li>eine Pr&uuml;fung aller Finanzierungsm&ouml;glichkeiten

soll vorgenommen werden;

<P>

<li>die Bildung von Forschungspartnerschaften zwischen &ouml;sterreichischen

Einrichtungen und solchen in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern soll als

notwendige Voraussetzung f&uuml;r die Vergabe von Forschungsgeldern

gelten; als ein m&ouml;glicher Ansatzpunkt f&uuml;r wissenschaftliche

Kooperationen k&ouml;nnte das Nord-S&uuml;d-Stipendienprogramm

genutzt werden.</ul>

<P>

<li>Als Voraussetzungen f&uuml;r eine Intensivierung der Entwicklungsforschung,

die sich zum Teil aus den niederl&auml;ndischen und schweizerischen

Verh&auml;ltnissen ableiten, wurden genannt:

<P>

<ul>

<li>verst&auml;rkte Legitimit&auml;t,

<P>

<li>Institutionalisierung der Entwicklungsforschung,

<P>

<li>st&auml;rkere Profilierung und Spezialisierung,

<P>

<li>Bedacht auf die kritische Rolle der Universit&auml;ten

und

<P>

<li>die Suche nach Kontakt und Dialog mit der Wirtschaft.</ul></ol>

<P>

<hr> 

<P>

<a name=emp></a><h3>Empfehlungen</h3>

<P>

<ol>

<li>Die Einrichtungen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit sollen anerkennen,

da&szlig; Wissenschaft und Forschung einen wichtigen Beitrag zu

einer dauerhaften Entwicklung leisten. Die wissenschaftlichen

Institutionen sollen ihre Partner in Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern

auch in der Praxis als Teil der internationalen Wissenschaftsgemeinschaft

anerkennen. Unterschiedliche Quantit&auml;t und Qualit&auml;t

des Wissenschaftsbetriebs d&uuml;rfen keinen grunds&auml;tzlichen

Hinderungsgrund f&uuml;r Partnerschaften darstellen. 

<P>

<li>Eine engere Kooperation zwischen den Institutionen der Entwicklungszusammenarbeit

und der Wissenschaft ist daher unter Bedachtnahme auf das jeweils

geltende Drei-Jahresprogramm der &ouml;sterreichischen EZA sowohl

bei der Ausarbeitung von Strategien als auch in der Projektarbeit

und deren Finanzierung anzustreben. Die engere Zusammenarbeit

soll dazu beitragen, den vorhandenen R&uuml;ckstand &Ouml;sterreichs

in der kooperativen, entwicklungsorientierten Forschung aufzuholen.

<P>

<li>Damit dies effektiv und effizient geschieht, soll gemeinsam ein

mittelfristiges Strategieprogramm ausgearbeitet werden. Im Interesse

beider Bereiche sollen bestehende Kooperationsl&uuml;cken zwischen

EZA und Wissenschaft &uuml;berbr&uuml;ckt und somit Synergien

zwischen bisher isolierten Ans&auml;tzen hergestellt werden. &quot;Forschungs-partnerschaft

mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern&quot; soll mit diesem Progamm dauerhaft

in die Forschungs- wie in die Entwicklungspolitik integriert werden.

<P>

<li>Mit der Beratung, Koordinierung und Abwicklung dieses Strategieprogramms

soll von den beiden zust&auml;ndigen Ressorts die Kommission f&uuml;r

Entwicklungsfragen betraut werden. Diese hat die Details des Programms,

wie sie zum gro&szlig;en Teil in der Arbeitstagung vorgeschlagen

wurden, auszuarbeiten, wobei Interdisziplinarit&auml;t, Langfristigkeit

und regionale Breitenwirkung wichtige Kriterien darstellen. Es

ist in entsprechender Weise auf bestehende Forschungskapazit&auml;ten

R&uuml;cksicht zu nehmen; gew&uuml;nschte Anpassungen sind zu

f&ouml;rdern.

<P>

<li>Die Kommission f&uuml;r Entwicklungsfragen soll auch als Programmkomitee

zur Beratung &uuml;ber forschungspolitische Positionen und Strategien

f&uuml;r die &ouml;sterreichische Beteiligung an der Aktionslinie

II (Zusammenarbeit mit Entwicklungsl&auml;ndern/INCO/DC) des jeweiligen

Rahmenprogramms f&uuml;r Forschung und Technologie der EU fungieren.

<P>

<li>Die Institutionalisierung der Entwicklungsforschung im universit&auml;ren

Bereich ist durch die Errichtung eines Senatsinstituts f&uuml;r

Entwicklungspolitik zu verwirklichen.</ol>

<h1 align=center>Brave new world</h1>


<br>

<font size=4>Homeless people may be pushed to the margins but they do not disappear -
David Ransom  finds out where they have gone and what they
are doing.</font><br><br><hr width=71%><p>

'It is possible to live in economic poverty where there is love, but not
in emotional poverty where there is no affection.' Bruce Harris is talking
about the 5,000 or so street children who come every year to Casa Alianza,
a project he works for in Guatemala City.<i>1</i> <BR>
<BR>
The children's story really began before they were born, at least 40 years
ago, with a CIA-inspired military coup, followed by a genocidal civil war.
As so often in Latin America, the issue at stake in Guatemala was land.
The reforms proposed by President Arbenz would have given to the majority
indigenous peoples at least some legal title to land they had farmed for
centuries. After the coup they found it being distributed by the military
to its sympathizers. Displaced people, among them thousands of children,
ended up in crude shacks around Guatemala City. Many of the children then
fled the shacks to live on the city streets. They are still doing so now.<BR>
<BR>
'Perhaps the most significant shortcoming of these children's &quot;home&quot;,'
continues Harris, 'is not so much the physical infrastructure as the almost
total lack of affection. The children can find friends on the street who
will care about them, though the material environment is not much different
from the cardboard shack. They form surrogate families which society calls
&quot;gangs&quot;. The street becomes their home. In the material sense
they are homeless but in an affective sense they have more of a home on
the streets than they did in their shack... I guess what I am trying to
say is that for the street children a &quot;home&quot; is more of a concept
than a material space.'<BR>
<BR>
The meaning of this concept is not hard to grasp. All children crave a sense
of belonging and human warmth. To take it away from them by making their
families homeless is the worst kind of abuse. Children do not 'become' homeless
- they are made so. That there are millions of children around the
world who have, in this fuller sense, been made homeless is nothing less
than shameful. <BR>
It is no less shameful, however, that this should happen to anyone else.
And, make no mistake, there is nowhere in the world, from St Petersburg
to S&atilde;o Paulo, from Wellington to Washington, where this is not happening
to someone. It can even happen at the centre of world attention, around
the venues for the Olympic Games.<BR>
<BR>
Scott Leckie, a lawyer working with the Habitat International Coalition,
complains that 'only scant attention was paid to more than 720,000 low-income
residents of Seoul who were forcibly removed from their homes in anticipation
of the 1988 Olympic Games. Even less coverage has been given to the mass
displacement now occurring in Atlanta, Georgia, as officials &quot;spruce
up&quot; the city prior to the 1996 Olympic Games. Atlanta shows notorious
contempt for the homeless. A growing number of the already large homeless
population once lived on sites recently developed into Olympic venues. Local
agencies claim that anywhere between 10,000 and 20,000 people have lost
their homes thus far.'<i>2</i> <BR>
<BR>
This amounts to what might best be called 'the politics of exclusion'.<i>3</i>
Put very crudely, such politics promotes a studied indifference to anyone
without money. In the North they are in a minority, and so exclusion can
be conducted in the name of democracy. It takes on changing guises, most
of them economic; in the US it is 'deficit reduction', in Britain 'privatization',
in Aotearoa/New Zealand 'Rogernomics'. In the South there's just one, universal
and essentially meaningless form, and it's called 'structural adjustment'.
The moneyless here are often in a majority and so more reliance must be
placed on enforcement. But everywhere the aim is the same, to promote the
'realism' of global free-market economics and minimize democratic influence.<BR>
<BR>
Anyone who lived through the economic chaos of the 1930s, when similar prejudices
prevailed, must be watching this turn of events in utter disbelief. The
destitution that was visited on millions of people in the North then has
its parallel in the South now. What is usually referred to as 'housing'
in the North has a particularly important part to play in maintaining these
prejudices. As a commodity it is the place where we 'invest' our lives in
the workings of the market, the focus for most of our private dreams of
satisfaction.<BR>
<BR>

<br>

What has recently happened to housing - and therefore to the homeless
- in Britain illustrates the folly of it all extremely well. From 1979
the Thatcher Government promoted what it liked to term a 'property-owning
democracy' on the back of massive government subsidies. The result was feverish
speculation, a scramble up the rungs of the 'property ladder'. House prices
shot up. At one point home owners - in reality mere debtors to financial
institutions - were spending more on credit raised against the notional
increase in the money value of their homes than was being produced by the
whole of British industry. Then, in 1989, the ladder slipped and fell away.
Interest rates soared and house prices slumped. Some two million households
found themselves stuck with houses worth less than they'd borrowed to pay
for them: a predicament described without the slightest hint of irony as
'negative equity'. Thatcher's home-owning democracy vanished in the puff
of negative equity it had always been.<BR>
<BR>
The interests of the third of the British population who were unwilling
or unable to climb the property ladder were simply ignored. None of the
severe problems afflicting public - 'council' - housing were addressed,
other than by selling it off, sometimes in gerrymandering operations designed
to improve the local Tory Party vote. In 1994 just 441 new houses were built
by local councils in Britain.<i>4</i><BR>
<BR>
The collapse of public housing was accompanied by a doubling in the number
of families with children who registered under the Homeless Persons Act,
from 62,920 in 1980 to 148,250 by 1992.<i>5</i>  The Government's response was
to talk of abolishing the Act altogether. In 1991 the sight of beggars and
rough sleepers on the streets of London drove the Government to consider
drastic measures. The financial health of the nation, they said, was tied
to visitors - tourists and businesspeople - feeling comfortable
in the capital. Yet photographs and articles by foreign visitors had started
to appear in the world's press asking: how could Britain have allowed its
citizens to become so abject?<BR>
<BR>
Homeless people had to be removed. Politically it was impossible to drive
them off the streets without a huge outcry. So the Government responded
by attempting to get them out of the downtown, West End, area of London
and place them in hostels away from public inspection. The most important
thing was to tidy up, to remove an eyesore. It now takes a speech by Princess
Diana, of all people, to get thousands of homeless young people into public
consciousness at all.<BR>
Around the world there are at the very least some 1.6 billion people -
almost a third of the world's population - living in what the World
Health Organization describes as 'life- or health-threatening' conditions.<i>6</i>
The 'threat' may come from dangerous drinking water, bad sanitation, floods,
landslips, pollution, overcrowding, bullets, bombs - any number of
things that can make life more unsafe and unpleasant than is tolerable.
The people who face such threats are homeless in the true meaning of the
word; marginalized and excluded from the calculations of 'structural adjustment'
that are usually responsible for making them so.<BR>
<BR>
The margins or outlines of a thing, however, tell us what it looks like,
what it really is and perhaps the shape of things to come. No society that
discounts the value of its members is going to work for long. Any 'democracy'
that sets out to exclude people as a matter of policy will end up being
defined by them, driven by the very fear, insecurity and violence it has
inflicted on them. A brave new world indeed.<BR>
<BR>
You can see the results clearly in South Africa, where exclusion under apartheid
took a very tangible form. Because people's homes are so crucial to everyday
life they played an important part in the resistance to apartheid, through
rent strikes and the township 'Civics' that organized them. The country
is now one of the few places in the world where housing is at the top of
the political agenda. But the process of creating homes where people can
live in peace is still fraught with difficulty.<BR>
'To the vast majority of South Africa's poor,' says Ted Bauman of People's
Dialogue on Land and Shelter, 'housing is not a &quot;commodity&quot;. For
the people who matter most and who produce the most housing - the homeless
poor - it is an aspect of everyday existence, much like carrying water,
obtaining fuel or cooking food. It is not an &quot;event&quot;, as portrayed
in bank mortgage-loan adverts, in the part where the bank manager hands
over the keys to the smiling family. Housing is an urgent and never-ending
process of shelter provision in which poor people are engaged for most of
their lives.<BR>
<BR>
'By focusing on housing as a product, current debate implicitly embraces
the mortgage-advert view, which is of relevance only to the relatively wealthy,
who can afford to purchase everything in a &quot;market&quot; and have lost
the ability to supply their own human needs anyway. Even worse, this assumption
implicitly devalues the people's housing process. Even though appropriately-supported,
people-produced housing is cheaper, quicker and more suited to the needs
of the poor, in South Africa it is considered &quot;substandard&quot; because
it is not a commodity. It is therefore seen as a part of the problem, not
the solution.<BR>
<BR>
'The Third World is littered with the results of this kind of thinking:
housing developments which either turn to slums or end up in the hands of
the rich; cities in the middle of nowhere; environmental degradation. In
almost every instance, these are the results of a failure not only to &quot;consult
the community&quot;, but to follow and support them in their own efforts.
Conversely, where &quot;development&quot; has been successful - by
which we mean that it results in vibrant, sustainable communities -
it has been in those rare cases where people took as their starting point
what communities were already doing, and concentrated on supporting them...
It's never too late to learn.'<i>7</i><BR>
<BR>
The homeless people who make up People's Dialogue have spent a long time
thinking, before building anything at all. Their thinking also includes
'dreaming': imagining the ideal home, discussing it with others, perhaps
even making full-scale paper models, and then deciding what is practical.
Only then do they look for land, finance, materials, all the resources necessary
for homes they will eventually build for themselves. <BR>
<BR>
This is where the political battle for inclusion, rather than exclusion,
really begins. Making decent homes depends on many things that individuals
- even large, well-organized groups - cannot possibly achieve
on their own. Clean water, sanitation and electricity have to be available;
the environmental impact must be considered with care. The location must
provide access to work, social networks and leisure. Affordable finance
is critical too.<BR>
<BR>
None of these things, in South Africa or anywhere else, can be provided
without the political will. Where homes function as private property in
a speculative, market-driven society this political will is notoriously
absent, so the politics of exclusion flourish. But where housing is thought
of simply as a tool of policy by bureaucratic state machines the resulting
ghettos - exclusion in another form - are hardly much better.<BR>
<BR>
What is needed is some fresh thinking and a different kind of political
will. This has to begin by accepting that a decent home is a basic necessity
of life, a fundamental human right. Such a right exists regardless of money
- after all, no other human right is conditional on cash. Once this
has been accepted, other things follow. Someone who has this right must
be heard and not excluded. What makes a 'decent' home can only be judged
by the people who live there, whose views are therefore the real foundations
on which any useful building must rest. The public function of democratic
government does not vanish. It remains to protect us from abuse and deliver
essentials like public services, affordable credit, environmental protection.
<BR>
<BR>
If we are liberated from the dictatorship of market forces it becomes possible
to imagine the unimaginable. Perhaps it would be better for everyone, in
the long run, if no-one could sell their home for more than they paid for
it; if people with an excess of two or three bedrooms had an obligation
to take in those who have no home at all; if no-one had the right to own
more than one home; if forms of ownership and finance developed that were
neither state nor private but controlled by local communities; if land had
no monetary value; if homeless people had a right to occupy and renovate
empty 'property'.<BR>
<BR>
The point of this is not that we need an unworkable wish-list to be presented
to some kind of unelectable putative government. It is to free our minds
from the bondage of market forces, to use our imagination and to work out
for ourselves what is practical. Younger people in the North for whom good
jobs and dream-homes are more of a fantasy than anything we have suggested
are, here and there, beginning to do just this. But for the most part it
is to the South that we must look for inspiration for a genuinely brave
new world.<BR>
<BR>
There is a chance to learn these lessons at the UN's Habitat II World Conference
on Human Settlements - the 'City Summit' - set for Istanbul in
June. Given Turkey's appalling human-rights record, Istanbul may be a curious
place in which to learn them. The US Government has also been doing its
utmost to stifle progress: the UN Centre for Human Settlements running the
Conference has, in Scott Leckie's words, 'reduced itself to a fearful and
lacklustre bystander, afraid of pursuing its mandate if this does not conform
with Washington's demands'.<i>2</i> <BR>
<BR>
But the politics of exclusion cannot endure forever. On the face of it the
woman who slips the key to the dream home she can no longer afford through
the letterbox of the bank and disappears into the night with her children
has little in common with the woman who retrieves what she can from the
ruins of a cleared slum in Manila and sets out in search of somewhere else
to squat. The experience of homelessness and exclusion is, however, much
the same wherever you are. Common humanity can never finally be denied.<p><hr width=71%><p>

<h2>Supporting private sector-led development in the Caribbean:<br>Essential first steps towards a more effective partnership with the European Union</h2><h3>

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h3>

<i>Michelle Lowe</i><br>

</I>London: Caribbean Council for Europe, October 1996<p></center>

<h5>This paper should be cited as: Lowe, M. 1996. Supporting private sector-led development in the Caribbean: Essential first steps towards a more effective partnership with the European Union. London: CCE.</h5>

<hr>

<p>

The following paper is the outcome of a process of consultation carried out on behalf of the Caribbean Council for Europe (CCE) and the Caribbean Association of Industry and Commerce (CAIC) to develop a consensus among member and non-member private sector organisations throughout the Caribbean about the general goals of the Caribbean private sector to highlight the development needs of different private sector entities in the region in the context of European policy towards the Caribbean in the second part of Lom&#233; IV and in a successor agreement after the year 2000. 

<p>

Based on the oft stated belief in Europe and the Caribbean that the private sector is the motor for future regional development, it seeks to:

<UL>

<LI>sensitise the European Union (EU) and the European Commission (EC) to the particular needs of the Caribbean private sector if it is to play a central role in the deelopment process;

<LI>alert Caribbean governments and regional institutions to the need to develop new approaches within national indicative and regional indicative programmes in the second part of Lom&#233; IV;

<LI>make a case for a successor agrement to Lom&#233; IV after the year 2000 that contains a new window free from historic constraints for the private setor and other social partners;

<LI>develop a debate on the private sector&#146;s belief that there is a need for a new intermediary body able to administer in a timely and effective manner aid programmes for the private sector and other social partners;

<LI>develop programmes that support identified programmes ranging from institutions building to support for key industrial and service sectors in the Caribbean; and

<LI>indicate the special role that the French DOM in the region might have in this process as "Europe in the Caribbean."

</UL>



<p>

Despite some tentative steps towards the private sector in the first half of Lom&#233; IV, Caribbean ACP governments and the European Commission have not yet demonstrated their full commitment to the principle of decentralised co-operation and private sector-led development either through making available  funding for the private sector in a timely manner or through the creation of appropriate intermediary bodies to develop private sector programmes. The problem, as underlined by this paper, is that while the Convention places importance on the principle of decentralised co-operation and private sector-led development, in practice the Lom&#233; mechanism continues to operate as a government-to-government agreement with the social partners in the private sector having a severely limited window of  access.  

<p>

In putting forward recommendations for a more effective partnership between the Caribbean and the EU which places the private sector at the centre of that relationship, the paper identifies a number of essential first steps that need to be accomplished. These include identifying new mechanisms to facilitate direct dialogue with the private sector as well as the creation of new intermediaries to deliver private sector programmes; the establishment of effective private sector windows for EU assistance; and new financial instruments to provide direct support to the private sector. 

<p>

<A HREF="ccelowe.htm#1">Section One</A> restates the need for a new strategic alliance between Caribbean governments and the private sector and the adoption of a joint approach to Europe. Increasingly, with the globalisation of world trade and the new imperative to survive on the basis of international competitiveness rather than preferential treatment, the private sector will play a key role in enabling the region to attain sustainable development within the proposed Free Trade Area of the Americas. The role of the private sector will also become critical as bilateral and multilateral  aid flows diminish and both regional and international investment  become the principal source of capital accumulation.  At the same time, the relative inexperience of the private sector in dealing with international development agencies suggests the need for a new inter-relationship with government and a joint approach  to Europe.

<p>

<A HREF="ccelowe.htm#2">Section Two</A> assesses the specific needs of the Caribbean private sector.   In focusing on the relative strengths and weaknesses of the private sector, the paper notes that, as a group, the Caribbean private sector is at a higher level of development than its counterparts in most other ACP countries, specifically as it relates to group coherence, vibrancy  and the ability to formulate common positions on which to lobby regional governments. Some common weaknesses also exist across territories. These include a relative lack of technical expertise in national institutions, a lack of entrepreneurial skills in certain territories, a lack of access to long-term financing, the existence of weak private sector institutions and a poor physical and regulatory environment for private sector development.

<p>

To remedy these, there is a role for the EU in the development of schemes and programmes to assist entrepreneurs to keep abreast of technological and demand changes in export markets as well as provide assistance in product and packaging design.  Special emphasis has also been placed on the development of new financial mechanisms that expand the role of the European Investment Bank (EIB), the Centre for the Development of Industry (CDI) and  adapt mechanisms such as the European Community Investment Partnership Scheme (ECIP) to the needs of the Caribbean private sector.

<p>

National and regional private sector  institutions (chambers of commerce, manufacturers associations and hotel associations) also share a common need for institutional strengthening.  Proposals from a number of national private sector organisations call for programmes aimed at capacity building among staff to improve administrative efficiency and technical expertise  and improve communication links across national and regional organisations to facilitate the development of a network of private sector organisations through which information can be disseminated and through which organisations can share the benefit of expertise and research in different areas.

<p>

<A HREF="ccelowe.htm#3">Section Three</A> explores possible new approaches to dialogue and future co-operation between the EU and the Caribbean which facilitate greater private sector involvement in the delivery and implementation of private sector programmes.  Preliminary proposals explore the possibility of using the existing CARIFORUM mechanism as a forum to facilitate ongoing exchanges between regional governments, the private sector and the European Commission in the short term.  While acknowledging that this may be resisted by Caribbean ACP Ministers, the paper notes that failing this, there will be need to establish a new mechanism which will create an additional call on regional co-operation funds.

<p>

Finally, in exploring possible new approaches to financing and programming, the paper underlines the need to devise new arrangements which will increase private sector access to Lom&#233; resources and minimise the bureaucratic delays both on the ACP and EC side without appearing to undermine the recognised right of ACP States to determine their development strategies and models in all sovereignty.  After some discussion of this issue at the time of the CCE/CAIC/EC Encounter in Brussels in July this year, it was agreed that the important thing was to identify eligible and credible financial institutions capable of working with the private sector for the timely delivery of private sector programmes.

Despite repeated requests in some quarters, United Nations agencies such as UNICEF, UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), World Food Programme (WFP) and the World Health Organization (WHO), have been prevented crossborder access to help civilians in the besieged territory.<p>According to UN sources, the Russians have continued to cite various official reasons such as "administrative difficulties" or "logistical problems" for not allowing the UN agencies to even send in supplies for distribution by MSF or ICRC. For the moment, UNICEF, UNHCR, WFP and other agencies are only allowed to operate in the Republics bordering Chechnya.<p>UN sources said the Russians have been exerting enormous pressure on UN Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali not to push the issue. "Basically, the last thing the Russians want is to have UN organizations witnessing what it is doing inside Chechnya. It is absolutely scandalous," said one UN official. "Neither UN relief workers nor their supplies are allowed in." The Russians, for example, have not permitted UNICEF convoys to cross the border. As Samir Bastia, the Geneva-based Director for UNICEF-Europe, complained: "If only we could help the children..." <p>The official line, according to UN sources, is that the UN agencies have been invited to "assist" but not to "enter" the country. "So we are still waiting for the green light from the Secretary-General," said one representative. As of 23 February, the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs, which is responsible for coordinating inter-agency operations in the region, said that there was no plan to deploy UN agencies inside Chechnya. However, it is possible, noted DHA representative Paul Hebert in Geneva, "that UNICEF may at some point be brought in to deal with health problems."<p>The UNHCR, on the other hand, will remain operational only in the frontier countries. Officially, the UNHCR's mandate is restricted to dealing with refugees. Observers note, however, that there have been an increasing number of crises -- Bosnia, Sri Lanka and Afghanistan -- where the Geneva-based agency has been providing assistance to internal refugees or displaced persons regardless of the mandate.<p>Several UN sources believe that one of the reasons that Moscow refuses to have UNHCR present inside the "conflict zone" (i.e.. Chechnya) is because it does not want fleeing civilians to be labelled as refugees. So far as the Russians are concerned, added one observer at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva, "Chechnya is an internal and not an international affair."<p>According to sources, the IOM, which is involved in evacuation and bread distribution operations in Grozny -- sometimes in the midst of the fighting zones -- was allowed to operate inside Chechnya mainly because of its experience in the former Soviet Union and past relations with the Russian Federal Migration Service. The IOM was heavily involved during the Soviet era in facilitating the departure of migrants, mainly to Europe, North America and elsewhere. The Russians, too, prefer to have displaced persons referred to as migrants rather than refugees. <p>At the same time, IOM may be developing a new role for itself in international emergencies. Given that the IOM's constitution includes assistance to "displaced persons," some relief analysts have suggested that IOM could cut itself a significant niche by assuming some of the humanitarian burden of the UNHCR. As it is, UNHCR is thoroughly overwhelmed by having to deal with growing numbers of refugees and displaced persons. In contrast to its normally low profile, IOM has been involved in recent operations, such as Mozambique and Rwanda, that have stood out far more than in the past. And given that more conflicts may arise in the former Soviet Union, IOM could soon find itself with its hands full dealing with displaced persons.<p><hr>©Copyright:<b> CROSSLINES</b> Global Report 1995.

<title>Situation in Sierra Leone worsens - press release</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#333366" vlink="#3399ff" text="#000000">

<hr><br>
<h4>For Immediate Release,10th October 1995</h4>

<h2>SITUATION IN SIERRA LEONE WORSENS</h2>


Over the last three months the inaccessibility of the hundreds of thousands of displaced people  in Sierra Leone  has greatly increased due to continued rebel attacks on the Freetown-Bo-Kenema Highways. This has resulted in serious shortages of food and other essential commodities, leading to widespread hunger, starvation and increased malnutrition in the districts. This horrendous situation has been aggravated by the recent outbreak of cholera. Children and women have been the worst affected.


<h4>Surveys have found -</h4>
  An estimated 20 - 30 children dying every day and that the incidence of acute global malnutrition was as high as 22%.  The causes of death are mainly lack of food, cholera/diarrhoea, acute respiratory infections, measles and malaria.
  An outbreak of cholera in the affected districts, propagated by the overcrowding and insanitary conditions in the camps and most homes, has had a serious impact on the population. To date, 1,248 cases have been reported in Kenema alone, 98 have died.
  The present population of Kenema is estimated to be 400,000, of whom 100,000 are displaced from the surrounding districts. The majority of the displaced are staying with relatives and friends in overcrowded conditions. The average size of a household has increased from 8 before the war to 38.
<p>

As an immediate response, UNICEF has airlifted emergency supplies, including basic health items, drugs, vaccines and other essentials to the area. Many of the airlifts don't manage to get through. Project teams have visited Bo, Kenema, Segbwema and Makeni to assess the situation. Health clinics are being established in all camps to provide free treatment to displaced persons, while support is being given to MSF and Action Internationale Contre la Faim (AICF) in their screening and therapeutic feeding programmes for children. To ensure continuation of schooling for displaced children, UNICEF has provided "school in a box" kits for 28,000 children between 6 and 14 years.
<p>

UNICEF is also concerned by the dramatic increase in the number of street children, with over 3,000 in Kenema and Bo, some as young as 4 years old, and another 3,000 in Freetown.  UNICEF
supports local NGOs in identifying and registering street children and placing them in transitory homes, providing blankets, clothing and cooking utensils.
<p>

<P><HR>

<B>Le monde est en profonde mutation</B>. L'effondrement du bloc

de l'Est et la fin du conflit Est/ Ouest ont boulevers&eacute;

la sc&egrave;ne politique et &eacute;conomique internationale,

ouvrant la voie &agrave; une coop&eacute;ration renforc&eacute;e

fond&eacute;e sur des valeurs et des principes communs mais conduisant

aussi &agrave; un remodelage des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts g&eacute;ostrat&eacute;giques

et &agrave; de nouveaux types de risques plus diffus. Au plan

&eacute;conomique, l'extension de l'&eacute;conomie de march&eacute;

et la fin des relations exclusives ou privil&eacute;gi&eacute;es

ont modifi&eacute; les conditions de l'offre et de la demande

sur les march&eacute;s internationaux. La conclusion des n&eacute;gociations

commerciales du cycle de l'Uruguay cr&eacute;e un contexte multilat&eacute;ral

nouveau, acc&eacute;l&eacute;rant le processus de <B>mondialisation</B>

de l'&eacute;conomie entra&icirc;n&eacute; par les &eacute;volutions

technologiques et par la <B>lib&eacute;ralisation</B> des politiques

&eacute;conomiques engag&eacute;e dans les ann&eacute;es 1980.

L'interd&eacute;pendance s'accro&icirc;t et s'&eacute;tend, au-del&agrave;

des sph&egrave;res &eacute;conomiques et financi&egrave;res, aux

sph&egrave;res du social et de l'environnement. Simultan&eacute;ment,

alors que les politiques nationales perdent de leurs marges de

manoeuvre, de nouvelles fractures se marquent, aliment&eacute;es

par les effets de l'exclusion, par la fragmentation du tissu social

au sein des pays industrialis&eacute;s comme au sein des &eacute;conomies

en transition et des pays en d&eacute;veloppement, par l'accroissement

des in&eacute;galit&eacute;s, par la marginalisation des pays

les plus d&eacute;munis. Ces fractures constituent des facteurs

d'instabilit&eacute;, qui se traduisent notamment par la mont&eacute;e

des extr&eacute;mismes de types nationalistes ou int&eacute;gristes.

 <P>

<B>Ce nouvel environnement international a conduit l'Union europ&eacute;enne

&agrave; red&eacute;finir ses int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts politiques

et de s&eacute;curit&eacute;,</B> et &agrave; donner un nouvel

&eacute;lan &agrave; la dimension politique du processus d'int&eacute;gration

europ&eacute;enne. Le Trait&eacute; sur l'Union europ&eacute;enne

a donn&eacute; une base institutionnelle &agrave; la mise en place

d'une politique ext&eacute;rieure et de s&eacute;curit&eacute;

commune (PESC), politique qui demeure cependant insuffisamment

d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e pour servir efficacement les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts

communs des Etats membres, et dont les m&eacute;canismes font

actuellement l'objet de discussions dans le cadre de la Conf&eacute;rence

Inter-Gouvernementale (CIG). Mais le Trait&eacute; a aussi fourni

une base institutionnelle &agrave; la politique europ&eacute;enne

de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

<H4>L'Union se pr&eacute;pare &agrave; d'importantes transformations</H4>

<P>

De profonds changements marqueront l'Union, au moment pr&eacute;cis&eacute;ment

de la mise en place d'un nouveau partenariat avec les pays ACP.

<P>

<U>Au plan interne</U>, l'accompagnement du march&eacute; int&eacute;rieur

et la perspective du passage &agrave; la monnaie unique, la r&eacute;vision

du Trait&eacute; et les autres r&eacute;formes institutionnelles

en discussion dans le cadre de la CIG, l'&eacute;laboration d'un

nouvel accord financier &agrave; moyen terme, et la perspective

de l'&eacute;largissement aux pays associ&eacute;s d'Europe centrale

et orientale, aux Etats baltes, &agrave; Chypre et Malte, constituent

autant de chantiers pour les prochaines ann&eacute;es, et pr&eacute;parent

l'Europe &agrave; affronter les d&eacute;fis du 21&egrave;me si&egrave;cle.

<P>

<U>Dans le cadre de ses relations ext&eacute;rieures</U>, vis-&agrave;-vis

des pays en d&eacute;veloppement et des &eacute;conomies en transition,

l'Union europ&eacute;enne est &eacute;galement engag&eacute;e

dans un ensemble d'initiatives nouvelles. 

<P>

Elle a conclu des accords d'association avec la plupart des pays

europ&eacute;ens de l'ancien bloc de l'Est candidats &agrave;

l'adh&eacute;sion. Parall&egrave;lement, elle accorde son soutien

au processus de transformation &eacute;conomique et politique

des r&eacute;publiques de l'ancienne Union sovi&eacute;tique et

a conclu des accords commerciaux avec plusieurs d'entre elles.

<P>

Dans le contexte de ses relations avec les pays tiers m&eacute;diterran&eacute;ens,

elle a fix&eacute; un nouveau cadre de partenariat multilat&eacute;ral

et durable liant 27 pays, compl&eacute;mentaire au renforcement

des relations bilat&eacute;rales, et qui comporte trois volets:

politique et de s&eacute;curit&eacute; d'une part, &eacute;conomique

et financier d'autre part (pr&eacute;voyant notamment l'&eacute;tablissement

progressif d'une zone de libre &eacute;change), social, culturel

et humain enfin.

<P>

L'Union a &eacute;galement d&eacute;cid&eacute; de renforcer ses

liens avec l'Am&eacute;rique latine, dans le cadre d'une strat&eacute;gie

en trois dimensions, qui pr&eacute;voit un approfondissement du

dialogue politique entre les deux r&eacute;gions, un soutien en

vue de renforcer le libre &eacute;change et un appui institutionnel

au processus d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale, des actions

et programmes de coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re et technique

centr&eacute;s sur quelques axes prioritaires. 

<P>

Enfin elle a adopt&eacute; une nouvelle strat&eacute;gie dans

ses relations avec les pays d'Asie, visant &agrave; renforcer

la pr&eacute;sence &eacute;conomique europ&eacute;enne dans cette

r&eacute;gion, &agrave; am&eacute;liorer la compr&eacute;hension

mutuelle, et &agrave; d&eacute;velopper une nouvelle approche

politique.

<P>

<B>Ces nouvelles orientations constituent les r&eacute;ponses

de l'Union aux changements en cours sur la sc&egrave;ne politique

et &eacute;conomique internationale. Elles traduisent la vocation

universelle des relations ext&eacute;rieures de l'Union, mais

aussi leur caract&egrave;re diff&eacute;renci&eacute;.</B>

<P>

<H4>La relation entre l'Union europ&eacute;enne et les soixante-dix

pays d'Afrique des Cara&iuml;bes et du Pacifique entre progressivement

dans une phase nouvelle</H4>

<P>

La convention de Lom&eacute; organise depuis 1975 les relations

commerciales et financi&egrave;res entre l'UE et les pays ACP,

actuellement au nombre de soixante-dix. Engag&eacute;e d&egrave;s

1957, la politique de coop&eacute;ration communautaire a connu

plusieurs &eacute;tapes d&eacute;cisives. Apr&egrave;s les premi&egrave;res

ann&eacute;es au cours desquelles il s'agissait d'associer les

Pays et Territoires d'Outre-Mer &agrave; la Communaut&eacute;,

les relations de coop&eacute;ration se sont poursuivies dans le

cadre des conventions de Yaound&eacute;, et sont rest&eacute;es

principalement centr&eacute;es sur l'Afrique noire francophone

jusqu'au milieu des ann&eacute;es soixante-dix. Apr&egrave;s le

premier &eacute;largissement de la Communaut&eacute;, dans un

contexte &eacute;conomique international qui se modifiait sensiblement,

l'Europe a commenc&eacute; &agrave; &eacute;tendre le champ g&eacute;ographique

de sa politique de coop&eacute;ration: d'une part en ouvrant la

premi&egrave;re convention de Lom&eacute; &agrave; d'autres pays

ACP; d'autre part en nouant progressivement des relations d'association

et de coop&eacute;ration avec d'autres r&eacute;gions du monde

en d&eacute;veloppement.  

<P>

La convention de Lom&eacute; a fait l'objet d'adaptations successives

tous les cinq ans, qui ont permis d'ajuster le dispositif en fonction

des &eacute;volutions &eacute;conomiques et politiques, d'introduire

de nouveaux instruments de coop&eacute;ration et de fixer de nouvelles

priorit&eacute;s. Les derni&egrave;res adaptations datent de 1995.

<P>

L'Union a aussi d&eacute;velopp&eacute; progressivement, hors

convention de Lom&eacute;, d'autres instruments sp&eacute;cifiques

de coop&eacute;ration avec les pays en d&eacute;veloppement, en

cr&eacute;ant des lignes budg&eacute;taires th&eacute;matiques

(relatives &agrave; la d&eacute;sertification, &agrave; la lutte

contre le sida, ...) ou relevant d'autres politiques communautaires

- en particulier la politique scientifique &agrave; travers le

programme cadre de recherche et d&eacute;veloppement (PCRD) -,

qui peuvent servir d'appui &agrave; la politique de coop&eacute;ration

au d&eacute;veloppement. Les pays ACP sont notamment &eacute;ligibles

&agrave; ces diff&eacute;rents instruments. 

<P>

L'UE a par ailleurs d&eacute;fini de nouvelles orientations g&eacute;n&eacute;rales

de politiques dans un certain nombre de secteurs ou de domaines

de la coop&eacute;ration, &agrave; la suite du d&eacute;bat engag&eacute;

en 1992 sur &quot;les perspectives de la coop&eacute;ration &agrave;

l'horizon 2000&quot;, et afin de mettre en oeuvre les nouvelles

dispositions du Trait&eacute; concernant la politique europ&eacute;enne

de coop&eacute;ration.

<P>

<B>A la veille du 21&egrave;me si&egrave;cle, une r&eacute;flexion

approfondie s'impose sur les orientations futures des relations

de l'Union europ&eacute;enne avec les pays ACP. La proximit&eacute;

de l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance de la Convention actuelle, en f&eacute;vrier

2000, et l'obligation contractuelle d'entamer les n&eacute;gociations

entre les deux parties au plus tard dix-huit mois avant cette

date, ainsi que la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de d&eacute;finir,

dans le contexte des disciplines renforc&eacute;es de l'OMC, un

cadre de coop&eacute;ration commerciale en pleine conformit&eacute;

avec les nouvelles r&egrave;gles multilat&eacute;rales, fournissent

une occasion privil&eacute;gi&eacute;e de proc&eacute;der &agrave;

une telle r&eacute;flexion et d'engager un large d&eacute;bat

sur l'avenir des relations entre l'UE et les ACP.</B>

<P>

<H4>Le d&eacute;bat sur l'avenir des relations UE-ACP doit en premier

lieu tenir compte du nouveau contexte global</H4>

<P>

<B>Le nouveau paysage mondial non seulement modifie les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts

objectifs de l'Union et de ses partenaires en d&eacute;veloppement,

mais implique aussi des responsabilit&eacute;s accrues pour un

acteur de la taille de l'UE. Ces responsabilit&eacute;s sont en

premier lieu d'ordre politique :</B> l'Union doit soutenir activement

les processus d'ouverture engag&eacute;s parall&egrave;lement

&agrave; la fin de la guerre froide au cours de la seconde moiti&eacute;

des ann&eacute;es 1980, et en particulier contribuer &agrave;

assurer la permanence des processus de d&eacute;mocratisation

encore fragiles dans de nombreux pays ACP. <B>Ces responsabilit&eacute;s

sont aussi d'ordre &eacute;conomique :</B>  l'Union doit accompagner

les effets de la globalisation, en op&eacute;rant les ajustements

n&eacute;cessaires au plan interne pour redresser les perspectives

d'emploi et combattre les ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes d'exclusion,

en participant activement &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration &eacute;conomique

internationale, en contribuant &agrave; la formulation et au respect

de r&egrave;gles multilat&eacute;rales, et en facilitant l'insertion

progressive des pays en d&eacute;veloppement dans l'&eacute;conomie

mondiale. Parmi les diff&eacute;rents aspects de la mondialisation,

les mutations engag&eacute;es vers la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de

l'information contribuent notamment &agrave; une nouvelle donne

&eacute;conomique apportant tout &agrave; la fois des perspectives

sans pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents dans des domaines comme le commerce

international, l'&eacute;ducation ou la sant&eacute;, et des menaces

de marginalisation accentu&eacute;e pour les pays qui n'auraient

pas acc&egrave;s aux r&eacute;seaux mondiaux de l'information.

<P>

<B>Pour l'Europe, confront&eacute;e aux difficult&eacute;s d'ajustement

de ses syst&egrave;mes &eacute;conomiques et sociaux, &agrave;

la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de d&eacute;velopper son action politique

dans un monde devenu multipolaire, et de se pr&eacute;parer &agrave;

l'&eacute;largissement &agrave; l'Est, la coop&eacute;ration au

d&eacute;veloppement et en particulier sa relation avec les pays

ACP, prend d&eacute;sormais une dimension nouvelle: comment vouloir

affirmer un r&ocirc;le d'acteur mondial, sans une strat&eacute;gie

responsable &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des diverses r&eacute;gions

du Sud, notamment  les plus expos&eacute;es aux risques de pauvret&eacute;

et de marginalisation?</B>  

<P>

<B>Avec pour finalit&eacute; de contribuer &agrave; r&eacute;duire

la pauvret&eacute; et les in&eacute;galit&eacute;s de d&eacute;veloppement

dans le monde, l'action de l'Union est aussi &eacute;troitement

li&eacute;e &agrave; la poursuite des objectifs de paix et de

stabilit&eacute;, &agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de mieux

g&eacute;rer les interd&eacute;pendances et les menaces globales,

et de favoriser un mode de d&eacute;veloppement mondial plus compatible

avec les valeurs politiques et sociales europ&eacute;ennes.</B>

<P>

Enfin, la politique de coop&eacute;ration de l'Union constitue

pour l'Europe une voie d'entr&eacute;e dans des r&eacute;gions

qui ont un potentiel de d&eacute;veloppement important et qui

commencent &agrave; s'organiser.

<P>

<B>A l'approche du 21&egrave;me si&egrave;cle, la relation UE-ACP

devra se poursuivre sur des bases nouvelles, afin de tenir compte

de l'&eacute;volution des conditions politiques et &eacute;conomiques

du d&eacute;veloppement, mais aussi parce que les motivations

europ&eacute;ennes ont fondamentalement chang&eacute;.</B> La

p&eacute;riode coloniale et post-coloniale est r&eacute;volue,

et un environnement international politiquement plus ouvert permet

d&eacute;sormais d'&eacute;tablir de mani&egrave;re moins ambigu&euml;

les responsabilit&eacute;s de chaque partenaire.

<P>

<H4>Avec pour objectif premier d'accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&eacute;

de la coop&eacute;ration, ce d&eacute;bat doit en second lieu

se nourrir des le&ccedil;ons &agrave; tirer de l'exp&eacute;rience

acquise par la Communaut&eacute; au cours de quatre d&eacute;cennies

de coop&eacute;ration avec les ACP</H4>

<P>

Face &agrave; un bilan global mitig&eacute; de la coop&eacute;ration

UE-ACP et &agrave; un certain scepticisme quant aux possibilit&eacute;s

de d&eacute;veloppement des pays ACP, dans le contexte de pressions

budg&eacute;taires persistantes dans les pays donateurs et d'une

tendance au &quot;repli sur soi&quot; engendr&eacute;e par les

difficult&eacute;s sociales en Europe, les partenaires sont tenus

aujourd'hui de mettre l'accent sur l'efficacit&eacute; de leur

coop&eacute;ration et de revoir leurs priorit&eacute;s dans le

souci de mieux refl&eacute;ter les pr&eacute;occupations des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s

europ&eacute;ennes et des ACP.

<P>

La coop&eacute;ration communautaire repr&eacute;sente un apport

important pour un grand nombre de pays ACP, et il est ind&eacute;niable

qu'elle a contribu&eacute; &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration des

conditions de vie de leurs populations. Elle a souvent &eacute;t&eacute;

un laboratoire d'id&eacute;es nouvelles, et a d&eacute;velopp&eacute;

dans un certain nombre de domaines une expertise unanimement reconnue.

Mais comme toute coop&eacute;ration, elle pr&eacute;sente aussi

des faiblesses. Un examen critique des r&eacute;sultats de la

coop&eacute;ration UE-ACP permet de les identifier &agrave; trois

niveaux. 

<P>

<U><B>Tout d'abord, au niveau du cadre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral dans

lequel s'ins&egrave;rent les actions de coop&eacute;ration</B></U><B>:

force est de constater que le principe du partenariat a perdu

de sa substance et ne s'est que partiellement concr&eacute;tis&eacute;.</B>

En termes politiques, la d&eacute;pendance &agrave; l'&eacute;gard

de l'aide, les exigences du court terme et la gestion des situations

de crise ont progressivement domin&eacute; la relation entre les

deux partenaires. En termes de dialogue sur les politiques &eacute;conomiques

et sociales, le partenariat s'est av&eacute;r&eacute; difficile

&agrave; r&eacute;aliser avec des pays pr&eacute;sentant de faibles

capacit&eacute;s institutionnelles et des syst&egrave;mes de gestion

publique souvent peu efficaces; ces pays ont eu tendance &agrave;

limiter le partenariat &agrave; la co-gestion des ressources au

jour le jour. 

<P>

<U><B>Ensuite, au niveau des politiques de coop&eacute;ration</B></U><B>:

les &eacute;tudes d'&eacute;valuation engag&eacute;es par l'UE

ont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement conclu &agrave; la pertinence de

la coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re et technique</B> europ&eacute;enne

par rapport aux objectifs communautaires et par rapport aux besoins

des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, ainsi qu'&agrave; des taux

d'efficacit&eacute; relativement &eacute;lev&eacute;s, notamment

pour ce qui concerne <B>les projets d'infrastructures et les interventions

dans les secteurs sociaux. Cependant, le contexte institutionnel

et de politique &eacute;conomique dans le pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire

a souvent constitu&eacute; une contrainte majeure,</B> r&eacute;duisant

l'impact de la coop&eacute;ration communautaire en termes d'am&eacute;lioration

des conditions de vie et de rel&egrave;vement du niveau de d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

<B>L'impact des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales a, dans

l'ensemble, &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;cevant.</B> Ce dispositif,

et en particulier les Protocoles concernant des produits sp&eacute;cifiques,

a certes contribu&eacute; de mani&egrave;re significative aux

succ&egrave;s commerciaux de certains pays, qui ont su adopter

en m&ecirc;me temps des politiques de diversification appropri&eacute;es.

<B>N&eacute;anmoins dans la majorit&eacute; des pays ACP, les

politiques &eacute;conomiques et les conditions structurelles

internes n&eacute;cessaires au d&eacute;veloppement des &eacute;changes

&eacute;conomiques et commerciaux ont fait d&eacute;faut.</B>

En outre trois faits nouveaux doivent d&eacute;sormais &ecirc;tre

pris en consid&eacute;ration pour envisager un nouveau r&eacute;gime

commercial: les accords de Marrakech et le renforcement des m&eacute;canismes

de r&egrave;glement des diff&eacute;rends qui risquent de mettre

en question le maintien de r&eacute;gimes pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiels

diff&eacute;renci&eacute;s et non r&eacute;ciproques; l'acc&eacute;l&eacute;ration

des processus de lib&eacute;ralisation aux niveaux multilat&eacute;ral

et inter-r&eacute;gionaux; l'importance croissante de th&egrave;mes

nouveaux dans les discussions internationales sur les r&egrave;gles

commerciales, tels que l'environnement, les politiques de concurrence,

les codes d'investissement, les normes techniques et sanitaires,

le respect des droits sociaux fondamentaux, etc. Ces &eacute;volutions

modifient la valeur relative des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences tarifaires.

Un autre &eacute;l&eacute;ment devrait &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre

pris en consid&eacute;ration, &agrave; savoir la possibilit&eacute;

d'&eacute;tendre aux pays ACP les travaux en cours visant &agrave;

simplifier et &agrave; harmoniser les r&egrave;gles d'origine

en vigueur dans les accords pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiels.

<P>

<U><B>Enfin, au niveau de la pratique de la coop&eacute;ration

financi&egrave;re et technique</B></U><B>:</B> le caract&egrave;re

automatique de l'octroi d'une partie  - aujourd'hui limit&eacute;e

- des ressources financi&egrave;res, et la tendance de l'UE, comme

d'autres bailleurs de fonds, &agrave; se substituer au partenaire

d&eacute;faillant, n'ont pas encourag&eacute; l'engagement politique

r&eacute;el attendu de la part des gouvernements des pays ACP.

Une certaine d&eacute;rive s'est produite dans la mesure o&ugrave;

<B>les instruments de la coop&eacute;ration ont eu tendance &agrave;

dominer les politiques plut&ocirc;t que de les servir.</B> Un

manque de flexibilit&eacute; a pes&eacute; sur la capacit&eacute;

de la coop&eacute;ration &agrave; s'adapter &agrave; un contexte

&eacute;conomique et politique qui change rapidement, et &agrave;

r&eacute;percuter des initiatives politiques nouvelles traduisant

les pr&eacute;occupations des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s europ&eacute;ennes

et ACP ainsi que le souci d'am&eacute;liorer de mani&egrave;re

permanente l'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide.

<P>

<H4>Ce d&eacute;bat doit enfin prendre en consid&eacute;ration

les nouvelles perspectives politiques, &eacute;conomiques et sociales

dans les pays ACP</H4>

<P>

Dans un environnement mondial et r&eacute;gional en &eacute;volution

rapide, les d&eacute;fis pour les pays ACP sont multiples: interrompre

la marginalisation &eacute;conomique et s'int&eacute;grer dans

les &eacute;changes internationaux, op&eacute;rer la transformation

politique, &eacute;conomique et sociale interne n&eacute;cessaire

au fonctionnement d'une soci&eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;mocratique

et d'une &eacute;conomie de march&eacute;, assurer les conditions

d'un d&eacute;veloppement durable et d'une r&eacute;duction de

la pauvret&eacute; dans le contexte d'une pression d&eacute;mographique

qui demeure particuli&egrave;rement forte. 

<P>

<B>Le constat de la diff&eacute;renciation croissante qui se marque

entre les pays en d&eacute;veloppement en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral

et au sein du groupe des ACP en particulier, constitue sans doute

un &eacute;l&eacute;ment fondamental.</B> La transition politique

et &eacute;conomique a en effet atteint des stades tr&egrave;s

vari&eacute;s d'un pays &agrave; l'autre. L'action de l'Union

se mesurera en fonction de sa capacit&eacute; &agrave; all&eacute;ger

les contraintes qui p&egrave;sent sur le d&eacute;veloppement

des pays ACP et, en m&ecirc;me temps, &agrave; appuyer les facteurs

de changement qui se manifestent dans un nombre croissant de pays.

Elle se mesurera surtout, en termes plus politiques, en fonction

de sa capacit&eacute; &agrave; redonner une motivation forte &agrave;

sa politique &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des ACP, notamment l'Afrique

sub-saharienne. <B>L'image n&eacute;gative d'un continent &agrave;

la d&eacute;rive que l'on attribue souvent &agrave; l'Afrique

n'est pas le reflet de la r&eacute;alit&eacute; africaine. L'Afrique

n'est pas univoque.</B> Les bouleversements sans pr&eacute;c&eacute;dents

au plan politique et l'am&eacute;lioration r&eacute;cente des

performances de croissance dans un certain nombre de pays, qui

r&eacute;sulte fondamentalement d'une am&eacute;lioration de la

gestion des politiques &eacute;conomiques et de la mise en oeuvre

de r&eacute;formes structurelles, constituent &agrave; cet &eacute;gard

des signes tr&egrave;s encourageants.

<P>

Face &agrave; une perte de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; qui affecte

le principe m&ecirc;me de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement, dans

un environnement mondial pr&eacute;sentant &agrave; la fois des

risques et des opportunit&eacute;s nouvelles, l'Union et ses partenaires

ACP devront chercher &agrave; donner de plus grandes chances de

succ&egrave;s &agrave; leur relation de coop&eacute;ration. <B>Ceci

impliquera avant tout d'identifier les acquis de la coop&eacute;ration

UE-ACP qu'il conviendra de pr&eacute;server, de progresser dans

la formulation et dans la mise en oeuvre de certaines orientations

ou initiatives r&eacute;centes, et de d&eacute;finir parmi les

diff&eacute;rentes options &agrave; envisager celles qui traduiront

le mieux les objectifs et les engagements mutuels.</B>

<P>

<H4>Une relation politique plus forte entre l'UE et les pays ACP

est n&eacute;cessaire pour redonner un sens au partenariat</H4>

<P>

Les difficult&eacute;s constat&eacute;es dans la r&eacute;alisation

concr&egrave;te du &quot;partenariat&quot; ne doivent pas remettre

en cause sa valeur d'engagement politique mutuel. <B>La situation

particuli&egrave;re et les d&eacute;fis immenses auxquels sont

confront&eacute;s nombre de pays ACP justifient de pr&eacute;server

la force et les qualit&eacute;s du partenariat actuel,</B> en

particulier la pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; de la coop&eacute;ration

et son caract&egrave;re contractuel. <B>Mais cet engagement politique

doit d&eacute;sormais &ecirc;tre plus explicite et plus effectif.

</B>

<P>

L'Union et ses partenaires ACP sont-ils pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; un

tel renforcement?

<P>

<B>Du c&ocirc;t&eacute; de l'UE, le dialogue politique avec les

pays ACP doit avoir sa place dans la politique ext&eacute;rieure

commune.</B> Un dialogue permettant d'aborder de mani&egrave;re

moins formaliste les questions de gouvernance, de d&eacute;mocratisation

et de droits de l'homme, de la consolidation de l'Etat de droit

d'une part, le d&eacute;veloppement d'une v&eacute;ritable politique

europ&eacute;enne de pr&eacute;vention et de r&eacute;solution

des conflits d'autre part, apparaissent aujourd'hui comme les

conditions d'une politique europ&eacute;enne plus efficace. <B>Du

c&ocirc;t&eacute; des pays ACP, l'engagement d'accomplir les r&eacute;formes

institutionnelles et de mener les politiques &eacute;conomiques,

 sociales et environnementales correspondant aux grands engagements

pris lors des conf&eacute;rences internationales</B> de Rio, Vienne,

Le Caire, Copenhague, P&eacute;kin, Istanbul ou Rome, doit fonder

la base nouvelle du partenariat. Les actions d'appui de l'UE -

tout comme celles des autres bailleurs de fonds - peuvent avoir

des cons&eacute;quences politiques importantes pour ces pays;

la pertinence de ces actions d&eacute;pend elle-m&ecirc;me d'un

ensemble de conditions, notamment politiques. Les responsabilit&eacute;s

respectives &agrave; cet &eacute;gard doivent pouvoir s'exprimer

sur le terrain politique.

<P>

Un engagement politique mutuel sur ces bases impliquerait de d&eacute;finir

les modalit&eacute;s du dialogue envisag&eacute;, en fonction

des sujets jug&eacute;s prioritaires (questions de s&eacute;curit&eacute;

int&eacute;rieure, probl&eacute;matique des migrations, lutte

contre les trafics illicites, etc) et selon la configuration g&eacute;ographique

la plus appropri&eacute;e (dialogue global ou dialogue diff&eacute;renci&eacute;

par groupes de pays).

<P>

<B>Les relations Nord-Sud constituent l'un des &eacute;l&eacute;ments

de l'identit&eacute; ext&eacute;rieure de l'Union, et la relation

 particuli&egrave;re entre l'UE et les ACP s'inscrit dans cette

perspective &eacute;largie. </B>Le lien entre le volet politique

et le volet coop&eacute;ration, comme d'ailleurs avec la politique

commerciale multilat&eacute;rale, rel&egrave;ve du principe g&eacute;n&eacute;ral

de la coh&eacute;rence de l'action ext&eacute;rieure. Le renforcement

de la capacit&eacute; d'action ext&eacute;rieure de l'Union est

l'un des sujets importants abord&eacute; dans le cadre de la conf&eacute;rence

inter-gouvernementale (CIG). Dans son &quot;Avis&quot; pr&eacute;sent&eacute;

en vue de la CIG, la Commission s'est prononc&eacute;e en faveur

du rassemblement des &quot;diff&eacute;rents &eacute;l&eacute;ments

des relations ext&eacute;rieures en un tout efficace, par des

structures et des proc&eacute;dures qui renforcent la coh&eacute;rence

et la continuit&eacute; de l'action ext&eacute;rieure&quot;. Chacun

de ces &eacute;l&eacute;ments doit n&eacute;anmoins conserver

sa sp&eacute;cificit&eacute;; la politique communautaire de coop&eacute;ration

au d&eacute;veloppement doit en particulier garder une autonomie

suffisante pour r&eacute;pondre &agrave; ses objectifs propres,

qui s'inscrivent dans le long terme et impliquent une continuit&eacute;

d'action. <B>Ce lien impliquera toutefois une s&eacute;lectivit&eacute;

accrue de l'aide communautaire</B> dans l'optique d'en am&eacute;liorer

l'efficacit&eacute;, et devrait conduire &agrave; un am&eacute;nagement

des modalit&eacute;s pratiques de la coop&eacute;ration.

<P>

<H4>Le cadre de coop&eacute;ration devrait aussi &ecirc;tre adapt&eacute;

pour faciliter l'ouverture des pays ACP aux &eacute;changes internationaux</H4>

<P>

Quelques principes nouveaux faciliteraient une telle ouverture.

<P>

Tout d'abord, le principe de la diff&eacute;renciation: tous les

pays ACP ne peuvent, &agrave; l'heure actuelle, s'engager dans

un partenariat politique et &eacute;conomique standardis&eacute;

avec l'UE. <B>Une diff&eacute;renciation des politiques et des

modalit&eacute;s de coop&eacute;ration est devenue indispensable

pour des raisons d'efficacit&eacute;.</B>

<P>

En second lieu, les partenaires europ&eacute;ens et ACP doivent

s'efforcer de r&eacute;concilier deux exigences: d'un c&ocirc;t&eacute;,

la responsabilit&eacute; premi&egrave;re des r&eacute;formes et

des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement doit pouvoir &ecirc;tre

assum&eacute;e par les pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires; d'un

autre c&ocirc;t&eacute;, l'UE doit pouvoir rendre compte de l'utilisation

des ressources de la coop&eacute;ration vis-&agrave;-vis du citoyen

europ&eacute;en. Dans cette optique, <B>la seule alternative aux

actions d'aide traditionnelle passe par un approfondissement du

dialogue sur les politiques, une am&eacute;lioration de la capacit&eacute;

locale de conception des politiques et de planification, et un

suivi communautaire centr&eacute; sur les r&eacute;sultats et

les progr&egrave;s accomplis plut&ocirc;t que sur les moyens engag&eacute;s.</B>

La  mise en  oeuvre de politiques sectorielles concues comme cadre

permettant une meilleure utilisation des ressources et une coordination

plus pouss&eacute;e entre les bailleurs de fonds, proc&egrave;de

de cette d&eacute;marche.

<P>

Ensuite, l'<B>UE et les pays ACP doivent se donner pour ambition

de d&eacute;velopper de nouvelles formes de coop&eacute;ration:</B>

l'UE constitue un p&ocirc;le unique capable de proposer un large

&eacute;ventail d'outils et d'encourager des partenariats scientifiques,

&eacute;conomiques, et technologiques. De nouveaux modes de partenariat

pourraient notamment &ecirc;tre encourag&eacute;s dans des domaines

innovants comme celui de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de l'information;

des projets pilotes pourraient en effet contribuer &agrave; d&eacute;velopper

les flux d'&eacute;changes entre des communaut&eacute;s sp&eacute;cifiques

(les chercheurs par Internet) ou offrir des occasions concr&egrave;tes

de coop&eacute;ration (par exemple dans les services de t&eacute;l&eacute;communications).

<P>

Enfin, dans la m&ecirc;me ligne de pens&eacute;e, <B>une participation

plus active des acteurs non gouvernementaux (secteur priv&eacute;

et autres repr&eacute;sentants de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile)

pourrait &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;e</B> sous la forme d'un dialogue

sur les priorit&eacute;s de la coop&eacute;ration, et sous la

forme d'un acc&egrave;s direct &agrave; une partie des ressources

disponibles.

<P>

<H4>La couverture g&eacute;ographique du futur accord de partenariat

pourrait &ecirc;tre modifi&eacute;e</H4>

<P>

<B>Le groupe &quot;ACP&quot; ne constitue ni un groupement politique

ni une entit&eacute; &eacute;conomique &agrave; proprement parler.</B>

Il s'est constitu&eacute; pour des raisons &agrave; caract&egrave;re

essentiellement historique, dans le cadre des seules relations

avec l'UE. 

<P>

<B>Repr&eacute;sentera-t-il toujours demain un partenaire pertinent

pour l'Union?</B> En d'autres termes le cadre qui organise aujourd'hui

les relations avec les soixante-dix Etats ACP doit-il &ecirc;tre

maintenu?

<P>

Sans doute, il reviendra pour une part aux pays ACP eux-m&ecirc;mes

de d&eacute;finir leurs positions &agrave; cet &eacute;gard, en

fonction de leurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts communs et de leur volont&eacute;

de d&eacute;velopper une capacit&eacute; de n&eacute;gociation

en tant que groupe politique ou &eacute;conomique sur la sc&egrave;ne

internationale, en dehors de leur relation avec l'UE.

<P>

<B>Pour l'UE, il s'agira avant tout d'un choix politique, tenant

compte de la mani&egrave;re dont la coop&eacute;ration avec les

pays ACP s'ins&egrave;re dans l'ensemble des relations de l'Union

avec les pays en d&eacute;veloppement.</B>

<P>

D'autres facteurs devront &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre pris en

compte.

<P>

<B>La diversit&eacute; des situations au sein de la zone ACP,

la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de diff&eacute;rencier les objectifs

et les priorit&eacute;s de la coop&eacute;ration, ainsi que, le

cas &eacute;ch&eacute;ant, les r&eacute;gimes commerciaux, la

perspective d'une r&eacute;duction des besoins d'aide pour certains

pays et la possibilit&eacute; d'une graduation, pourraient motiver

un changement de la couverture g&eacute;ographique de l'accord

de coop&eacute;ration.</B> Une modification du r&eacute;gime de

pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences non r&eacute;ciproques diff&eacute;renci&eacute;es

(par rapport aux autres pays en d&eacute;veloppement) pourrait

en outre devenir incontournable, et impliquer des r&eacute;gimes

commerciaux diff&eacute;rents selon le type d'&eacute;conomies

concern&eacute;es. 

<P>

Enfin l'importance que l'UE attache aux processus de coop&eacute;ration

et d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale, pour des raisons &eacute;conomiques

autant que politiques, doit aussi influencer la configuration

d'un nouvel accord.

<P>

<H4>Quatre options peuvent &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;es:</H4>

<P>

<UL>

<LI><B>(1) le statu quo,</B> moyennant certaines adaptations. Le principe

d'un accord global avec l'ensemble des pays ACP pourrait &ecirc;tre

maintenu, mais en pr&eacute;voyant des modalit&eacute;s et des

priorit&eacute;s diff&eacute;rentes; 

<P>

<LI><B>(2) un accord global compl&eacute;t&eacute; par des accords

bilat&eacute;raux.</B> La diff&eacute;renciation serait pouss&eacute;e

plus loin, l'accord global ne comportant que des engagements de

nature tr&egrave;s g&eacute;n&eacute;rale;

<P>

<LI><B>(3) un &eacute;clatement de Lom&eacute; en accords r&eacute;gionaux.</B>

Un accord avec l'Afrique sub-saharienne, &eacute;tendu &agrave;

l'Afrique du Sud, serait manifestement significatif pour l'Europe;

lorsque l'&eacute;tat d'avancement de la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale

le permet, des accords sous-r&eacute;gionaux pourraient aussi

&ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;s. Dans les Cara&iuml;bes, diff&eacute;rentes

possibilit&eacute;s s'offrent aux partenaires: l'Union pourrait

notamment proposer une coop&eacute;ration &eacute;largie &agrave;

l'ensemble des pays du Bassin des Cara&iuml;bes et viser, &agrave;

terme, &agrave; int&eacute;grer la coop&eacute;ration avec ces

pays dans le cadre des relations qu'elle a d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es

avec l'Am&eacute;rique latine. Dans le Pacifique, un &eacute;largissement

du cadre de coop&eacute;ration &agrave; d'autres Etats insulaires

accro&icirc;trait l'efficacit&eacute; de la politique europ&eacute;enne,

notamment au plan des &eacute;changes avec les pays de l'APEC.

<P>

<LI><B>(4) un accord sp&eacute;cifique avec les pays les moins avanc&eacute;s

(PMA) de la zone ACP, &eacute;ventuellement ouvert &agrave; d'autres

PMA.</B> Cette option, qui n'exclut pas certains &eacute;l&eacute;ments

des trois options pr&eacute;c&eacute;dentes, permettrait de tenir

compte de la sp&eacute;cificit&eacute; des PMA, et d'adopter,

en particulier dans le domaine commercial, une politique mieux

adapt&eacute;e aux probl&egrave;mes et aux besoins de ces pays.

Concernant le volet politique et le volet de la coop&eacute;ration

financi&egrave;re toutefois, elle para&icirc;t peu adapt&eacute;e.

Elle doit en outre &ecirc;tre appr&eacute;ci&eacute;e au regard

de l'approche r&eacute;gionale traditionnellement suivie envers

les pays ACP. La question de la mondialisation des relations de

coop&eacute;ration de l'Union ne se pose plus dans les m&ecirc;mes

termes qu'en 1957 ou en 1975: l'Union entretient d&eacute;sormais

des relations de coop&eacute;ration avec un grand nombre de pays

et est pr&eacute;sente dans toutes les r&eacute;gions du monde.

</UL>

<P>

<H4>Pour &ecirc;tre plus efficace, l'Union doit adopter une approche

plus coh&eacute;rente et mieux coordonn&eacute;e vis-&agrave;-vis

des pays ACP</H4>

<P>

Le d&eacute;bat g&eacute;n&eacute;ral sur la coh&eacute;rence

de l'action europ&eacute;enne vis-&agrave;-vis des pays en d&eacute;veloppement

a d&eacute;bouch&eacute;, au cours des derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es,

sur un certain nombre d'initiatives destin&eacute;es d'une part

&agrave; examiner les effets des politiques communautaires autres

que la coop&eacute;ration sur les objectifs du d&eacute;veloppement,

d'autre part &agrave; renforcer la coordination entre la Communaut&eacute;

et les Etats membres ainsi qu'avec les autres bailleurs de fonds,

afin d'am&eacute;liorer l'efficacit&eacute; d'ensemble de la coop&eacute;ration.

<P>

M&ecirc;me si la situation actuelle est souvent jug&eacute;e peu

satisfaisante, <B>la coh&eacute;rence - au sens strict, c'est-&agrave;-dire

la prise en compte des effets externes des autres politiques -,

ne peut faire l'objet d'un engagement international de la Communaut&eacute;.</B>

La coh&eacute;rence demeure en effet une question d'appr&eacute;ciation

politique, face &agrave; des objectifs parfois conflictuels.

<P>

<B>Le d&eacute;ficit de coordination par contre pourrait &ecirc;tre

r&eacute;duit, non seulement en poursuivant activement les efforts

de coordination engag&eacute;s par l'UE au niveau des orientations

de politiques, au niveau op&eacute;rationnel et dans les enceintes

internationales, mais aussi en prenant, &agrave; l'occasion du

renouvellement de l'accord UE-ACP, des engagements sp&eacute;cifiques

nouveaux. Deux options peuvent &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;es</B>

&agrave; cet &eacute;gard:

<P>

<LI><B> l'Union pourrait se donner pour objectif de d&eacute;finir

une strat&eacute;gie europ&eacute;enne globale vis-&agrave;-vis

des pays ACP,</B> qui engagerait aussi bien les Etats membres

dans leurs actions nationales que la Communaut&eacute;. L'existence

d'un cadre de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence commun faciliterait la recherche

d'une meilleure compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute;, principe fix&eacute;

par le Trait&eacute;, et conduirait progressivement &agrave; une

plus grande efficacit&eacute; des diff&eacute;rentes interventions;

<P>

<LI><B>l'Union pourrait aussi proposer &agrave; ses partenaires

de mettre en place un m&eacute;canisme d'information, de suivi

et de coordination des actions et des politiques de coop&eacute;ration

des Etats membres et de la Communaut&eacute;.</B> Il s'agirait

donc d'un engagement de la part de l'Union d'assurer les conditions

d'une meilleure coordination. 

<P>

Une coordination europ&eacute;enne renforc&eacute;e est susceptible

de faire progresser les efforts de coordination entrepris au niveau

de l'ensemble des donateurs, ainsi qu'au sein du syst&egrave;me

multilat&eacute;ral dans le cadre du rapprochement inter-institutionnel

convenu lors du r&eacute;cent Sommet du G7, accordant une attention

particuli&egrave;re &agrave; l'Afrique.

<P>

<H4>Le nouveau contexte international, l'exp&eacute;rience du pass&eacute;

et les &eacute;volutions socio-&eacute;conomiques dans les Etats

ACP imposent de donner de nouvelles priorit&eacute;s &agrave;

la politique de coop&eacute;ration</H4>

<P>

Des orientations nouvelles ont &eacute;t&eacute; adopt&eacute;es

par l'Union au cours des ann&eacute;es r&eacute;centes, visant

notamment &agrave; int&eacute;grer de nouveaux th&egrave;mes ou

&agrave; red&eacute;finir les objectifs poursuivis dans diff&eacute;rents

secteurs ou domaines de la coop&eacute;ration. Ces orientations

conserveront, en toute hypoth&egrave;se, leur pertinence &agrave;

l'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance de l'an 2000, m&ecirc;me si l'exp&eacute;rience

acquise d'ici l&agrave; aura permis d'adapter ou de d&eacute;velopper

certains aspects. 

<P>

Mais au-del&agrave; de cet &quot;acquis&quot;, l'UE et ses partenaires

ACP pourraient se fixer de nouvelles priorit&eacute;s, tenant

compte des objectifs g&eacute;n&eacute;raux assign&eacute;s par

le Trait&eacute; &agrave; la politique communautaire de coop&eacute;ration

au d&eacute;veloppement, des succ&egrave;s et &eacute;checs du

pass&eacute;, et des contraintes et des potentialit&eacute;s des

pays ACP pour leur d&eacute;veloppement futur. <B>La politique

de coop&eacute;ration UE-ACP pourrait ainsi &ecirc;tre restructur&eacute;e

autour de trois axes: la dimension &eacute;conomique, sociale

et environnementale; la dimension institutionnelle; le commerce

et l'investissement.</B>

<P>

La distinction entre ces trois domaines de l'appui communautaire

ne doit certes pas conduire &agrave; une approche cloisonn&eacute;e;

au contraire, <B>ces diff&eacute;rents volets doivent se renforcer

mutuellement</B>. Ainsi l'am&eacute;lioration n&eacute;cessaire

de la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; des &eacute;conomies ACP passe

&agrave; la fois par des mesures de politiques externes et par

des mesures de politiques internes. De m&ecirc;me, l'accroissement

de l'emploi et le progr&egrave;s social sont intimement li&eacute;s

au d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; autant qu'&agrave;

l'am&eacute;lioration du fonctionnement de l'Etat.

<P>

Pour autant l'Union ne peut - et ne doit - pas tout faire: <B>la

diff&eacute;renciation croissante entre les pays de la zone ACP

doit au contraire l'inciter &agrave; adopter une coop&eacute;ration

modulable</B> et &agrave; intervenir dans des domaines qui pourraient

&ecirc;tre diff&eacute;rents d'un pays &agrave; l'autre. 

<P>

<H4>Dans sa dimension &eacute;conomique, l'appui communautaire

devrait viser &agrave; promouvoir l'insertion des pays ACP dans

l'&eacute;conomie mondiale</H4>

<P>

<B>Une strat&eacute;gie d'appui centr&eacute;e sur l'am&eacute;lioration

de la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; des &eacute;conomies ACP et

sur le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; et du commerce

pourrait comporter un ensemble d'actions</B> destin&eacute;es

&agrave; assurer la continuit&eacute; et accro&icirc;tre la cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;

des r&eacute;formes entreprises par ces pays. La premi&egrave;re

de ces actions doit sans aucun doute porter sur l'<B>appui &agrave;

la mise en place d'un cadre macro-&eacute;conomique stable, non

inflationniste et g&eacute;n&eacute;rateur de croissance.</B>

<P>

Ensuite, parmi les diff&eacute;rentes options possibles, les domaines

suivants peuvent faire l'objet d'une discussion approfondie:

<P>

<LI><B>une approche plus syst&eacute;matique des causes de la faiblesse

de l'investissement dans la plupart des pays ACP.</B> L'UE pourrait

jouer un r&ocirc;le positif en appuyant certaines r&eacute;formes

administratives et institutionnelles susceptibles de faciliter

la mobilisation de l'investissement priv&eacute;, en aidant &agrave;

la mise en place de politiques de la concurrence, au d&eacute;veloppement

de march&eacute;s des capitaux, &agrave; une modernisation du

droit des affaires et du droit de propri&eacute;t&eacute;, &agrave;

une politique de protection des consommateurs, &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation

et &agrave; la formation, ainsi que par le d&eacute;veloppement

de la coop&eacute;ration industrielle;

<P>

<LI>un appui, adapt&eacute; aux circonstances locales, dans le domaine

de la <B>restructuration des entreprises publiques et des privatisations,</B>

dans le contexte plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ral d'une &eacute;volution

du r&ocirc;le de l'Etat dans l'&eacute;conomie;

<P>

<LI>une <B>intensification de l'appui &agrave; l'ouverture sur les

march&eacute;s mondiaux et &agrave; l'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale.</B>

Une strat&eacute;gie globale dans ce domaine doit &agrave; la

fois comporter un appui au d&eacute;veloppement des capacit&eacute;s

(aux niveaux r&eacute;gional et national) et une aide pour faire

face aux co&ucirc;ts de transition;

<P>

<LI>la recherche de <B>partenariats</B> entre l'UE et les pays ACP,

qui mobilisent les ressources du secteur priv&eacute; dans le

<B>d&eacute;veloppement des infrastructures, notamment en mati&egrave;re

de t&eacute;l&eacute;communications</B>, et leur exploitation

dans des conditions &eacute;conomiques viables;

<P>

 <LI>un appui au d&eacute;veloppement des comp&eacute;tences <B>scientifiques</B>

et techniques;

<P>

<LI>une <B>coop&eacute;ration dans le domaine macro-&eacute;conomique

et mon&eacute;taire</B>; 

<P>

<LI>une action de soutien permettant d'all&eacute;ger la charge

de la<B> dette ext&eacute;rieure</B>, bien que la Communaut&eacute;,

en raison du degr&eacute; &eacute;lev&eacute; de concessionnalit&eacute;

de son aide, ne soit qu'une source marginale de l'endettement

des ACP.

<P>

<H4>Dans sa dimension sociale, l'appui communautaire devrait &ecirc;tre

renforc&eacute;</H4>

<P>

Pour l'UE, il existe de fortes motivations pour centrer les efforts

de coop&eacute;ration avec les ACP sur l'objectif de lutte contre

la pauvret&eacute;. Cet objectif constitue certes d&eacute;j&agrave;

un axe important de la politique de coop&eacute;ration actuelle.

N&eacute;anmoins, pour l'avenir, <B>l'Union et ses partenaires

ACP devront s'interroger sur la mani&egrave;re d'accro&icirc;tre

l'impact de la coop&eacute;ration communautaire sur la r&eacute;duction

de la pauvret&eacute;.</B>

<P>

Le principe d'une approche multiple impliquant un vaste &eacute;ventail

d'interventions devra &ecirc;tre maintenu. Mais une orientation

plus strat&eacute;gique pourrait &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;e par

chacun des partenaires dans deux directions. 

<P>

Tout d'abord, l'UE pourrait appuyer un ensemble de r&eacute;formes

et d'initiatives destin&eacute;es &agrave; favoriser une croissance

&eacute;quitable et cr&eacute;atrice d'emplois, &agrave; am&eacute;liorer

l'acc&egrave;s pour tous aux ressources productives notamment

&agrave; travers l'&eacute;ducation et la formation professionnelle.

<P>

Ensuite l'UE pourrait adopter une approche sectorielle plus globale,

s'appuyant sur un dialogue approfondi sur les politiques ayant

des effets sociaux importants, et sur une aide accordant une attention

particuli&egrave;re au financement des d&eacute;penses courantes

dans les secteurs sociaux. 

<P>

L'effort consenti en faveur des objectifs du d&eacute;veloppement

social pourrait en outre figurer parmi les crit&egrave;res &agrave;

prendre en compte pour l'octroi de l'aide communautaire, dans

l'hypoth&egrave;se d'une plus grande s&eacute;lectivit&eacute;

li&eacute;e &agrave; l'appr&eacute;ciation de la &quot;bonne gestion.&quot;

<P>

<H4>La protection de l'environnement devrait  &ecirc;tre int&eacute;gr&eacute;e

avec plus de force dans l'ensemble des appuis communautaires</H4>

<P>

Une strat&eacute;gie clairement d&eacute;finie devrait permettre

de mieux traduire les principes du d&eacute;veloppement durable

dans la r&eacute;alit&eacute; de la coop&eacute;ration. Outre

la poursuite des efforts actuels en termes d'&eacute;tudes d'impact

et d'actions positives sp&eacute;cifiques, une nouvelle politique

dans ce domaine devrait s'articuler autour de quelques priorit&eacute;s:

le <B>lien entre la pauvret&eacute; et la d&eacute;gradation de

l'environnement, l'&quot;internalisation&quot; des co&ucirc;ts

environnementaux, le d&eacute;veloppement des capacit&eacute;s

et une approche participative. </B>

<P>

L'UE peut jouer un r&ocirc;le constructif en incitant, dans le

cadre du dialogue sur les politiques, et en aidant les gouvernements

des pays ACP &agrave; d&eacute;velopper leurs capacit&eacute;s

d'analyse et de gestion des probl&egrave;mes d'environnement.

<P>

Certains th&egrave;mes tels que la quantit&eacute; et la qualit&eacute;

des ressources en eaux, la d&eacute;gradation des sols li&eacute;e

aux pressions d&eacute;mographiques, la destruction des for&ecirc;ts,

les probl&egrave;mes d'environnement urbain, m&eacute;ritent une

attention particuli&egrave;re.

<P>

<H4>L'UE pourrait jouer un r&ocirc;le plus actif dans le domaine

du d&eacute;veloppement institutionnel</H4>

<P>

L'importance des dysfonctionnements de l'Etat et l'acuit&eacute;

des probl&egrave;mes de gouvernance dans de nombreux pays ACP,

la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de r&eacute;habiliter ou de renforcer

l'Etat de droit pour assurer les conditions du d&eacute;veloppement

et d'une r&eacute;duction des in&eacute;galit&eacute;s et de la

pauvret&eacute;, devraient inciter les partenaires &agrave; d&eacute;velopper

le volet institutionnel de leur coop&eacute;ration. 

<P>

Mais l'UE doit aussi s'interroger sur la port&eacute;e d'une telle

action. A cet &eacute;gard, <B>le renforcement de la relation

politique entre l'UE et les pays ACP apparait comme le compl&eacute;ment

indispensable</B> d'une action de coop&eacute;ration visant &agrave;

appuyer le d&eacute;veloppement des capacit&eacute;s institutionnelles

et administratives dans un pays. Il s'agit en effet d'un processus

fondamentalement politique, dans la mesure o&ugrave; toute r&eacute;forme

dans ce domaine affecte les structures de pouvoir et rencontre

in&eacute;vitablement de fortes r&eacute;sistances.

<P>

<B>L'UE est-elle pr&ecirc;te &agrave; soutenir de fa&ccedil;on

plus strat&eacute;gique le processus de transition politique et

social n&eacute;cessaire?</B>

<P>

A c&ocirc;t&eacute; de cette dimension politique, l'appui au d&eacute;veloppement

institutionnel a aussi une composante plus &quot;technique&quot;.

De ce point de vue, l'Union est relativement bien plac&eacute;e

pour d&eacute;velopper son action dans ce domaine, notamment parce

qu'elle n'a pas de mod&egrave;le unique &agrave; faire valoir,

compte tenu de la diversit&eacute; des syst&egrave;mes d'organisation

sociale et politique des Etats membres, parce que l'exp&eacute;rience

de la construction communautaire lui a permis de d&eacute;velopper

un savoir-faire particulier, et enfin parce que le partenariat

constitue un cadre propice &agrave; ce type de coop&eacute;ration.

<P>

<B>L'action de l'UE pourrait se concentrer sur les th&egrave;mes

li&eacute;s &agrave; ses principaux domaines de coop&eacute;ration,

et en fonction de la valeur ajout&eacute;e qu'elle est susceptible

d'apporter</B> par rapport &agrave; d'autres bailleurs de fonds.

Ces th&egrave;mes sont notamment la promotion du respect des droits

de l'homme, l'appui aux organisations r&eacute;gionales, l'am&eacute;lioration

de la capacit&eacute; d'analyse et de conception des politiques

&eacute;conomiques et sociales et de pr&eacute;paration des r&eacute;formes,

la gestion budg&eacute;taire, l'am&eacute;lioration des syst&egrave;mes

juridiques, les r&egrave;gles de concurrence, la protection des

investisseurs, l'&eacute;ducation et la formation, la protection

de l'environnement, la politique des consommateurs, le d&eacute;veloppement

des institutions &eacute;manant de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile,

etc.

<P>

L'Union pourrait en outre consid&eacute;rer le d&eacute;veloppement

des capacit&eacute;s locales comme l'un des crit&egrave;res pr&eacute;sidant

au choix des modalit&eacute;s de mise en oeuvre de sa coop&eacute;ration

financi&egrave;re et technique.

<P>

<H4>Un nouveau r&eacute;gime commercial devra &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;,

qui soit coh&eacute;rent avec les choix strat&eacute;giques des

pays ACP en vue de leur insertion dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale</H4>

<P>

Dans un environnement &eacute;conomique et institutionnel interne

g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement peu favorable au d&eacute;veloppement

d'un secteur priv&eacute; comp&eacute;titif, &agrave; une progression

de l'investissement et &agrave; une diversification de la production,

<B>la plupart des pays ACP n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; en mesure

d'exploiter l'ensemble des possibilit&eacute;s qu'offraient les

pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences sp&eacute;ciales accord&eacute;es dans

le cadre de la convention de Lom&eacute;.</B> Les exportations

des pays ACP vers l'UE n'ont pas &eacute;chapp&eacute; &agrave;

la faiblesse g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des performances commerciales

de ces pays, et leur part du march&eacute; communautaire a sensiblement

recul&eacute;, passant de 6.7% en 1976 &agrave; 2.8% en 1994.

Bien que la situation varie sensiblement d'un pays ou d'une r&eacute;gion

&agrave; l'autre, le march&eacute; europ&eacute;en repr&eacute;sente

encore en moyenne plus de 40% des d&eacute;bouch&eacute;s pour

les ACP. 

<P>

Pour l'avenir, diff&eacute;rentes options pourront &ecirc;tre

envisag&eacute;es pour d&eacute;finir un (ou des) nouveau(x) r&eacute;gime(s)

commerciaux. Elles devront &ecirc;tre appr&eacute;ci&eacute;es

en fonction de leurs implications pour les relations UE-ACP, mais

aussi de leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; faciliter la diversification

des relations &eacute;conomiques ext&eacute;rieures des ACP et

&agrave; &eacute;carter les risques d'une marginalisation croissante.

<P>

<H4>Quatre options principales peuvent &ecirc;tre identifi&eacute;es:</H4>

<P>

<UL>

<LI>(1) le statu quo.</B> Le maintien d'un syst&egrave;me contractuel

de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences diff&eacute;renci&eacute;es non r&eacute;ciproques,

pourrait &ecirc;tre compl&eacute;t&eacute; par des actions de

coop&eacute;ration visant les domaines li&eacute;s au commerce

(normes et certification, environnement, concurrence, droits de

propri&eacute;t&eacute; intellectuelle, ..);

<P>

<LI>(2) l'application du syst&egrave;me de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;es</B> (SPG) de la Communaut&eacute;

sur une base bilat&eacute;rale ou multilat&eacute;rale. Ceci conduirait

&agrave; sortir les dispositions commerciales de l'accord de coop&eacute;ration,

et donc de la n&eacute;gociation, dans la mesure o&ugrave; il

s'agit d'une politique unilat&eacute;rale (&eacute;ventuellement

multilat&eacute;rale) de l'UE.

<P>

<LI>(3) une r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; uniforme.</B> Apr&egrave;s

une p&eacute;riode de transition, il s'agirait pour tous les pays

ACP d'accorder la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; &agrave; l'UE, en

conformit&eacute; avec les r&egrave;gles de l'OMC. Comme dans

le premier cas de figure, une coop&eacute;ration &eacute;largie

aux nouveaux domaines pourrait &ecirc;tre d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e.

<P>

<LI>(4) une r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; diff&eacute;renci&eacute;e.</B>

Des r&eacute;gimes de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences r&eacute;ciproques

pourraient &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;s entre l'UE et diff&eacute;rents

groupes de pays, ou entre l'UE et des pays individuels. Cette

option pourrait &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre compl&eacute;t&eacute;e

par une coop&eacute;ration dans les nouveaux domaines figurant

sur l'agenda de l'OMC.

</UL>

<P>

<B>Ces diff&eacute;rentes options ne sont pas exclusives. Elles

pourraient aussi &ecirc;tre combin&eacute;es,</B> de fa&ccedil;on

&agrave; permettre d'adapter le r&eacute;gime commercial en fonction

du niveau de d&eacute;veloppement des diff&eacute;rents pays concern&eacute;s,

et de la volont&eacute; d'approfondir les relations.

<P>

Avant de faire un choix en faveur de l'une ou l'autre de ces options,

une analyse approfondie de leurs effets potentiels, pour l'UE

et pour les ACP, devra &ecirc;tre effectu&eacute;e.

<P>

<H4>L'Union pourrait &eacute;galement appuyer l'adoption d'un accord

sur la protection de l'investissement priv&eacute; &eacute;tranger</H4>

<P>

Des propositions ont d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; examin&eacute;es

dans ce domaine depuis la quatri&egrave;me convention de Lom&eacute;.

Des accords internationaux sont en voie d'&ecirc;tre n&eacute;goci&eacute;s,

et la Commission s'efforce de faire progresser les discussions

dans le cadre de l'OMC. Des n&eacute;gociations sont &eacute;galement

en cours au sein de l'OCDE en vue d'un Accord Multilat&eacute;ral

sur l'Investissement.

<P>

Dans l'intervalle, une coop&eacute;ration &agrave; un niveau sous-r&eacute;gional

ou par groupes de pays rationaliserait d&eacute;j&agrave; sensiblement

les n&eacute;gociations, qui ne se font aujourd'hui que sur un

plan bilat&eacute;ral (d'Etat &agrave; Etat). Une telle initiative

constituerait un stimulant significatif pour l'investissement

priv&eacute;.

<P>

<H4>L'Union devrait aussi revoir les modalit&eacute;s pratiques

de sa coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re et technique</H4>

<P>

L'&eacute;volution vers un partenariat plus &quot;responsable&quot;,

l'exigence accrue d'efficacit&eacute;, et la prise en compte des

niveaux de d&eacute;veloppement sensiblement diff&eacute;rents

auxquels sont arriv&eacute;s certains pays ACP, imposent de revoir

fondamentalement les modalit&eacute;s de mise en oeuvre de l'aide

communautaire aux ACP.

<P>

<H4>Vers une nouvelle logique instrumentale.</H4>

<P>

La convention de Lom&eacute; dispose aujourd'hui d'un large &eacute;ventail

d'instruments r&eacute;pondant &agrave; des objectifs sp&eacute;cifiques

et soumis &agrave; des proc&eacute;dures de gestion diff&eacute;rentes,

parfois complexes. Leur utilisation simultan&eacute;e dans un

m&ecirc;me pays ne favorise pas la transparence de la politique

men&eacute;e par l'UE. <B>La question se pose sans doute de savoir

si l'UE ne devrait pas s'orienter vers la fixation d'enveloppes

financi&egrave;res globales,</B> en distinguant &eacute;ventuellement

entre les op&eacute;rations r&eacute;pondant &agrave; des situations

de crise et les actions de long terme, ainsi qu'entre les actions

d'appui au secteur public et au secteur priv&eacute;.

<P>

<H4>Vers une plus grande s&eacute;lectivit&eacute; de l'aide.</H4>

<P>

Le caract&egrave;re automatique de l'allocation des ressources

d'aide programmable a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; sensiblement

r&eacute;duit depuis la r&eacute;vision de Lom&eacute; IV &agrave;

mi-parcours, et un crit&egrave;re qualitatif nouveau a &eacute;t&eacute;

introduit, permettant d'adapter les montants d'aide allou&eacute;s

par pays en fonction des efforts consentis par un gouvernement

dans ses politiques sectorielles et dans sa politique macro-&eacute;conomique.

Cette &eacute;volution traduit l'exigence accrue d'efficacit&eacute;

de la part de l'UE. Elle correspond aussi &agrave; une conception

nouvelle du partenariat fond&eacute;e sur des engagements r&eacute;ciproques

et selon laquelle l'aide ext&eacute;rieure est destin&eacute;e

&agrave; soutenir des efforts de r&eacute;forme interne. L'UE

devrait donc &ecirc;tre tent&eacute;e de poursuivre dans cette

voie. En m&ecirc;me temps, les avantages de la programmation en

termes de pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; des flux de financement

ext&eacute;rieurs pour les ACP, et parce qu'elle suppose l'existence

d'un cadre strat&eacute;gique minimum, devraient l'inciter &agrave;

maintenir un syst&egrave;me de programmmation pluri-annuelle.<B>

L'UE devra d&eacute;cider dans quelle mesure elle souhaite compl&eacute;ter

le crit&egrave;re des besoins, essentiellement fond&eacute; sur

des indicateurs de d&eacute;veloppement, par des crit&egrave;res

de &quot;performance&quot; ou de &quot;bonne gestion&quot;, et

donner plus de flexibilit&eacute; &agrave; sa politique</B> en

adoptant par exemple une programmation glissante.

<P>

<H4>Aide-projets ou aide directe aux budgets.</H4>

<P>

L'&eacute;valuation des instruments communautaires a permis de

d&eacute;gager un certain nombre de conclusions op&eacute;rationnelles.

Elle a notamment soulign&eacute; l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t de renforcer

l'approche sectorielle et l'appui aux r&eacute;formes, d&eacute;j&agrave;

largement mis en oeuvre sous Lom&eacute; IV, et de mettre l'accent

sur l'am&eacute;lioration du cadre institutionnel et de la capacit&eacute;

locale de conception des politiques &eacute;conomiques et sociales,

int&eacute;gr&eacute;es dans une strat&eacute;gie de long terme.

<B>Dans cette optique, l'UE doit-elle d&eacute;finitivement  abandonner

l'approche-projets, et s'efforcer de cr&eacute;er les conditions

pour accorder son appui sous la forme d'une aide directe aux budgets

des Etats concern&eacute;s et d'un appui aux politiques sectorielles?</B>

<P>

Une telle &eacute;volution devrait aussi s'accompagner d'une r&eacute;forme

de la conditionnalit&eacute;, en concertation avec l'ensemble

des bailleurs de fonds. D'une part, il s'av&egrave;re n&eacute;cessaire

de trouver un consensus sur un ensemble, limit&eacute;, de crit&egrave;res

significatifs, plut&ocirc;t que de poursuivre dans la voie des

ann&eacute;es r&eacute;centes, qui ont vu se multiplier des conditionnalit&eacute;s

souvent tr&egrave;s sp&eacute;cifiques. D'autre part, pour &ecirc;tre

efficace et avoir un r&eacute;el effet incitatif sur les politiques

nationales, la conditionnalit&eacute; doit &ecirc;tre &agrave;

la fois r&eacute;aliste (tenant compte des facteurs politiques

et institutionnels autant qu'&eacute;conomiques et sociaux), globale

(fond&eacute;e sur une appr&eacute;ciation de l'ensemble des politiques

macro-&eacute;conomique et sectorielles men&eacute;e par un gouvernement)

et rigoureuse. Les services de la Commission ont fait des propositions

en ce sens aux autres bailleurs de fonds dans le cadre du Programme

Sp&eacute;cial pour l'Afrique (SPA), en vue d'adopter une nouvelle

approche qui permette de mieux concilier les objectifs de d&eacute;veloppement

&agrave; long terme et les imp&eacute;ratifs du court terme, et

qui favorise l'appropriation des r&eacute;formes par les pays

b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires. 

<P>

<H4>Vers un nouveau mode de gestion.</H4>

<P>

<B>Le r&eacute;gime de la co-gestion a montr&eacute; ses limites:</B>

il p&egrave;se sur l'efficacit&eacute; du syst&egrave;me et il

ne favorise pas l'appropriation des r&eacute;formes et des programmes

de d&eacute;veloppement par les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires. Ce

r&eacute;gime doit donc &ecirc;tre remis en cause. <B>Quelles

sont les alternatives, pour assurer &agrave; la fois une fiabilit&eacute;

suffisante dans la gestion des ressources, et encourager la responsabilit&eacute;

des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires,</B> elle-m&ecirc;me condition

d'une aide plus efficace? <B>Une approche diff&eacute;renci&eacute;e

et &eacute;volutive pourrait &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;e,</B>

permettant de d&eacute;finir le mode de gestion le plus appropri&eacute;

au cas par cas, en fonction de crit&egrave;res tels que la qualit&eacute;

du dialogue sur les politiques, les progr&egrave;s enregistr&eacute;s

dans leur mise en oeuvre, le caract&egrave;re additionnel des

ressources communautaires par rapport &agrave; l'effort national,

ou l'existence de m&eacute;canismes de coordination des aides

ext&eacute;rieures par le pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire.

<P>

Enfin, comme elle l'a fait de mani&egrave;re constante, la Commission

recommande la budg&eacute;tisation du fonds europ&eacute;en de

d&eacute;veloppement (FED). La budg&eacute;tisation donnerait

un v&eacute;ritable statut communautaire &agrave; la partie de

l'aide g&eacute;r&eacute;e par la Commission, facilitant ainsi

les synergies positives entre les diff&eacute;rents domaines de

l'action europ&eacute;enne. Parall&egrave;lement, les op&eacute;rations

de pr&ecirc;t de la BEI aux pays ACP pourraient &ecirc;tre soumises

aux m&ecirc;mes modalit&eacute;s que celles qui s'appliquent &agrave;

ses op&eacute;rations dans d'autres pays tiers, en particulier

en ce qui concerne l'approvisionnement du Fonds de Garantie pour

les op&eacute;rations externes.

<h3>CLASSES UNDER THE MANGO TREE FAIL TEACHING TEST</h3>
<i>
Education is often touted as the answer to every problem. But the presence of 
schools does not guarantee education. After spending several weeks in a 
Ghanaian village on assignment for <b>Gemini News Service, Isabella Gyau</b> reports 
on class conflict.<p>


By <b>ISABELLA GYAU</b>,
21 May 1996,<br>
Offuman village, Ghana  </i><hr><p>


Theresa Boateng is regarded as educated, but she cannot read letters or write 
correspondence for the old women whose children have travelled abroad. <p>

Nor can she write the names of people who donate money during funerals, or 
fill in funeral announcement and invitation forms.<p>

Theresa, a senior secondary school graduate in Offuman village, Ghana, is 
unperturbed. "I am not the only person like that," she says.<p>

She is right. About 70 per cent of the 2,000 villagers are illiterate and most 
of the young people who have been to school are, at best, semi-literate.<p>

One teacher attributes the low level of literacy to a general lack of interest 
in education: "Their interest lies in fufu  [a universally popular dish made 
from cassava] and garden eggs [a vegetable used in stews and soups] and nothing 
else." <p>

He says the children have no contact with the outside world, and so nothing 
challenges them to study and improve their lot. <p>

Girls face particularly difficult barriers. Some parents believe that however 
educated a women is, she will end up in a man's kitchen. So they are not keen 
on educating their daughters.<p>

"Because of this, whenever a female child threatens to drop out of school, the 
parents welcome the idea," says the teacher.<p>

"I have tried my best to educate them about women who have achieved high 
academic laurels as a result of interest in education," he says, "but it seems 
the girls are only interested in marriage.  For them, marrying at 20 is too 
late." <p>

As a result, about 95 per cent of adult women in Offuman are illiterate.
There are many other problems. Nursery school teacher Docia says: "It all 
begins at the pre-school level, where the child's interest in education could 
be developed." <p>

She says most parents refuse to send their children to nursery school, saying 
they cannot afford the fees. <p>

She also blames parents who fail to dress their children properly for school: <p>

"Some come in tattered clothes and sometimes their friends tease them." 
Consequently, the youngsters do not feel happy in school.<p>

Parents blame the poor facilities. One says: "The Methodist school classroom 
floors are not cemented and children face all sort of insect bites which 
sometimes make them cry their lungs out." <p>

Headmaster Ahima Boateng admits that a shortage of classrooms and teachers 
poses a big problem.<p>

There are no classrooms for the three final primary classes, although they are 
now under construction: "The children have been studying under the mango trees, 
and they will have to stay there until we finish the new building."<p>

He says that about 1.2 million cedis have been spent so far, with assistance 
coming from the parent-teachers' association and the local Methodist Church. <p>

The Methodist junior secondary school is reddening with age, and has no 
staffroom. A teacher says: "We have to sit around a big table on the verandah 
outside the school because the school hasn't got enough rooms for us." <p>

The junior secondary school run by the local authority also lacks classrooms. <p>

It is situated in a building used for tobacco  processing. Windows have been 
added to give light.<p>

"Accommodation for teachers has been a keen factor in the poor educational 
standard in the village," says Esther, a primary school teacher. "My landlady 
is ejecting me because I cannot afford to pay a 60,000 cedis advance for the 
room I am living in."<p>

Esther says that "since I am teaching their children, I think I deserve some 
kind of mercy from the village. I don't come from this place and if they don't 
want me to stay, I am prepared to leave for my village." <p>

The children themselves are aware of their plight and complain about 
conditions.  <p>

"When I was in primary four, for a whole term we had no teacher. We would go 
to school and come back home," recalls Mensah, a school-leaver. 
Books are scarce.<p>

Says Martha: "When I was in primary school, our teacher would always come in 
with the English textbook neatly covered to prevent it from getting dirty. We 
never saw the cover of the primary four English book."<p>

The junior secondary schools have been given a number of books under the 
government's library scheme. But a teacher moans: "Even the few children who 
are able to read are not interested in the books. No children borrow the 
books." <p>

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Ken Saro-Wiwa Sentenced to Death</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>

<center><h2>Ken Saro-Wiwa and other leaders get death sentence</h2></center>
<p>

Nigerian activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other human rights campaigners have been sentenced to death.<p>

Five other defendants were acquitted of the murder charges.  The sentences are mandatory and carry no right of appeal.  Before executions can be carried out, however, the sentences must by approved by the Provisional Ruling Council.<p>

Saro-Wiwa is president of the Movement for the Survival of the Ogoni Peoples, which campaigned to protect the rights of the indigenous inhabitants of the oil-rich Ogoni region of south-eastern Nigeria.  The deputy president, Ledum Mitee, was acquitted.<p>

The Ogoni claim to be facing oppression both from Nigeria's military government and by multinational oil companies - including the Anglo-Dutch Shell Oil company.<p>

Saro-Wiwa and the other Ogoni were charged with murder after a mob riot left four moderate Ogoni leaders dead.  Saro-Wiwa and his fellow defendants were denied access to their families, doctors and legal counsel for eight months before being charged with the crimes.<p>

Supporters of Saro-Wiwa worldwide claim that the trial was flawed, and that the defendants were framed to suit the political aims of the military dictatorship.   Saro-Wiwa and the other accused were tried by a Special Military Tribunal.  <p>

The defence produced strong evidence that key prosecution witnesses were bribed to testify against Saro-Wiwa, but this was rejected by the judge.  The defence subsequently resigned, protesting that the outcome of the trial was clearly pre-determined.<p>

Ken Saro-Wiwa has proclaimed his innocence, and said that in life or death his ideas - about peaceful resistance and human rights - would remain.<p>

The British Government has condemned the trial as flawed and objected to the sentences.  Nigeria will also face strong criticism of its human rights record at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Auckland on November 10 - 13.<p>

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Ken Saro-Wiwa Verdict Expected</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">OneWorld News Service

<p><b><font size=-1>This material has been provided by the Ogoni Community Association UK</font></b>
<center><h2>Ken Saro-Wiwa verdict <br>expected Tuesday 31 October</h2></center>
<p>

<br><b>The verdict in the murder trials of Ogoni leaders, including writer, environmentalist and 1996 Nobel Peace prize nominee Ken Saro-Wiwa, is expected by Tuesday the 31st of October 1995.  If found guilty they will be sentenced to death.  The sentences are mandatory and there is no right of appeal.</b><br><br><font size=-1>Photo ©Copyright:
 Catma Films.  Still taken from <a href="../../owbt/drilling_video.html">The Drilling Fields.</a></font><br clear=left><p>

Ken Wiwa, son of Ken Saro-Wiwa stated in London that: "We have every reason to expect that they will be found guilty and sentenced to death.  But we have long known that this trial is a politically motivated prosecution with very little basis in fact.  The verdict will be a judgement on the Nigerian regime and their contempt for justice, the rule of law, democracy and human rights.  The world is watching to see what will happen."<p>

Ken Saro-Wiwa and 15 other Ogonis were arrested in May 1994 following the deaths of four Ogoni chiefs during a mob riot.  Saro-Wiwa, who has been declared an <a href="../../amnesty/index.html">Amnesty International</a> Prisoner of Conscience along with Ledum Mitee and Dr Barinem Kiobel, were held in leg irons, denied access to their families, doctors and legal counsel for eight months before being charged and brought before a special Civil Disturbances Tribunal in February of 1995.<p>

The 500,000 strong Ogoni people of Nigeria are fighting for their survival under growing pressure from multinational oil companies and the Nigerian government.  An indigenous ethnic group, the Ogoni people reside on 400 square miles of oil-rich and fertile land in the Niger River Delta of southeastern Nigeria.<p>

Operating in partnership with the Nigerian authorities, several multinational oil companies, including the Anglo-Dutch Shell Oil company, have exported an estimated $30 billion worth of oil and gas from Ogoniland in the past 35 years.  In return the Ogonis have not seen any of the benefits of this oilfall, instead their environment has been destroyed - forever.<p>

In 1990 the Ogonis formed the Movement for the Survival of Ogoni People (MOSOP) to fight their economic and environmental exploitation in Nigeria.  In January 1993, 300,000 Ogonis came out in support of the movement and its ideals.  MOSOP declared Shell persona non grata until they regained the confidence of the community.  Soon after Shell claimed that they had withdrawn from Ogoni lands.<p>

In reaction to the peaceful Ogoni protests, the Nigerian military dictatorship sent a Military Task Force into Ogoni in April 1994 to "pacify and sanitise Ogoniland of the MOSOP virus" and to "allow Shell to return to the community".  Since the arrest of Saro-Wiwa in May 1994, many villages have been razed, women and children have been raped, more than 80,000 Ogonis displaced and more than 2000 people killed by the Task Force.<p>

The oppression in Ogonilands has been well documented in reports by Greenpeace, <a href="../../amnesty/index.html">Amnesty International,</a> the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, the Washington based <a href="gopher://gopher.humanrights.org:5000/11/int/hrw">Human Rights Watch</a> and the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organisation (UNPO) at the Hague.<p>

Independent observers have found that the Special Military Tribunal falls short of internationally acceptable legal standards.  British lawyer Michael Birnbaum QC, who attended court proceedings and has compiled a comprehensive report for Article XIX, reported that "there were grave doubts as to the legality and fairness of the proposed trial".<p>

After Justice Auta, the Chairman of the Tribunal, rejected defence evidence of the bribing of two former prosecution witnesses to testify against Saro-Wiwa, the defence resigned.  They felt that the outcome of the trial was obviously pre-determined.<p>

Saro-Wiwa declined any further legal assistance in his defence and instead read a final statement to the Tribunal last week:<p>

"I predict a denoument of the riddle of the Niger delta will soon come.  The agenda is being set at this trial.  Whether the peaceful ways I have favoured will prevail depends on what the oppressor decides, what signals it sends out  to the waiting public.<p>

<b>In my innocence of the false charges I face here, in my utter conviction, I call upon the Ogoni people, the peoples of the Niger delta, and the oppressed ethnic minorities of Nigeria to stand up now and fight fearlessly and peacefully for their rights.  History is on their side, God is on their side."</b><p>

<h3>ALGERIA: AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL CONDEMNS MASSACRES OF

CIVILIANS</h3>

<p>

<h4>12 FEBRUARY 1997</h4>

<p>

Amnesty International condemns in the strongest terms the massacres of 
civilians which continue

to

be committed daily in Algeria.  The organisation calls on all those 
involved in the conflict to put

an

immediate end to the targeting of civilians.

<p>

     In the past weeks, hundreds of people have been shot dead, 
slaughtered, decapitated or

mutilated in targeted attacks.  Others have been killed and blown to 
pieces in bomb explosions

in

public places.  Among the victims were men, women and children, including 
relatives of

members

of the security forces and of government-backed militias, as well as 
relatives of members of

armed

groups defined as &quot;Islamic&quot; groups.

<p>

     Armed groups such as the <I>Groupe Islamique Arm&eacute;</I> (Armed 
Islamic

Group), GIA, or the <I>Front Islamique pour le Djihad Arm­</I> (Islamic 
Front for the Armed

Jihad), FIDA, which have claimed murders and attacks, continue to issue 
death threats against

civilians.

<p>

     &quot;Such atrocities cannot be justified under any circumstances.  
Those responsible for

such crimes continue to show their utmost contempt for the respect for 
human life,&quot;

Amnesty

International said. 

<p>

     The murders and bloody attacks of these past few weeks have taken 
place in the context of

the increased level of violence of the last three months.  However, while 
massacres and

explosions

form part of a terrifying daily reality, the Algerian authorities 
continue to claim that there is only

&quot;residual violence&quot;.

<p>

     The civilian population, especially in rural and isolated areas, 
often does not benefit from

any protection from the security services, who have been replaced in 
several regions by civilian

militias armed by the state.  Thus, it is often left to the civilian 
population, which is more and

more

vulnerable to attacks by armed groups, to find ways of protecting 
themselves and to take the law

into their own hands.

<p>

     The censorship of information defined as 
&quot;security-related&quot; and the restrictions

imposed on the media makes it impossible for the Algerian and 
international press to investigate

and freely inform the public.   Therefore, massacres go unreported and 
figures given by official

sources for the number of victims are often much lower than in reality.

<p>

     &quot;Concrete measures must urgently be taken to protect the 
civilian population.  

Thorough and transparent investigations must be carried out so as to 
ensure that those

responsible

for these atrocities are brought to justice,&quot; Amnesty International 
said.

<p>

     &quot;This is the responsibility and the duty of the Algerian 
authorities, but also of the

international community, which to date continues to ignore the plight of 
the civilian population in

Algeria,&quot; added the organisation.

<h1>Oxfam UK/I Briefing paper on the proposed new ILO convention on home-working</h1></center>

<li>See also Oxfam Press Release on June 20 - <b><a href="../news/home_june20.html">ILO Members Take Historic Decision to Benefit the World's Homeworkers.</a></b><p>



<h3>Introduction</h3>

According to the ILO, the International Labour Organisation, <i>homeworking is a primary growing source of income for a great number of workers throughout the world, and is on the increase in many countries.  </i>home working can offer new sources of employment and provide an opportunity for workers to balance employment and family responsibilities. It gives employers greater flexibility to meet rapidly changing markets and can make an important contribution to a country's export earnings and GNP. <br><p>

However, it also brings serious problems. The ambivalent employment status of homeworkers, their isolation, and weak bargaining position often leads to abuse. Homeworkers are often unprotected by employment legislation or collective bargaining agreements and therefore denied many of the most basic employment rights enjoyed by other workers. In Oxfam's experience they rank among some of the least protected, most vulnerable, and badly paid groups of workers. For example, according to an ILO study, "in Latin America piece-rates paid to homeworkers in urban areas are less than those paid in factories... and those doing homework in rural areas fall to the very bottom of the wage scale".  Not only do these conditions cause great personal suffering they also incur wider social and economic costs which are examined in this briefing. <br><p>

The low pay and poor conditions of homeworkers is of immediate concern to Oxfam UK/I's Clothes Campaign, which is aimed at improving working conditions in the garment industry, where homeworking is widespread. Homeworking is also an important focus of Oxfam's advocacy work with governments, the IMF, and World Bank to improve employment protection for vulnerable and marginalised groups of low paid workers. Oxfam UK/I supports homeworking groups in various sectors and countries around the world:  SEWA (The Self Employed Women's Association) in India; a recently formed organisation in South Africa called SEWU (the Self-Employed Women's Union); the National Homework Group in the UK; sweat-shop workers and homeworkers in the garment and shoe sector in Chile; NGOs working on the issue in Peru. Other members of the Oxfam International family also have contacts with organisations working with these groups in their own countries.<br><p>

Oxfam UK/I is urging government and employer delegations to support the proposal for a new ILO Convention and Recommendation on Homework at the next ILO Conference (General Assembly) in June 1996.  It believes that the proposed Convention offers a useful middle way between regulating homeworkers out of existence, or leaving them at the mercy of a global economy which confines them to low pay and poor conditions. A vote in favour would have a positive impact on the living and working conditions of millions of homeworkers in countries all over the world. <br><p>
<h3>Who are homeworkers ? </h3>

There are many different definitions of the term homework.  The new Convention is aimed at those who carry out paid work in their own home and who are dependent on an outside employer or sub-contractor for the supply of their work; rather than the genuinely self-employed, independent workers or small businesses who are largely in control of their own work.<br><p>
The definition of homework in the proposed ILO Convention is: work carried out by a person for remuneration in his or her home or in other premises of his or her own choice, other than the workplace of the employer, which results in a product or service as specified by the employer, irrespective of who provides the equipment, materials or other inputs used, as long as this person does not have the degree of autonomy and of economic independence necessary to be considered an independent worker under national laws, regulations or court decisions. <br><p>
According to HomeNet International, an International Network of Homeworkers, it is often groups who face discrimination in the wider labour market - women, people with disabilities, people from ethnic minorities, or migrant workers - who end up working from home. The vast majority of homeworkers globally are women - at least 80 percent according to the ILO - many of whom are caught between the urgent need for work and the need to be at home to look after their children. Contrary to common perception, most surveys reveal that the majority choose homeworking because of their urgent need for money, and generally use the income for essential items rather than 'pin' money.<br><p>
According to HomeNet International, homework is found in many different forms,  in northern and southern countries, in urban and rural areas, and in traditional and modern sectors. It is widespread in some industrial sectors especially in textiles and garments. It is also found in the electronic, leather, and car industries.  Homework in the rural sector is also common and may involve processing agricultural or forest produce; packing and cleaning fruit and vegetables; and processing fish products. It is also increasingly common in the service sector, and the rapidly evolving forms of new technology has also increased teleworking from home.<br><p>
<h3>Homeworking - a growing phenomena</h3>

Official government statistics seldom include data on sub-contracting, home-based workers, or businesses which are not legally registered. They also often fail to distinguish between the genuinely self-employed and those dependent on others for their work. However, evidence from household surveys conducted by the ILO, homeworking groups, academics and others, suggest that homeworking is widespread, and growing, in parts of Asia, Latin America, Europe (including the UK), North America, Australia, and parts of Africa. From Oxfam's own contacts with homeworking groups it is apparent that some have a detailed analysis of the prevalence and conditions of homework.<br><p>
This increase in homework, should be understood in the context of a rapidly changing world economy and the wider growth of flexible working practices, such as sub-contracting (whether from small businesses, workshops or homeworkers), temporary, part-time and casual work. Sub-contracting - either at home or overseas - has become an important way for companies to maintain competitiveness, ensure flexibility and cut labour costs in the face of intensified international competition arising from trade and investment liberalisation and rapidly changing patterns of consumer demand. <br><p>
According to the ILO's 1995 World Employment Report there was a pronounced growth in sub-contracting by large firms to small firms in both the formal and informal sectors during the 1980s in Latin America. Sub-contracting is particularly common in labour-intensive industries such as the garment industry, which has traditionally employed the greatest number of homeworkers. <br><p>
Many homeworkers are now found at the end of a long sub-contracting chain through which retailers or large manufacturers sub-contract to a myriad of smaller factories, businesses, and homeworkers either at home or overseas. Although the retailers may make the biggest profits, each contractor in the chain receives a commission, however small. This means that the homeworker may receive only a fraction of the final price.   A baby's dress, for example, might sell for around $15 in a department store in North America, or Western Europe, but the local producer who made it may get less than 10 cents. <br><p>
As many businesses and home-based workers are classed as self-employed or are not registered at all, sub-contracting allows companies to cut labour costs by bypassing existing labour regulations and collective bargaining agreements. It means they can pay lower wages, avoid paying employers contributions, benefits and taxes. Employers can also reduce overheads as workers bear many of the costs of heating or equipment  Sub-contracting also allows companies to maintain flexibility in the face of fast-changing global markets, as homeworkers can be 'hired and fired' easily. Workers who complain about conditions can be easily laid off. In sum, it passes many of the risks of production onto the homeworkers.<br><p>
Developments in transport, new technology, and communications have also facilitated the spread of sub-contracting. In the garment industry in Europe, for example, some companies have been able to combine the latest technology at the retail or final assembly stage, with a cheap and flexible work-force further down the production chain to assemble, process, and pack products. The new technology is especially important in monitoring sales and offers companies the "advantage" of rapid response to fast-changing life-style and niche markets. The adoption of modern satellite communications means that design can be carried out near the market and instructions for cutting can be sent anywhere in the world in minutes. Despite this, sub-contracting from their home countries has become increasingly attractive to some Northern based companies because it combines the advantage of "Third World" wage rates and shorter delivery runs.<br><p>
<h3>4.	The Case for a new ILO Convention on Homework </h3>

<h3>What is the Convention ?</h3>

The proposed Convention is based on a broad definition of homework which includes many homeworkers who have an indirect or disguised employment relationship. It aims at promoting :<br><p>
equality of treatment with wage-earners, in particular in relation to the right to organise, protection against discrimination in employment, occupational health and safety provisions, in remuneration, in statutory social security protection, access to training, minimum age for admission to employment, and maternity benefits<br><p>

<ul type=circle>
<li>the inclusion of homeworkers in the collection of basic labour statistics

<li>the regulation of intermediaries 

<li>the establishment of systems of inspection
</ul>
The proposed complementary Recommendation examines each of the above points in greater detail, gives advice to employers and intermediaries on employment practice, registration, and supervision of workers,  and also includes guidelines on programmes to support and train homeworkers, which would aid their organisation.  <br><p>


The Convention is highly unusual for the ILO, and particularly important, as conventions for  the protection of unorganised sector workers have rarely been seen in the ILO.  It is an important achievement for the invisible workforce of homeworkers and their organisations that the question of international regulation has finally been put on the agenda. This in large part reflects the efforts of SEWA and HomeNet, with the support of many trade unions. At SEWA's urging, the International Confederation of Trade Unions (ICFTU) adopted a resolution asking the ILO to pass a convention for the protection of homeworkers.  The ICFTU has consistently followed up the issue with the ILO and in 1995 the Governing Body of the ILO finally agreed that 'Homework' should be the subject of a new Convention, backed up by a more detailed Recommendation. (If a Convention is approved, it then has to be ratified by individual governments and converted into national laws. It is stronger than a Recommendation, which is voluntary and merely provides policy guidelines.)<br><p>


Last year the ILO tripartite Committee on Homework voted in favour of a Convention and by a narrow majority. Most employers were against a Convention and a Recommendation, preferring a recommendation only. Trade unions were and are solidly in favour of both the Convention and Recommendation. Government opinions were mixed.<br><p>


The proposed text of the Convention and Recommendation will be discussed and amended in detail in the Homework Committee in the ILO Conference in June 1996, and then voted on in the plenary  (where all members of the ILO vote). A two-thirds majority will be needed in the plenary session to approve the Convention. Given the voting pattern in the Homework committee last year, Governments which have two votes each will play the deciding role. <br><p>


<h3>Employment status of homeworkers</h3>

The proponents of the new convention argue that many homeworkers are not in fact self-employed or independent, but are dependent workers like employees, and should therefore be entitled to employment and social protection similar to that of normal wage-earners. For example, a survey published by the UK National Group on Homework in 1994, Home Truths,  discovered that 47 percent of the homeworkers interviewed thought that their employers considered them as self-employed and yet 63 percent would have preferred to be treated as employees. Supporters of the Convention argue that homeworkers should be treated as employees unless they genuinely want to be considered as self-employed and fit the relevant criteria for independent workers defined by national law, regulations or court decisions.<br><p>


According to the representative of the ILO Director General to the 1995 Homework committee, very few ILO instruments make any specific reference to homework. While some instruments cover all workers without exception, thereby including homeworkers, others permit the exclusion of certain categories of workers or limit their scope to workers in enterprises or establishments. Similarly, national legislation may fail to adequately protect homeworkers - either remaining silent or excluding them from some or all of its provisions. An ILO survey of 150 countries found that only 18 had specific homework legislation, though another 17 had a section on homework in their labour codes.   <br><p>


The main problem arising from these omissions is that unless homeworkers are specifically mentioned in legislation, they are usually excluded from protection in practice. Employers often do not put anything in writing to homeworkers and in the minority of cases where they do, they specify that the homeworker is self-employed. The onus therefore rests on the homeworker to prove his or her status as an employee, which often results in loss of employment. Their ambiguous employment status leaves them highly vulnerable to exploitation and abuse, and effectively denies them the rights enjoyed by other workers. This results in low pay, lack of basic employment rights, insecurity, and health and safety problems.  <br><p>


The Conventions' proponents argue that it is important to address this problem explicitly and systematically by setting minimum standards for the protection of dependent homeworkers which take account of  their special characteristics. The importance of standard-setting for homeworkers has been echoed in recent declarations from the Social Summit and Beijing Conference on Women. For example, the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action of November 1995 asked governments to: Adopt policies to ensure the appropriate protection of labour laws and social security benefits for part-time, temporary, seasonal and homebased workers.<br><p>


(It is important to remember, however, that in the South, own-account or independent producers are often little better off than dependent homeworkers having limited access to credit, training and markets. Often as a small producer loses control over his or her market or raw material she becomes a piece rate worker.  Food processing and weaving are two examples of own-account workers whose status as small independent producers is being undermined and who are gradually losing control over their markets. However, not all of them will wish to be considered as workers and may prefer to try and maintain their status as self-employed. It is equally important that appropriate government measures are adopted to help these groups for example by assistance with credit, training, and marketing).<br><p>


<h3>The social costs of homework</h3>


Although the home-based nature of the work may offer some advantages to women, it also exacts a high human and social cost. Whether they sew garments in England, make toys in New York, weave silk in Thailand or roll bidis (cigarettes) in India, their problems remain in many ways similar. An ILO report states that: 'surveys in industrialised and developing countries have revealed a surprisingly similar catalogue of problems associated with homeworking. They include very low wages, often below legal minima where they exist; anti-social working hours; health and safety problems, often affecting the whole family of the homeworker; delays in payment, and on occasion, non-payment of wages; misinformation from employers about homeworkers "legal rights and status, and evasion of such regulations as may exist; and the threat of withdrawal of work used as a means to intimidate homeworkers and prevent them claiming their rights " .<br><p>


Ela Bhatt, the General Secretary of SEWA, sums up the situation: " Homeworkers are particularly vulnerable to unfair terms of employment and working conditions. Usually they are not considered as regular employees and have no job security, have irregular incomes and no career prospects. Their wages are far lower than those of other workers doing comparable work within the undertaking. The piece-rate method of remuneration commonly applied to homeworkers obliges many of them to work very long hours in order to gain a decent income. Often homeworkers have to work under conditions that present health and safety risks or dangers for themselves and their families and are not fully informed of possible consequences. Almost invariably they have no access to health benefits or social security".<br><p>


Studies also report that although not directly employed, children may be forced to work to help their parents because of low wages and the high pressure of tight deadlines. A recent survey of homebased workers in the incense industry in India showed that 43% of children in the surveyed families were involved in producing incense sticks due to economic necessity.<br><p>


The unreasonably low wages and benefits resulting from the unregulated use of homeworking exerts downward pressure on the wages and conditions of other workers in the industry and other countries.<p>


<h3>The economic costs of homework</h3>


One of the main concerns of employers delegations opposed to the convention, is that regulation of homework will reduce growth, cost jobs and drive workers into the black economy. In Oxfam's view the evidence does not support this overly negative view of regulation.<br><p>

For example, recent research on OECD countries suggests that lower employment protection increases hiring thereby reducing long-term unemployment, but also increases firing and thereby increases short-term unemployment - the first (good effect) is almost offset by the second (bad) one so that the national gains from flexibility are small. The research also indicates that employment taxes do not appear to have any long-term effect on unemployment and are borne entirely by labour (ie increases in non-wage costs are offset by lower wages), although there may be substantial short-run effects. <br><p>


Similarly, recent research on minimum wage legislation does not show significant long term job losses. Recent increases in the minimum wage in Chile in the early 1990s played an important role in reducing poverty alongside rapid growth and low levels of official unemployment. Evidence from the US suggests that the minimum wage has not had a significant effect on employment.  Countries such as Colombia and Costa Rica, which maintained minimum wage levels in the 1980s, in contrast to many other countries in Latin America where minimum wages fell significantly, achieved some of the fastest levels of growth in Latin America. <br><p>

The fact that many home-based workers and small businesses are in fact linked to large successful formal-sector companies and multinationals by sub-contracting relations, would imply that labour rights can be effectively extended to these groups without incurring the kind of enforcement difficulties or jobs losses which is feared in genuinely independent small or informal businesses . In so far as there is a short-term trade-off between improved employment standards and jobs because of company relocation this could be lessened by the introduction of core labour standards into international trading agreements.<br><p>

Furthermore, in Oxfam's view, measures to promote cheap and flexible labour markets can be economically inefficient and potentially self-defeating. While it is true that homework can create important new sources of  jobs in the short term, if it remains unregulated it can actually hinder a country's long-term economic expansion<br><p>

The ILO has pointed out that productivity will be impaired if wages and conditions fall below 'efficiency levels' due to high turnover, low commitment and poor health. Oxfam research on Chile shows how legislation which facilitates flexible labour markets, including sub-contracting, reduces the incentives for companies to train workers, to invest in new technologies or to improve products. Without such measure countries may not be able to move to a second phase of export based on higher value added products, rather than cheap labour. <br><p>

Low wages can also depress domestic demand, undermining growth prospects and deepening recession. The World Bank has acknowledged that wage reductions were one of the reasons for the failure of Bolivia's adjustment programme in the 1980s. <br><p>
Unregulated homework may also reduce tax government revenue either because their earnings are below the tax threshold or because they are unregistered. Growing inequality and social unrest associated with poorly regulated labour markets is also bad for growth.<br><p>

<h3>Oxfam's recommendations</h3>

Along with homeworkers, trade unions and other groups around the world Oxfam is urging governments, and employers' delegations, to vote in favour of the both the proposed new ILO Convention and Recommendation on Homeworking in their current form at the ILO Conference in June 1996. <br><p>

Oxfam UK/I believes that the rapid spread of homeworking, inadequate coverage in existing conventions and national legislation, the appalling employment conditions of many homeworkers, and the associated wider social and economic costs, point to the need for the establishment of an international core of minimum labour standards. This is not a case of introducing new onerous regulation but rather ensuring that employment rights enshrined in existing international conventions, cover all categories of workers as originally intended.<br><p>


Oxfam believes that such measures would help to reduce the human, social and economic costs associated with homework. The Convention is sufficiently broad and flexible to allow signatory countries to develop policies appropriate to the types and specific characteristics of homework within that country. It provides a basic definition of homeworking but allows countries sufficient flexibility to take account of criteria under national law which would distinguish homeworkers from truly independent workers. Rather than driving homework further underground, Oxfam believes that it will provide homeworkers with the confidence to register and become legal.<br><p>


The setting of minimum standards is only one means among others to improve conditions for homeworkers.  The complementary Recommendation provides important policy guidance on other ways for governments to help homeworkers, whether dependent or own account workers. The generation of alternative employment and the provision of child care is also important to help increase the choices available to women and to reduce their dependence on poor employers.<br><p>


Approving the convention is, of course, only the first step. It will then need to be ratified by governments and translated into national legislation, according to local social and economic conditions. Oxfam believes that the Convention will offer an important lever for homeworkers to exert pressure on Governments and employers to ensure that they receive a living wage and just employment conditions.<br><p>

The ILO,  a specialist agency of the United Nations, is the most significant multilateral mechanism for improving and monitoring labour standards.  There are now 170 countries who are members  of the ILO, each entitled to send four delegates to its annual decision-making conference; two government representatives, one representative of employers, and one of employees, reflecting it's unique tripartite structure. <br><p>

<H3>Origins of humankind</H3>
A 17.5 million year old skull found at Olduvai Gorge in Tanzania in 1957
indicated Africa as the probable site of human evolution.  Homo erectus,
our immediate ancestor, first appeared about 1.5 million years ago and is
credited with the discovery of fire, the first use of stone tools and recognisable
speech.<BR>
<H3>Up to and including the 19th Century</H3>
Much of the land in East Africa is unsuitable for intense cultivation or
habitation.  Prior to 1840 a system of about 200 Ntemi chiefs, each served
by a council and each with about 1,000 subjects, seemed to be the norm.
In 1840 Ngoni exiles from Natal Province, South Africa, fleeing from the
Zulu leader Chaka, used his violent methods to seize land. Simultaneously,
there was increasing activity by Arab slave traders. These two sets of invaders
devastated villages.<BR>
<H3>Arab influence</H3>
Trade between the East African coast and the Persian Gulf, of gold, ebony,
ivory and spices, go back millennia. The 13th - 15th centuries are called
the Shirazi Era after the sultans, who originated from the Shiraz region
of Persia (now Iran) and ruled more than 30 city states in East Africa.
The island of Kilwa, which had 10,000 inhabitants, its own mint and splendid
buildings, was the centre for the gold trade until the invasion of the Portuguese
in 1505. In 1698 the Portuguese centre in Mombasa (Kenya) was overthrown
by Arabs from Oman.<BR>
<BR>
In 1827 the Sultan of Muscat, Seyyid Said, captured Mombasa and the east
coast region. He based himself in Zanzibar where he established clove plantations
and started to trade in slaves. Britain's Act of 1833 which abolished the
slave trade did not affect East Africa and by 1839 40,000 slaves were being
sold annually from Zanzibar.<BR>
<H3>European Influence</H3>
Up to 1850 Europeans knew little about the African interior. In 1855 German
missionary James Erhardt produced a map of Africa based on Arab accounts.
Explorers Richard Buxton, John Speke, David Livingstone and Henry Stanley
all played a part in mapping East and Central Africa and locating the source
of the Nile.<BR>
<BR>
Between 1884 and 1918 Germany ruled much of the area they called Tanganyika.
Zanzibar became a British protectorate in 1890 and Tanganyika came under
British rule in 1918. Unlike Kenya, Tanganyika was never very heavily settled
by Europeans although 100,000 Tanganyikans fought for the Allies in World
War II. Tanganyika attained full independence on 9th December, 1961 and
Nyerere became President.<BR>
<H3>Independence</H3>
The United Republic of Tanzania was formed on May 1st, 1964 when Tanganyika
united with Zanzibar. After Independence Tanzania became staunchly socialist
but since the mid-1980s there has been a swing to a free market system.
Nyerere created a great sense of national unity by making Kiswahili the
national language of Tanzania. This is based on an African language, several
thousand years old, which has since incorporated Arab words. Nyerere retired
in 1985 and was succeeded by Ali Hassan Mwinyi. Elections are planned for
October 1995. <BR>

The Week in Europe, 19 December 1996</h2>

<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>

<p>

Executive Director of the <A HREF="cce.htm">Caribbean Council for Europe</A></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

A week ago the President of the European Commission, Jacques Santer and the

Irish Prime Minister, John Bruton, in his capacity as the current President

of the European Union, met with US President, Bill Clinton in Washington.

The meeting was the most recent of a semi-annual series of summits between

the EU and US on matters of common concern.

<p>

The content of the meeting ranged from the problems of genetically modified

maize, NATO enlargement and Cuba, to the humanitarian crisis in Zaire. The

wide range of issues discussed and some of the differences that emerged

indicated clearly the significant changes that have taken place in the

EU/US relationship over the past ten years. As a meeting between equals it

was a far cry from previous bilateral discussions with certain EU member

states that characterised the post war special relationship.

<p>

This same process of change has been observable in the ways in which Europe

and the US now relate to the Caribbean. Traditionally the UK, the US and

Canada sought to co-ordinate their interests in the Caribbean through

regular discussions on matters of mutual interest. More recently this

dialogue has taken place in a North Atlantic framework and in the context

of economic development, within the Caribbean Group of Economic

Co-operation and Development (CGCED) of the World Bank.

<p>

But as the trans-Atlantic debate on the Caribbean has widened to embrace an

increasingly powerful European Union, achieving the consensus of the past

has become more difficult. Today the EU/US debate on the Caribbean is

increasingly characterised by a growing number of differences.

<p>

To a large extent the fundamental difference arises because the US Congress

- while paying some heed to an administration that has genuinely sought

multilateral solutions to international problems - is more inclined to the

belief that its role is to insist on unilateral action that puts America

and American interests first.

<p>

At their most obvious present EU/US differences over the Caribbean are over

Cuba and how to encourage change there. While the EU and US both seek a

transition to democracy and a market oriented economy in that nation, the

EU visualises that this can be encouraged through progressive engagement

while the US seeks change through isolation and coercion.

<p>

But beyond this singular issue and beneath the surface there are much

broader matters which have the capacity to create divisions between the US

and Europe which should worry the Caribbean.

<p>

Earlier this year in Europe at the preparatory meetings for the CGCED

meetings in Washington at which aid donors sought to co-ordinate policy

towards the region, new tensions began to emerge. At that meeting EC

officials were angered by the insistence of US officials on introducing new

political conditionalities. In particular they objected to US attempts to

determine the regional development agenda noting that, Haiti apart, the US

had virtually ceased to be a significant aid donor in the Caribbean. EC

officials observed that the US approach ignored the fact that the EU was

the single largest regional donor or had constructed its regional

relationships on the basis of partnership and consensus.

<p>

Further tensions are now in the making as the US pursues its hemispheric

agenda through the creation of a Free Trade Area of the Americas by 2005.

While this date is probably unrealistic, the underlying US policy of "our

hemisphere" ignores the fact that multilateral and bi-lateral ties between

the EU and the Caribbean and Latin America have become increasingly

significant.

<p>

These differences in approach and style may come to a head in the next four

years over the question of trade reciprocity. The EU is likely to pursue an

approach post Lom&#233; that results in a gradual phase out of preference and

the introduction over time of full reciprocity along lines similar to those

being negotiated at present with South Africa. The US, for its part,

appears from the steps it has already taken, to be arguing for full

reciprocity within the Americas, by 2005 on its terms alone. The difference

in approach is at its most stark in relation to small island states such as

those in the OECS. The concept of special and differential treatment is

well understood in Europe but not it would seem on Capitol Hill.

<p>

Many of these issues will become public in a Caribbean context as the

negotiations for a post Lom&#233; agreement proceed and the US makes its views

known on a special EU/Caribbean relationship. Other matters such as

different EU and US approaches on narcotics related issues are already

apparent.

<p>

In this latter context, Caricom heads of government agreed last week to

seek an early meeting with the US President to discuss their concern about

the ways in which "unacceptable methods of persuasion" were being used by

the US to prosecute the war on the narcotics traffickers. Thankfully this

important but narrow agenda was widened in the final communiqui to include

a desire for discussions with Mr Clinton and his new team on trade,

economic development and problems of security.

<p>

How the US reacts, the level at which such a meeting takes place and the

time allotted will all indicate whether the US takes seriously the region's

concerns. The response, or lack of it, may well turn the present

anti-American sentiment common throughout the region into a desire for a

deeper relationship with Europe. 

<p>

But this may be misplaced as few European nations let alone the EU as a

body would be prepared to engage further with a region regarded by most

member states as marginal. Rather there is a real need to understand what

Europe can and cannot do and where and why its approach is different to the

US. Many Caribbean economies are still underwritten by European preference,

aid or concessional funding because of an enduring sense of partnership.

But this interest is not reciprocated in levels of Caribbean contact other

than in Brussels or London. This column will look next year at how

individual EU member states and the Commission regard the Caribbean region.

But this is a matter that should have been addressed long ago in the region

if partnership is not to turn into self interest or benign indifference on

the part of Europe and come to parallel the attitude of the US.

<p>

But Europe apart, the real long term answer must be a change in US policy.

As Barbados's Prime Minister, Owen Arthur, said at the Miami Conference on

the Caribbean "The way forward is to build a new partnership grounded in

the new realities.... The end of the cold war offers an unprecedented

opportunity to forge a special relationship with the Caribbean...... based

on a coherent strategy..... designed to facilitate the Caribbean's own

efforts at building prosperous and stable societies...".

<p>

A new partnership is a message that is good for both Europe and the United

States.

<b>Tuesday 25 June</b><br>
<i>From Naser Mirza, USA</i><p>
<p>

<h3>The Iranian opposition leader is also a terrorist...</h3>

I am an Iranian and support any group who oppose human right violation around the world.<p>

I just red an <b><a href="../../gemini/mar96_iran.html">article by Michael Jansen</a></b> with title of 
"Iranian women call for equality and democracy".<p>

In that article he was describing M. Rajavi as a true iranian opposition leader who has respect for human right.<p>

It needs to be mentioned that she is the head of a terorist organization.
And this organiztion is responsible for placing many bombs on streets, buses and market places during their power struggle with Iranian government.<p>

They caused a lot of innocent people killed including women and children.
They supported Iragian dictator Saddam Hossein in cracking down on Kurdish people.<p>

A respected organization such as Amnesty International needs to distinghuish between true human right activists and terrorists who murder innocent people to acheive their goasl.<p>

<center><b>The charm of Britain has always been the ease with which one can move into the middle class</b> - Margaret Thatcher.</center><p>



Come on you lot, I wanna gettoff 'ome tonight.'<p>

My Uncle Ken, his sons Stephen and Andy and myself were lingering in the
huge upper tier of the Holte End at Aston Villa Football Club, Birmingham.
I'd travelled up that day from Oxford for the last home game of the 
season. It was strange going back to my working-class roots, to the world
where I once worked in a Dudley factory as a sheetmetal worker. <p>

In Oxford, where I've lived and worked for the past 11 years, things are
very 
different. There I'm a graphic designer and purportedly middle class. Still,
sitting here with my relatives in the warm late-May sunshine felt good.
Like going home. <p>

We were reluctant to leave the ground, choosing instead to soak up the end-of-season
atmosphere. In mock despair a steward was imploring us to vacate the now-almost-empty
stadium, which only moments before had been awash in a sea of claret and
blue, the club colours.<p>

'It's okay,' I replied to the impatient, grey-haired man dressed in a violently
luminous orange waistcoat, 'we're just taking in the <i>ambiance'</i>.<p>

I couldn't believe it. I just said it. The word came out of my mouth, italicized
for emphasis, as though I had no control over it. I groaned inwardly. He
looked at me as if I was from another planet.<p>

'Am you takin' the piss, mate?' he queried, now more menacingly.<p>

'No honest, I...' my voice trailed off as I looked round to see my relatives
staring at me in disbelief.<p>

'Listen to 'im, 'e talks posh, don't 'e?' Stephen said in his broad Black
Country accent. Ken and Andy nodded in agreement, with expressions on their
faces that suggested they'd lost me to some strange religious sect.<p>

We left the stadium in a shroud of awkward silence that was only broken
when news came through that one of Villa's rivals had lost. The mood lightened
but the damage had been done. Somehow, that single word had condemned me
as a class traitor. But what did that mean? Who, or what, was I betraying?
<p>
<center><hr width=71%><p>
<i>
I feel I'm stuck somewhere between the two classes and in some ways I hate it, you know, not feeling I belong anywhere.</i><p>
<hr width=71%></center><p>



We joined a jubilant throng of Villa supporters in a pub close to the ground.
The talk was of football. Shouting above the din I changed the subject.<p>

'So you think I'm posh, do you Ste'?' I asked, somewhat nervously.<p>

As I spoke I noticed his huge hands were splattered with dried paint of
differing hues. Ken had been a painter and decorator all his working life
and his sons had joined him when they left school.<p>

'Well, you've lost your accent for a start, ain't yer?' returned Stephen.
<p>

We managed to grab an empty table while Ken and Andy headed for the bar
and were soon swallowed up by the raucous crowd. I wondered if I'd ever
see them again.<p>

'Yes, I suppose I have,' I answered defensively, 'but I live in a different
world now'. <p>

'Ya mean, with the middle class.'<p>

'Yes, and I have to be able to communicate with them. Having an almost unintelligible
accent would make that impossible.'<p>
'So they wouldn't understand me?'<p>
'Well...'<p>
'I'm as good as them.'<p>
'I know, I'm just saying...'<p>

Somebody bumped into us and a portion of his beer ended up on my trouser
leg. By now the pub resembled the inside of a claret-and-blue sardine can.
The walls vibrated as a hundred voices smote the air with repeated choruses
of inane chanting. I began again.<p>

'I suppose, what I'm saying is, well, the two worlds are very different.'<p>
'Per'aps they am, but they think they'm betta than us, don't they?'<p>
'I suppose some of them do, yes.'<p>
'An' what about you, what do you think?'<p>
'I'm in the middle...'<p>
'Ya mean, middle class?'<p>
'No, er, yes. I mean, it's complicated. Oh, fuck knows.' <p>
Ken and Andy returned from their expedition to the bar. Beer spilled everywhere
as they plonked down a quartet of pints and several packets of crisps. I
rubbed at the wet patch on my trouser leg. It felt uncomfortable.<p>
'What yer talkin' about?' asked Ken as he sat down.<p>
'Fuckin' clever types who think they'm betta than us,' answered Stephen
as he picked up his pint. Leaning forward he took several huge gulps, emptying
almost half the glass in an instant. I opened a packet of crisps, grabbed
a handful and handed the packet round. <p>
'They're not all like that...'<p>
'Am you like them?'<p>
'<i>They</i> say I am. I mean, I have a degree. I work in a profession. I go to
dinner parties and drink Beaujolais. And I talk &quot;posh&quot;. I suppose
that makes me like them.'<p>
'An' what am <i>we</i> like, then?'<p>
'Well, you're supposed to be thick, inarticulate and pig-out on a diet of
junk food and tabloid TV.'<p>
'Ya see, they think they'm superior to us.'<p>
'Of course they're not, but they do have advantages.' <p>
'Like what?'<p>
'Education for a start. They'll go to any lengths to make sure their kids
get a good one. And most of them are left money or property by parents or
relatives so they're always one step ahead of the rest. To be honest, I
reckon whatever happens to them, they always come up smelling of roses.'<p>
'So what happens to us. Do we always get the worst of it?'<p>
'Well, who's gonna leave us pots of money? And besides, the education system
is geared to cream off the smartest. There's never any time to let the others
catch up and develop their talents. When I left school in 1963, at the age
of 15, most of us were herded into factories, diploma-less and almost fucking
brainless.' <p>
'It's like that today, ain't it?'<p>
'Yeh, except nowadays working-class kids queue up on the dole. So nothing
has really changed. The status quo remains intact.'<p>
'That's a pop group,' observed Andy with a mischievous glint in his eye.<p>
'Very funny.'<p>
'But <i>you</i> managed to move out, eh? You left the factory and left us behind,'
continued Stephen, ignoring his brother's attempt at humour.<p>
'I was lucky I suppose. But does that make me a class traitor?'<p>
'What do you think?'<p>



'I don't know. That's the honest answer. I feel I'm stuck somewhere between
the two classes and in some ways I hate it, you know, not feeling I belong
anywhere. But it's what I wanted. And I wanted it so badly I burned bridges.
In my rush to get away I wanted to deny my past, even the way I spoke. I
still feel bad about that. Guilty, I suppose. And yet...'<p>
Just then a muscular, lanky youth, sporting a haircut from a Nuremberg rally
and a cavernous mouth that lacked several front teeth, slapped Stephen on
his back with such force that my relative and his chair were projected several
centimetres forward. A bout of male banter ensued. I leaned back, supped
at my beer and contemplated our conversation. Those words kept coming back
to me. Traitor. Betrayal. Guilt. What did it all mean? What was so bad about
my previous life? Why did I want my new one so badly?<p>
I was certainly contemptuous of many of the people I worked with in the
factory. I was appalled by their apathy and apparent willingness to settle
for the cheap dreams offered by consumerism. I hated the way anything regarded
as intellectual was derided. And the renowned philistinism prevalent amongst the uglier sections
of the working class is still being proclaimed a virtue. It isn't clever
to boast about not being clever. <p>
I wanted, and still want, them to see that knowledge is power. That failure
does not have to be their fate, and waiting to win the lottery will never
get them, or the rest of us, anywhere. As John Lennon said, they are living
someone else's dream, it's not even their own. <p>
Well, I certainly had no allegiance to all that. So when I say I'm proud
to be working class, what am I proud of? <p>
I'm proud to be descended from the millions of women, men and children who
sweated blood in the world's factories, shipyards and mines, and from the
workers who fought and died for a better world. I'm proud of the old working-class
sense of community and decency that seems to have long since vanished. <p>
But whatever the reason, I wanted out. I craved the world of the intellectual
and progressive. I read books, got myself politicized and eventually, through
the auspices of what was left of the welfare state, went to college. I gained
a degree and eventually moved to the city of dreaming spires. But when I
got there I didn't fit in. There were new rules to learn, new games to play.
<p>
The midday meal changed from working-class dinner to middle-class lunch.
Fish fingers metamorphosed into smoked salmon and people threw snippets
of French into their conversation. <i>Dis donc!</i><p>
'Well, I'll tell yer...' said Stephen, his friend now creating havoc at
the next table. Stephen motioned Andy for another pint. It was Andy's round.
He gathered the now-empty glasses, turned, took a deep breath then headed
in the general direction of the bar and vanished once more into the noisy
mass of bodies. '...all I know is that we are still here and still being
shat on from a great height. But no fuckin' smart arse is gonna tell me
what to do.' He banged the table with his fist.<p>
I looked at Ken. He winked. He adored his sons. They adored him. <p>
Perhaps that's it. Perhaps I'm riddled with guilt at creating a sort of
success and leaving behind family and friends to sink or swim in the free-market
nightmare of Nineties Britain. And, for all my confusion, do I feel guilty
because I actually <i>enjoy</i> quite a lot of my new life?<p>
'My God, I've got middle-class angst!'<p>
'What?' said Stephen looking surprised at my outburst.<p>
'Oh, nothing. Just thinking out loud.'<p>
Suddenly the conversation dried up. I chomped on a handful of crisps and
listened to the communal singing that had continued unabated. I surveyed
the scene. It was depressingly male-dominated; all tattooed arms, farting,
belching and gross, lager-bloated stomachs. Somebody close to our table
was re-acquainting himself with his breakfast. This didn't feel like home.
I wasn't proud of this. But did Oxford really feel any better?<p>
My position in the scheme of things - in the middle, as it were -
might cause me some unease but it does allow me to straddle the two worlds,
taking metaphorical temperature readings. I feel like a kind of cultural
anthropologist; observing, taking notes. And as I flit from one to the other
what I see is disturbing. <p>
I see the gap widening between each group, both becoming more wary and distrustful
of the other. The stereotypes remain stubbornly intact. I see scared people
scrambling to compete for a slice of an ever-decreasing economic pie. <p>
I see the working class; low-achieving, lacking confidence, willingly accepting
their fate, destructively turning in on themselves; drug abuse, crime and
violence. Or turning outwards, looking for scapegoats; black people, women,
Jews, lesbians and gay men. Easy targets for the panic-stricken. And then, with money they don't have, they embark on an orgy of
spending, being conned into buying anything they see.<p>
I see an increasingly nervous middle class with their traditional values
of hard work and thrift under threat. The spectre of unemployment and insecurity
now hangs over them and they are more than willing to pull up the ladder
on the masses below. Still insisting there's no such thing as class, their
acclaimed bonhomie has become an intolerant scowl.<p>
As for me? I continue to live in my 
cultural limbo land - feeling guilt at betraying what remains of the
struggle for working-class emancipation, then thanking God I'm not there
any more; still reacting to middle-class cerebral intimidation and thanking
God I'm here, reading my books, visiting the opera and drinking good wine.
<p>
'Perhaps you're <i>truly</i> classless?' said Stephen, as though he'd been reading
my thoughts. <p>
'My God, perhaps I am...'<p>
He then winked at his dad, looked back at me and smiled warmly.<p>
'But don't worry Al, whatever you are, we still love ya.'	<p>

and raise the money needed. <BR>
<BR>
There are 3,740 people living in 400 households. A household can consist
of more than one family and several wage earners. Every 10 households forms

household ranges between 40-60,000/- (&#163;53.33-&#163;80.00) per annum.<BR>
<BR>
People in the village contribute money to the development of the village
which is a local tax. In 1994 700,000/- (&#163;93.33) was paid in tax, 20%

<title>Newsflash 1995 - Nigerian Death Sentences Confirmed</title> 
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="#d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">[OneWorld News Service]<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>

<center><h2>Ken Saro-Wiwa death sentence confirmed by military</h2></center>
<p>


The military government of Nigeria has confirmed the sentences of death by hanging on the writer and human rights activist Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists.<p>

The decision shows Nigeria's determination not to give in to international pressure to commute the sentences.  Observers are especially surprised that the confirmation of the death sentences was announced only two days before the opening of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in New Zealand.<p>

Speaking from the Commonwealth Summit, Ken Wiwa (Ken Saro-Wiwa's son),
in Auckland to urge Commonwealth Leaders to take action against Nigeria said:<p>
<b>
"This confirms what we have always known: this vicious regime is prepared to
ignore international opinion and the standards of a civilised society in its
blind pursuit of greed and power. The Commonwealth and the rest of the world
must intervene now to save my Father and the whole of Nigeria from disaster.
Tomorrow may be too late". </b><p>

There have been reports that the executions may be imminent.  Although campaigners are not certain of Mr Saro-Wiwa's whereabouts, he is thought to have been moved from his cell to await execution.<p>
      <hr>  <font size=+1>OneWorld Online has made every effort to contact the Nigerian authorities and publish their version of events.  However, they have not chosen to release any information or comment.</font><hr><p>
 
 <i>The following material originates from a human rights mailing list</i>
<h3>To voice your opinion, it is suggested by campaigners that you:</h3>


1.  Contact the Clinton Administration and ask that the
Administration come out strongly against this sentencing and
demand the release of Saro-Wiwa and the others.  The United States
has political pull with Nigeria, particularly given that the U.S.
consumes 70 percent of Nigeria's oil.<p>

 
Specifically, you could ask that Clinton call General Abacha of
Nigeria, denouncing the verdicts and warn that if these people are
put to death, it will have profound political ramifcations.<p>

 
Fax a letter or call:    Anthony Lake<br>
                         Assistant to the President for National<br>

2. Send a letter to General Abacha, the military ruler of Nigeria,
asking for Saro-Wiwa's immediate release, citing the international
condemnation this sentencing has received.<p>

<TITLE>The Week in Europe</TITLE>

The Week in Europe, 12 December 1996</h2>

<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>

<p>

Executive Director of the <A HREF="cce.htm">Caribbean Council for Europe</A></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

No one in the Caribbean should under-estimate the turmoil that will arise

in the coming months in Europe over the agreement presently being sought to

achieve an EU single currency and monetary union.

<p>

Although there are some signs that an agreement might be reached at the

Dublin summit of EU heads of government, it is not clear what shape this

will take or whether it will be endorsed by all member states. The

divisions are so wide-ranging that it is suggested that if Britain, for

electoral reasons, rejects present proposals being advocated by Germany,

that nation, together with France, may seek to establish a "two speed"

Europe. This scenario would involve a group consisting of perhaps half the

EU' s member states, attempting to force the pace of integration by

establishing an inner core of nations that leaves out countries, such as

Britain, that are reluctant to join the monetary union in 1998.

<p>

Although the issues associated with this process are complex and technical

they are already impacting in a very political way. In Spain and Greece

there have been widespread demonstrations from workers not prepared to

accept the cuts in subsidies and pay required if those nations are to

reduce deficits to meet the criteria necessary for monetary union. In

Britain and Denmark there is growing public alarm over the implied threat

to sovereignty posed by the likelihood that the most economically powerful

members of the EU will be able, once monetary union is in place, to

determine economic policy without reference to individual parliaments. In

Belgium and France there is concern that the proposed fines for any nation

that runs up excessive deficits after monetary union might be too punitive

and worsen economic problems. And beyond all of this there is a fear that

it would be Germany that would dictate future EU economic policy through a

European central bank, leaving national governments powerless to tackle

very key issues such as unemployment.

<p>

In short, the debate is really about whether old concepts of nation states

and sovereignty can endure in a world moving to ever larger trading blocs,

reciprocity, and globalisation.

<p>

What is being seen in the parliaments and streets of Europe' s capitals are

perhaps the first developed world protests against this process. Readers in

the Caribbean may smile wryly at this as the former colonial powers come to

understand what much of the region has learnt the hard way through the IMF

or changes in, for example, the removal of Commonwealth preference. The

message is the same: economic or political influence exercised by

relatively few powerful nations can impact adversely and alarmingly quickly

on the economic, social and political stability of nations sometimes not

consulted and often remote from the decision-making body.

<p>

This lesson has again been made clear in the Caribbean context of rice. Two

weeks ago it seemed that the Irish Presidency of the EU had established a

compromise acceptable to all member states bar one on the much-debated

trade aspects of the EU and the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT)

agreement which covers in part the Netherlands Antilles and the British

Dependent Territories in the Caribbean. Under this OCT/EU relationship,

which forms part of the Lom&#233; Convention, products from the ACP which

undergo certain transformation in the OCT enter Europe quota- and

duty-free. This facility was first used by Guyana and Suriname for rice

and, just as intended, it has had a developmental effect in the OCT and in

the ACP nations concerned. However, more recently this route has begun to

be used for sugar from the Dominican Republic, dairy products, and a range

of other sensitive items.

<p>

Faced with this - and subject to a discussion on numbers - the EC, all but

one member state, and the ACP rice producers accepted a system would have

to be established that set quotas on specific products exported to Europe

in this manner. But the solution required unanimity and the Dutch, for

reasons that are no longer clear, were not prepared to work with other

member states on an acceptable compromise. To the anger of all other EU

nations, Dutch intransigence in the General Affairs Council meeting led to

the issue remaining unresolved. 

<p>

If this had simply resulted in the status quo prevailing., ACP producers

could have slept, if not easily, then without too much discomfort. But

what, this time around, has materially changed the circumstances is a

parallel action by Italy to introduce safeguard measures to halt rice

shipments from the ACP via the OCT. Although the Italian position was

probably tactical initially with the objective of encouraging Dutch

agreement in the General Affairs Council, the absence of a compromise now

means that in a matter of weeks ACP rice may no longer be able to use the

OCT route.

<p>

No doubt the Dutch will appeal to the European Court, but that is of little

help to the rice farmers and millers in the ACP or those involved in

processing in those OCTs that only process rice. The ACP producers are

mobilising to defend their interests and the issue is far from over.

<p>

Whether it is in Europe or the Caribbean, it appears that economic

independence will become ever-less possible as globalisation accelerates.

As I suggested some weeks ago, the  questions this raises for governments

and for sovereignty need to be answered soon if the Caribbean is to find a

stable place for itself in an independent world.

L'avenir de la Convention baigne dans l'incertitude

Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>ECDPM Points cl&#233;s 1996</i>: pages 4-5

<HR>

<p>

Le m&#233;canisme d'&#233;valuation de la Convention de Lom&#233; s'est peu &#224; peu mis en

marche. La Convention a-t-elle un avenir et comment se pr&#233;sentera-t-il, telles sont les questions

br&ucirc;lantes.

<p>

La Commission europ&#233;enne travaille &#224; un nouveau document politique et les pays en voie

de d&#233;veloppement sont inquiets. Pourtant, malgr&#233; toutes les discussions, on pense que le

sc&#233;nario d'apr&#232;s 1999 pourrait &#224; peine changer. Certains observateurs consid&#232;rent

que reconcevoir la coop&#233;ration europ&#233;enne au d&#233;veloppement serait peut-&ecirc;tre plus

difficile que de laisser les choses plus ou moins telles quelles.

<p>

La Convention de Lom&#233; est un partenariat &#233;tabli entre 70 pays d'Afrique, des Cara&iuml;bes

et du Pacifique (ACP) et l'Union europ&#233;enne, qui inclut les &#233;changes et l'aide. Cette

Convention date de 1975 et nul ne sait avec certitude si elle existera apr&#232;s son 25e anniversaire en

l'an 2000.

<p>

Lorsque l'ECDPM a invit&#233; les Etats ACP &#224; entreprendre les pr&#233;paratifs de la poursuite

de la Convention de Lom&#233;, le Centre a essuy&#233; des r&#233;actions d'agacement. Les

d&#233;cideurs &#233;taient fatigu&#233;s apr&#232;s les n&#233;gociations difficiles de la

r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours de Lom&#233; IV et ils ne voulaient pas entendre que leur

t&#226;che &#233;tait loin d'&ecirc;tre termin&#233;e. Ces derniers mois, toutefois, le climat a

chang&#233;.

<p>

Au cours de l'ann&#233;e &#233;coul&#233;e, l'ECDPM a suscit&#233; une prise de conscience parmi

les groupes d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t ACP en les encourageant &#224; proc&#233;der &#224; une

&#233;valuation critique et &#224; d&#233;battre l'avenir de la Convention de Lom&#233;. Selon Louk

de la Rive Box, directeur de l'ECDPM, la "conclusion principale constitue un paradoxe. Les Etats ACP

sont inquiets pour leur relation avec l'Europe, mais l'ignorance en ce qui concerne Lom&#233; est totale."

<p>

<h3>Un myst&#232;re pour la plupart des gens</h3>

Cette conclusion se fonde sur d'importantes consultations de l'ECDPM avec des gens de toutes les

r&#233;gions ACP. Geert Laporte a l'impression qu'en dehors d'un cercle restreint de repr&#233;sentants

du gouvernement, la Convention demeure un "myst&#232;re absolu" dans les pays ACP.

<p>

Cette ignorance est en partie due &#224; la fa&#231;on dont les ressources de Lom&#233; sont

g&#233;r&#233;es au niveau du pays - un ordonnateur national dans chaque pays ACP,  un haut

repr&#233;sentant du gouvernement, dirige les activit&#233;s. Cette situation r&#233;sulte

&#233;galement de l'opinion, que Lom&#233; est une affaire concernant les gouvernements.

<p>

A cet &#233;gard, Box sugg&#232;re qu'une "critique de la Commission pourrait &ecirc;tre qu'elle n'a

pas fait intervenir, assez t&ocirc;t dans le processus, d'autres groupes d'int&#233;r&ecirc;t, tels que les

chambres de commerce." Il critique &#233;galement les gouvernements ACP qui n'ont pas fait grand-

chose pour encourager la formation d'un groupe de tenants de Lom&#233; dans leurs pays. Avec un si

petit groupe impliqu&#233; dans la Convention, il n'est gu&#232;re &#233;tonnant que la prise de

conscience du public soit si faible.

<p>

La connaissance de la Convention est une chose, son utilisation en est une autre. La Convention est

tr&#232;s complexe et compte plus de 369 articles, ainsi qu'une s&#233;rie de protocoles. "Il est

d&#233;j&#224; difficile pour un bureaucrate qui l'utilise tous les jours de comprendre Lom&#233;, alors

ne parlons pas des repr&#233;sentants de gouvernement ACP qui sont peu motiv&#233;s," explique

Laporte. Le Centre esp&#232;re "entretenir le d&#233;bat en apportant des informations, de sorte que

lorsque les n&#233;gociations sur l'avenir de Lom&#233; commenceront en 1998, toutes les parties

sauront quelles sont les difficult&#233;s. Notre objectif est de susciter un vrai d&#233;bat sur l'avenir

de Lom&#233;," d&#233;clare Box. "C'est une convention unique qui &#233;tait tr&#232;s progressiste

&#224; l'&#233;poque de sa mise au point. Mais elle n'est pas utilis&#233;e de mani&#232;re

ad&#233;quate."

<p>

<h3>Un instrument efficace?</h3>

Une grande partie du d&#233;bat sur Lom&#233;, du moins en Europe, concerne la pr&#233;tendue

inefficacit&#233; de l'aide europ&#233;enne. Alors que des &#233;valuations compl&#232;tes n'ont pas

encore eu lieu, certaines &#233;tudes montrent que la performance de l'aide europ&#233;enne n'est pas

plus mauvaise que celle d'autres bailleurs de fonds, estime Laporte.

<p>

Le minist&#232;re n&#233;erlandais des affaires &#233;trang&#232;res n'a pas encore de vision

compl&#232;te des r&#233;sultats de Lom&#233;. Ernst Noorman, repr&#233;sentant du gouvernement

charg&#233; des affaires de l'UE au d&#233;partement de la coop&#233;ration internationale, signale

une d&#233;cision prise l'ann&#233;e derni&#232;re par les ministres europ&#233;ens de la

coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, consistant &#224; &#233;valuer les programmes d'aide de

l'UE. "C'est un point important, bien que les dirigeants de la Commission, qui se sentaient menac&#233;s,

aient fait preuve de beaucoup de r&#233;sistance," explique Noorman. Il pense que l'&#233;valuation sera

pr&ecirc;te d'ici deux ou trois ans. "Donc, pour le moment, nous ne sommes pas en mesure de dire si

l'aide europ&#233;enne a &#233;t&#233; efficace ou non." N&#233;anmoins, l'exp&#233;rience montre,

selon Noorman, que l'UE est tr&#232;s bonne dans les domaines de l'ajustement structurel, de

l'int&#233;gration r&#233;gionale et des projets de s&#233;curit&#233; alimentaire mais qu'elle est plus

faible en mati&#232;re d'environnement.

<p>

Paul Hoebink, ma&icirc;tre assistant au centre du tiers-monde de l'universit&#233; catholique de

Nim&#232;gue, constate que l'un des &#233;l&#233;ments positifs de Lom&#233; est la fa&#231;on

dont la r&#233;partition des fonds est li&#233;e &#224; des crit&#232;res pr&#233;cis de pauvret&#233;

et de besoins. D'apr&#232;s Hoebink, les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts politiques et &#233;conomiques sont moins

dominants que dans d'autres formes de coop&#233;ration internationale.

<p>

L'autre versant du soutien "de l'aide et des &#233;changes" de Lom&#233; fut de pr&#233;voir un

acc&#232;s pr&#233;f&#233;rentiel des exportations ACP aux march&#233;s europ&#233;ens. 

<p>

Toutefois, en d&#233;pit de ces pr&#233;f&#233;rences, la plupart des pays ACP n'ont pas

&#233;t&#233; capables de progresser sur le plan &#233;conomique. Leur part de march&#233; est en

fait pass&#233;e de 6,7% en 1976 &#224; 3,4% en 1993. "On pourrait dire que sans Lom&#233; ces pays

auraient perdu bien davantage, mais ce n'est pas tr&#232;s satisfaisant," remarque Paul Hoebink,

chercheur &#224; l'universit&#233; de Nim&#232;gue.

<p>

Le tableau n'est cependant pas tout &#224; fait sombre. Quelques pays ont tir&#233; profit de l'accord

mais ils constituent des exceptions &#224; la r&#232;gle.

<p>

Les d&#233;tracteurs des pr&#233;f&#233;rences attirent l'attention sur les exp&#233;riences de certains

pays non ACP qui, avec moins de pr&#233;f&#233;rences commerciales, ont renforc&#233; leur position

sur le march&#233; europ&#233;en. "Les pays ACP n'ont pas utilis&#233; les possibilit&#233;s

commerciales qui leur &#233;taient propos&#233;es en partie du fait de leurs proc&#233;dures assez

complexes," reconna&icirc;t Noorman. "En outre, les pr&#233;f&#233;rences commerciales sont, en fait,

tr&#232;s limit&#233;es et peu int&#233;ressantes pour les soci&#233;t&#233;s plus importantes."

<p>

Noorman cite Maartje van Putten, membre n&#233;erlandais du Parlement  europ&#233;en, qui a

d&#233;clar&#233; que la quantit&#233; d'oignons pouvant &ecirc;tre export&#233;e &#224; des

conditions pr&#233;f&#233;rentielles dans l'UE &#233;quivalait &#224; la production annuelle d'oignons

de deux agriculteurs n&#233;erlandais.

<p>

Comme les bases industrielles des pays ACP sont g&#233;n&#233;ralement faibles, certains

d&#233;clarent que les exportations agricoles devraient constituer l'une de leurs forces. "Il est important

que leurs productions agricoles b&#233;n&#233;ficient d'un acc&#232;s aussi large que possible. Mais

c'est pr&#233;cis&#233;ment l&#224; un secteur sensible que l'Europe garde ferm&#233; autant qu'elle

peut," explique Noorman.

<p>

<h3>Int&#233;r&ecirc;ts diff&#233;rents</h3>



Lorsque les n&#233;gociations sur la deuxi&#232;me partie de Lom&#233; IV ont eu lieu l'ann&#233;e

derni&#232;re, il devint &#233;vident que l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t manifest&#233; par la partie

europ&#233;enne avait diminu&#233;. Le Royaume-Uni a r&#233;duit sa contribution d'un tiers;

l'Allemagne n'a jamais &#233;t&#233; une fervente partisane et seule la force motrice de la France a

permis d'arriver &#224; une conclusion heureuse de la r&#233;vision &#224; mi-parcours.

<p>

Une partie de la d&#233;fiance europ&#233;enne peut s'expliquer par l'histoire de la Convention de

Lom&#233;. Les pays ACP sont pour la plupart d'anciennes colonies fran&#231;aises et britanniques. La

France surtout est tr&#232;s attach&#233;e &#224; ses anciens liens coloniaux. "En principe, Lom&#233;

&#233;tait un trait&#233; n&#233;o-colonial impliquant les anciennes colonies de l'Union. C'&#233;tait

un mauvais d&#233;but," remarque Hoebink. Ces liens ont &#233;t&#233; affaiblis au cours des ans par

l'adh&#233;sion de nouveaux membres &#224; l'UE. Ces nouveaux membres ont des histoires coloniales

diff&#233;rentes ou n'en ont pas du tout (Autriche). D'autres raisons sont les budgets d'aide plus

restreints et la crainte que des engagements de cinq ans envers Lom&#233; entra&icirc;nent une restriction

des fonds destin&#233;s &#224; des objectifs bilat&#233;raux. En particulier lorsque les budgets

nationaux diminuent, Lom&#233; prend une proportion croissante de l'ensemble du budget national de

l'aide. Cette motivation &#233;tait particuli&#232;rement forte au Royaume-Uni o&ugrave; les

responsables de l'aide ont tenu &#224; ce que leurs engagements envers le cadre multilat&#233;ral de

Lom&#233; soient r&#233;duits.

<p>

<h3>Plus de discrimination &#224; l'avenir?</h3>

Des forces internes et externes sont &#224; l'origine du climat houleux qui entoure actuellement le

d&#233;bat sur Lom&#233;. S'il est encore trop t&ocirc;t pour que des plans d'action &#233;mergent,

le d&#233;bat s'anime &#224; mesure que les questions se font plus claires.

<p>

L'un des probl&#232;mes essentiels &#224; aborder est la discrimination, dans les deux sens du terme.

Premi&#232;rement, comment faire une discrimination entre les pays ACP, de mani&#232;re &#224; ce

que leurs diff&#233;rences se refl&#232;tent dans leurs relations avec l'Europe. Deuxi&#232;mement,

comment &#233;viter la discrimination envers les pays tr&#232;s pauvres qui sont actuellement exclus

des accords.

<p>

Bien qu'il ne veuille pas tirer de conclusion maintenant, Geert Laporte, de l'ECDPM, consid&#232;re une

approche plus diff&#233;renci&#233;e comme l'une des options. Laporte a "l'impression que l'on

travaille &#224; une sorte de r&#233;gionalisation. L'id&#233;e de base est qu'il est impossible de garder

soixante-dix pays ensemble parce qu'ils sont trop diff&#233;rents." Puisqu'il est clair que les pays ACP

sont confront&#233;s &#224; des probl&#232;mes diff&#233;rents, il est possible, &#224; son avis, que

Lom&#233; se transforme en un "accord global couvrant tous les pays en d&#233;veloppement,

doubl&#233; de sous-accords pour des pays et  des r&#233;gions sp&#233;cifiques."

<p>

On pourrait ainsi aboutir &#224; une r&#233;gion d'Afrique australe b&#233;n&#233;ficiant d'un soutien

diff&#233;rent de celui accord&#233; &#224; l'Afrique centrale, au Pacifique ou aux Cara&iuml;bes.

Hoebink constate qu'alors que "tout le monde parle de r&#233;gionalisation," il plaide pour un

trait&#233; incluant &#233;galement les pays en d&#233;veloppement d'Asie. "Le point capital d'une

nouvelle coop&#233;ration sera [d'inclure] un pays tel que l'Inde," pr&#233;voit-il, "parce que c'est une

force potentielle importante sur le march&#233; europ&#233;en."

<p>

Toutefois, pour Noorman, il n'est pas exclu que le cadre de Lom&#233; reste intact. Les difficult&#233;s

seront peut-&ecirc;tre tout simplement trop grandes. "Ce que nous avons &#233;tabli est le r&#233;sultat

de n&#233;gociations de plusieurs ann&#233;es entre des Etats membres qui tous ont des

int&#233;r&ecirc;ts diff&#233;rents. On est arriv&#233; &#224; un &#233;quilibre et il ne sera pas

ais&#233; d'en trouver un nouveau." "Quand on dit "Lom&#233;, c'est fini", il faut proposer d'autres

solutions", poursuit-il.

<p>

Ceci constitue un grand d&#233;fi pour l'avenir.

<h1 align=center>Tibet - a history</h1>

<h3>A farewell to arms </h3>

Tibet was a great military power back in the seventh century. A succession of kings - the most famous of whom was Srongsten Gampo - expanded Tibet far beyond its present boundaries, south into India and west into China. The Chinese Emperor then had to pay annual tribute of 10,000 rolls of silk to Tibet - a fact conveniently forgotten amid China's current claims of 'historical' dominance. <p>

It was during Srongsten Gampo's reign that Buddhism was introduced to the Tibetan court by two of his wives, one Nepalese and the other Chinese. By the end of the eighth century it had largely supplanted the native Bon religion. As Buddhism spread a wonderful thing happened. The previously warlike Tibetans gradually 'laid their weapons at the foot of the [Lord Buddha's] Lotus throne and forswore the arts of war'. By the end of the tenth century Tibet had withdrawn from Chinese and Indian territories. Tibetans did not entirely forget their military past, and no-one dared invade them, but they were no longer an expansionist people. <p>


<h3>Tea with Genghis </h3>

For the next three centuries Tibet was essentially isolationist but in 1207 it fell under Mongolian domination. This was the age of Genghis Khan, the Mongol warlord who ruled over China, Korea and territories stretching as far as Europe. While in Chinese and Persian history Genghis Khan is portrayed as barbaric, Tibetan history presents him as tough but fair. When he invited representatives from all the world's religions to his court to determine which was best, Tibetan Buddhists won the day - telling Genghis to sit in his favourite chair with a cup of his favourite brew beside him, they made the cup rise to his lips of its own accord. 



In 1350 Tibet resumed its independence but enjoyed a unique priest-patron relationship with Mongolia for the next few centuries. Tibetans looked after the spiritual welfare of the Mongols while Mongol lords made generous gifts to Tibetan monasteries and guaranteed Tibet's defence against would-be invaders.<p>




<h3>High Lamas and uncanny children </h3>

Out of this relatively stable religious climate emerged the Dalai Lama system. The Dalai Lama was to be both spiritual leader and head of state. When he died the search would begin for the child into whose body his spirit had chosen to be reincarnated. The first Dalai Lama, Pema Dorje (which means Lotus Thunderbolt), was born in 1391 of very poor peasants in the western highlands. From the day he was born miraculous things happened around him. By 1419 he was the first High Lama of Drepung, which was to become the biggest monastery in the world. Many of Tibet's great monasteries were founded during his reign and Buddhist thought and practice flourished. A few years after he died his successor was discovered in an uncannily mature child who had memories of a past life. The system worked relatively smoothly. Tibet prospered, especially during the the reign of the Great Fifth Dalai Lama who started building the Potala Palace, still the treasure house of Tibetan culture today.<p>


<h3>Covetous glances and murder 
mysteries </h3>

But by the mid-seventeeth century Mongol power was on the wane and the new Manchu or Qing Dynasty in China began to cast covetous glances in Tibet's direction. When the Great Fifth Dalai Lama died in 1682 there were fears that the Chinese would seize the chance to invade. Amazingly, his death was kept secret for 15 years as an impersonator was put in his place. Unfortunately when the new Dalai Lama was found and enthroned his main interests were sex, wine and love poetry. In 1720 a 2,000-strong Chinese garrison was placed in Lhasa, putting an intolerable strain on the capital's food supplies and the following year Chinese Emperor K'an Hsi pronounced that Tibet had always been a vassal of China. Few Tibetans took any notice. But Chinese influence grew all the same by backing the Regent - the power behind the throne made necessary due to the time-lag between a Dalai Lama's dying, being reborn and reaching adulthood. Three of the next five Dalai Lamas died in childhood and were probably murdered - and the other two took no interest in politics.<p>


<h3>Great games and betrayals </h3>

By the late nineteenth century Afghanistan, northern India and Tibet had become the setting of the Great Game, an imperialist power struggle. The British ruled India and were convinced that the Russians intended to gain regional influence by invading Tibet. In 1904 the British consolidated their position by themselves invading Tibet. The British military expedition, headed by Colonel Younghusband, met with resistance from the small Tibetan army. Two hundred British soldiers and several times that number of Tibetans died before Tibet signed a treaty, promising it would prevent other foreign powers from influencing its internal affairs and would trade with British India. When Chinese troops entered Lhasa six years later, the Dalai Lama appealed to the British to help expel them. To his surprise the British refused. Luckily the corrupt Chinese empire was in its death throes and fell to Nationalists in 1911. Tibetans seized the chance to throw out the invaders. In June 1912 the Dalai Lama proclaimed Tibetan independence.<p>


<h3>Feudal foibles and leisured 
splendour </h3>

Tibet may have entered the twentieth century but its people were living in conditions that had more in common with medieval times in Europe. Feudal landowners and powerful monasteries held sway in most of the country and peasants had to pay them the equivalent of tithes. Secular education did not exist. The Thirteenth Dalai Lama was virtually alone in his realization that for Tibet to survive in the modern world changes would have to be made. He tried to reform land ownership, the legal and penal system, the civil service and education. He also tried to establish a modern Tibetan army. But time and again his initiatives were blocked by powerful traditionalists, both religious and secular. He died before seeing the dreadful outcome of this rigidity. The leisured splendour of the secular Žlite looked to the outside world for some things - Lhasa shops sold Scotch whisky and Elizabeth Arden cosmetics - but there were still no diplomatic relations with foreign countries. When Communists came to power in China in 1949 only a handful of Tibetans had any idea what this might mean for their country. <p>


<h3>Isolation and invasion </h3>

On 1 January 1950 Radio Beijing announced that: 'The task of the People's Liberation Army for 1950 is to liberate Tibet.' Chinese propaganda explained that Tibet was dominated by foreign imperialists (six Westerners lived there at the time) and that the Tibetan victims of a feudal regime could wait no longer for their 'peaceful liberation'. On 7 October, 84,000 Chinese troops penetrated Tibet's eastern province of Kham. They met with unexpected resistance from Khampa horseriders fighting with swords against Chinese guns. News of the invasion went unheeded in Lhasa: the entire Tibetan government was out picnicking when the telegram arrived. When appeals went out for international help, India and Nepal expressed sympathy but did nothing and Britain called for adjournment of the UN debate on the invasion. On 17 November 1950 15-year-old Tenzin Gyatso was prematurely given full powers to rule as Fourteenth Dalai Lama.

 

In 1951 the Chinese presented him with an 'agreement' promising that neither Tibet's social system nor its religion would be changed but that Tibetans would 'return to the big family of the Motherland, the People's Republic of China'. Without international support he had no choice but to sign. <p>



<h3>Uprising and crackdown</h3>

The Chinese believed the Tibetan masses would embrace the benefits of communism. But although standards of living were low, no-one went hungry and the traditional ruling powers were paternalistic rather than brutal. In 1953 Mao Zedong promised the Dalai Lama the Chinese would leave Tibet once 'liberation' was complete. Instead persecution by the Chinese led hundreds to head for the mountains to join the guerrilla organization Chushi Gangdrug ('Four Rivers, Six Ranges'). In March 1959 Tibetan resistance exploded. Fearing a Chinese plot to kidnap him, the Dalai Lama went into exile in India. The Chinese cracked down hard. Chinese figures record 87,000 deaths while Tibetan sources suggest as many as 430,000 were killed in the Uprising and subsequent years of guerrilla warfare. Large-scale and systematic Chinese brutality began, involving an arsenal of torture and humiliation methods. Peasants and nomads lost freedom of movement and were ordered into communes. Tens of thousands of Tibetans starved to death between 1959 and 1961 in the famines that followed Mao's disastrous Great Leap Forward.<p>


<h3>The darkest years </h3>

In 1966 Mao Zedong launched the 'Cultural Revolution' - and the decade that followed was to be Tibet's darkest. Threatened by the opposition he felt growing within his Party, Mao turned to China's youth and ordered them to eradicate the 'the four olds' (old ideas, old culture, old customs, old habits). Red Guards, most in their teens, went on the rampage, righteously intimidating, beating and killing 'reactionaries', 'class enemies' and 'spies'. In Tibet it meant full-scale war on a people and a civilization. Thousands of monasteries were looted and razed. Tens of thousands of Tibetans, lay and ordained, were persecuted and sent to labour camps. Red Guards poured into Lhasa from China, to be joined on their rampages by some Tibetan youths. 



Every home was raided and statues or images of Buddha were destroyed and replaced with pictures of Mao. Holy texts were turned into toilet paper. Only when Mao died in 1976 did the onslaught ease.<p>



<h3>Money, money, money</h3>

In 1980 the outspoken Chinese leader Hu Yaobang came to Tibet and made an extraordinary comment: the country was in a shambles, he said. The Communist Party had 'let Tibetans down' - they were worse off than before due to 'plain colonialism'. Money was allocated for rebuilding monasteries and tourism was encouraged. Unfortunately Hu was soon disgraced and paramount leader Deng Xiaoping, while steering China away from Maoism towards capitalism, has been just as repressive as Mao in his attitude to Tibet. The 1980s saw the Dalai Lama changing strategy: he started making political speeches on his visits abroad and international support for Tibetan independence grew. In 1988 he made the Strasbourg proposal, a compromise which called for genuine autonomy rather than independence - but still the Chinese would not negotiate. In 1989 the Dalai Lama was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Back in Lhasa, Tibetans had been taking to the streets in a a new era of protest which began in 1987 and continues today, despite intense repression. China's interests in Tibet have now lost any ideological tinge they might once have had: it wants to extract its natural resources and to inject Chinese colonists.<p>

<h2>Developing Stories</h2>
<font size=2 face=helvetica,arial>In 1989, TVE, in alliance with the BBC and the One World Group of
Broadcasters, pioneered the first Developing Stories series, which provided six outstanding film-makers
from the South with an opportunity to make their own programmes, in their own chosen genres,
presenting their view on environment and development issues. Broadcast in 98 countries in the run-up to
the1992 UN Earth Summit, the six films in this first series went on to win 25 international awards, and to
be used in countless festivals, seminars and educational campaigns. </font>

<p>
<font size=2 face=helvetica,arial>A second series, Developing Stories II, showcased four more films timed
to coincide with the Cairo International Conference on Population and Development in September 1994.
With their focus on the linked issues of population, resource depletion, poverty and migration, issues that
were at the heart of the conference, the series has so far been broadcast in 40 countries. The concept
behind Developing Stories has been adopted for a new series of programmes that has been developed by
TVE to raise awareness of, and coincide with, the Fourth World Conference on Women. Entitled Women of
the World the package of programmes consists of documentaries and shorts, news features and 'spots'
made by Southern women producers, exploring some of the issues on the agenda at the Fourth World
Conference on Women, taking place in Beijing in September 1995.</font>

<H3>Scientific and technological cooperation between the European

Community and Latin America</h3>

<P>

The present article regarding scientific and technological cooperation

between the European Community and Latin America can be placed

in the context of the development aid and cooperation offered

by the European Union in the framework of its foreign policy with

the Latin American region. The main aim here consists in analyzing

those cooperation programmes established by the European Community

with the developing countries of Latin America regarding science

and technology, with the goal of identifying, both on the European

Union as well as on the Latin American side, the mechanisms established

for putting this into practice as well as the perspectives for

success which these can generate in the framework of regional

cooperation.

<a name=ant></a><h3>Antecedentes</h3> </P>

<P>

El progreso de los Pa&iacute;ses en V&iacute;as de Desarrollo

(PVD) estaba relacionado inicialmente , directamente, con la pol&iacute;tica

metr&oacute;poli-colonial ejercida por las grandes potencias de

la &eacute;poca <a href="#1">(1)</a>. Con el final del colonialismo y a partir

de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, nace la voluntad por parte de todos

los pa&iacute;ses del establecimiento de nuevas Relaciones Internacionales,

con el objeto de lograr su bienestar social, pol&iacute;tico y

comercial, mediante el fortalecimiento de la paz y del desarrollo

econ&oacute;mico. </P>

<P>

Con el nacimiento de las organizaciones internacionales, el fortalecimiento

de &oacute;rganos regionales y el aumento de las demandas por

parte de los PVD de una participaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s igualitaria

en el comercio mundial, a fin de alcanzar su esperado desarrollo

econ&oacute;mico y social, toma cuerpo la idea de la cooperaci&oacute;n

internacional <a href="#2">(2)</a>. </P>

<P>

El principio de igualdad en la v&iacute;a econ&oacute;mica internacional

conlleva un concepto diferente de Estado que, al rev&eacute;s

del concepto cl&aacute;sico del Derecho Internacional, el cual

determina un mismo estatus jur&iacute;dico a los Estados soberanos,

se fundamenta en base a un concepto singular, donde cada Estado

est&aacute; sometido a un r&eacute;gimen jur&iacute;dico propio

en raz&oacute;n de su grado de desarrollo <a href="#3">(3)</a>. Este car&aacute;cter

jur&iacute;dico diferenciado, posibilita que los pa&iacute;ses

menos desarrollados se beneficien de ventajas especiales y diferenciadas

en relaci&oacute;n a los industrializados, fruto del principio

de solidaridad que, junto al de igualdad ya mencionado y al de

soberan&iacute;a, constituyen los fundamentos base del derecho

al desarrollo; entendido como el conjunto de reglas jur&iacute;dicas

establecidas en favor de los PVD, destinadas a que estos accedan

a determinadas oportunidades espec&iacute;ficas, con el objeto

de promover su progreso y posibilitar una actuaci&oacute;n m&aacute;s

igualitaria en el comercio internacional, fortaleciendo su presencia

en la sociedad internacional. </P>

<P>

En el dominio del desarrollo, existen dos formas para evidenciar

la colaboraci&oacute;n entre Estados, una mediante la ayuda y

asistencia internacional y otra por la v&iacute;a de la cooperaci&oacute;n

internacional <a href="#4">(4)</a>. El criterio jur&iacute;dico-econ&oacute;mico

que permite calificar tales operaciones como de ayuda, est&aacute;

en las condiciones m&aacute;s favorables existentes, con relaci&oacute;n

a las que se exigen para las mismas actividades a otros sujetos.

</P>

<P>

Los t&eacute;rminos ayuda y asistencia est&aacute;n siendo paulatinamente

sustituidos por el de cooperaci&oacute;n, en base a dos razones

principales: de un lado, porque la cooperaci&oacute;n, entendida

en sentido estricto como la puesta en com&uacute;n de recursos

destinados a la realizaci&oacute;n de un objetivo predeterminado

por las partes en relaci&oacute;n de igualdad entre s&iacute;,

supone una mayor reciprocidad, en la medida que existe una colaboraci&oacute;n

mutua de medios, riesgos y beneficios. Cambia, pues, el matiz

de la operaci&oacute;n, a trav&eacute;s de la donaci&oacute;n

se comparten conocimiento, activos, t&eacute;cnicas, riesgos y

beneficios. Hecho que, de cierta forma, promueve la soberan&iacute;a

e independencia de los PVD frente a los pa&iacute;ses industrializados

(PI). De otro lado, puede entenderse que la asistencia o ayuda

sean partes de una obra com&uacute;n: la cooperaci&oacute;n, teniendo

estas dos operaciones car&aacute;cter transitorio <a href="#5">(5)</a>. </P>

<P>

En la actualidad, entretanto, y en vista al contenido fundamental

de las operaciones de cooperaci&oacute;n entre pa&iacute;ses industrializados

y PVD, el t&eacute;rmino cooperaci&oacute;n no se diferencia en

el fondo del de ayuda otorgada a pa&iacute;ses menos desarrollados,

manteniendo la interdependencia de los pa&iacute;ses perif&eacute;ricos

frente a los centrales. </P>

<P>

<a name=coo></a><h3>La cooperaci&#243;n cient&#237;fica y tecnol&#243;gica</h3>

</P>

<P>

La cooperaci&oacute;n internacional comprende innumerables operaciones,

situadas a su vez en varios sectores econ&oacute;micos. Sus formas

o modalidades pueden ser did&aacute;cticamente clasificadas mediante

tres criterios diferenciadores <a href="#6">(6)</a>: el primero, con respecto al

origen de la ayuda o aportaci&oacute;n; seg&uacute;n este criterio,

la cooperaci&oacute;n puede tener car&aacute;cter p&uacute;blico,

concesional o no concesional, o un car&aacute;cter privado, que

consiste en aportaciones del sector privado a la cooperaci&oacute;n.

Un segundo criterio dispone sobre las modalidades de la cooperaci&oacute;n,

o sea, si son realizadas bilateral o multilateralmente. En efecto,

estas dos formas son usadas conjuntamente; la primera se puede

entender como aquella realizada mediante la intervenci&oacute;n

del Gobierno u organismo privado de un pa&iacute;s y de un Gobierno

u organismos de un PVD. Ser&iacute;a esta modalidad, seg&uacute;n

el profesor Michel B&eacute;langer <a href="#7">(7)</a>, la forma m&aacute;s tradicional

de cooperaci&oacute;n, remont&aacute;ndose sus or&iacute;genes

a la era colonial. El inconveniente de este tipo de colaboraci&oacute;n,

desde la &oacute;ptica de los PVD, es que puede llegar a traducirse

en pretensiones imperialistas y de expansi&oacute;n comercial

por parte de los PI; de otro lado &eacute;sta puede, a la inversa,

representar una respuesta m&aacute;s pragm&aacute;tica a carencias

concretas de los PVD <a href="#8">(8)</a>. </P>

<P>

La cooperaci&oacute;n multilateral se sit&uacute;a en el cuadro

de las organizaciones internacionales y se caracteriza por efectuar

aportaciones concebidas a trav&eacute;s de la contribuci&oacute;n

de sus Estados miembros, generalmente pa&iacute;ses industrializados,

en favor de los PVD. </P>

<P>

El &uacute;ltimo criterio diferenciador es el relativo a los objetos

sujetos a la cooperaci&oacute;n. La cooperaci&oacute;n puede revestir

una gama de modalidades seg&uacute;n el objeto de transferencia

de la operaci&oacute;n; aunque la multiplicidad de prestaciones

destinadas a los PVD se reducen a dos categor&iacute;as <a href="#9">(9)</a>: la

transmisi&oacute;n de conocimientos y la aportaci&oacute;n de

capital. Esta &uacute;ltima se estructura a trav&eacute;s de las

contribuciones realizadas mediante las donaciones de los organismos

internacionales y regionales, las ayudas realizadas por los propios

Estados bilateralmente y las aportaciones del sector privado.

La transmisi&oacute;n de conocimientos, a su vez, se concreta

mediante la asistencia t&eacute;cnica y la transferencia de tecnolog&iacute;a,

objetivos de fondo de las pol&iacute;ticas de cooperaci&oacute;n

en ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a. </P>

<P>

Es una condici&oacute;n para el desarrollo el acceso al progreso

t&eacute;cnico; por tanto hace falta, de un lado, capital humano

cualificado y capacitado para asimilar las nuevas innovaciones

tecnol&oacute;gicas emergentes y, de otro, la posibilidad de vivenciar

tales innovaciones. </P>

<P>

El profesor Papanicolaou <a href="#10">(10)</a> expone que los retrasos en la puesta

en marcha de grandes proyectos de inversi&oacute;n son debidos,

de un lado, a la falta de planes micro y macro econ&oacute;micos

bien elaborados para su consecuci&oacute;n y, de otro, al bajo

nivel del personal en asimilar tal operaci&oacute;n. Siguiendo

su argumentaci&oacute;n, se concluye que estos dos factores tienen

en com&uacute;n el elemento humano y que es la formaci&oacute;n,

en realidad, le principal goulot d&#180;etranglement du d&eacute;velopment

&eacute;conomique. </P>

<P>

Desde finales de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, la cooperaci&oacute;n

t&eacute;cnica se ha transformado en un rasgo permanente de las

relaciones econ&oacute;micas internacionales Norte-Sur. Inicialmente

esta cooperaci&oacute;n fue utilizada como el &uacute;nico medio

de la transmisi&oacute;n de conocimientos de los PI a los PVD

<a href="#11">(11)</a>. </P>

<P>

Esta clase de colaboraci&oacute;n tiene dos rasgos primordiales:

de un lado, sirve como instrumento de aceleraci&oacute;n en la

formaci&oacute;n de t&eacute;cnicos, cuadros directivos y administradores

de los PVD mediante la transmisi&oacute;n de experiencias o consejos

elaborados por expertos de los pa&iacute;ses m&aacute;s avanzados,

y est&aacute; caracterizada como asistencia t&eacute;cnica de

los pa&iacute;ses industrializados a los pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo.

Esta asistencia o ayuda se realiza generalmente por medio de la

concesi&oacute;n de becas a los investigadores de los PVD para

su formaci&oacute;n, y/o a trav&eacute;s de suministros de personal

humano y equipo necesario para la realizaci&oacute;n de un proyecto

conjunto de investigaci&oacute;n y desarrollo. Las participaciones

referidas, en el supuesto de la cooperaci&oacute;n multilateral,

se efect&uacute;an mediante programas generales de ayuda o asistencia

t&eacute;cnica y cient&iacute;fica, gestionados por organismos

internacionales o regionales, los cuales pueden tener car&aacute;cter

general <a href="#12">(12)</a> o espec&iacute;fico en determinados pa&iacute;ses

o grupos de pa&iacute;ses <a href="#13">(13)</a>. </P>

<P>

De otro lado, y dado que es cada vez m&aacute;s generalizado el

convencimiento que el desarrollo econ&oacute;mico depende sobre

todo de la materia gris, entendida en su triple acepci&oacute;n

de creaci&oacute;n/descubrimiento de medios y productos, innovaci&oacute;n

o aplicaci&oacute;n de lo creado con fines de inversi&oacute;n

y consumo y de organizaci&oacute;n de tareas <a href="#14">(14)</a>; y la manifiesta

desigualdad que origina el desarrollo econ&oacute;mico de un pa&iacute;s

con respecto a otro, queda patente en la necesidad por parte de

los pa&iacute;ses menos desarrollados de acceder e importar los

conocimientos mencionados o, en otras palabras, de acceder a la

transferencia tecnol&oacute;gica. </P>

<P>

La mejora de sus bases tecnol&oacute;gicas y la importaci&oacute;n

de los insumos indispensables para el restablecimiento, mantenimiento

y ampliaci&oacute;n de la capacidad de producci&oacute;n, a fin

de hacer frente a los desaf&iacute;os del crecimiento y a los

cambios estructurales imprescindibles para una mejor participaci&oacute;n

en la econom&iacute;a internacional, motivan a los PVD a movilizar

recursos tecnol&oacute;gicos exteriores y a activar canales, mecanismos,

corrientes e instrumentos para la transferencia tecnol&oacute;gica.

A partir de esta perspectiva, la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica

y t&eacute;cnica entre los PI y los PVD debe, adem&aacute;s, de

contribuir a la capacitaci&oacute;n y formaci&oacute;n de capital

humano de estos &uacute;ltimos, servir como mecanismo de transferencia

de conocimientos y t&eacute;cnicas que supongan un mayor enlace

de los PVD en la econom&iacute;a internacional y contribuya a

la mejora de las Relaciones Internacionales Norte-Sur. </P>

<P>

Los objetivos del presente trabajo ser&aacute;n analizar la cooperaci&oacute;n

entre la Uni&oacute;n Europea y los PVD de Am&eacute;rica Latina

en materia de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a, para lo cual debemos

identificar de un lado los mecanismos de &eacute;sta y, de otro,

sus perspectivas. </P>

<P>

<a name=coop></a><h3>La cooperaci&#243;n cient&#237;fica y tecnol&#243;gica entre la Comunidad y Am&#233;rica Latina </h3> </P>

<P>

<B>Aproximaci&oacute;n en las Relaciones Comunidad Europea y Am&eacute;rica

Latina</B> </P>

<P>

La pol&iacute;tica comunitaria de cooperaci&oacute;n o de desarrollo

naci&oacute; por incidente, o incluso por accidente <a href="#15">(15)</a>, dentro

de las negociaciones del Tratado de Roma en 1957, cuando Francia

impuls&oacute; la asociaci&oacute;n a la Comunidad de sus colonias.

A esta propuesta se adher&iacute;an B&eacute;lgica, Italia y Pa&iacute;ses

Bajos. Con la independencia de estos territorios se establecen

unas nuevas relaciones de colaboraci&oacute;n fundadas sobre el

principio de soberan&iacute;a de las nuevas naciones. A partir

de la ampliaci&oacute;n de la Comunidad, con la incorporaci&oacute;n

del Reino Unido, Irlanda y Dinamarca y, por consiguiente, de los

territorios de la Commonwealth a la asociaci&oacute;n, se promueven

privilegiadas relaciones con los pa&iacute;ses asociados, principalmente

con la firma de la Convenci&oacute;n de Lom&eacute; <a href="#16">(16)</a> y con

el inicio de una pol&iacute;tica europea en el Mediterr&aacute;neo

<a href="#17">(17)</a>. </P>

<P>

Los mencionados lazos eclipsaron los intereses de la cooperaci&oacute;n

comunitaria hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina, cuyo trato se ha desarrollado

en el &aacute;mbito de las relaciones de los pa&iacute;ses no

alineados o no asociados <a href="#18">(18)</a>, y mediante etapas progresivas.

Concretamente en la d&eacute;cada de los ochenta, coincidiendo

con el Tercer Decenio del Desarrollo, decretado por las Naciones

Unidas para el per&iacute;odo 1981-1990, es cuando se polariza

la idea de un Nuevo Orden Econ&oacute;mico Internacional por parte

de los pa&iacute;ses pobres, representando para las relaciones

entre las dos regiones un cambio de postura en pro al acercamiento.

</P>

<P>

Desde 1972 el Consejo Europeo proclama la necesidad de la realizaci&oacute;n

de una pol&iacute;tica global de cooperaci&oacute;n, que debe

ser efectuada por medio de las orientaciones e instrumentos desarrollados

por la Comisi&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

El Comunicado de la Comisi&oacute;n al Consejo en 1984, sobre

Las orientaciones para el fortalecimiento de las relaciones entre

la Comunidad y Am&eacute;rica Latina <a href="#19">(19)</a>, representa la primera

ocasi&oacute;n en que se elaboran por parte de la Comunidad unas

directrices para el fortalecimiento de la cooperaci&oacute;n multilateral

entre ambas regiones. </P>

<P>

Teniendo en cuenta la carencia de inter&eacute;s de la pol&iacute;tica

exterior de la Comunidad hacia Latinoam&eacute;rica, adem&aacute;s

del fr&aacute;gil di&aacute;logo, hasta entonces existente entre

las dos &aacute;reas, estas orientaciones no han conducido a un

cambio significativo en la mencionada relaci&oacute;n. La necesidad

y voluntad de una mejora cualitativa y cuantitativa de &eacute;sta,

vino a ra&iacute;z de numerosos factores de significativa importancia.

Desde el prisma de Am&eacute;rica Latina, cabr&iacute;a destacar,

de un lado, la democratizaci&oacute;n de sus Estados, todav&iacute;a

no consolidada en raz&oacute;n de la continua crisis social y

econ&oacute;mica que viven muchos de &eacute;stos y que impide

y/o distorsiona el edificio institucional de la democracia representativa.

De otro lado, la implementaci&oacute;n de programas de ajustes

macroecon&oacute;micos y el cambio en el modelo vigente de sustituci&oacute;n

de las importaciones, han permitido la modificaci&oacute;n substancial

en sus pol&iacute;ticas exteriores, traduci&eacute;ndose en la

voluntad de diversificar &eacute;stas, por medio de la integraci&oacute;n

de sus econom&iacute;as en el orden econ&oacute;mico internacional

actual. </P>

<P>

Con respecto a la Comunidad, la adhesi&oacute;n de Portugal y

Espa&ntilde;a, pa&iacute;ses con tradicionales lazos de amistad

y una historia com&uacute;n con Latinoam&eacute;rica, y el aumento

de la competencia en materia de pol&iacute;tica exterior, a ra&iacute;z

del Tratado de Maastricht, signific&oacute; la revitalizaci&oacute;n

del inter&eacute;s comunitario hacia esta regi&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

Igualmente, se estableci&oacute; un di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico

y comercial fluido entre ambas regiones, iniciado a partir de

una conferencia, realizada al margen de la reuni&oacute;n del

27 de septiembre de 1987 de la Asamblea General de las Naciones

Unidas en Nueva York, entre la Comunidad Europea y los pa&iacute;ses

pertenecientes al Grupo de R&iacute;o, bloque surgido por la fusi&oacute;n

de dos grupos de pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos: el grupo Contadora

(Colombia, M&eacute;xico, Panam&aacute; y Venezuela) y el grupo

de Apoyo (Argentina, Brasil, Per&uacute; y Uruguay); en 1988 Panam&aacute;

fue apartado de &eacute;stos y en 1990 ingresan en &eacute;l:

Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador y Paraguay. En la actualidad forman el

grupo de once pa&iacute;ses que, a su vez, coinciden con los miembros

de la Asociaci&oacute;n Latinoamericana de Integraci&oacute;n

(ALADI). </P>

<P>

Este di&aacute;logo se institucionaliza el 20 de diciembre de

1990 en la Conferencia informal de Roma, mediante la aprobaci&oacute;n

de las partes de la realizaci&oacute;n anual de Conferencias Ministeriales

entre las dos regiones, representando el marco institucional de

las relaciones latinoamericanas y comunitarias. </P>

<P>

Como resultado inmediato a esta nueva fase de relaciones destaca,

en lo institucional, adem&aacute;s del desarrollo de un foro pol&iacute;tico

entre la Comunidad y el Grupo de R&iacute;o, un aumento de la

posici&oacute;n de la CE en Am&eacute;rica Latina, con las nuevas

aperturas de embajadas o delegaciones de la Comisi&oacute;n en

las capitales latinoamericanas <a href="#20">(20)</a>. En lo comercial, la aplicaci&oacute;n

anticipada de la Oferta de Montreal, dentro de la Ronda de Uruguay,

permite una mejora en las condiciones de acceso al mercado comunitario

de productos latinoamericanos. Y finalmente, en lo que respecta

a la cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica entre las dos regiones

se han incrementado por parte de la CE instrumentos y mecanismos

de incentivo a la inversi&oacute;n comunitaria hacia Am&eacute;rica

Latina, adem&aacute;s de la posibilidad por parte del Banco Europeo

de Inversiones (BEI), de invertir en proyectos de inversi&oacute;n

en Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia. </P>

<P>

En el &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica y

cient&iacute;fica interregional, a ra&iacute;z de la institucionalizaci&oacute;n

de un di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico y con la finalidad de evitar

el aislamiento de cient&iacute;ficos de ambas regiones, promoviendo

a largo plazo el mercado com&uacute;n del conocimiento; tanto

la CE como Am&eacute;rica Latina han elaborado programas y/o instrumentos

que albergan capital humano de ambas regiones, en el &aacute;rea

de la investigaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y tecnol&oacute;gica.

El descubrimiento y el an&aacute;lisis de estos mecanismos de

cooperaci&oacute;n es la tarea del presente trabajo, para lo cual,

se intentar&aacute;n describir los instrumentos de cooperaci&oacute;n

de la CE hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina y los programas latinoamericanos

de participaci&oacute;n europea y extranjera. </P>

<P>

<B>Mecanismos e instrumentos de la Cooperaci&oacute;n de la Comunidad

Europea y Am&eacute;rica Latina</B> </P>

<P>

A efectos de la cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo con los pa&iacute;ses

en v&iacute;as de desarrollo de Asia y Am&eacute;rica Latina,

la Comunidad dispone actualmente de los instrumentos siguientes:

</P>

<P>

La cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica, cuyo

objetivo es facilitar a los PVD los resultados de la investigaci&oacute;n

europea, y tambi&eacute;n abrir &eacute;sta a los problemas espec&iacute;ficos

del Tercer Mundo <a href="#21">(21)</a>. </P>

<P>

La pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica

de la CE con los PVD no asociados se realiza en el contexto de

programas globales, enfocados a su aprovechamiento por los PVD

m&aacute;s avanzados <a href="#22">(22)</a>. Se realizan mediante la financiaci&oacute;n

de proyectos conjuntos de investigaci&oacute;n, as&iacute; como

creaci&oacute;n de bolsas de estudios, financiaci&oacute;n de

work shops cient&iacute;ficos, talleres, etc. </P>

<P>

La Comunidad ha utilizado algunos instrumentos para acrecentar

y llevar a cabo el desarrollo de su cooperaci&oacute;n internacional

en materia de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a; tradicionalmente dos

ser&iacute;an los principales: el SDT- Programa de Ciencia y T&eacute;cnica

al servicio del Desarrollo- y el ISC -Cooperaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica

Internacional <a href="#23">(23)</a>. A ra&iacute;z del di&aacute;logo entre el

Grupo de R&iacute;o y la CE, se posibilita la participaci&oacute;n

de organismos latinoamericanos en los programas macro de investigaci&oacute;n

y desarrollo de la Comunidad. </P>

<P>

Finalmente, en el &aacute;mbito de la pol&iacute;tica Europea

de cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo, dest&aacute;case el programa

COLUMBUS, creado en 1987 por la Comisi&oacute;n de los Rectores

Europeos (CRE), representando el principal mecanismo de asistencia

internacional en lo que respecta a la formaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica

y a la movilidad interuniversitaria. </P>

<P>

<B>STD-Ciencia y T&eacute;cnica al servicio del Desarrollo</B>

</P>

<P>

La cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica de la Comunidad con Am&eacute;rica

Latina se basa principalmente en el intercambio de conocimientos

cient&iacute;ficos pre-competitivos o sea, aquellos que no est&aacute;n

en relaci&oacute;n directa con el perfeccionamiento de un producto

que est&aacute; en un mercado. Es una investigaci&oacute;n, por

lo tanto, que no va dirigida a mejorar la productividad espec&iacute;fica

de un pa&iacute;s o un producto. </P>

<P>

El primer instrumento de la cooperaci&oacute;n europea en materia

de ciencia y t&eacute;cnica que afect&oacute; Am&eacute;rica Latina

fue el denominado STD-Ciencia y T&eacute;cnica al Servicio del

Desarrollo, creado en 1987, el cual comprende tres per&iacute;odos

de realizaci&oacute;n de cuatro a&ntilde;os: el STD1 (1983-1986),

el STD2 (1987-1991) y, finalmente, el STD3 (1990-1994) <a href="#24">(24)</a>. </P>

<P>

Este programa se incluye en el Programa Marco de la Comunidad

en materia de investigaci&oacute;n y desarrollo <a href="#25">(25)</a>, sus objetivos

globales ser&iacute;an: el fomento de una mayor y mejor coordinaci&oacute;n

en el &aacute;mbito europeo del desarrollo de la cooperaci&oacute;n

cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica entre los pa&iacute;ses en

v&iacute;as de desarrollo <a href="#26">(26)</a>, el incentivo al fortalecimiento

de la capacidad en materia cient&iacute;fica de los PVD, la reestructuraci&oacute;n

del modelo actual de Relaciones Internacionales en dominio cient&iacute;fico

y t&eacute;cnico, y la ayuda a la creaci&oacute;n y desarrollo

de c&eacute;lulas de investigaci&oacute;n en el Tercer Mundo.

</P>

<P>

El &aacute;mbito de aplicaci&oacute;n de este instrumento est&aacute;

en la investigaci&oacute;n en materia de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a

de los seres vivos, dando prioridad los temas relativos a la agricultura,

nutrici&oacute;n, medicina y medio ambiente. Esta investigaci&oacute;n

tiene a su vez dos &aacute;reas de actuaci&oacute;n, la agricultura

y la medicina <a href="#27">(27)</a>, distribuidas en la mejora del nivel de vida,

con &eacute;nfasis en la investigaci&oacute;n de m&eacute;todos

duraderos de producci&oacute;n agr&iacute;cola, vegetal y animal

logrando la reducci&oacute;n del d&eacute;ficit alimentario de

algunos PVD, y mejorando cualitativamente la participaci&oacute;n

de los referidos pa&iacute;ses en los intercambios internacionales.

Investigaciones que fomenten el desarrollo de las producciones

agr&iacute;colas de alto valor econ&oacute;mico, por medio del

estudio de sistemas de producci&oacute;n y marketing de los cultivos

de renta. Mecanismos para el aumento cuantitativo y cualitativo

de las producciones para la satisfacci&oacute;n de las normas

del comercio internacional y la mejora de los valores de mercado

de los productos producidos, as&iacute; como el estudio sobre

las posibilidades de transformaci&oacute;n in situ de esos productos,

con &eacute;nfasis en la protecci&oacute;n medio ambiental. </P>

<P>

Otra &aacute;rea es la relativa a la mejora del estado de salud;

los objetivos aqu&iacute; ser&iacute;an, de un lado, investigaciones

sobre la prevenci&oacute;n y tratamiento de enfermedades predominantes

en los PVD, con &eacute;nfasis en las enfermedades tropicales

(transmisivas o no) y enfermedades de transmisi&oacute;n sexual

(especialmente el SIDA), y de otro lado, la ayuda en la creaci&oacute;n

u organizaci&oacute;n de sistemas de asistencia sanitaria adaptados

al medio rural o urbano de los PVD. </P>

<P>

El importe estimado necesario para la ejecuci&oacute;n del programa

STD es de 109,89 millones de Ecus, de los que 71,43 millones est&aacute;n

destinados al &aacute;rea de la agricultura y 38,46 a la de medicina,

sanidad y nutrici&oacute;n. Este desglose no excluye la posibilidad

de que determinados proyectos afecten de forma simult&aacute;nea

a ambas &aacute;reas <a href="#28">(28)</a>. </P>

<P>

Las modalidades de realizaci&oacute;n de este programa se concretan

en las siguientes: </P>

<P>

-Proyectos conjuntos de investigaci&oacute;n, entre al menos un

socio establecido en la Comunidad (Universidad, organismos de

investigaci&oacute;n, empresas...). Los acuerdos ser&aacute;n

objeto de contratos de Investigaci&oacute;n y Desarrollo (I+D)

celebrados mediante un procedimiento de selecci&oacute;n, basado

en convocatorias de propuestas publicadas en el Diario Oficial

de las Comunidades Europeas (DOCE). Los costes son compartidos,

la Comunidad no puede participar financieramente con un porcentaje

superior al 50% del total de la acci&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

-Medidas complementarias destinadas a la organizaci&oacute;n de

seminarios, talleres y conferencias cient&iacute;ficas, actividades

de formaci&oacute;n de vanguardia y de fomento de la explotaci&oacute;n

de los resultados de las investigaciones realizadas. </P>

<P>

-Acciones concertadas, consisten en el esfuerzo de la Comunidad

para coordinar la investigaci&oacute;n que se realice por sus

Estados miembros. </P>

<P>

<B>Cooperaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica Internacional: El programa

ALAMED</B> </P>

<P>

El programa ALAMED (Programa de Cooperaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica

y T&eacute;cnica entre la Comunidad Europea y pa&iacute;ses de

Am&eacute;rica Latina, Asia y Mediterr&aacute;neo) es una cooperaci&oacute;n

complementaria al programa anteriormente analizado y est&aacute;

integrado en el programa de cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica

internacional de la CE, creado en 1984, del cual s&oacute;lo se

pueden beneficiar los pa&iacute;ses en desarrollo con los que

la Comunidad mantiene un acuerdo de cooperaci&oacute;n bilateral

<a href="#29">(29)</a>. </P>

<P>

Este programa pretende facilitar la movilidad entre los cient&iacute;ficos

comunitarios y los de las regiones citadas, estableciendo relaciones

fluidas y permanentes entre Europa y los dem&aacute;s pa&iacute;ses.

</P>

<P>

Los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica Latina participantes son los

siguientes: Argentina, Bolivia, Brasil, Chile, Colombia, Costa

Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, M&eacute;xico,

Nicaragua, Panam&aacute;, Per&uacute;, Uruguay y Venezuela <a href="#30">(30)</a>.

</P>

<P>

En contrapartida al programa SDT, los campos de investigaci&oacute;n

del ISC abarcan una amplia gama de disciplinas como f&iacute;sica,

matem&aacute;ticas e ingenier&iacute;a, materiales, qu&iacute;mica,

medio ambiente, ciencias de la tierra, salud y biomedicina, biolog&iacute;a

y agricultura <a href="#31">(31)</a>. Cada pa&iacute;s tiene predefinidas las &aacute;reas

de actuaci&oacute;n de este programa, por acuerdos mutuos entre

la CE y las autoridades nacionales. </P>

<P>

La colaboraci&oacute;n se canaliza principalmente mediante la

elaboraci&oacute;n de proyectos conjuntos de investigaci&oacute;n,

de dos a tres a&ntilde;os de duraci&oacute;n, financiados por

la Comunidad a trav&eacute;s de una contribuci&oacute;n m&aacute;xima

de 350.000 Ecus. Tambi&eacute;n por la concesi&oacute;n de becas

de estancias en laboratorios cient&iacute;ficos de Estados miembros

comunitarios, con una duraci&oacute;n m&aacute;xima de 24 meses,

asignadas a investigadores doctorados empleados en una instituci&oacute;n

cient&iacute;fica de su pa&iacute;s, cuyo proyecto haya sido aprobado

por la Comunidad. Finalmente, el programa patrocina otra serie

de actividades de contenido investigador, tales como work shops,

congresos y conferencias. </P>

<P>

Como el programa anterior, &eacute;ste est&aacute; restringido

a las investigaciones de car&aacute;cter indirecto o pre-competitivo,

relacionadas con la formaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica y profesional

y la informaci&oacute;n en los pa&iacute;ses referidos. </P>

<P>

<B>IV Programa Marco de I+D de la CE </P></B>

<P>

La Comunidad utiliza como instrumento base de su pol&iacute;tica

en materia de investigaci&oacute;n y desarrollo cient&iacute;fico

y tecnol&oacute;gico, programas globales llamados Programas Marco

de Investigaci&oacute;n y Desarrollo Tecnol&oacute;gico. Estos

Programas Marco fijan los objetivos cient&iacute;ficos y tecnol&oacute;gicos

a ser alcanzados por la Comunidad mediante acciones concretas,

cuya finalidad ser&iacute;a la de promover el fortalecimiento

de las bases cient&iacute;ficas y tecnol&oacute;gicas de la industria

europea, y favorecer al desarrollo de su competitividad internacional.

</P>

<P>

Los Programas Marco poseen una duraci&oacute;n de cuatro a&ntilde;os.

El primero de ellos naci&oacute; en septiembre de 1984 y comprendi&oacute;

el per&iacute;odo de 1984 a 1987, el segundo de 1987 a 1991 y,

en abril de 1990, el Consejo de Ministros adopta el III Programa

Marco Comunitario de I+D Tecnol&oacute;gico <a href="#32">(32)</a>. </P>

<P>

En la actualidad, la Comunidad est&aacute; en la tarea de formalizar

el IV Programa Marco de Investigaci&oacute;n, Desarrollo Tecnol&oacute;gico

y Demostraci&oacute;n, que comprende el per&iacute;odo de 1994

a 1998 <a href="#33">(33)</a>. </P>

<P>

El Tercer Programa Marco (1990-1994) posee tres &aacute;reas de

dominio prioritario: la tecnolog&iacute;a de la informaci&oacute;n

y de las comunicaciones, la gesti&oacute;n de los recursos naturales

y el aprovechamiento de los recursos intelectuales <a href="#34">(34)</a>, que est&aacute;n

subdivididos en seis l&iacute;neas de acci&oacute;n (capital humano,

energ&iacute;a, ciencias de los seres vivos, medio ambiente, tecnolog&iacute;as

materiales e industriales y tecnolog&iacute;a de la informaci&oacute;n

y comunicaci&oacute;n) y en 15 programas espec&iacute;ficos <a href="#35">(35)</a>,

entre los cuales se encuentra el STD (Ciencia y Tecnolog&iacute;a

al Servicio del Desarrollo) relativo a la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica

internacional con los PVD. </P>

<P>

El Tercer Programa Marco represent&oacute;, en comparaci&oacute;n

al programa anterior, un cierto cambio cualitativo en relaci&oacute;n

a las prioridades en materia de investigaci&oacute;n comunitaria,

donde el medio ambiente, la biotecnolog&iacute;a y la movilidad

y formaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica ganan un papel m&aacute;s

pronunciado. </P>

<P>

El Cuarto Programa sigue las l&iacute;neas del anterior, con algunas

novedades en cuanto a objetivos y estructura. Este nuevo instrumento

tiene tres ejes fundamentales: el apoyo a la competitividad de

la industria europea mediante el fortalecimiento de las bases

cient&iacute;ficas y tecnol&oacute;gicas comunitarias, la contribuci&oacute;n

de la ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a a las necesidades sociales,

y el apoyo a las diferentes pol&iacute;ticas comunes en materia

de I+D <a href="#36">(36)</a>. Su estructura se compone de cuatro acciones. La primera,

respecto a los campos de investigaci&oacute;n prioritarios, se

resume en siete &aacute;reas de investigaci&oacute;n: tecnolog&iacute;a

de la informaci&oacute;n y de las comunicaciones, tecnolog&iacute;as

industriales, medio ambiente, ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a de la

vida, energ&iacute;a, investigaci&oacute;n para una pol&iacute;tica

europea de transporte e investigaci&oacute;n socioecon&oacute;mica

con fines propios. En principio, estas &aacute;reas de investigaci&oacute;n

ser&iacute;an exclusivas de la investigaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica

de los Estados miembros, realizadas entre s&iacute; o en conjunto

con terceros pa&iacute;ses industrializados, prioritariamente

con los pa&iacute;ses industrializados del resto del continente

Europeo y las dos grandes potencias mundiales: Jap&oacute;n y

Estados Unidos, importantes competidores de la industria Europea.

</P>

<P>

La segunda acci&oacute;n versa sobre la cooperaci&oacute;n internacional

de la Comunidad, donde se establece que los PVD con suficiente

potencial cient&iacute;fico podr&iacute;an participar en determinados

programas establecidos en la primera acci&oacute;n <a href="#37">(37)</a>. De esta

manera se provee la posibilidad a determinados pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos

de participar en programas espec&iacute;ficos de I+D propios de

la Comunidad, de contenido elevado. En esta acci&oacute;n se intenta,

desde el prisma comunitario, integrar distintas iniciativas de

investigaci&oacute;n a partir de un enfoque global y coordinado,

en sinergia con la actuaci&oacute;n en la ayuda al desarrollo.

Los temas prioritarios versan preferentemente, sobre recursos

naturales renovables y su empleo para la mejora sostenible de

la producci&oacute;n agraria, sobre la protecci&oacute;n del medio

ambiente y sobre la investigaci&oacute;n sanitaria para el desarrollo.

Finalmente, la tercera acci&oacute;n trata sobre la difusi&oacute;n

y explotaci&oacute;n de los resultados obtenidos por las actividades

de investigaci&oacute;n, motivando sobre todo la mejora en la

competitividad de las industrias comunitarias y en las dem&aacute;s

orientaciones establecidas por el Tratado de Uni&oacute;n Europea,

principalmente en sus art&iacute;culos 130F a 130P sobre investigaci&oacute;n

y desarrollo tecnol&oacute;gico. </P>

<P>

<B>Proyecto COLUMBUS</B> </P>

<P>

En el &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n europea en materia

de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a, se desarrolla en 1987 el proyecto

COLUMBUS <a href="#38">(38)</a> de movilidad universitaria entre Europa y Am&eacute;rica

Latina. Sus principales objetivos son favorecer el desarrollo

de universidades latinoamericanas, adapt&aacute;ndolas al cambio

de las circunstancias internacionales, aprovechando experiencias

de universidades europeas e incrementando el intercambio entre

ambas regiones <a href="#39">(39)</a>. </P>

<P>

Este proyecto nace en Buenos Aires, patrocinado por la Conferencia

de Rectores Europeos (CRE). Se estructura en dos etapas; la primera

de 1987 a 1992 y la segunda, de marzo de 1993 hasta 1997, con

tres l&iacute;neas b&aacute;sicas de actuaci&oacute;n: el desarrollo

de un foro de intercambio entre las pol&iacute;ticas y experiencias

de las universidades latinoamericanas y europeas, con la identificaci&oacute;n

de problemas comunes institucionales, el estudio conjunto de sus

soluciones y la cooperaci&oacute;n en la gesti&oacute;n universitaria

y la promoci&oacute;n de la autoevaluaci&oacute;n del papel de

las universidades <a href="#40">(40)</a> frente a los nuevos retos existentes, principalmente

en el campo de las relaciones entre universidad-sector productivo.

</P>

<P>

Este proyecto no significa &uacute;nicamente la cooperaci&oacute;n

entendida por movilidad y formaci&oacute;n universitaria; busca

ser el catalizador del cambio universitario, ultrapasa la cl&aacute;sica

asistencia t&eacute;cnica de los PI a los PVD. Es un instrumento

de transferencia de t&eacute;cnicas y conocimientos y promueve

el desarrollo estrat&eacute;gico a largo plazo. Para tales fines

establece: foros permanentes entre universidades latinoamericanas

y europeas; la promoci&oacute;n de medios de intercambio de experiencias,

para el establecimiento y desarrollo de incubadoras y centros

de innovaciones entre universidades, empresas, agencias y otros

grupos locales, a fin de promover el desarrollo equilibrado de

la transferencia tecnol&oacute;gica y su mejor gesti&oacute;n;

enlaces entre estudiantes posgraduados, para investigaci&oacute;n

y entrenamiento en las a&eacute;reas relacionadas, con el desarrollo

sostenible y el desarrollo de la evaluaci&oacute;n e investigaci&oacute;n

realizadas mediante la consolidaci&oacute;n del cambio, a trav&eacute;s

de nuevas regulaciones y posturas universitarias <a href="#41">(41)</a>. </P>

<P>

El coste estimado para la ejecuci&oacute;n de este programa, en

el per&iacute;odo de 1987-1993, es de 2,4 millones de d&oacute;lares,

siendo el 50% cubierto por la Comisi&oacute;n de las Comunidades

Europeas. Las contribuciones <a href="#42">(42)</a> de las organizaciones gubernamentales

locales y de otros participantes representaron el 40% del coste

del proyecto. </P>

<P>

<B>Mecanismos de Cooperaci&oacute;n Cient&iacute;fica y T&eacute;cnica

de Am&eacute;rica Latina</B> </P>

<P>

Am&eacute;rica Latina, tras una d&eacute;cada de frustraciones,

comienza los noventa con nuevos desaf&iacute;os a los que debe

enfrentarse. Las tendencias hacia un nuevo orden econ&oacute;mico

globalizado, multipolar, tecnificado, ya son evidencias. Para

acompa&ntilde;ar las nuevas inclinaciones internacionales y romper

el cerco de su propio subdesarrollo adopta distintas posturas,

dejando de lado criterios tradicionales de protecci&oacute;n y

de reserva de mercado, a trav&eacute;s de pol&iacute;ticas din&aacute;micas

de apertura econ&oacute;mica dependientes de la competitividad

internacional <a href="#43">(43)</a>. </P>

<P>

La transformaci&oacute;n que sufre esta regi&oacute;n para su

inserci&oacute;n en este mundo menos protegido y m&aacute;s competitivo,

pasa necesariamente por la modernizaci&oacute;n de sus estructuras

sociales y econ&oacute;micas. </P>

<P>

Entre las diversas experiencias de la modificaci&oacute;n experimentada,

puede ser que la m&aacute;s importante consista en el aprendizaje

de que, en el futuro, el crecimiento se basar&aacute; cada vez

m&aacute;s en la incorporaci&oacute;n de conocimientos e innovaciones

t&eacute;cnicas a las funciones productivas <a href="#44">(44)</a>. Es en base a

estas directrices y a la certeza de que su modernizaci&oacute;n

y su consiguiente crecimiento econ&oacute;mico dependen de su

grado de vinculaci&oacute;n exterior y del grado de integraci&oacute;n

regional en enfrentar los formidables rectos del desarrollo, que

Am&eacute;rica Latina lanza dos programas relativos a la colaboraci&oacute;n

regional e internacional en materia de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a,

el Programa Bol&iacute;var, y el Mercado Com&uacute;n del Conocimiento,

los cuales ser&aacute;n analizados a continuaci&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

<B>Programa Bol&iacute;var</B> </P>

<P>

Una de las respuestas al desarrollo de los cambios estructurales

emprendidos por Am&eacute;rica Latina consiste en la sinergia

entre la Industria, la Investigaci&oacute;n, la Innovaci&oacute;n

y la Integraci&oacute;n. Con la finalidad de hacer efectiva tal

relaci&oacute;n nace el Programa Bol&iacute;var, de Integraci&oacute;n

Tecnol&oacute;gica Regional, Innovaci&oacute;n y Competitividad

Industrial, fruto de una alianza realizada por el programa regional

de vinculaci&oacute;n entre los sectores productivos y de investigaci&oacute;n

cient&iacute;fica, denominado Entidades Latinoamericanas Cient&iacute;ficas

y Empresariales (ENLACE), creado a partir de las actividades del

Grupo de Reflexi&oacute;n, instituido por el Banco Interamericano

de Desarrollo (BID) en cooperaci&oacute;n con la UNESCO (Naciones

Unidas para la Educaci&oacute;n, la Ciencia y la Cultura <a href="#45">(45)</a>).

Y de la iniciativa Bol&iacute;var (de Integraci&oacute;n Tecnol&oacute;gica

Regional, la Innovaci&oacute;n y la Competitividad Industrial)

el Gobierno de Venezuela, con las mismas caracter&iacute;sticas

del anterior <a href="#46">(46)</a>. </P>

<P>

El Programa Bol&iacute;var es un organismo no gubernamental, con

personalidad jur&iacute;dica de derecho privado, constituido en

Caracas el 31 de marzo de 1992, tras la creaci&oacute;n en noviembre

de 1990 de su Comit&eacute; Enlace. Tiene algunas caracter&iacute;sticas

propias como: su car&aacute;cter regional, el cual intenta fomentar

la integraci&oacute;n de los sectores tecnol&oacute;gicos, de

producci&oacute;n, financiero, comercial y la innovaci&oacute;n

industrial, facilitando la asociaci&oacute;n de empresas y/o centros

de investigaci&oacute;n de dos o m&aacute;s pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica

Latina; en otras palabras, vincula parcelas acad&eacute;micas

a sectores industriales latinoamericanos <a href="#47">(47)</a>. Es de gesti&oacute;n

mixta: iniciativa privada y sector p&uacute;blico, con geometr&iacute;a

variable, sus procedimientos respetan las caracter&iacute;sticas

de cada pa&iacute;s y subregi&oacute;n, y con gran flexibilidad,

toda iniciativa parte de intereses concretos de sus participantes.

</P>

<P>

Este programa se desarrolla simult&aacute;neamente en tres niveles.

El primero mediante las Comisiones Nacionales, que agregan a una

representaci&oacute;n plural los factores de decisi&oacute;n de

cada pa&iacute;s miembro. Est&aacute;n constituidas, generalmente,

por personalidades vinculadas a empresas, universidades, organismos

estatales, centros de investigaci&oacute;n, etc, cuya finalidad

es la de constituir lobbies para crear localmente un clima favorable

para las actividades del programa y para los conceptos que se

le asocian (integraci&oacute;n regional, investigaci&oacute;n

aplicada, la innovaci&oacute;n, la inserci&oacute;n internacional,

etc...). Hasta la mitad de 1993, eran dieciocho los Estados latinoamericanos

con representaci&oacute;n en las Comisiones Nacionales. </P>

<P>

En un segundo nivel est&aacute;n las ONE (Oficinas Nacionales

de Enlaces), que representan la c&eacute;lula fundamental del

mecanismo operativo del programa, pues, es en ella que se desarrolla

toda la fase t&eacute;cnica de recepci&oacute;n, evaluaci&oacute;n

y promoci&oacute;n de los proyectos hasta la etapa del financiamiento

o hasta el tercer nivel, que se constituye en una red de instituciones

nacionales, regionales e internacionales financieras, llamadas

Men&uacute; Financiero, las cuales facilitan el acceso al financiamiento

de los proyectos objeto del programa. </P>

<P>

Los objetivos fundamentales de este instrumento de cooperaci&oacute;n

son la mejora de la calidad de los productos, procesos y servicios

latinoamericanos a fin de alcanzar normas de calidad internacional

homog&eacute;neas, adem&aacute;s de posibilitar la creaci&oacute;n

de nuevos productos, procesos y servicios, potenciando la capacidad

productiva existente en cada pa&iacute;s mediante el fomento a

la creaci&oacute;n de empresas conjuntas o joint ventures entre

empresas y/o instituciones de dos o m&aacute;s pa&iacute;ses de

la regi&oacute;n o de otras regiones; y tambi&eacute;n posibilitar

la circulaci&oacute;n y democratizaci&oacute;n del conocimiento

a trav&eacute;s de dise&ntilde;os de redes de cooperaci&oacute;n

entre investigadores y acad&eacute;micos de diversos pa&iacute;ses.

</P>

<P>

En el &aacute;mbito de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a, este mecanismo

intenta, adem&aacute;s, conectar los sectores de la innovaci&oacute;n,

de la ciencia y de la tecnolog&iacute;a con el sector productivo.

En este caso, la investigaci&oacute;n es aplicada y est&aacute;

direccionada al desarrollo cient&iacute;fico y tecnol&oacute;gico

de la regi&oacute;n latinoamericana. El impacto de este programa

en los sistemas cient&iacute;ficos y tecnol&oacute;gicos de la

regi&oacute;n, puede medirse por su capacidad en identificar y

poner en contacto socios potenciales, facilitar el financiamiento

de proyectos conjuntos de desarrollo tecnol&oacute;gico entre

pa&iacute;ses de la regi&oacute;n o de otras regiones. </P>

<P>

La Comunidad ha reconocido como ejemplo de cooperaci&oacute;n

internacional el Programa Bol&iacute;var a trav&eacute;s de la

comunicaci&oacute;n oficial de la Comisi&oacute;n al Consejo y

al Parlamento Europeo, sobre La pol&iacute;tica de cooperaci&oacute;n

al desarrollo en el horizonte del 2000. Aplicaci&oacute;n del

Tratado de Maastricht (Bruselas, 15.05.92). En la segunda reuni&oacute;n

institucional entre el Grupo de R&iacute;o y la Comunidad se tom&oacute;

nota de la cooperaci&oacute;n mutua del Programa Bol&iacute;var

y posteriormente se realiz&oacute; el primer convenio entre este

instrumento y el Programa Comunitario de Ciencia y Tecnolog&iacute;a

(Eureka), mediante la intervenci&oacute;n de la comisi&oacute;n

portuguesa del programa Eureka, formalizando los esfuerzos en

garantizar la realizaci&oacute;n de negocios y proyectos que involucren

empresas y centros investigadores latinoamericanos y portugueses.

Se refleja, adem&aacute;s, la voluntad y posibilidad de profundizar

las relaciones del programa Bol&iacute;var con la Comunidad <a href="#48">(48)</a>.

</P>

<P>

En la actualidad este programa ha recibido 110 proyectos, se han

identificados socios potenciales para 33 de &eacute;stos y 17

han respondido afirmativamente a la posibilidad de asociarse.

Las &aacute;reas involucradas abarcaban aspectos tales como: agroalimentos,

autopartes, biotecnolog&iacute;a, catalizadores, dise&ntilde;o,

electr&oacute;nica, materiales, metalmec&aacute;nica y telecomunicaciones.

</P>

<P>

Este mecanismo cuenta con los aportes no reembolsables provenientes

del Banco Interamericano de Desarrollo (BID) de 4,2 millones de

d&oacute;lares, del Gobierno venezolano de 1,1 millones de d&oacute;lares,

de sectores privados de tres millones de d&oacute;lares y contribuciones

de organismos internacionales como la SELA y la UNESCO <a href="#49">(49)</a>. </P>

<P>

<B>Mercado Com&uacute;n del Conocimiento</B> </P>

<P>

A propuesta del presidente de Uruguay, Dr. Luis Alberto Lacalle,

en la Asamblea General de la Organizaci&oacute;n de Estados Americanos

(OEA) de junio de 1990 <a href="#50">(50)</a>, se desarrolla la idea de la realizaci&oacute;n

de un mercado com&uacute;n del conocimiento para fomentar el intercambio

de conocimientos pre-competitivos, la integraci&oacute;n de las

capacidades t&eacute;cnicas del hemisferio, la mejor participaci&oacute;n

de los pa&iacute;ses de Am&eacute;rica Latina y del Caribe en

el progreso t&eacute;cnico mundial, contribuyendo a la competitividad

productiva y bienestar social de la regi&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

Para el efectivo desarrollo de este mercado, los Estados miembros

establecen un programa marco de cooperaci&oacute;n, en el cual

se integran mecanismos de cooperaci&oacute;n y programas de actividades

multilaterales, seleccionadas con criterio de excelencia y relevancia,

con base en evaluaciones independientes, para ser utilizados por

investigadores del hemisferio trabajando en colaboraci&oacute;n

entre s&iacute;, o con investigadores de otros pa&iacute;ses participantes

de Europa y Asia <a href="#51">(51)</a>. </P>

<P>

En el programa marco se estipulan las &aacute;reas de acci&oacute;n

prioritarias, a las que en un primer per&iacute;odo corresponder&iacute;a

la investigaci&oacute;n y formaci&oacute;n de pos grado y centros

regionales de excelencia, intercambio y revinculaci&oacute;n de

recursos humanos altamente cualificados, vinculaci&oacute;n de

las universidades y centros de investigaci&oacute;n y la formaci&oacute;n,

intercomunicaci&oacute;n y difusi&oacute;n de los conocimientos

t&eacute;cnicos y cient&iacute;ficos. </P>

<P>

En materia de investigaci&oacute;n, formaci&oacute;n y redes,

este programa tiene tres componentes principales: la creaci&oacute;n

de una red de asociaciones entre universidades y empresas para

la formaci&oacute;n t&eacute;cnica avanzada, los intercambios

transnacionales y los proyectos conjuntos de entrenamiento en

alta tecnolog&iacute;a. Entre las l&iacute;neas de trabajo con

posibilidad de acci&oacute;n conjunta con empresas figuran las

siguientes materias: medio ambiente, alimentaci&oacute;n, comunicaciones,

capacitaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos, gesti&oacute;n de pol&iacute;ticas,

programas y proyectos de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a, conocimientos

de la oferta y la demanda de las capacidades de investigaci&oacute;n

y apoyo a la innovaci&oacute;n, metodolog&iacute;a y normalizaci&oacute;n,

complementaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos, qu&iacute;mica, bioqu&iacute;mica

y petroqu&iacute;mica, metalurgia y mineralog&iacute;a <a href="#52">(52)</a>. </P>

<P>

El mercado com&uacute;n de conocimientos supervisa sobre todo

la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y tecnol&oacute;gica para

el desarrollo de Am&eacute;rica Latina y el Caribe, en este sentido

fomenta: la capacitaci&oacute;n de recursos humanos de las regiones

citadas; la cooperaci&oacute;n de pa&iacute;ses del hemisferio,

o externos a &eacute;ste, en materia de investigaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica

y tecnol&oacute;gica; y los servicios de ciencia y tecnolog&iacute;a

y la informaci&oacute;n sobre tales materias. Y est&aacute; dirigido

esencialmente a universidades de la regi&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

<a name=con></a><h3>Consideraciones finales: la perspectiva de la cooperaci&#243;n cient&#237;fica y t&#233;cnica de la Comunidad y Latinoam&#233;rica</h3>

</P>

<P>

La cooperaci&oacute;n y desarrollo de la CE se concentraba originariamente,

como se ha mencionado, en los pa&iacute;ses asociados del ACP

y los pa&iacute;ses del mediterr&aacute;neo. A partir de 1976,

esta pol&iacute;tica conoce un nuevo desarrollo, en direcci&oacute;n

hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina y Asia, donde adem&aacute;s de acuerdos

comerciales, se inicia una pol&iacute;tica de inversiones financiada

por el presupuesto comunitario <a href="#53">(53)</a>. </P>

<P>

De la cooperaci&oacute;n total de la CE con los pa&iacute;ses

no asociados, Am&eacute;rica Latina recibi&oacute;, entre 1976

a 1986 <a href="#54">(54)</a>, poco m&aacute;s del 25% de la cooperaci&oacute;n

total, mientras que a Asia se destin&oacute; el 75% del total.

Este cuadro empieza a cambiar a finales de la d&eacute;cada de

los ochenta, fij&aacute;ndose una participaci&oacute;n latinoamericana

m&aacute;s equilibrada. Concretamente, en 1988 el 33% del total

de la cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo de la Comunidad fue direccionado

hacia esta regi&oacute;n, en 1990 &eacute;ste sube al 39% y, finalmente,

en 1994 llega al 44%. </P>

<P>

Esta modificaci&oacute;n de postura se debe a varios factores

significativos, tales como la institucionalizaci&oacute;n del

di&aacute;logo CE y el Grupo de R&iacute;o y, sin duda, la visi&oacute;n

actual en Latinoam&eacute;rica de la nueva situaci&oacute;n del

desarrollo, dependiente de los condicionamentos externos. Ambos

factores analizados aqu&iacute; con anterioridad. </P>

<P>

Desde otro &aacute;ngulo, adem&aacute;s de la evoluci&oacute;n

cuantitativa de la cooperaci&oacute;n hacia Latinoam&eacute;rica,

cabr&iacute;a destacar la evoluci&oacute;n cualitativa de estas

operaciones. Desde la citada Orientaciones para el fortalecimiento

de las relaciones de la Comunidad y Am&eacute;rica Latina de 1984,

se propon&iacute;a un mayor &eacute;nfasis en otras formas de

cooperaci&oacute;n, frente a la cooperaci&oacute;n tradicional

de ayuda al desarrollo; que promoviera el beneficio mutuo entre

las partes y una pol&iacute;tica m&aacute;s espec&iacute;fica

para esta regi&oacute;n. </P>

<P>

Confirmando este precepto Orientaciones de la CE para la Cooperaci&oacute;n

con los Pa&iacute;ses en Desarrollo de Am&eacute;rica Latina y

Asia, del 11 de junio de 1990, impulsan el desarrollo de la cooperaci&oacute;n

econ&oacute;mica, cuando la definen como uno de los ejes principales

de la cooperaci&oacute;n de la CE. En este sentido cabr&iacute;a

destacar el aumento significativo del porcentaje de la cooperaci&oacute;n

avanzada, en el &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n al desarrollo

en general de la Comunidad hacia Am&eacute;rica Latina, &eacute;sta

pasa en 1986 del 5% de la cooperaci&oacute;n total, al 21% en

1991 y al 16% en 1992 <a href="#55">(55)</a>. </P>

<P>

La cooperaci&oacute;n econ&oacute;mica se caracteriza por tres

grandes &aacute;mbitos de intervenci&oacute;n; entre ellos destaca

la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica y t&eacute;cnica. La evoluci&oacute;n

de esta clase de colaboraci&oacute;n se remonta a las Orientaciones

de 1984, cuando la mencionaba como elemento principal de la cooperaci&oacute;n

industrial. Del mismo modo, en el &aacute;mbito de la cooperaci&oacute;n

bilateral, o bilateral colectiva, los acuerdos de cooperaci&oacute;n

firmados entre la CE y algunos pa&iacute;ses latinoamericanos

<a href="#56">(56)</a> a partir de la d&eacute;cada de los noventa, todos contienen

apartados espec&iacute;ficos sobre la cooperaci&oacute;n cient&iacute;fica

y tecnol&oacute;gica. </P>

<P>

Finalmente, dentro del di&aacute;logo pol&iacute;tico CE-Grupo

de R&iacute;o, desde la Conferencia de Roma de 1990, se define

en la ciencia y la tecnolog&iacute;a como &aacute;reas fundamentales

de cooperaci&oacute;n. En la Conferencia de Luxemburgo los pa&iacute;ses

latinoamericanos manifiestan su deseo de participaci&oacute;n

en programas de investigaci&oacute;n comunitarios en ciencia y

tecnolog&iacute;a y, finalmente, en la segunda reuni&oacute;n

Ministerial entre la CE y el Grupo de R&iacute;o <a href="#57">(57)</a> los ministros

de la CE se&ntilde;alaron la apertura al Programa Marco Comunitario

a investigadores de los pa&iacute;ses del grupo, en algunas &aacute;reas

espec&iacute;ficas <a href="#58">(58)</a>. Se esperaba una mayor participaci&oacute;n

latinoamericana en diferentes &aacute;reas de las investigaciones

comunitarias y en los resultados de &eacute;sta, con el acuerdo

del IV Programa marco de Investigaci&oacute;n de la Comunidad,

instrumento que posiblemente colaborar&aacute; para la transferencia

y el acceso de conocimientos y t&eacute;cnicas, por parte de los

PVD-AL, elementos que deben ser, cada vez m&aacute;s, los ejes

que presidan las relaciones y la cooperaci&oacute;n entre los

pa&iacute;ses industrializados y los en desarrollo. </P>

<TITLE>The Week in Europe</TITLE>

The Week in Europe, 21 November 1996</h2>

<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>

<p>

Executive Director of the <A HREF="cce.htm">Caribbean Council for Europe</A></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

Back in the late 1960s when I was at University the military, western

governments and the private sector were dirty words. Undergraduates sought

to emulate Ch&#233; Guevera and it was the thoughts of Marcuse, Chairman Mao and

Marx that were earnestly debated.

<P>

Today all of this has changed. Conservative parties are flourishing, the

private sector has become the motor of development and graduates are

burning the midnight oil to understand marketing, advanced economics and

all else that is necessary to achieve an MBA.

<P>

Many argue that this is all cyclical and sometime early in the next

millennium social values and capital will achieve a new balance. Perhaps,

some in the Caribbean suggest, this may emerge in a post-Castro Cuba if it

can construct a socialist market economy within an open civil society.

<P>

But today, the tensions still continue to grow between those who believe

that the state should retain a controlling role and those who believe that

the market will determine roles in a world in which thinking about borders

and sovereignty are being revolutionised by information technology and

globalisation.

<P>

This will in all probability be the background theme in the debate that is

just beginning on the EC Development Commissioner's green paper on

post-Lom&#233; relations, which was finally agreed by the EC College of

Commissioners on November 21 as this column was being written. The

document, which I intend to write at length about next week, basically

emphasises: the need to consider differentiating European approaches by

region or sub-region of the ACP while leaving it up to the ACP to decide

whether they stay together as a group; a key role for the private sector;

and a visibly effective and efficient results-oriented aid programme.

<p>

Apart from the obvious questions this will raise about relations between

ACP States and how the region determines a negotiating strategy that is to

its benefit, much of the core debate is likely to centre on trade issues,

market access, preference, transitional mechanisms, competitiveness, open

markets and - above all - the ability of the private sector to deliver

timely and positive results. This debate will not be easy as it is in

effect about ceding power and responsibility.

<P>

It is frequently alleged by some in government in the Caribbean who

maintain the need for a centrist, statist approach that it is not viable

working with the Caribbean private sector. They assert: private sector

associations are dominated by a few large companies; the Caribbean private

sector as a whole has no coherent view; most in the private sector are

commission agents; and in some nations expatriate interests still

predominate. These prejudices are often conveyed to those in Brussels or to

governments elsewhere in order to continue to bolster the argument for

maintaining government-to-government exclusivity in treaties such as the

Lom&#233; Convention.

<P>

Last week an <A HREF="ccelowe.htm">independent report</A> written by a Caribbean researcher, Michelle

Lowe, was published on behalf of the Caribbean Association of Industry and

Commerce (CAIC). This study, which was funded by European and Caribbean

members of the Caribbean Council for Europe, looks at the requirements of

the Caribbean private sector of the EU in the period up to 2000 and after

the Lom&#233; Convention expires. Unlike any previous document it brings

together the views of the largest and smallest private sector associations

and their members; it incorporates the opinions of powerful sectoral

associations such as those for tourism, rice and rum; and it embraces the

views of chambers and others in the French Departments, the Dominican

Republic and even Cuba.

<p>

The two-part report contains some important recommendations. These include:

<UL>

<LI>identifying new mechanisms to facilitate a dialogue between the EU, regional governments and those in the business sector and civil society;

<p> 

<LI>the creation of new intermediaries in the private sector to deliver programmes through the private sector in a timely manner;

<p> 

<LI>the creation of new financial instruments through which the EU can give direct support to the private sector;

<p> 

<LI>the identification of new mechanisms that enhance backward and forward linkages between tourism and Caribbean economies through private sector mechanisms;

<p> 

<LI>the creation of a special relationship between the French DOM, as Europe in the Caribbean, and the Caribbean ACP States; and 

<p> 

<LI>the creation of stable mechanisms that ensure a successful transition out of preference.

</UL>

<p>

These and many other issues are dealt with at length in the report which

makes clear that the need is for governments, whether they be in the region

or in Europe, to demonstrate a full commitment to the concept of

decentralised co-operation if Caribbean economies are to achieve

competitiveness in the next millennium. CAIC is in the process of

circulating the document to Caribbean governments and regional

institutions. It is to be hoped that its conclusions are incorporated into

the region's post-Lom&#233; IV negotiating position.

<h2>A Message from Carol Bellamy, <br>UNICEF Executive Director</h2>
</center><p>
<b>
As the new Executive Director of UNICEF, I want to express my support for the International Children's Day of Broadcasting and to urge all of you to be a part of it.  The Day has truly created an 'electronic ring around the world.'<p></b>

During my days at the Peace Corps in Latin America, I saw - and used - the power of radio to communicate vital information.  Television enhances that power.  In just three short years, this Day has shown conclusively that when this power is used for children, their lives change for the better.<p>

For us at UNICEF, this year's International Children's Day of Broadcasting is a very special one, as it kicks off a year of celebrations for the organisation's 50th Anniversary.  We're asking you not only to look back with us, but to look forward at what tomorrow has in store for children.<p>

I believe the Convention on the Rights of the Child holds great hope for the future of our children.  It has been ratified by almost every country in the world.  But without broadcasters to spread the word about its provisions, monitor its implementation and, above all, to give children a voice, the Convention cannot become a living document.  On this year's Day, we're asking you to focus on the Convention and so make children's rights a reality.<p>

Through the International Children's Day of Broadcasting, we hope you will join us on that journey towards tomorrow, to a world where all children can have the chance to grow, develop and make their dreams come true.<p>

<i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="index.html"> Index on Censorship  </i></a><hr><p>

<h2>Nigeria: Ordeal by Innocence</h2>

<b>It is with profound regret that Index has learned that Ken Saro-Wiwa was
executed in Port Harcourt prison on 10 November.<p>


The material  below is excerpted from a statement that Saro-Wiwa was
prevented from reading out in court towards the end of his trial.

</b><p>

"My lord, we all stand before history.  I am a man of peace, of ideas.  <p>

Appalled by the denigrating poverty of my people who live on a richly-endowed land, distressed by their political marginalisation and economic strangulation, angered by the devastation of their land, anxious to preserve their right to life and to a decent living, and determined to usher to this country as a whole a fair and just democratic system, I have devoted all my intellectual and material resources - my very life - to a cause in which I have total belief and from which I cannot be blackmailed or intimidated.  <p>

I have no doubt at all about the ultimate success of my cause, no matter the trials and tribulations which I and those who believe with me may encounter on our journey.  Nor imprisonment nor death can stop our ultimate victory.<p>

I repeat that we all stand before history.  I and my colleagues are not the only ones on trial.  Shell is on trial here, and it is as well that it is represented by counsel said to be holding a watching brief.  The company has, indeed, ducked this particlular trial, but its day will surely come and the lessons learned here may prove useful to it, for there is no doubt in my mind that the ecological war the company has waged in the delta will be called to question sooner than later and the crimes of that war be duly punished.  The crime of the company's dirty wars against the Ogoni people will also be punished.<p>

On trial also is the Nigerian nation, its present rulers and all those who assist them.  I am not one of those who shy away from protesting injustice and oppression, arguing that they are expected of a military regime.  The military do not act alone.  They are supported by a gaggle of politicians, lawyers, judges, academics and businessmen, all of them hiding under the claim that they are only doing their duty, men and women too afraid to wash their pants of their urine.  <p>

We all stand on trial, my lord, for by our actions we have denigrated our country and jeopardised the future of our children.  As we subscribe to the subnormal and accept double standards, as we lie and cheat openly, as we protect injustice and oppression, we empty our classrooms, degrade our hospitals, and make ourselves the slaves of those who subscribe to higher standards, who pursue the truth, and honour justice, freedom and hard work... <p>

I predict that a denoument of the riddle of the Niger delta will soon come.  The agenda is being set at this trial.  Whether the peaceful ways I have favoured will prevail depends on what the oppressor decides, what signals it sends out to the waiting public.<p>

In my innocence of the false charges I face here, in my utter conviction, I call upon the Ogoni people, the peoples of the Niger delta, and the oppressed ethnic minorities of Nigeria to stand up now and fight fearlessly and peacefully for their rights.  History is on their side, God is on their side.  <p>

For the Holy Quran says in Sura 42, verse 41: 'All those who fight when oppressed incur no guilt, but Allah shall punish the oppressor.'<p>

Come the day."<p>

<b>Ken Saro-Wiwa<br>
Port Harcourt, 1 September 1995</b><p>
<hr width=71%><p>

<i>The following is a poem by Ken Saro-Wiwa, written after his arrest</i><p>

<ul><b>Ogoni! Ogoni!<p>

Ogoni is the land<br>
The people, Ogoni<br>
The agony of trees dying <br>
In ancestral farmlands<br>
Streams polluted weeping<br>
Filth into murky rivers<br>
It is the poisoned air<br>
Coursing the luckless lungs<br>
Of dying children<br>
Ogoni is the dream<br>
Breaking the looping chain<br>
Around the drooping neck of a shell-shocked land.<p></b>

</ul>Ken Saro-Wiwa<br>
Written in prison<p>

<h3>MYANMAR: 1996 WORST YEAR FOR HUMAN RIGHTS THIS DECADE</h3>

<p>

<h4>12 FEBRUARY 1997</h4>

<p>

The past year has seen an escalation in political repression in Myanmar 
unequalled since the

violent

suppression by the army of the 1988-90 popular uprising, Amnesty 
International said today, as

it called

for the international community to redouble pressure on the Burmese 
authorities in 1997.

<p>

     During 1996 more than 2,000 people were arrested for calling for 
human rights reforms,

severe

restrictions were placed on Daw Aung San Suu Kyi's freedom of movement 
and speech, and

members of

the National League for Democracy (NLD) were attacked by organised mobs, 
with the apparent

encouragement of the government.

<p>

     &quot;Last year was the worst for human rights in Myanmar since 
1990&quot; Amnesty

International said.  &quot;Already 1997 has been marked by the long jail 
sentences handed down

to at

least 34 people detained after last year's pro-democracy 
demonstrations.&quot;

<p>

     &quot;While the world talks about constructive engagement, things 
are going backwards in

Myanmar.  Those governments with influence, particularly the Association 
of South-East Asian

Nations

(ASEAN) gathering in Singapore this week, need to think again about how 
to pressure the

Burmese

authorities to improve their human rights record.&quot;

<p>

     The State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) throughout 1996 
suppressed peaceful

political meetings, gatherings and demonstrations, sometimes violently.  
SLORC has shown an

almost

complete intolerance of any peaceful political activity whatsoever.  At 
the beginning of the year,

Burmese

people could gather peacefully every weekend to listen to speeches by NLD 
leaders.  By the end

of the

year even this was forbidden.

<p>

     In May and September, security forces arrested some 300 and 600 NLD 
members

respectively,

who were gathering for party congresses.  Some of those arrested remain 
in detention. 

Hundreds of

students and NLD members were arrested following the forceful breaking up 
of peaceful student

demonstrations in December.   Amnesty International is concerned that 
some 100 remain in

prison. 

During the year, Aung San Suu Kyi was repeatedly refused permission to 
leave her compound,

and was

effectively confined to her house for long periods. 

<p>

     Amnesty International is particularly concerned at a worrying new 
development which

emerged

during the year, with violent attacks against senior members of the NLD.  
On 9 November, a

group of

about 200 young men attacked Aung San Suu Kyi's motorcade with iron bars 
and sticks.  The

men were

thought to be members of the Union Solidarity Development Organisation 
(USDA), a SLORC

sponsored

group, and were allegedly paid 500 kyats each to participate in the 
attack which is believed to

have been

coordinated by the government.  Earlier this month, Aung San Suu Kyi 
alleged that shortly before

the

attack on her motorcade, a government minister had told a meeting of USDA 
members that she

should be

killed.

<p>

     At the same time, the state controlled media is making increasingly 
strident personal attacks

against Aung San Suu Kyi and the NLD.  Independent foreign reporters have 
been denied access

to

interview NLD members, and in one case, a journalist covering the 
demonstrations was severely

beaten

by the security forces.

<p>

     In April 1996, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights (CHR) 
extended the Special

Rapporteur on Myanmar's mandate for another year.   Amnesty International 
is calling for a

further

extension at this year's CHR, and for United Nations member states, in 
particular members of

ASEAN,

to pressure the Burmese authorities to stop denying access to the Special 
Rapporteur.

<title>Uncertainty Surrounds Future of the Lom&#233; Convention</title>

Uncertainty Surrounds Future of the Lom&#233; Convention</h2>

<p>

<h4>Full text of an article from the <i>ECDPM Programme Highlights 1996</i>: pages 4-5</h4>

</center>

<hr>

<p>

Slowly the machinery to evaluate the Lom&#233; Convention has begun to roll. The burning questions

are whether there is a future for the Convention, and what shape it will take.

<p>

The European Commission is working on a new policy paper and developing countries are worried.

Despite all the debate however, there is a suspicion that the post 1999 scenario may change very  little.

To some observers, re-designing European development cooperation may be far more difficult than leaving

it more or less as it is.

<p>

The Lom&#233; Convention - a partnership between 70 countries in Africa, the Caribbean

and the Pacific (ACP), and the European Union - encompasses trade and aid. Created in

1975, no-one is certain whether it will be around after its 25th birthday in the year 2000.

<p>

When ECDPM began calling on  ACP states to begin preparations for a follow-up to the

Lom&#233; Convention, the Centre received irritated and sometimes even angry reactions.

Officials were tired after the tough negotiations on the Lom&#233; IV mid-term review and

did not want to hear the bad news that their task was far from over. In recent months

however, the climate has changed.

<p>

During the past year, ECDPM has been raising awareness among ACP interest groups,

encouraging them to critically evaluate and discuss the future of the Lom&#233;

Convention. According to Louk de la Rive Box, ECDPM Director, the "main conclusion is

a paradox. ACP states worry about their relationship with Europe but there is a complete

ignorance about Lom&#233;."

<p>

<h3>A mystery for most people</h3>



This conclusion is  based on extensive consultations by ECDPM staff with people in all the

ACP regions. ECDPM's Geert Laporte feels that, apart from a tiny circle of government

officials, the Convention remains an "absolute mystery" in ACP countries.

<p>

This lack of awareness is partly due to the way in which Lom&#233; resources are managed

at the country level -- a national authorising officer in each ACP country, usually a senior

government official, oversees and manages Lom&#233; activities. It is also due to the view,

in Brussels and in ACP capitals, that Lom&#233; is a matter for governments.

<p>

In this regard, Box suggests that a "criticism of the Commission could be that it did not

engage other interest groups, like Chambers of Commerce, soon enough into the process."

He is also critical of ACP governments that have done little to create a supportive

constituency for Lom&#233; in their countries. With such a small group involved in the

Convention, it is hardly surprising that public awareness is so low.

<p>

Awareness of the Convention is one thing, its utilisation is another. The convention is very

complex and contains more than 369 articles and a series of protocols written in a very

officialese style. "It is already difficult for a bureaucrat, working with it daily, to understand

Lom&#233;. Let alone ACP officials who are underpaid and not motivated," explains

Laporte.

<p>

The Centre hopes to "feed the debate by providing information, so when in 1998 the

negotiations on the future of Lom&#233; start, the parties know what the difficulties are.

Our aim is to create a real debate about the future of Lom&#233;." says de la Rive Box. "It

is a unique convention and was very progressive when it was developed in the seventies. But

it is not used adequately."

<p>

<h3>An effective instrument?</h3>



Much of the debate in Europe is on the supposed ineffectiveness of EU development aid.

While complete evaluations have not yet taken place, studies show that EU aid performs no

worse than other donors, says Laporte. 

<p>

The Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs doesn't yet have a complete picture of the results from

Lom&#233;. Government official Ernst Noorman, working on EC affairs at the department

of international cooperation, points to a decision last year by European ministers of

development cooperation to evaluate EU aid programmes. "That's a big point. Though there

was a lot of resistance by the top of the Commission, which felt threatened", explains

Noorman. He expects the evaluation to be ready within two or three years. "So at the

moment we can't say whether European aid was effective or not." Nevertheless, experience

shows, according to Noorman, that the EU is strong on structural adjustment, regional

integration, and food security projects, but weaker on the environment.

<p>

Paul Hoebink, senior lecturer at the Third World Centre of the Catholic University of

Nijmegen notes that a positive element of Lom&#233; is the way in which fund distribution

is tied to clear criteria of poverty and needs. According to Hoebink, political and economic

interests are less dominant than in other forms of international cooperation.The other side

of the Lom&#233; "aid and trade" pillar has been the provision of preferential access for

ACP exports to European markets. Despite these preferences however, most ACP countries

have not been able to advance in economic terms. Their market share has actually declined

from 6.7% in 1976 to 3.4% in 1993. 

<p>

"You might say that without Lom&#233; these countries would have lost even more, but

that is not very satisfying," comments Hoebink.

<p>

The picture is not all bleak. A few countries have benefited from the arrangement. Barbados

and especially Mauritius are the Convention's show-pieces, but they however are the

exceptions.

<p>

Critics of the preferences point to the experiences of some non-ACP countries which, with

fewer trade preferences, have strengthened their position in the European market. 

<p>

"ACP countries have not used the trade possibilities partly because of the rather complex

procedures," acknowledges Noorman. "Moreover we pretend that the trade preferences are

very ample. But in fact they are very restricted and are not interesting for bigger companies."

<p>

Noorman quotes Dutch Member of the European Parliament, Maartje van Putten, who said

that the amount of onions which can be exported preferentially to the EU is as high as the

annual onion production of two Dutch farmers.

<p>

Since ACP countries tend to have weak industrial bases, some argue that agricultural exports

should be one of their strengths. "It is important that their agricultural products get as much

access [to Europe's markets] as possible. But that is exactly a sensitive sector which Europe

keeps closed as much as it can", says Noorman.



<p>

<h3>Changed interests</h3>



When negotiations were held last year on the second part of Lom&#233; IV, it became clear

that interest from the European side had faded. The United Kingdom reduced its contribution

by one third; Germany has never been a strong supporter; and only the driving force of

France brought the mid-term review to a successful conclusion.

<p>

Part of the European reluctance can be explained by the history of the Lom&#233;

Convention. ACP countries are mainly former French and British colonies. France, especially

is very much attached to its former colonial ties. "In principle, Lom&#233; was a neo-

colonial treaty in which the old colonies of the Union were involved. That was a bad start,"

comments Hoebink. 

<p>

These ties have been diluted over time by the addition of new members to the European

Union. Newer members have different colonial histories, or none at all (Austria). Spain, for

instance has traditionally focused on Latin America, which like Asia, is excluded from the

Lom&#233; Convention.

<p>

Other motivations are tighter aid budgets, and a fear that five-year commitments to

Lom&#233; will put too great a squeeze on bilateral funds. Particularly where national

budgets are being reduced, Lom&#233; takes up an increasing proportion of the total

national aid budget. This motivation was particularly strong in the United Kingdom where aid

officials, facing a significant decline in bilateral funds, insisted on a reduction in their

commitments to the multilateral Lom&#233; framework.  

<p>

<h3>More discrimination in the future?</h3>

Internal and external forces have created the current stormy climate for the debate on the

Lom&#233; Convention. While it is too early for complete scenarios to emerge, the debate

is heating up as the issues become clearer.

<p>

One major problem to tackle is discrimination. In two ways. First, how to discriminate among

ACP countries so that differences are reflected in their relations with Europe. Second, how

to avoid discriminating against very poor countries like Bangladesh which are currently

excluded from the agreements.

<p>

Though he does not want to draw conclusions yet, ECDPM's Geert Laporte identifies a more

differentiated approach as one of the options under consideration. Laporte "gets the

impression that a kind of regionalisation is being worked on. The basic idea is that it is

unmanageable to keep seventy countries together, because they are too different." Since it

is clear that ACP countries face different problems, he can see Lom&#233; possibly evolving

into an "umbrella agreement covering all developing countries, with sub-agreements for

specific countries and regions."

<p>

This could lead to a Southern African region supported in different ways than Central Africa,

the Pacific or the Caribbean. Hoebink notes that while "everybody is talking about

regionalisation," he pleads for a treaty that also incorporates Asian developing countries.

"The crux for a new cooperation will be [to include] a country like India," he warns,

"because that is a large potential force on the European market."

<p>

But Dutch official Noorman does not exclude that Lom&#233; will remain intact:

<p>

"What we have laid down in Brussels is the result of years-long negotiations between Member

States, which all have different interests. A balance is found and it will not be easy to find a

new balance."

<p>

Noorman continues: "When you say no Lom&#233; no more you have to come up with

alternatives." 

<p>

This is the challenge for the next four years.

<h3>China adoptions</h3>



I read somewhere in your WWW literature that adopting from China is very 
difficult. Working through an agency here in the States - called Wide 
Horizons for Children - we have found the process pretty straightforward. My 
wife returned home June 1st with our child on what was the 30th trip Wide 
Horizons has made to the country (usually in groups of 10-15 couples). Adopting 
from China <b>can</b> be very difficult if you attempt it without the support of 
people who have been there and established ties. With a competent agency, it 
need not be difficult (although there is plenty of red tape - most of it 
necessary - to deal with). My concern is that your warning will stop people 
from trying to adopt from China when the need is clearly urgent.<p>

The Week in Europe, 28 November 1996</h2>

<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>

<p>

Executive Director of the <A HREF="cce.htm">Caribbean Council for Europe</A></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>

A little over a week ago the Green Paper produced by the EC's Development

Commissioner, Professor de Deus Pinheiro, on relations between the EU and

the ACP in the 21st century, was considered by the EC's College of

Commissioners and then presented to the EU ministers attending a

Development Council meeting.

<P>

Despite this, the much talked-about discussion document is still not widely

available.  While it is a veritable gold mine of ideas on options for a

future relationship, it is far from user-friendly. Its discursive style ranges from 

philosophic observations on the future relationship between the EU and

developing nations, through the implications of globalisation, to

indications of very specific ideas in respect of the political, economic,

trade and aid options under consideration by the EC.

<P>

Notwithstanding these reservations, it has to be essential reading for all

in Caribbean politics, government, the private sector, NGOs, trades unions

and others who seek to maintain a future relationship with Europe, whether

for political or economic reasons.

<p>

At its heart the Green Paper is not about a European prescription for a

future relationship, but the presentation of a series of options for

debate, although it is apparent from the drafting that the EC favours some

more than others.

<p>

While it is not easy to do justice to the broad sweep of the document in a

column such as this, let me try to provide a flavour of those sections that

are of most immediate concern and interest to the Caribbean.

<p>

Three aspects of the document are particularly relevant to the region.

These are those dealing with the 'political' relationship, the options for

future trade ties and the role of decentralised partners such as the

private sector.

<p>

The Green Paper recognises that there is now a widening economic divergence

between all developing countries, and within the ACP in particular. This

gap between the richest and poorest in the ACP, it argues, is likely to

widen as a result of rapidly changing global and regional environment,

unless - through partnership with the EU and others - new frameworks of

co-operation can be created. In the case of more advanced regions (such as

the Caribbean) this means assistance with economic transition and the

development of new instruments (regulations and aid mechanisms) that

embrace economic, scientific, technological and environmental co-operation.

<p>

This, it suggests, all points to an EU approach based on differentiation by

region. "The ACP Group is, in reality, neither a political group nor an

economic entity," the Green Paper states. "The geographical coverage of the

co-operation agreement might be changed to take on board factors such as

diversity within the ACP Group". In this context,  it then proposes four

options as a possible basis on which a future EU/ACP arrangement might be

constructed:

<UL>

<li>the maintenance of the status quo of the existing Convention but with

different arrangements and priorities;

 

<li>an overall agreement for the ACP supplemented by regional agreements;

 

<li>a division of the Convention into regional agreements; and

 

<li>a specific agreement for the least developed ACP States, possibly open to

other least developed nations outside the ACP.

</ul><p>

For the Caribbean, the Green Paper then puts forward its first 'heretical'

thought and what one assumes is its preferred choice: "There are a number

of options in the Caribbean, notably the idea of an enlarged co-operation

agreement for the whole of the Caribbean area leading ultimately to

integration of co-operation within these countries into the framework of

relations with Latin America." Much later in the document, in an annex, it

becomes clear that Professor Pinheiro's advisers envisage such a process

might be enhanced by the use of EU support for integration via the

Association of Caribbean States, thereby embracing Cuba, Central America

and all of the OCTs (the French DOMs and the British and Dutch Dependent

Territories).

<p>

Later still, the document addresses the question of the need for new trade

arrangements "consistent with the strategic choices made by the ACP

countries in their bid to integrate into the world economy". This

carefully-chosen expression reflects further new thinking, for it suggests

implicitly that the Caribbean, the Pacific, the ACP in the Indian Ocean,

southern Africa and other regions will, by their location, have to seek

different trade relationships.

<p>

The Green Paper then offers four trade options which it recognises are not

mutually exclusive:

<UL>

<li>that the status quo of non-reciprocal trade preferences be maintained but

be supplemented by co-operation in trade related fields;

 

<li>application of the Generalised Scheme of Preferences on a bilateral or

multilateral basis. This approach, it admits, would involve removing trade

from any post-Lom&#233; co-operation agreement;

 

<li>uniform reciprocity entailing all ACP States, after a transitional

period, extending reciprocity in line with World Trade Organisation rules

with new areas of co-operation in trade-related fields; and

 

<li>differential reciprocity between the EU and different groups of nations

or single countries. This option (which implies the creation of free trade

areas), the Green Paper suggests, might be supplemented by co-operation in

new areas covered by the WTO agenda.

</ul>

<P>

Beyond these critical choices, which warrant much more extensive coverage

and analysis than this column can possibly provide, the Green Paper deals

with the delivery of programmes, the need for efficiency and changing

European perspectives. It also dwells at length on the role of the private

sector and other social partners, and suggests ways forward.

<P>

Much more will be written on all these issues in future columns and, no

doubt, by many others. But, above all, the Green Paper provides a

much-needed focus for the region about the types of options the EC believes

are viable. If the document suggests any one theme, it is that, if the

successor to the Lom&#233; Convention is to have real value in a changed world,

more successful regions such as the Caribbean must look ahead to future

objectives rather than seek to defend the status quo.

<P>

Las previsiones para 1996 del &uacute;ltimo Plan de Cooperaci&oacute;n

Internacional (PACI 96), aprobadas en el Consejo de Ministros

de 28 de diciembre de 1995, han sido las primeras en pasar el

tr&aacute;mite de su previa revisi&oacute;n por el Consejo de

Cooperaci&oacute;n, &oacute;rgano de car&aacute;cter consultivo,

creado por el Real Decreto 795/95 de 19 de mayo, el cual dio su

aprobaci&oacute;n al plan por unanimidad el 15 de diciembre, aunque

con voto interpretativo particular por parte de las Organizaciones

No Gubernamentales de Desarrollo (ONGD) presentes en dicho &oacute;rgano.

<P>

Los resultados de la elaboraci&oacute;n del PACI delatan la consolidaci&oacute;n

de la situaci&oacute;n de estancamiento de los Fondos dedicados

a las Pol&iacute;ticas de Desarrollo en el conjunto de pa&iacute;ses

donantes, en sinton&iacute;a con el ambiente econ&oacute;mico

recesivo y la disciplina de reajuste presupuestario dominante.

En Espa&ntilde;a esta tendencia vino condicionada por varios factores

internos de diferente signo; en primer lugar, la importancia de

la movilizaci&oacute;n social que, desde mediados de 1994 exigi&oacute;

una mejora cuantitativa y cualitativa de la ayuda, oblig&oacute;

a un posicionamiento activo, o reactivo, de las fuerzas pol&iacute;ticas

y deriv&oacute; en el arranque del motor legislativo en favor

de iniciativas largamente aletargadas Ley del Mezenazgo, Consejo

de Cooperaci&oacute;n, Ley del Voluntariado, Proyecto de Ley de

Cooperaci&oacute;n, reformas institucionales la Agencia Espa&ntilde;ola

de Cooperaci&oacute;n Internacional (AECI) y organizativas de

la Secretar&iacute;a de Estado para la Cooperaci&oacute;n Internacional

y para Iberoam&eacute;rica (SECIPI) e hizo brotar compromisos

sobre un aumento de los fondos, al menos dentro del terreno de

lo factible.

<P>

En sentido contrario, la aplicaci&oacute;n de las pol&iacute;ticas

de convergencia para alcanzar los indicativos econ&oacute;micos

que abren las puertas de la Uni&oacute;n Econ&oacute;mica y Monetaria

de la UE, exigieron recortes presupuestarios, complicados por

la situaci&oacute;n de inestabilidad pol&iacute;tica interna que

ha pospuesto la aprobaci&oacute;n de los Presupuestos Generales

del a&ntilde;o en curso hasta pasadas las elecciones generales

de marzo.

<P>

Concretamente esto supone que, por primera vez desde 1989 la operaci&oacute;n

de diferencia entre la Ayuda Oficial al Desarrollo (AOD) del PACI

del a&ntilde;o anterior y la del siguiente resulta negativa (Cuadro

1). La disminuci&oacute;n se concentra en la Cooperaci&oacute;n

bilateral, en concreto en los cr&eacute;ditos del Fondo de Ayuda

al Desarrollo (FAD) cuyo flujo neto hacia los PVD se reduce en

un 23,75%. Sin embargo, no debe atribuirse a un recorte de los

cr&eacute;ditos otorgados, sino a un aumento de los reembolsos

en base a antiguos cr&eacute;ditos concedidos ya en fase de devoluci&oacute;n.

<P>

El descenso de los FAD trata de ser compensado con un aumento

 de un 22,4% de los fondos destinados a programas y proyectos,

lo que, sumado al aumento de un 5,5% de la Cooperaci&oacute;n

descentralizada, conduce a un mayor equilibrio entre la ayuda

no reembolsable y los cr&eacute;ditos FAD (Cuadro 2) continuando

la tendencia iniciada el a&ntilde;o anterior. 

<P>

El gran incremento que experimentan las aportaciones a organismos

internacionales financieros debe relativizarse, ya que depende

de las exigencias del calendario de desembolsos o reposici&oacute;n

de fondos de cada organismo. Los aumentos de Cooperaci&oacute;n

Internacional a Organismos no financieros se deben en gran parte

a las Operaciones de Naciones Unidas para el mantenimiento de

la Paz, aunque &eacute;stas no se computan en el incremento de

la AOD. En cuanto a las aportaciones a la UE (Cuadro 3), la subida

se concentra en las partidas de Cooperaci&oacute;n y no en las

de AOD, debido a que son fondos destinados a Cooperaci&oacute;n

con los Pa&iacute;ses de Europa Central y Oriental (PECOS), la

Ex-URSS y la Pol&iacute;tica Exterior y de Seguridad Com&uacute;n

(PESC) que no estan incluidos en las listas de PVD aprobadas por

el Comit&eacute; de Ayuda al Desarrollo de la Organizaci&oacute;n

para la Cooperaci&oacute;n y el Desarrollo Econ&oacute;mico (OCDE).

<P>

En el resumen por sectores (Cuadro 4) destaca el salto cuantitativo

que experimentan las subvenciones a ONG, que pasan de recibir

4.100 millones de pesetas a 10.650, con lo que resultan las destinatarias

de la parte del le&oacute;n del aumento destinado a programas

y proyectos. Toda esta tendencia al incremento de la ayuda no

reembolsable repercute en el aumento del peso espec&iacute;fico

del Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores (Cuadro 5) que, por primera

vez, supera por separado a los Ministerios de Econom&iacute;a

y Hacienda y Comercio y Turismo en lo referente a gesti&oacute;n

de programas y proyectos, aunque la suma de estos con Industria

y Energ&iacute;a a&uacute;n le dupliquen.

<P>

Se observa una disminuci&oacute;n de la parte destinada a proyectos

de cooperaci&oacute;n bilateral con Latinoam&eacute;rica (Cuadro

6), en favor de otras &aacute;reas como el Norte de &Aacute;frica,

Oriente Medio y &Aacute;frica Subsahariana que, aunque puede suavizarse

con las partidas que se les atribuya a trav&eacute;s de las subvenciones

a ONGD y las de cooperaci&oacute;n descentralizada (fuertemente

decantadas hac&iacute;a aquella zona), parece suponer una desviaci&oacute;n

hacia un nuevo dise&ntilde;o en la estrategia de orientaci&oacute;n

geogr&aacute;fica.

<P>

Finalmente, en la propia introducci&oacute;n a las previsiones

aprobadas, se matiza que, a pesar de darse un estancamiento de

la relaci&oacute;n AOD/PIB en el 0,28%, es previsible una actualizaci&oacute;n

de las cantidades una vez se hayan aprobado los Presupuestos Generales,

adem&aacute;s de la posibilidad de introducir los cr&eacute;ditos

ampliables hasta el 0,35% del PIB tal y como se hizo el a&ntilde;o

anterior.

<h2>The drama that crossed 'The Line'</h2>
<ul><b><i>SABC crosses The Line</i></b><br>
<b><i>Laying down the line on the harsh realities in SA</i></b><br>
<b><i>For many The Line was the last straw</i></b><br>
<b><i>Are we ready to go on The Line?</i></b><br>
<b><i>Bravely CCV lays it all on The Line</i></b></ul>
<p>
<i>These are just a few of the headlines from dozens of articles in the South African press reacting to the controversial screening of the IBT-Afravision co-production 'In a Time of Violence', screened in South Africa with the original title, 'The Line'. They were accompanied by a letter from producer Jeremy Nathan in which he says: 'I believe this series has changed the shape of television in South Africa forever.'</i>
<hr>
In Britain the series was shown on three consecutive Sunday evenings as part of a Channel 4 mini-series during the run-up to the South African elections in April. Originally the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) had scheduled the screening on their CCV channel at the same time but, due to the volatility of the pre-election period, they decided not to screen it until after the elections. 
<p>
After screening the first episode, SABC withdrew the drama because of protests from the certain vocal factions, but when this action provoked even more protests, and accusations of censorship, SABC decided to go ahead and screen all three programmes together on the evening of Saturday 30 July. This caused a national debate in the press, radio and television that lasted for weeks. Producer Jeremy Nathan gives his account of what happened:
<p>
"The first episode was screened on Wednesday 20 July, having received fairly extensive publicity and good reviews. That evening, the SABC's lines were jammed with viewers calling to complain about the portrayal of Inkatha and Zulu-speaking South Africans. The main complaint was the querying of whether this was the right time to screen such a dramatic portrayal of recent events, and did this constitute a reconciliation?
<p>
"After a meeting with Inkatha's Transvaal head Temba Khosa, the SABC suspended the screening of the further two episodes. Another, larger volley of complaints was then received by the SABC demanding it be put back on and that they were breaching the newly established Bill of Rights. 
<p>
"The issue hit front page and leading news reports. After discussions between SABC management, producer, director, cast and crew, it was unanimously agreed to push ahead with the screenings. All the Sunday newspapers carried large front page articles and an announcement from the SABC explaining why it was going ahead with all three episodes. 
<p>
"Dawn on Monday broke with the press and radio coverage becoming even more extensive. For the entire week, the whole country was caught up with debating the merits and demerits of the forthcoming screening, with people of all political persuasions getting involved in the freedom of information and expression debate. 
<p>
"On Thursday evening, a week after the series was suspended, the Inkatha-linked National Hostel Residents Association went public on national press, radio and television placing a Ôfatwah' on the lives of the producer, cast and crew of the series. Some of the more visible cast and crew went into hiding, as Inkatha threatened to march on and occupy the SABC offices. On the Saturday morning the march and occupation took place. Although small, it was vocal and the police were a constant presence.
<p>
"Saturday 30 July was truly the most bizarre day and night in the lives of the cast and crew. About twenty of us were holed up in a hotel room, preparing to watch our series screened to the nation, not knowing how ordinary people would react. The moment finally came, with the SABC screening a peace song before the series, and a lengthy introduction by a top SABC management person. Cut off from the rest of the world, protected by anonymity and the hotel's discretion, we hotly debated whether we had done the right thing. Without doubt, and to a person, whatever the cost to ourselves, we all felt that we had. 
<p>
"Sunday morning found us at breakfast, all a little drained by the experience of the last few days. Four elderly white women were breakfasting at the hotel. One of them recognised one of the actors, came over to the table and suddenly, the entire breakfast room knew who we were. They all loved the series and told us how they never knew how things were in the townships, and thanked us all for a brilliantly entertaining and informative show. 
<p>
"For the next two weeks the debate raged in the newspapers and on the radio. Most viewers were of the opinion that it was all true, and that it was a great start for new South African television. What was all the fuss about? Some did not, and felt it was one-sided and pro-ANC. All forgot that it was a drama and not a documentary. Pure opinion, and entertainment.
<p>
"The audience figures a few weeks later proved that it was the second most viewed programme ever in South Africa, second only to the news during the elections, and higher than the World Cup soccer finals. After a traumatic few weeks, the debate quietened down. The cast and crew felt exhausted on the one hand, pleased that freedom of broadcasting had been placed on the agenda, and that their work had been seen by many millions, but also aware of the distance that the country still has to go to create a culture of tolerance and debate.
<p>
"All the broadcasters and people involved in the series can feel pleased that in some small way we have contributed to challenging the monolith of power that has historically controlled broadcasting in South Africa, and for the first time given the audience, the people, a choice in the matter. Those people who complained when it was taken off ensured that it was rescreened, and to them we are indebted."

<br><i>The material that follows has been provided by </i>BBC Television
<hr><center><h1>Live Aid 10th Anniversary</h1><i>"It had to be the biggest show ever, I was aware of that. It was entertainment but it was for an almost Biblical Disaster. Maybe for the first time since Man left the African Rift Valley we began to talk in a common language, and that language, bizarrely, turned out to be pop music."</i> - Bob Geldof, April 1995,<i><p></center>
<hr>

<br><i>George Michael, Bob Geldof, David Bowie and Bono singing 'Do They Know It's Christmas?' at the finale of Live Aid, July 13th 1985<p>

<br clear=left><br>
</i><h3>The Concert</h3> <i>"Live Aid became the focus of everyone's frustration and anger and shame. Very quickly, it became a sort of phenomenon." - Bob Geldof </i><p>
More than 70,000 people packed Wembley Stadium 10 years ago for a concert which was watched on television by 1.4 billion people in over 170 countries worldwide. A total of £70 million was raised for famine relief - still the most money raised for charity by a single event - and used to fund projects in Mozambique, Chad, Burkina Faso, Niger, Mali, the Sudan and Ethiopia. (The people of Bermuda were the most generous of all, giving  the equivalent of £1.50 per person.) Band Aid and Live Aid were never intended to become permanent institutions: once the money was spent, the offices were closed and the Band Aid Trust now encourages people to support other charities working in Africa.<p>


<h3>The Legacy</h3>
Perhaps the most significant achievement was that, for once, people felt they could <i>do</i> something - they were empowered by Geldof's crusade for justice for those stricken by drought and civil war in Ethiopia. Nobody was so naive as to suggest that this money would solve the problem, but at least, by giving money, people took an interest in what was happening in the rest of the world. This is probably the greatest legacy left by Live Aid.
<p>
<h3>The Anniversary Programme</h3>
<p><br>

BBC Television marks the tenth anniversary with a spectacular six-and-a-half hour <b>Live Aid 10th Anniversary</b> special broadcast on <b>Saturday, July 15th, 6.00-8.30pm</b> and <b>9.30-1.30am.</b><p><br clear=left><p>



<i>"Our plans had always included more than just a repeat of the best of the music. We wanted the anniversary programme to stay true to the original aims of the 1985 event and to highlight the state of Africa. Many people gave money to Live Aid in 1985, and it is important that people have the chance to see what happened to their money."- Peter Firstbrook, Executive Producer </i> <p>

In April 1995, Bob Geldof and a small BBC Television film crew travelled to Ethiopia to film a series of sequences for the programme. The brief for Geldof and the film director was to show a side of the country that the television viewer would not expect. Recent research suggests that over 80% of people in the United Kingdom get most of their information about the developing world from television - mostly news and current affairs reports - and that two-thirds of television news footage of the developing world covers conflict, famine or other major catastrophes. This leads to an inevitable distortion of people's understanding of what life in the rest of the world is really like. <p>

<i>"We obviously wanted to visit projects that had received support from Band Aid funds, but these reports were never intended to give the impression that the problem was solved with a small donation, nor that Band Aid money was the only source of funds. Often Band Aid only provided a relatively small amount of seed money for projects in which local people did an enormous amount of hard work themselves." - Peter Firstbrook, Executive Producer</i><p>

Bob Geldof was asked to present a personal and impressionistic vision of Ethiopia. In one particularly memorable sequence, he returns to Korem, the town which ten years ago brought to our attention the suffering and horror of the '84 famine, and finds a now bustling market town surrounded by rolling green farmland. A young woman, who was orphaned by the famine in 1984, tells of her journey to the camp on her mother's back, and the tin huts, sickness and death when they got there. Today, she is nursing her 6-month-old daughter.

<h3>Reactions and updates from<i> One World Online's </i> partners</h3>
  <a href="../oxfam/index.html"> OXFAM</a> - "Ten years on we have peace and a fledgling democracy in Ethiopia. These are great assets. But desperate poverty remains. The population continues to increase by more than 1.5 million a year. The gap between food needs and food production is still growing. The rate of deforestation exceeds all planting efforts. If these issues are to be addressed, Ethiopia will need: the efforts of all its people; sound government policies; and continuing international support."<p>

 <a href="../cafod/index.html"> CAFOD</a> - "Ethiopia's greatest natural resource is its people. They are creative, ingenious, hard-working and keen to build a secure future for themselves. Over the past ten years CAFOD has invested in this resource with skills training programmes, making people more self-sufficent.<br>In Tigray, one of the areas worst affected by the famine, CAFOD has funded the training of 'barefoot vets', health workers and mechanics, and helped develop new skills with women and street children. We are helping to build a training school at Adwa, a remote area of Tigray that was neglected during 17 years of war."<p>

 <a href="../unicef/index.html"> UNICEF</a> - "The people of Ethiopia have been living under emergency conditions for close to twenty years. Life is especially harsh for people in the countryside - the majority of the population. Children and women are particularly affected. For every 1000 babies born, 120 will die before the age of five. Women struggle to cope with sporadic food shortages and the lack of proper health care."<p>


 <a href="../scf/index.html"> Save the Children Fund</a> - "Ten years on from Live Aid, much has been achieved. Since 1991, Ethiopia has been at peace for the first time in two decades. Better early warning systems have been developed by Save the Children and other agencies - to forecast famine, and more roads have been built to distribute aid.  The Ethiopian government has itself taken measures to avert famine. Yet, despite these gains, donors have been reluctant to commit themselves to Ethiopia's future development. As a result, the lives of millions of Ethiopians continue to rest precariously on the thin line between survival and catastrophe."
<p>
<a href="../actionaid/index.html"> ACTIONAID</a> - "Poor communities in Ethiopia continue to face hungry seasons. Erratic rainfall and environmental degradation challenge agricultural production while the majority of farmers cannot afford materials for the next planting season. Yet a small loan, for fertiliser or an ox, could make a difference. ACTIONAID's saving and credit schemes provide loans to Ethiopian farmers while other long-term programmes are improving clean water, education and health care."
<p>
 <a href="../christian_aid/index.html"> Christian Aid</a> - "Ten years on from Live Aid, Christian Aid is still there, supporting the efforts of Ethiopians in their struggle for better lives. Thousands of hectares have been terraced to catch rainfall, new dams and wells are providing clean water and simple technologies - such as grinding mills - are making a huge difference to the lives of many families. In ten years time, Ethiopians may be able to be self-sufficent.  Until then they need all the help we can give."

<font size=4><b>Ross Crockford</b> visits Adbusters, a Vancouver-based campaigning group that
combines parody with politics.</font><BR>
<BR>
<hr width=71%><p>



The viewers of CNN Headline News were in for a bit of a shock. <BR>
One afternoon last September, amid the channel's standard fare of news bites
and ads for cars and mutual funds, this appeared : an animated pig, smacking
its lips, rising out of a map of North America. 'The average North American
consumes five times more than a Mexican, ten times more than a Chinese person
and thirty times more than a person from India,' said an announcer. Cut
to a bulldozer, plowing garbage into a landfill. 'We are the most voracious
consumers in the world - a world that could die because of how we North
Americans live.' Cut to an image of Earth, receding in space. 'Give it a
rest. September 24th is Buy Nothing Day.'<BR>
<BR>
Score another small victory for the Adbusters Media Foundation. Since 1989
this group of activists based in Vancouver, on Canada's Pacific coast, has
generated dozens of similarly cheeky and provocative messages. And fought
to get them onto television screens. As they see it, most TV ads are propaganda
for an unsustainable way of life and our media is more interested in selling
that way of life than in discussing ways we can change it. Adbusters tries
to beat the big advertisers at their own game - by promoting ideas
instead of products. <BR>
<BR>
'We're trying to develop a new language of protest,' says Kalle Lasn, one
of the group's founders. 'Corporations are defining our culture for us.
It's time for us to take it back.' With that goal in mind the Estonian-born
Lasn, 53, publishes Adbusters magazine, a quarterly 'journal of the mental
environment' exposing advertising practices and offering oddball 'culture
 jamming' strategies. (One recent issue contained a counterfeit coupon for
a free hamburger and invited readers to persuade McDonald's employees to
accept it.) <BR>
<BR>
Between the articles are ad parodies. And even these have created a stir.
The makers of Absolut Vodka once threatened to sue Adbusters over a series
of spoof ads - one showed the familiar vodka bottle, drooping from
over-indulgence, with the slogan 'Absolut Impotence'. But they eventually
backed off, realizing that a lawsuit would only give the magazine more publicity.<BR>
<BR>
Lasn also makes 30-second, broadcast-quality 'subvertisements' like the
Buy Nothing Day message but he has trouble convincing TV stations to run
them. Last year he sent a dozen of the 'uncommercials' he's produced (blasting
such things as television addiction and industrial forestry) to the three
biggest stations in New York City. Though the messages were professionally
slick and their claims backed by statistics all three stations turned him
down.<BR>
<BR>
'Television is the most powerful medium of our time but the average citizen
does not have access to it,' claims Lasn. 'This pandering to the commercial
interest has gone so far that our basic freedom of speech is being violated.'
<BR>
<BR>
The powers that be will find it more difficult to stop the message of Buy
Nothing Day. Last September 24, <i>Buy Nothing Day</i> went international. In Manchester,
England, a group called Enough celebrated the date by launching a fake new
soft drink called Happiness. In the Netherlands activists occupied a shopping
mall dressed in rat costumes and urged people to leave the race. It may
sound loony but Lasn has even bigger plans in 1996, including a full-page
ad in the New York Times and the broadcast of another animated pig message
in the capitals of all of the G-7 countries.<BR>
'Western culture has gone berzerk with shopping,' says Lasn. 'Buy Nothing
Day is the consumer equivalent of meditation. It teaches you something about
the impulse to buy that has been so carefully conditioned into us by advertizing.'<BR>
<BR>
Breaking the consumer habit won't be easy. At the end of last year's Buy
Nothing Day spot on CNN a toll-free telephone number appeared on-screen
and dozens of viewers called to express their opinions. Three-quarters of
them were hostile. 'You're a bunch of tree-hugging freaks,' said one. 'Advertizing
is the American way.'<BR>
<BR>
Says Kalle Lasn: 'Our message goes against the grain of what North Americans
have been brought up to believe. But let's face it, neither our consumer
culture nor our economic system are sustainable. We're at the beginning
of a revolution which is fuelled by a quest for sustainability - a
quest to give our children and our children's children the same kinds of
opportunities that we have. It requires incredibly hard choices. Now is
the time to make them.'	<BR>

<title>Middle East peace process in tatters as fifth suicide bomb hits Israel</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#823308" alink="d9d919" vlink="ff7f00">OneWorld News Service<p><b><font size=-1>This report has been researched and written by the OneWorld News Team</font></b>



<h2>Middle East peace process in tatters as fifth suicide bomb hits Israel</h2>



<b>5 March 1996</b><p>

Thousands of grief-stricken Israelis called for an end to Prime Minister Shimon Peres' peace process last night, as  a fifth suicide bomb attack killed 12 people and wounded over 100 in Tel Aviv.<p>

In the past 8 days more than 60 people have been killed in suicide bomb blasts, detonated by the military wing of the Palestinian Muslim fundamentalist group, Hamas.<p>

Hamas' stated aim is to wreck what is left of the Arab-Israeli peace process by proving to Israelis and Arabs alike that their leaders are ineffectual, and that the two communities cannot live together.<p>

Judging by the reaction of some Israelis to the latest terrorist atrocity, the bombers are achieving their aim.  "Peres, you're next," shouted some, in an apparent reference to the fate of the assassinated prime minister Yitzak Rabin.  Mr Peres has seen his lead in the polls over the hardline Jewish Likud opposition party slashed in the last several days.  <p>

In response to this latest series of blasts, Peres has himself been forced to take a stronger stance towards the Palestinian threat.  After an emergency cabinet meeting yesterday, he told reporters: "We will go to any corner where this twisted terror has begun to take root."<p>

Israel will now give priority to a military campaign against Hamas, and its fellow fundamentalist organisation Islamic Jihad.  Security services will be given a free hand to enter even the parts of the former Occupied Territories now controlled by Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority.<p>

This is a reversal of previous Israeli policy, which has seen the withdrawal of troops from the occupied territories of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip after the 1993 peace deal with the Yasser Arafat's PLO.   <p>

However, the Palestinian authorities condemned the decision, saying that they were in charge of countering the threat from Muslim militants.  Over the past few weeks 350 known Hamas members have been detained by Mr Arafat's police.<p>

A further long-term threat to peace is the emnity that the bombing campaign is continuing to sow between Palestinians and Israelis.  Many Israelis feel there has been a distinct lack of sympathy among the Palestinians for their plight.  "Where are the peace rallies?" many are asking.<p>

Palestinians are in turn angry at Israel's response, which has been to close indefinitely the border between Israel and the former Occupied Territories.  Thousands of Palestinians depend on jobs in Israel for their income, and preventing them from working will deepen despair and poverty in Muslim communities.<p>

It is from this crushing poverty that fundamentalism and extremist politics derive their strength, say many observers.  Unless there is a long term strategy to tackle this problem, Arab-Israeli peace may still be a long way off.<p>

<title>World Conference on Women - Beijing</title>
</head>
<body>

<br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="oxfam.html">  Oxfam</i></a>
<hr>

<center><h2>Briefing paper for the IV World Conference on Women<br>

Beijing - 4th-15th September 1995</h2></center>

The IV World Conference on Women scheduled to take place in September this 
year is the
latest in a series of Conferences scheduled to coincide with the United 
Nations' 50th
Anniversary. As such, it will build on the work already done by the World 
Summit on
Children (1990), the Earth Summit 1992), the Vienna Human Rights Conference 
(1993), the
International Conference on Population and Development (1994) and the World 
Summit on
Social Development (1995). Coming at the end of such a long list, the charge 
of "conference-
itis" is perhaps inevitable. So why is Beijing important and what can it 
achieve ?
<p>

The Declaration and the Platform of Action which will be agreed at the 
Beijing Conference
will mark the latest stage in a process which began twenty years ago in 
1975, declared
International Women's Year by the UN's General Assembly. The year was a 
turning point
in putting women's issues on the agenda in the development process. The UN 
Decade for
Women (1976-1985) was a worldwide effort to examine the status and rights of 
women and
to bring them into the decision-making process at all levels. In 1979, the 
UN General
Assembly adopted the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of 
Discrimination against
Women which entered into force in 1981 and set an international standard for 
what was
meant by equality between women and men.<p>


In 1985, the World Conference to Review and Appraise the Achievements of the 
UN Decade
for Women in Nairobi adopted the Forward-looking Strategies for Women to be 
implemented
by the year 2000. These marked a turning point for women, securing agreement 
by
governments to update their legislative frameworks, incorporating women's 
rights and
building awareness of gender into planning processes. The Nairobi Conference 
also gave a
boost to women's organisations and NGOs campaigning on gender issues. While 
the
intervening years have undoubtedly brought many positive changes for women, 
ten years on,
many of the commitments made at Nairobi have still to be met.<p>


Oxfam believes that the Beijing Women's Conference is important firstly 
because it presents
an opportunity to remind governments of their previous commitments and put 
them under
pressure to implement them; secondly, it will highlight the enormous gender 
gap which still
exists; thirdly, it will allow women from all over the world to seek new 
commitments from
national governments and international institutions, linked to concrete 
proposals which can
bring about real changes in their daily lives. The NGO Forum will complement 
this by
providing an opportunity for women's groups to share ideas and experience 
across the world.<p>


In summary, we hope that the Beijing Conference will lead to:

<ul><li>   Re-affirmation that women's rights are fundamental human rights.

<li>   Action to halt the increasingly female face of poverty.

<li>   Generation of additional resources for women in the development process
     through enhanced debt relief and acceptance of the 20:20 compact.</ul><p>

The Conference is taking place against a background of controversy, with the 
most recent
focus of dissent being over the siting of the NGO Forum. The Chinese 
Government has
proposed that this should be moved from the centre of Beijing to Huairou in 
the suburbs,
giving rise to fears that NGOs' access to official delegations will be 
limited. While lobbying
by NGOs has resulted in some important concessions including agreement on 
visas, transport
between Beijing and Huairou and a satellite base for NGOs in Beijing itself, 
concerns over
accreditation of NGOs and censorship of publications remain.<p>


While Oxfam shares these concerns, we are keen to ensure that they do not 
detract from the
overall purpose of the Conference - the promotion of women's rights and 
equality.<p>


<h3>The scale of the problem</h3>

Oxfam works in over 70 countries around the world and witnesses the results 
of
discrimination against women on a daily basis. Women provide most of the 
food consumed
by poor households and perform more than three-quarters of the agricultural 
work in many
countries. They manage common resources and are responsible for collecting 
water and
firewood as well as bringing up children. Female labour also accounts for a 
growing
proportion of employment in commercial agriculture and industry.<p>


But despite this contribution, women face a bewildering array of social, 
economic, cultural
and religious barriers to their equal participation in society. 
While the 
true cost of this
systematic discrimination cannot be measured, the results can be seen in a 
few revealing
statistics:<p>


<ul><li>  Out of 130 million primary school children not attending school, 70% 
are girls.

<li>  Out of 960 million illiterate adults in the world, two-thirds are 
women.

<li>  In many countries, especially in Asia, the malnutrition rate for girls 
is much
     higher than for boys. In Bangladesh, for example, the malnutrition rate 
for girls
     is three times that for boys.

<li>  Women are typically paid 30-40% less than men for doing the same jobs.
<li>  One third of wives in developing countries are physically abused. In 
Peru, 70%
     of all crimes reported to the police concern women beaten by their 
partners.

<li>  Worldwide, one woman in 2,000 has been reported as raped.

<li>    Women's share of the seats in the world's parliaments has fallen from 
15% in
     1988 to 11% in 1994. Only around 6% of cabinet posts are held by women 
and
     in 1994, only ten women were heads of state or government. At the UN, 
only six
     of the 184 member countries have a female permanent representative.</ul><p>


Given the scale of the problem and the all encompassing nature of the 
Beijing Platform of
Action, there are many issues which could be raised at the Conference. In 
its lobbying at
Beijing, Oxfam will concentrate on the following points.<p>


<h3>Women's Human Rights</h3>

Among the agreements on women's rights made at previous UN conferences, one 
of the most
significant is the explicit recognition in the Vienna Declaration that the 
human rights
of women and the girl child are an inalienable, integral and indivisible 
part of universal
human rights. Against a background of rising religious fundamentalism and 
growing
economic and political conservatism, such basic principles are once again 
under attack from
some quarters. In particular, it seems likely that those who champion the 
nuclear family will
attempt to scapegoat women for the social breakdown which is occurring in 
many societies.
Throughout our overseas programme, Oxfam's experience of the diversity of 
families leads
us to believe that diversity should be recognised and valued.<p>


As a starting point for its lobbying, Oxfam will seek to ensure that the 
principle that
women's rights are fundamental human rights is upheld and that there is no 
backsliding on
previous agreements. As a means of holding governments accountable for 
ending
discriminatory practices, we will be calling for:


<ul><li>  Universal ratification and implementation of all UN human rights 
instruments,
     including ratification without reservation of the Convention against 
All Forms of
     Discrimination Against Women.</ul><p>


<h3>Women in Poverty</h3>

Of the 1.2 billion people living in absolute poverty, a disproportionate and 
growing number
are women, leading to what commentators have dubbed "the feminization of 
poverty". The
causes of poverty in general and women's poverty in particular are many, 
complex and
varied. One fundamental problem is that in many societies, women continue to 
be denied
access to land, property and other resources and are discriminated against 
in terms of
inheritance, credit and banking services. In Bangladesh, daughters inherit 
land at half their
brothers' entitlement while in much of Africa, women have no rights to 
resources such as
the land they cultivate. Overall, it is estimated that women obtain only 10% 
of all rural
credit. <br>At Beijing, Oxfam will be lobbying for:

<ul><li>  Equal access to land, property, inheritance, credit and banking 
services for
     women.</ul><p>


Given that women do around two-thirds of the world's work in return for less 
than 5% of
the world's income, measuring and valuing unwaged work is an important 
aspect of
recognising women's economic and legal rights. Quantifying and valuing 
unwaged work
would provide official information on how much work women do in the home, on 
the land,
in family business and in the community. <br>
At Beijing, Oxfam will be calling 
for:


<ul><li>   Governments, financial institutions and the UN to measure and value 
women's
     unwaged work and include this in satellite accounts of GDP.</ul><p>


The deregulation of labour markets has led to an increase in the number of 
women joining
the work force. While some have done so on a voluntary basis, seizing newly 
gained rights
and opportunities, others have been forced to take paid employment to make 
ends meet.<p>


All too often, the latter category of women join the informal sector, 
working long hours in
poor conditions for inadequate remuneration.<p>


In Chile, an "economic success story", Oxfam partners are working in the 
Patronato district
of Santiago, centre of the country's textile industry. Here, an estimated 
6,000 small
workshops do outwork for large manufacturers and provide employment to over 
12,000
mainly female workers. Few of these workshops meet even the minimum 
specifications of
Chile's weak health and safety laws and accidents are regular occurrences. 
Most women do
not have contracts so can be made redundant without compensation. Piecework 
rates are so
low that most women have to work shifts in excess of twelve hours, including 
night work.
Even the most basic trade union rights are denied.<p>


Elsewhere in the formal sector, national labour laws often fail to give 
women adequate
protection against discrimination or protect their rights to employment and 
social security
during illness and pregnancy. <br>At Beijing, Oxfam will be calling for:<p>


<ul><li>   Implementation of all International Labour Organisation (ILO) 
conventions
     relevant to the protection of women's employment rights including those 
relating
     to equal pay for women, maternity rights, rights of association and 
rights of
     part-time workers.</ul><p>


Despite calls at the World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen for 
the
International Financial Institutions to ensure that social development goals 
are fully integrated
into macro-economic policies, Oxfam remains concerned at the impact of 
structural
adjustment programmes on poor and marginalised groups, including women.<p>


In Zimbabwe, for example, the simultaneous reduction of food subsidies 
combined with the
decline in wages which accompanied adjustment dramatically reduced household 
incomes.
One study of a low income urban settlement in Harare estimates that the 
proportion of
families living below the poverty line doubled to 43% under adjustment. The 
poorest families
cut their meals from two to one a day, with women bearing the brunt of this 
household level
adjustment, foregoing meals themselves in order to feed their children.<p>


Whereas there is now a strong international consensus on the importance of 
investing in basic
health and education services, as illustrated by World Bank statements at 
the Copenhagen
Summit, the reality that Oxfam sees on the ground is government cut-backs 
which hit women
and girls hardest.<p>


Burdened by debt as they attempt to meet IMF-World Bank targets, many 
governments have
responded by cutting social welfare budgets. During the 1980s, real per 
capita spending on
education in Africa fell by one-third while two-thirds of the countries in 
the region also
reduced expenditure on health. Uganda, one of the most severely indebted 
countries, is
currently obliged to spend more on servicing its debt than it is able to 
invest in health and
education combined.<p>


In an attempt to bridge the gap, some countries have resorted to the 
introduction of user fees
for health and education. Such measures have predictably hit the poor 
hardest and poor
women the hardest of all.<p>


An Oxfam study in Zimbabwe found that women's attendance at ante-natal 
clinics was
particularly sensitive to increased health fees. The Government of Zimbabwe 
has
subsequently withdrawn fees in rural health clinics but they continue to be 
standard policy
in many other countries. While exemption schemes have been introduced, these 
have
generally proved to be inadequate. Moreover the user charge schemes have 
proved to be
economically inefficient - in Zimbabwe, the scheme cost more to run than it 
raised in
government revenue. <br>At Beijing, Oxfam will be lobbying for:<p>

<ul><li>  The withdrawal of user fees for basic health services and primary 
education
     under structural adjustment programmes.<br>

<li> Greater participation from civil society in the formulation of World 
Bank/IMF
     policies and in particular, agreement that community based 
organisations,
     women's groups and NGOs should be involved in the design of economic 
reform
     programmes.

<li> Agreement that all future structural adjustment programmes will be 
designed to
     take account of their impact on women's labour and access to services.

<li>  International Financial Institutions to introduce effective social 
conditionality so
     that the disbursement of structural adjustment loans is made 
conditional on
     government action to improve basic services and ensure access to them 
by women
     and girls.</ul><p>


<h3>Women's Health and Reproductive Rights</h3>

Last year's International Conference on Population and Development 
successfully reached
new agreements on women's health and reproductive rights. Oxfam understands 
the
concerns
which are often expressed in relation to the population question, but 
believes that rapid
population growth is both a cause and a consequence of poverty and of 
control. It is vital that
women are empowered to make choices about family size within the couple, 
within the
family and within the community. We support agreements reached in Cairo for 
a
comprehensive strategy to reduce rapid population growth through a wider 
anti-poverty
strategy and specific measures to improve the education and status of women 
and ensure
that
women have access to quality reproductive health care services.  There are 
many reasons
why people elect to have large families but one of the most obvious is 
poverty. Tackling
poverty, followed by providing education and freely available reproductive 
health care for
women is, in our view, the best strategy for reducing family size.<p>


However, a coalition of the Holy See and some Roman Catholic countries plus 
Muslim
countries in the Middle East are seeking to use the Beijing Conference to 
re-open the debate
they lost in Cairo regarding women's reproductive rights. <br>Oxfam will be 
lobbying for:


<ul><li>    Full implementation of the Cairo commitments on women's sexual and
     reproductive health.

<li>   A holistic approach to women's health which recognises their needs from 
early
     childhood to old age, including needs for high quality reproductive 
health care.</ul><p>


<h3>Violence Against Women</h3>

Violence against women in the home continues to be endemic in many 
societies. One study
covering 35 countries found that an average of one-fifth to one-half of 
women have suffered
domestic violence from a male partner, on average three times a year. In 
Egypt and Zambia,
injuries resulting from domestic assaults are the most common reason for 
female visits to
casualty units while in Latin America, domestic and sexual violence against 
women claims
more lives than political violence. <p>
Oxfam will be lobbying to:<ul>

<li>  Ensure that national legislation specifically recognises and 
establishes sanctions
     against all forms of violence against women.

<li>   Ensure that police forces and judiciaries are trained to take domestic 
violence
     seriously and deal with it appropriately.

<li> Ensure that the Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women has all 
necessary
     assistance from national governments and UN agencies in fulfilling her 
task and
     in promoting the renewal, updating and strengthening of her mandate.</ul><p>


<h3>Women and Conflict</h3>

While the end of the Cold War initially heralded a new spirit of optimism 
about the prospects
for world peace, this has quickly dissolved in the myriad of intra-state 
conflicts which have
erupted across the globe. As the nature of conflict has changed, so have its 
victims - four out
of every five casualties in contemporary conflicts are civilians. The 
outbreak of conflict has
led to refugee movements on an unprecedented scale. The 82 major armed 
conflicts which
took place between 1989 and 1993 have left 40 million people as refugees or 
internally
displaced and of these, around 80% are women and children.<p>


Refugee women form a particularly vulnerable group, frequently dependent on 
others to meet
even their most basic needs for food, water, shelter and clothing. They are 
also vulnerable
to gender specific forms of violence such as rape, forced prostitution and 
forced pregnancy.
In former Yugoslavia, it is estimated that between 50,000 and 80,000 women 
have been
raped, while in Rwanda, countless thousands have been forced to bear the 
children of those
who massacred their families. <br>Against this background, Oxfam is lobbying 
for:

<ul><li>  Adequate resources to guarantee the rights to protection and relief of 
refugee and
     displaced women.

<li>   Explicit recognition that rape and other forms of sexual assault in the 
conduct
     of armed conflict constitute a war crime under the terms of the Geneva
     Convention and its Protocols.

<li>  The establishment of a permanent International Tribunal for genocide, 
war
     crimes and other serious violations of human rights.</ul><p>


All too often, intra-state conflicts are fuelled by weapons sold by the 
former super-powers
to governments only too willing to sacrifice social development for military 
hardware.<p>


Pakistan, with some of the worst social indicators in the world, continues 
to allocate a greater
proportion of its annual budget to military expenditure than to health and 
education
combined. Developing countries now account for 15% of global military 
expenditure,
an annual total of $118bn. While excessive military expenditure remains 
primarily a matter
for the governments concerned, those who sell the weapons must bear their 
share of
responsibility. Four-fifths of the world's weapons are supplied by the 
Permanent Five
members of the UN Security Council.<p>


Perhaps the most sinister aspect of "modern" conflicts is that long after 
peace has been
declared, the weapons of death can go on claiming innocent victims, killed 
or maimed by
anti-personnel mines. There are an estimated 100 million mines in the world 
laid in 64
countries. They kill or injure 2,000 people each month - every 15 minutes, 
someone,
somewhere in the world will step on a landmine - and a large proportion of 
victims will be
women and children. Oxfam remains unconvinced that the various export 
moratoria imposed
on anti-personnel mines will prove adequate to deal with the scale and 
seriousness of the
problem.<br> Oxfam is therefore calling for:

<ul><li>  A total ban on the production, sale, transfer, export, stockpiling or 
use of all
     anti-personnel mines.</ul><p>


<h3>Implementation, follow-up and resources</h3>

No matter what governments agree to at Beijing, there is a danger that 
commitments will turn
into empty rhetoric unless the Conference addresses the central issues of 
implementation,
follow-up and resources.<p>


Coming in the wake of various other UN Conferences which have sought to 
establish new
bodies to oversee implementation, Oxfam believes that the responsibility for 
implementing
the Beijing Platform of Action should be integrated with existing 
structures.<br> We will argue
the case for:

<ul><li>  Responsibility for co-ordinating implementation to rest with ECOSOC, 
which
     should be strengthened. Specific strategies must be developed to ensure 
that
     gender perspectives are incorporated in all UN programmes.

<li>   Introduction of an integrated mechanism for reporting back on Beijing 
and all
     other recent UN conferences.

<li>  Creation of a new post of Under Secretary General to oversee UN
     implementation of the Agenda for Equality.</ul><p>


With regard to follow-up, we believe the key to success lies in ensuring 
that governments
give commitments to measurable, time-bound objectives for progress.<p>


Given that the Beijing Conference takes place against a background of 
falling aid budgets,
it seems unlikely that governments will agree to finding additional 
resources for
implementation of its proposals.<br> Nevertheless, Oxfam believes that 
considerable progress
could be made by reallocating existing resources more wisely and by adopting 
more
imaginative schemes to release funds for women in development.
In particular, we will be arguing the case for:

<ul><li>  A co-ordinated strategy and improved terms for debt relief, including 
80-100%
     reductions in Paris Club debt and agreement on new measures to tackle 
the
     growing crisis of multilateral debt, financed  from within the 
multilateral
     institutions.

<li>   Commitment to the 20:20 compact, agreed on a voluntary basis at the
     Copenhagen Summit, whereby 20% of donor countries' development 
assistance
     and 20% of recipient countries' national budgets will be spent on basic 
health
     care and basic education.
<li> A reduction in military expenditure with the proceeds invested in 
social
     development priorities such as health and education. Reducing military 
spending
     in developing countries by 25% would be sufficient to double social 
spending.</ul><p>


In relation to Beijing, we believe that priority expenditure for funds 
released in this way
should include:

<ul><li>  Increased financial and human resources for the Committee on the 
Elimination
     of Discrimination Against Women which monitors compliance with the
     Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women.

<li>   Strengthening the capacity of the Division for the Advancement of Women
     to service CEDAW and CSW.

<li> Adequate resources to be directed toward UNIFEM (United Nations 
Development
     Fund for Women) to strengthen its programmes and implement its mandate.</ul><p><hr>

<TITLE>The Week in Europe</TITLE>

The Week in Europe, 17 January 1997</h2>

<h4>by <i>David Jessop</i>

<p>

Executive Director of the <A HREF="cce.htm">Caribbean Council for Europe</A></h4>

</center>

<hr>

<P>In December l996, the EC published and circulated a green paper produced by

the EC's Development Commissioner setting out a series of options for post

Lom&#233; arrangements between the EU and the ACP.

<P>

Since that time (and in some cases before) member states of the Union have

been developing their own position papers, although few have yet been

formally endorsed as policy in the countries concerned. EU member states

vary in their approach with France and Britain likely to be most supportive

of an extension of the existing arrangements subject to new conditionalities, new approaches to financial resources and the need for

any new trade arrangements to be WTO compatible. The Dutch and to some extent the Germans and the Belgians, seek convergence in EU development and foreign policy. Thus they question the concept of a special relationship

for the ACP, many aspects of the present Treaty and expect that whatever

resources are available will be used in a more efficient and innovative

manner. For their part, Scandinavian nations appear to be placing their

emphasis on aid for the poorest. In common with all EU member states they

see much of the debate focusing on Africa. Separately the European

Parliament wants to see a modernised Lom&#233; after 2000. Despite this, the

opinions of member states are not widely known in the Caribbean, nor has

the region made them aware of its thinking.

<P>

During the latter months of the Dutch presidency, or possibly during the

first months of the Luxembourg presidency, member states will formally

agree a negotiating mandate. This leaves the Caribbean region with little

time in which to determine its position and that of its social partners and

weave this into a Cariforum and then an ACP negotiating mandate.

<P>

There are many pressing issues that cross traditional boundaries between

government and social partners such as the private sector, the trades

unions and environmentalists that need consensus before more technical

questions are considered.

<P>

It is therefore pleasing to learn that the next Caricom intersessional of

heads of government in late February will concentrate on developing a post

Lom&#233; stance for Cariforum, the wider than Caricom group that embraces the

ACP Caribbean. 

<P>

The meeting will have a broad-based agenda but it is to be hoped that the

meeting will address six specific areas requiring a clear and unified

position. These are:

<UL>

<LI>What is the best way to incorporate a region-specific approach into an

ACP negotiating mandate and a post Lom&#233; arrangement? By almost every

measure the Caribbean region's requirements are different from most of its

partners in the ACP. By 2005 the region will be seeking to incorporate

itself together with its partners in the ACS into the FTAA, possibly via

NAFTA parity. This will bring into question the sustainability of any

non-reciprocal or preferential trade arrangements that might be established

with Europe after the year 2000. Changed relationships after 2000 also

raise questions about what Lom&#233; instruments need to be created that specifically benefit the Caribbean as it prepares for transition to open

markets. This is not to argue against maintaining ACP solidarity but to

suggest that the development needs of the Caribbean are likely to be

different to those of its partners in the ACP. As such it points to the

need for new instruments that offer material assistance with transition in

a manner that encourages a region-specific approach and regional

integration.

<P>

<LI>Will a post Lom&#233; arrangement require a new regional political balance

being achieved? Historically the Caribbean beneficiaries of the Lom&#233;

relationship were the nations of Caricom. Today the Dominican Republic,

Haiti and maybe in time Cuba, expect equal treatment from a post Lom&#233;

arrangement. This may change the nature of the region's requirements and

its negotiating stance. It will particularly impact on the development of a

negotiating mandate in respect of trade. A case may have to be developed

for special and differential treatment for the smaller anglophone nations.

How well is the region prepared for this?

<P>

<LI>The post Lom&#233; debate offers the opportunity for the Caribbean to

determine what new instruments it needs. The post Lom&#233; debate offers the

opportunity for the Caribbean to determine what new forms of assistance it

needs. The EC has already indicated that it is prepared to consider new

ideas in respect of the environment, research and development; training;

investment promotion and attraction; finance; and for the private sector

and other social partners. This points to the need for the region to

identify and agree on the nature of existing constraints and future

aspirations and develop an ACP compatible but region-specific range of

future requirements.

<P>

<LI>The private sector's view will be a key component in this process. The

private sector is recognised as being a key element in this process. CAIC,

the rum industry, the rice industry, the sugar industry and by mid-year,

the tourism industry, will have or will shortly have post Lom&#233; positions.

These need to be incorporated into the region's negotiating position in a

manner that ensures that the Caribbean can use post Lom&#233; assistance to

enhance and secure its competitiveness in more open markets. This suggests

that in the post Lom&#233; negotiating process a new balance must be established

in the private sector/public sector relationship.

<P>

<LI>Outside players such as the US and the WTO will need to be considered in

this equation. As events in respect of bananas have clearly shown it is

unlikely that in the late l990s the post 2000 negotiations will be regarded

by the US and others in the benign way of previous Lom&#233; discussions. The

position of the US and others in the WTO or ACS on a successor arrangement

needs to be determined.

<P>

<LI>Beyond this there are many specific issues including: the post Lom&#233;/DOM

relationship with the region; the future requirements of the OCT in the

region; and provisions regarding co-operation with neighbouring states and

most especially, those with Cuba in particular and the ACS in general.

<P></UL>

Resolving these questions will not be easy as they cross the fault lines in

the region which are frequently papered over or ignored. In this respect

the probable presence of the Dominican Republic's farseeing new President,

Leonel Fernandez, at the Caricom intersessional may do much to bring the

new thinking in the Hispanic Caribbean alongside that of Barbados' Prime

Minister, Owen Arthur, as the two appear to share many similar views.

<P>

The meeting may therefore determine whether new thinking or old will

influence the region's future relations with Europe.

<title>USA: Congress Cuts To Funding For Legal Representation For 
Death Row Prisoners Threatens The Right To A Fair Trial And Increases Danger Of Innocents Being Executed</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#oooooo" link="#238e23" vlink="#4a766e">


<br><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="amnesty.html">Amnesty International</a></i>
<hr>
<h3>USA: CONGRESS CUTS TO FUNDING FOR LEGAL REPRESENTATION FOR 
DEATH ROW PRISONERS THREATENS THE RIGHT TO A FAIR TRIAL AND INCREASES DANGER OF INNOCENTS BEING EXECUTED</h3>

The proposed withdrawal of funds by the US Congress for Post- Conviction Defender Organizations (PCDOs), commonly known as Capital Representation Resource Centers, could lead to grossly inadequate representation for death row prisoners, Amnesty International said today.

The current bill before Congress eliminates the $20 million funding for the PCDOs, therefore leaving the majority of the Centers without sufficient funding and forcing their closure.
<p>
"The centers, which currently employ approximately 190 attorneys, represent about half of the United States 3000 death row inmates -- the withdrawal of funding will have the effect of firing half the attorneys representing those on death row," the organization said.
<p>
Amnesty International believes that the chances of those innocent of the crime for which they were sentenced being executed will increase with the demise of the PCDOs. 
<p>
Walter McMillian was sentenced to death in Alabama in 1988. He was represented during the appeals process by staff from the Alabama Capital Resource Center. 
<p>
Walter McMillian was declared innocent and released more than four years after he was originally sentenced. During appeals, the Resource Center staff were able to show that the prosecutor at McMillian's trail suppressed evidence proving his innocence and coerced testimony from trial witnesses. 
<p>
In October 1993 a Congressional report by the House Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights listed 48 condemned prisoners who had been freed from death row since 1972. The report blamed inadequate legal safeguards to prevent wrongful executions and listed numerous flaws in the criminal justice system, including shoddy legal representation. 
<p>
Walter McMillian is just one of the many innocent people who may have been executed but for the representation provided by the PCDOs: the future Walter McMillians may not be so fortunate.
<p>
Amnesty International believes that despite international judicial safeguards, the death penalty is used in an arbitrary and discriminatory manner. Many defendants receive shockingly poor representation at their original trial. 
<p>
"It appears that because many death row inmates have been granted appeals, or had their executions held up for further legal hearings, Congress wishes to abolish the PCDOs as a victim of their own success," Amnesty International said. " Such is the political rush to have more executions in the United States. "
<p>
Amnesty International calls on the US authorities to ensure that those sentenced to death receive legal representation by appropriately trained and skilled lawyers.

"It is           particularly crucial now, in the early stages of vast           technological change, that all governments reaffirm their           commitment to respect the rights of citizens to communicate           freely, and for the United States as the birthplace of the           Internet, to be a model for free speech, not censorship," she           adds. <p>	Human Rights Watch is a plaintiff in the lawsuit brought by           the American Civil Liberties Union challenging the CDA on           constitutional grounds. The hearings end today in Philadelphia,           Pennsylvania.<p>                    In addition, Human Rights Watch is calling on the nations           participating in the G7 Ministerial Conference on the Information           Society and Development to be held in South Africa from May 13-15,           1996, to repudiate the international trend toward censorship and           to express unequivocal support for free expression guarantees           on-line. <p>	Among the G7 countries--Britain, Canada, France, Germany,           Italy, Japan, and the United States--only the U.S. has actually           passed legislation curtailing freedom of expression on-line. The           trend toward restricting on-line communication is growing,           according to <b><a href="hrw/index.html">"Silencing the Net: The Threat to Freedom of           Expression On-line,"</a></b> which documents restrictions that have been           put in place in at least twenty countries, including the           following:<p><ul>                    <li><b>China</b>, which requires users and Internet Service 	Providers           (ISPs) to register with authorities;<br>                    <b><li>Vietnam</b> and <b>Saudi Arabia</b>, which permit only 	a single,           government-controlled gateway for Internet service;<br>                    <b><li>United States</b>, which has enacted new Internet-specific           legislation that imposes more restrictive regulations on           electronic expression than those currently applied to printed           expression;<br>                    <b><li>India</b>, which charges exorbitant rates for international 	access           through the state-owned phone company;<br>                    <b><li>Germany</b>, which has cut off access to particular host 	computers           or Internet sites;<br>                    <b><li> Singapore</b>, which has chosen to regulate the Internet as 	if it           were a broadcast medium, and requires political and religious           content providers to register with the state; and<br>                    <b><li>New Zealand</b>, which classifies computer disks as 	publications and           has seized and restricted them accordingly.</ul><p>                    Human Rights Watch recommends principles for international and           regional bodies and nations to follow when formulating public           policy and laws affecting the Internet, sets forth the           international legal principles governing on-line expression, and,           examines some of the current attempts around the globe to censor           on-line communication.<p>                    <img align=left border=0 hspace=20 vspace=5 width=89 height=34 src="../../owo_pix/new_more.gif"><br><li><b><a href="hrw/index.html">Silencing the Net: The Threat to Freedom of Expression Online</a><br> <font size=2>(the full report)</font></b><br clear=left><br></BLOCKQUOTE> <img width=650 height=1 src="../newsflash_pix/news_line.jpg"><p>    <font size=2>                The 24-page report is available on the Human Rights Gopher: <br><b>URL:          <b><a href="gopher://gopher.humanrights.org:5000/11/int/hrw/general">gopher://gopher.humanrights.org:5000/11/int/hrw/general</a></b><br></b> and on OneWorld Online right <b><a href="hrw/index.html">here</a></b>.          Paper copies of "Silencing the Net" are available from the           Publications Department, Human Rights Watch, 485 Fifth Avenue, 	New York, NY 10017-6104 for $3.60 (domestic), $4.50 (international).           Visa/MasterCard accepted.</font><hr><p>                    <b>Human Rights Watch</b><br>          Human Rights Watch is a nongovernmental organization 	established           in 1978 to monitor and promote the observance of internationally           recognized human rights in Africa, the Americas, Asia, the Middle           East and among the signatories of the Helsinki accords.

<h2>AWARENESS WEEK - 2 - 8 DECEMBER 1996</h2>



Autism Awareness Week (AAW) is a week dedicated to raising awareness of autism and Asperger syndrome. 
Each year we hope to further raise the general level of awareness of autism but specific audiences
are also targetted. This year’s theme for the week is “Beyond Rainman” - a look at how carers of
people with autism cope with the stresses and strains they experience as a result of caring.
<p>

To find out more about these issues, we commissioned a survey which looked at the way in which the
general public perceive autism - what they understand about it and what it involves.  The majority of
the general public did not feel that people with autism receive enough services and support. Many who
had heard of autism were unaware of the main characteristics of the condition  etc  The survey also
contains extracts from interviews with people who have autism. 
<p>

The survey highlights many of the issues that families affected by autism experience.   In addition
there are many events which are being organised around the country which will help to heighten
awareness of autism.

<h1>CAMPAIGN UPDATE:</h1>

<b>Progress with retailers as of June 22:</b><br> 
<b>M&S:</b> has acknowledged contact with Oxfam, but no meeting has been arranged. An M&S spokeswoman said that a meeting would 'depend on how things developed in the future.'<br>
<b>C&A:</b> Oxfam met with John Greene, head of corporate communications, in May. According to Clothes Code campaign co-ordinator, Shelagh Young, the meeting with C&A was 'positive' and that C&S's new code of conduct initiative for suppliers was 'a step in the right direction.' Gail Pilling, C&A’s UK corporate communications manager, said all buyers were responsible for ensuring suppliers met required standards and added: 'the meeting was amicable and we spoke about the concerns that Oxfam has.'<p>


Very constructive meetings with Sears and Burtons have taken place, and Gail now will have follow-up meetings.  Oxfam will meet with the Club Executive at Next in August.<p>


<b>It is now more important than ever for you to hand in <a href="coupon.html">coupons</a> and write <a href="letter.html">letters</a>. Your letters and coupons will help convince all retailers to carry on talking to Oxfam. Thanks for all the letters sent and coupons handed in so far. You are the power behind the campaign!</b><p>

<b><FONT SIZE=6>Dear Head of Customer Services</font></b><br>


I am extremely concerned to hear that many people making clothes sold in the UK work very long hours in unsafe - even dangerous - factories, on rates of pay which exploit the poor. do you have a code of conduct protecting clothing workers - a set of minimum standards that guaranteed humane factory conditions? And if so, could you explain how you make sure it is always implemented?
<p>

I believe that retailers are in a position of responsibility, and have considerable influence over suppliers' work practices.
<p>

Please help secure basic rights for people working in the clothes industry.

Civil Service Reform: Editorial</h3>

by <i>Stanley Please</i>

<p>

Full text of an article from <i>DPMN Bulletin, 2(3) December 1994: pages 2-3</i>

<hr>

"In many countries of sub-Saharan Africa, the ineffectiveness of the civil service threatens

almost all development efforts as well as basic public administration." This quote from

Mamadou Dia of the World Bank expresses the concern that underlies all of the contributions

to this issue of the Bulletin.

<p>

But it is not a concern which is limited to Africa. This is brought out very clearly by Kaul in his

review of recent experience with civil service reform in Commonwealth countries including the

United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, India, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Hong Kong, Singapore,

Trinidad and Tobago, as well as Ghana and Zambia. The reforms have sprung from a variety of

political and economic causes at both the macro and micro levels. Thus there have been major

changes in views regarding the most effective role for the state in the economy, and at the micro

level questions have been asked about the most efficient manner in which public services can

be delivered while also investigating possibilities to commercialise government departments and

work with the private sector and NGO's.

<p>

But it is with African countries that the contributors are predominantly concerned. For it is in

Africa that a complex of factors has led to a situation in which almost all countries have civil

services which are widely judged, first, to be far too large in terms of numbers employed,

second, to be excessively costly in terms of budgetary outlays, and, third, to be inefficient in

terms of delivering the public services which countries require. During the 1980's, and largely

under the external influence of the IMF and the World Bank, it was the first two of these

problems which were the primary focus of attention. Cost containment was the major objective

although, as Yahaya points out, some attention was given to the efficiency issue.

<p>

It is interesting that, in contrast to the 1980's, all contributors to this Bulletin virtually ignore the

first two problems of excessively high employment levels in the civil service and excessively

high budgetary costs. This is certainly not because the actions taken in the 1980's effectively

dealt with these problems. While considerable 'down-sizing' did in fact take place in some

countries (e.g. Ghana, Central African Republic, Guinea, Mauritania, Uganda) in others staff

actually increased (e.g. C“te d'Ivoire, Malawi, Niger, Tanzania). Moreover none of the

significant reductions which had been expected in the budgetary cost of the civil service occurred

even where staff numbers were reduced.

<p>

What these contributions seem to reflect is that during the 1990's the focus of attention in the

discussion of civil service reform has switched overwhelmingly to the third problem namely that

of the efficiency of the service. Not only is this because the focus on numbers and cost is now

seen to have been too restrictive. What is of greater importance is that an efficient civil service

delivering a high quantity and quality of public services, is now seen as a necessary condition

for generating a more rapid rate of economic and human development. As Corkery emphasises

"apart from the importance of the state in providing basic services of law, order and justice,

defence, infrastructure, education, and health," it is now recognised much more widely and

strongly than in the 80's, that "for the institutions of the free market to work, government

institutions must also work." 

<p>

It is in this context that Corkery and Fofana review experience with civil service reform

programmes in Anglophone and Francophone countries respectively. It is of interest that they

both come to roughly the same conclusions regarding the priority conditions for success in

implementing these programmes. Three of these stand out: (i) ensuring the commitment of

government both in words and in establishing technically and politically strong institutional

machinery for undertaking reforms; (ii) ensuring the commitment of civil servants themselves

through regular management-union machinery but also through other channels; and, (iii)

ensuring the participation of civil society.

<p>

What is also of interest following the Corkery and Fofana papers, is that Rasheed's contribution

on "Ethics and Accountability in the African Civil Service" also emphasises the importance of

civil society in civil service reform. His paper presents a balanced but hard-hitting statement of

the critical importance to be attached to eliminating the "outright bribery and corruption, the

patronage, nepotism, .... moonlighting, absenteeism, abuse of public property" which have

"become so pervasive and even institutionalised norms of behaviour in Africa that one may

speak of a crisis of ethics in African public services." His analysis of the deep causes of this

crisis leads him to conclusions which focus on issues of recruitment, of training including

training in professional values and public service, and of establishing codes of conduct and

effectively implementing them. In addition, his conclusions, as with Fofana, emphasise the need

for "mass education campaigns," "establishing coalitions of business associations and other

organisations to expose and fight corruption," and in general to mobilise civil society and to

"foster popular participation to ensure the responsiveness, accountability and transparency of

governancy."

<p>

Rasheed also takes developed countries to task for the active and initiating role which their

businessmen play in the bribing of officials in Africa. Moreover, he does not exempt their

governments from these strictures, many of which he sees as ignoring or even condoning corrupt

practices in the interests of export objectives -- some even making bribes tax deductible.

Transparency International he sees as a good beginning in "raising the alarm" on this set of

issues. However, he very correctly argues for international conventions to be drawn up to ensure

greater transparency in transactions and to punish those engaged in corrupt practices.

<p>

Yahaya concentrates his attention on the issue of training that is identified by the other

contributors as an important element of civil service reform. He distinguishes between previous

attempts at reform in Africa which focussed exclusively on the training of civil servants to

provide a Weberian 'rational bureaucracy' from the new conception of reform that focusses on

"building a capacity for good governance." This concept embraces not only the civil service itself

but its relationship with the private sector and with civil society more generally. Yahaya then

outlines the seminars, training programmes, and other activities which will be organised by the

centres of policy analysis and management training which the Commonwealth Secretariat,

UNECA and AAPAM are jointly establishing in six Francophone, Anglophone and Lusophone

countries.

<p>

What is clear from these papers is that governments throughout Africa are now fully aware of

their need to create more efficient and highly motivated civil services on which they can depend

for the formulation and implementation of policies and programmes and more generally for the

effective administration of their countries. Moreover, the papers also demonstrate that reform

programmes to reflect this awareness have already been initiated.

<p>

What has to be questioned is whether governments themselves are showing the degree of

urgency which the situation requires or whether, indeed, the contributors to this Bulletin are

expressing this urgency sufficiently strongly. There is obviously a fine balance to be drawn in

this regard. As Corkery emphasises, reform measures which are introduced too precipitately can

easily backfire because they are in danger of being both inadequately prepared and inadequately

discussed with the representatives of civil servants and of civil society. Building constituencies

for reforms within countries is a message which comes across strongly and its importance cannot

be denied. Certainly reform measures imposed by the Bretton Woods institutions, as they

frequently were during the 1980's, and which are not 'owned' domestically, seem doomed to

failure.

<p>

However, the distortions which have arisen in African economies since independence are so deep

that only major reforms sustained over many years and with adequate external assistance, will

be able to address them and thereby generate rates of economic growth which at least keep up

with rates of population growth of three per cent or more. The fundamental distortion since

independence has arisen from the discrimination against agriculture and industry in pricing,

fiscal, exchange rate, and other policies. Thus the only buoyant labour market for young people

coming out of schools and colleges, has been public employment in the civil service, teaching,

and other services. It was in these services, moreover, that trade unions developed which

reinforced the interests of their employees as against those of people engaged in agriculture and

in industry.

<p>

This distortion in income-earning opportunities was not seen in most other developing countries

of the world. It led in Africa, amongst other problems, to a budgetary problem in which 40 per

cent or more of government expenditure was on wages and salaries as contrasted with a

proportion nearer to 25 per cent for other developing countries.

<p>

Some of this discrimination has been removed over the past decade or so by economic reform

measures undertaken often as part of structural adjustment programmes. But the plight of civil

servants particularly in some ex 'disaster' countries such as Uganda and Mozambique should not

be permitted to hide the continuing discrimination in favour of public sector workers in many

other African countries, both Francophone and Anglophone. Much still remains to be done.

<p>

Unfortunately, however,  the economic reform measures have themselves created a problem for

civil service reform because they have resulted in declines or inadequate rates of economic

growth throughout most of Africa. Thus the job opportunities for redundant civil servants or for

new entrants from schools and colleges to the labour market, have not been available in any

significant numbers in agriculture or in industry.

<p>

The hope must now be that, having started down the road of civil service reform, countries will

sustain and speed up these reform programmes. Building up constituencies of support, as argued

in many of the contributions, will be important. But, at the end of the day, disciplined and

politically courageous action by governments is inevitable. This is particularly the case where

strong vested interests in favoured but inefficient institutions fail to give adequate support to the

more rapid introduction of reform measures.

<p>

In his contribution, Rasheed emphasises the need for a "comprehensive agenda" for civil service

reform. To his agenda can be added the fact that if these reforms are to be more willingly

accepted and successfully implemented, they must be matched by macro-economic programmes

which generate a more buoyant economy and labour market.

<p>

This is not simply a matter for national governments. If the IMF and the World Bank are as

committed as they say they are, to economic reform programmes to remove distortions in

institutions and policies including those in the public service, they should recognise that these

programmes must be matched by growth-oriented macro- economic policies. Macro-financial

discipline is essential for sound economic policies. But this has to be differentiated from

continuous belt-tightening.

<p>

It is only in an expanding economy that civil service reform will become more acceptable. It is,

moreover, only in such an environment that the whole raison d'ˆtre of civil service reform will

be achieved, namely to contribute to a higher rate of economic growth and of human resource

development in Africa.

GREENPEACE GETS UP PEOPLE'S NOSES. Founded in Vancouver in 1971, the organization
exploded into inter-national prominence and mass membership when the French
Secret Service bombed its ship <i>Rainbow Warrior</i> in Auckland in 1985. Its
direct confrontation of the huge and impersonal forces that threaten the
world's safety has often led to accusations of publicity hunger. Certainly
Greenpeace has always been aware of the power of the daring stunt and the
single image to attract attention and inspire - those tiny dinghies
confronting the monster warship USS Eisenhower (bottom); the stark anticipation
of Ken Saro-Wiwa's execution in Nigeria (left). <BR>
<BR>
But why should the Devil have all the best images? Greenpeace's daring and
media-grasp have helped inspire a new generation of direct-activists. And
it is a token of their success that when France restarted its nuclear tests
in the Pacific last year the protests were not left to a lonely Greenpeace
boat but exploded all over the world - not least on the rioting streets
of Tahiti .	<BR clear=all><center>

Basistekst :<br>

<a href= "7etltc.htm">1.Tractatus Logico Tragi-Comicus </a> (of 'TLTC', 1992, 245p, Engels) <br><br>

De TLTC is de Engelse basislexicon (hoeksteen) -begonnen in 1986- waarin de krachtlijn van het nog uit te werken materiaal losjes geaxiomatiseerd werd. In 1996 wordt de tekst herwerkt & met afzonderlijke commentaren aangevuld.<br>  

<br>

Kern : een 8-dimensioneel model van onze Kosmos bestuurd door 3 onafhankelijke, niet herleidbare maar centraliserende meta-entropische operatoren, te weten : Bewustzijn (C), Informatie (I) en Materie (M). Studie van axiomata van 'prima materia', logica, esthetica en ethica. Werkdefinities en algemene uitgangspunten. Basissleutels voor een comparatieve filosofie. Grondschema voor een toekomstige kosmologie & theologie.<br><br>  

<a href="7nstuurk.htm">2.Naar een Stuurkundige Antropologie </a>(1993, 113p)<br><br>  

'Conventioneel' mensbeeld dat op eclectische wijze de cognitieve genese (J.Piaget) van  de 4 'nominale' dimensies functionalistisch onderzoekt rekening houdend met de

ideeën van S.Freud, L.Kohlberg & A.Maslow.<br><br>

3) Codex Eroticus (1993, 41p, Engels) #<br><br>

Logica van de liefde. De 'codices' zijn teksten die direct aansluiten bij de TLTC (op elke pagina bevinden zich concordantiegetallen).<br><br>

4) Codex Diabolicus (1993, 11p, Engels) #<br><br>

Logica van de haat. In tegenstelling met het (rooms) katholiek dogma wordt er gepleit voor een infernale metafysica waarin 'de duivel' mythisch gesproken op het einde der tijden (wanneer het 'Jubileum der Jubilea' of 'apokatastasis' gevierd wordt) door God volledig & onomkeerbaar opgenomen (vergeven) wordt.<br><br>

<a href="7nesthet.htm">5) Aanzet tot een Esthetica van het voortreffelijk Exemplarische & het Sublieme daaraan voorbij </a>(1993, 72p)<br><br> 

Esthetica geïnspireerd op 't Kantiaans exemplarisme, gericht op een sublieme integratie van harmonisatie (orde) & disharmonisatie (chaos).<br><br> 

<a href ="7nmystic.htm">6) Kennis en Minne-mystiek </a>(1994, 416p)<br><br>

Over de minne bij Beatrijs van Nazareth, de mystieke kennismanipulatie en haar strikt negatieve & symbolische theologie. Voorzien van o.m. a) een algemene & middellijke studie van de context van de Vlaamse mystiek, b) een commentaar en kritiek op Beatrijs' verhandeling & c) een studie van de totaliserende mentale operatoren die de contemplatie & de Godschouwing begeleiden.<br><br>

en rationaliteit. Vooroefening op 'Kennis, Chaos & Metafysica'.<br><br>

<a href="7ededeo.htm">9) De Deo </a>(1995, 10p)<br><br>

Korte samenvatting van de grondaxiomata van de gehanteerde apofatische theologie die aansluit bij de qabalah. Centraal is het onderscheid tussen enerzijds de onkenbare

God die niet geschapen is en schept en anderzijds de kenbare Schepper die geschapen is en schept en die zich als een Triniteit (Vader, Zoon en H.Geest) te kennen geeft.<br><br>

10) Kennis, Chaos & Metafysica (volume 1) (1995, 456p)<br><br>

Volume 1 : <a href="7nkennis.htm">Kennis</a><br>

Bedoeling is om aan een gematigd, postmoderne epistemologie gestalte te geven die resulteert in de methodologie van de verfijnd participerende observatie. Overzicht van de Westerse metafysica en criteria voor een geldige immanente & transcendente metafysica. Dit werk werd voorafgegaan door de Prolegomena, 1994.<br><br>

11) Remarks about Death & Resurrection (1994 &  1996, 49p, Engels) #<br><br>

Enkele reflecties over de dood, de rol van Jezus Christus, de constitutie van de mens, de onsterfelijkheid van zijn ziel, de reïncarnatie, de verrijzenis & de spirituele taak van Satan.<br><br>

<FONT size="+2">Z</FONT>odra er voldoende tekst beschikbaar was (2300pp eind 1995), werd er gedacht aan een metaniveau. Dit noemen we het 'pneuma' van het stelsel. Het betreft o.m. een kritiek op het beschikbaar & het nog steeds groeiend tekstlichaam vanuit diverse invalshoeken (o.m.  psychoanalytisch, structuralistisch, deconstructief en autobiografisch).<br><br> 

Dit Pneuma Equiaeon is medebepalend voor de verdere uitbouw van het Corpus. Het moet er o.m. voor zorgen dat alle fundamentalistische, lineaire neigingen die mogelijk van de tekst uitgaan, radicaal door <a href= "7nstuurk.htm"> decentrering </a>& <a href= "7ephilo.htm#crit">deconstructie </a>ondermijnd worden. Er wordt verwacht dat tegen het eind van 1996 het reeds beschikbaar Corpusmateriaal pneumatisch verwerkt werd, alsook dat er met de autokritiek van start werd gegaan. <br><br>

<FONT size="+2">H</FONT>et aanbieden van deze <a href= "7ephilo.htm#sys">milde postmoderne wijsbegeerte </a>aan de wereldgemeenschap via Internet is het Zelf-niveau van het stelsel. Immers, geen enkel menselijk creatief werk ontstaat "ex nihilo". Voortdurend moet een auteur communiceren wil hij/zij op de actuele problematiek inspelen. Internet biedt op dat vlak ongeziene mogelijkheden, want er kan globaal-participatief gewerkt worden in een gedecentraliseerd netwerk van een quasi oneindig aantal dynamische verbindingen. Dit netwerk heeft meer weg van organische structuren (vgl. met Gaudi) dan van <a href= "7ephilo.htm#mod">de moderne monolieten</a>, de filosofie van de rechte hoek & de thermodynamische dood en de stimulus-respons-psychologie van de gesloten doos (black box). <br><br>

We nodigen iedereen uit om <a href= "emailong.htm">te reageren op te teksten </a>die hier beschikbaar zijn. De verdere uitbouw van het stelsel zal zo door de interacties op Zelf-niveau (door, met en in de wereldgemeenschap van tekengebruikers) mede bepaald worden. <br><br>Niettegenstaande in de commerciële 'new age'-beweging het accent meestal op individuele verworvenheden wordt gelegd, en het Zelf daar als het meest eigene van eenieder wordt ingeschat, is dit een éénzijdige voorstelling. <b>Feit is dat wij het meeste hebben gekregen en dat de intersubjectieve interactie ons bewustzijn mede mogelijk maakt</b>. Zelfs in de terminologie van bijvoorbeeld Assagioli is het duidelijk dat het 'hoger' Zelf <I>door een Goddelijke Vonk geanimeerd wordt</I>. Deze Vonk komt van de Schepper, niet van het individu. Dat sommige interacties van het <a href="consc.htm">bewustzijn </a>zich niet uitsluitend op de 'nominale' bewustzijnsdimensies afspelen, verandert daar niets aan. Dat personen individueren door met hun eigen hoger Zelf in contact te treden, neemt niet weg dat waarheid, schoonheid, goedheid & geluk niet uitsluitend door individueel werk kunnen worden gevonden. De individuatie lukt immers enkel wanneer de mens zich gevat weet <I>in iets of iemand dat hem overstijgt, voedt & begeesterd (spirituele geborgenheid)</I>. <b>In dit zin is het Zelf-niveau van ons stelsel van christelijke denominatie</b>. Het leeft door de reacties van & interacties met anderen op een liefdevolle, authentieke wijze op te nemen en te verwerken in het licht van hogere geestelijke aspiraties. Geen enkele zingevende wijsbegeerte trappelt in de lucht. Ze ontstaat steeds door met anderen voor de Andere in het groter geheel te kunnen & willen participeren.<br><br>

<a name="spira"><hr><h3>Spira Equiaeon</a></h3><hr><br>

<FONT size="+2">O</FONT>nder 'Spira' verstaan we de innerlijke 'kronkels' van het stelsel. Immers, elk denksysteem heeft conclusies. Ondanks de virulente deconstructieve pneumatische kritiek moet een wijsbegeerte uiteindelijk <b>iets vertellen over oorsprong, zin & finaliteit van het menselijk bestaan</b>. 'Van waar komen wij ?' 'Wie zijn wij ?' 'Naar waar gaan wij ?' Een denken dat niet verder komt dan kritiek is in die zin waardeloos. De zaken dan omkeren en beweren dat de wijsbegeerte  geen geldig antwoord op deze fundamentele levensvragen kan articuleren is hypocriet. In dat geval geeft met beter toe <b>dat men er niet is uitgekomen</b>.<br><br>Het hedendaags 'modern' sciëntisme alsook <a href= "7ephilo.htm#log">de radicale postmodernen </a>beantwoorden deze cruciale vragen steeds vaker met : 'We weten het niet.' <br><br>Heeft de moderne wetenschapsgodsdienst het geluk van de mens op Aarde verbeterd ? Klonk het 'credo' niet veelbelovend ? Gegeven onze wereldproblemen is het nuttig om in te zien dat de moderne wetenschappen de realiteit niet meester zijn. Hun paradigma '<I>schijn</I>werkt' immers enkel in de 'zwarte doos' (black box) die -zo doet men ons geloven- de gehele werkelijkheid zou voorstellen. Dit is echter niet het geval. De werkelijkheid is veel rijker dan de 'nature morte' van de moderne 'rechte hoek'. Wordt de mens wederom door een elite bedrogen ? Is de massale hoeveelheid geld die in dergelijke lieden werd & wordt gestoken in overeenstemming met <b>hun relevantie voor de kosmos, de planeet Aarde of de menselijke gemeenschap</b> ? Zijn strengere criteria voor de selectie van dergelijke hooggeschoolden alsook een groter rotatiesnelheid bij afwezigheid van <b>moreel verantwoordbare creatieve resultaten</b> is heden ten dage méér dan noodzakelijk.

<a name="def"><hr><h3>One and Many Definitions ?</a></h3><hr><br>

<FONT size="+2">N</FONT>umerous definitions of philosophy exist. According to some philosophy can not be defined without the use of dialectics involving one or more contradictions, for Man himself IS the longing for wisdom. Being the soul of culture & science, the heart of religions & churches and the core of morality & ethics, philosophy <b>can not be described from one particular outside perspective</b>. Philosophy should be compared, in this Hegelian scheme, with her own specialized utterances in science, art, morality & religion.<br>

<br> 

The distinction between philosophy and <b>the logistics of philosophy</b> or 'academical philosophy' is interesting. Although according to Hume academical philosophical knowledge may be useful, we understand authentic philosophy to serve a more vital purpose, i.e. the leap from certain living (natural) knowledge to a revealed (intuitive) wisdom. What German philosophy calls "Wissen" is indeed a non-verbal, unknowing knowledge conjuring <b>the presence of a sense of being within consciousness.</b><br><br> For rationalists like Wolff this special intuitive knowledge is the result of an <b>intellectual perception</b>, i.e. a direct insight into the operations of thought, devoid of sensoric and conceptual input (a Western prototype of "method of union", cfr. Eastern "yoga" ?). In this way a panoramic view may be acquired. However, this non-verbal insight is rooted in <b>a systematical & methodical natural knowledge</b> (cfr. Maimonides) which tried to explain Being as-such (immanent & transcendent metaphysics). Without this natural knowledge our intuitions stand alone and are not serving the ultimate extension & unity of our minds (cfr. Kant). So although we accept the possibility of intuition we do not accept its autonomy. This is certainly the case when the philosophical investigation of Being reveals continuous change to be the core of existence.<br>

<br>

<a name="philo">In</a> the Introduction of the <a href="7etltc.htm">Tractatus Logico Tragi-Comicus</a> the following ideas appears : <br><br><I>"Philosophy (or love of wisdom) aims to attain a pure intuition & an authentic understanding built upon multi-rational knowledge. Philosophical insight (its wisdom) results from a recurrent & multiple transference between reason (logos) & intuition (arché, eidos)."</I><br>

<br>A pure intuition, the beginning of wisdom, is the goal of philosophy. The parameters of purity are defined by understanding, So authentic understanding (longing for wisdom through purity) is the rock upon which philosophy is built. The laws of purity are not to be found outside consciousness. They derive from the perception of consciousness of its own mental, emotional & actional operations. In infancy the mirror-image of 'my' physical body caused this sense of 'me', which I called 'I' or 'ego' (cfr. Lacan). Of the circular space of early semiotic functions this 'I' is the center. Likewise, when thought learns how to consider itself by itself, a <b>transcendental 'I'</b> emerges in consciousness. The circular ego-consciousness is transformed into an elliptic consciousness oscillating between 'I' & the 'transcendental I', finally encompassing both (transfiguration). Authentic understanding or philosophical insight is always reaching towards wisdom by allowing <b>all possible interactions between both approaches of our physical brain</b>, i.e. digital, linear, sequential & verbal versus analogous, chaotic, parallel & non-verbal.<br><br> Philosophy starts with natural rational knowledge  and -when optimalized- results from the stern training of a rational mind focussed on <bthe global, universal, cosmic 'meaning' of humanity. </b>Its method & system is the first object of epistemology.<br><br> Wisdom is what happens after glimpses of the first & final causal  scheme of things emerged in consciousness as the totality (Gestalt, mandala) of Being. Our natural talents will not suffice to allow consciousness to contemplate All long enough to leave conscious operational traces in the best trained minds. Sometimes a total loss of unity is the reaction-form created to compensate for awesome monadic experiences. Surely 'academical' philosophers should be made conscious of this. Fieldwork remains necessary.<br><br> Wisdom is the free state arrived at when the monad is permanently present in the 'now' of consciousness. When -in Husserl's words- the 'natural state' has been completely, through <b>the method of bracketing</b>, put out of action, i.e. <b>all concerns for spatio-temporal existence (Dasein) have been eliminated</b>, then and only then 'a new region of Being' (Sosein) may by won. Wisdom implies abstention. For what can remain over when the world, we & our thinking have been bracketed ? <br><br>

<a name="sys"><hr><h3>A Mild Postmodern System* of Philosophy ? </a></h3><hr><br>

Postmodernism is the name given to a mutli-cultural movement which for the moment  <b>has not been completely understood nor implemented</b>. It was Joseph Hudnut who, at Harvard with modernist Walter Gropius, introduced it into architecture. In an article published in 1945 he spoke of 'the post-modern house'. Lyotard, introducing this notion in contemporary philosophical discourse with his book 'The Postmodern Condition : A Report on Knowledge' (1979), proposed that his own commitment to this new and emergent movement be grasped as a reaffirmation of the authentic modernism (to be found in Adorno's philosophy). So in fact he is pro-modernist !  Some claim postmodernism to be the 'avant-garde' of the modernism of the XXIth century (Eco), others say that by depending too much upon a 'subjectivist' non-social conception of rationality it moves towards irrationalism (Habermas). For the latter the Enlightenment is indispensable. <br><br>'Postmodernism' is still in the process of being born. Its truths are culture-dependent and grow in time. At present is it a hybrid philosophy and world view <b>dialectically involved with modernism</b>. But, most parameters of postmodernism have not as yet been established. Nevertheless, here we do not grasp it as a intermediary phase towards a new type of modernism. Like Wolfe, Jencks and others, <b>we understand postmodernism to be basically anti-modernist</b>, which does not imply a regression into pre-modernism for the whole of modernism should not be rejected. However, the rhetorical tropes celebrated by modernism like 'logical consistency', 'analytical reason', 'straightforwardness', 'simplicity', 'justification', 'system', 'proof' with the exclusion of 'holism', 'interdisciplinary approaches' & the 'interconnectivity of knowledge' are rejected as such. The sterile division between 'human sciences' and 'natural sciences' is questioned and replaced by the triad <a href = "consc.htm">consciousness</a>, <a href= "informat.htm">information</a> & <a href="matter.htm">matter</a>. Jenck's definition of postmodernism as "double coding" is interesting (cfr. 'The Language of Post-Modern Architecture', 1984). The combination of modern techniques with "something else" which does take into account history and which is able to communicate with its users is indeed typical for the postmodern approach (cfr. Cahoone, L. (edit) : 'From Modernism to Postmodernism', Blackwell - Oxford, 1996). <br><br>The distinction between 'radical postmodernism' and 'mild postmodernism' is justified on the grounds of <b>the argumentative weakness of both Lyotard's 'paralogy' or Derrida's 'deconstruction'</b>. Habermas & others are right in pointing out that Lyotard's view on rationality is defunct. For some logical rules are necessary a priori. Transcendental object & subject can not be eliminated from thought and so constitute <b>the groundless ground of knowledge, i.e. a continuity</b>. Stressing discontinuity does not desolve continuity. Nor is continuity interesting & revealing without discontinuity. In the same spirit, let us ask : Who will deconstruct deconstruction ? How did deconstruction emerge ? From Derrida's mind ? Is -like Feyerabend's "anything goes"- <b>deconstruction not a metaphore for the last outpost of a philosophy of language -initiated by Wittgenstein- unable to shape a plausible theory on language</b>? A mild postmodernist is aware of the necessities implied by transcendental logic, without however falling into the trap of either metaphysical realism or idealism. Nor is s/he inclined to deny the rules of logic, i.e. the same rules needed to negate its unconditional importance.<br><br>    

Nor do we claim (as Jameson did) postmodernism to be the 'cultural logic of late capitalism'. The logic of late capitalism (or late socialism) and classical modernism are one and the same. Is 'classical modernism' not a destructive & necrophilic expression of defunct modern ideals and fundamentalistic 'big stories' articulated a couple of centuries ago ? The  XXth century has seen the offspring of these illusions, resulting in massive destruction, misery & death (although our technology enables us to reshape Earth into a paradise for all of humanity). It is time to use modern technology without mechanizing or digitalizing our humanity (which modernism did by placing technological materialism on the altar of our souls). A technology <b>which does not pollute, serving the whole of humanity, is a workable postmodern standard of mechanization</b>. For modern technology walked hand in hand with <b>an erroneous belief in permanent growth.</b> As in our postmodernism a global <b>sustainable dynamical equilibrium</b> is the goal, technological science should be demystified and secularized. In Western philosophy today, a theory on sustainable dynamical equilibria (authoring different objective & subjective conditions) is the main issue. So the first phase of postmodernism is <b>an open & polite deconstrucion of most 'classical' modern standards of approach.</b> In this way the original features of postmodernism may slowly be apprehended. In the following phases <b>the true name</b> of this new cultural movement will ensue. Tantamount however to an agreement on the fundamental nature of some decisive break between the modern and the postmodern is  a general acceptance of this new term. <br><br> 

Some of the difficult ramifications of postmodernism are discussed in volume I, 'Knowledge' (1995) of the book 'Knowledge, Chaos & Metaphysics' and the 'Prolegomena' (1994) to that book. Readers able to understand Dutch are referred to our <a href="7nfilo.htm">Dutch Section</a>. For the moment the following conclusions will help our English readers understand what is meant by 'mild' postmodernism.<br>

<h3><a name ="mod">How did modernism evolve ?</a></h3>Is it not very important to know that modernism, taken as a historical phenomenon, has itself gone through several stages ? In 'Knowledge, Chaos & Metaphysics' six stages were characterized as follows : <br><br>The <b>rise</b> of the Modern Ideal :<br><br><li>

1.<b>Humanism</b> (starting with the Renaissance) : <br>

a) a non-radical, nominalistic denial of the conceptual realism of scholasticism;<br>

b) observation, experiment & a 'bricoleur'-mentality which derive from the individual ; <br>c) focussed on solving practical problems ;</li><br><br><li>

2.<b>Rationalism</b> of Nature in the XVIIthe century : <br>

a) mathematical quest for the final foundation of knowledge in a clear, distinct, continuous, certain & absolute sufficient ground ;<br>

b) systematic observation & formalization of facts ; <br>

c) focussed on a closed, knowledge-founding & dualistic worldview & antropology ; </li><br><br><li>

3.<b>Empirism</b> of Nature in the XVIIIthe century :<br>

a) mathematical certainty & impressions are the foundation of knowledge (phenomenism) ; <br>b) systematic observation & its formalization ;<br>

c) sceptic agnosticism which undermines positive science, scholastic & natural philosophical metaphysics ;</li><br><br><li>

4.<b>Criticism</b> at the end of the XVIIIthe century :<br>

a) transcendental quest for the objective boundaries of intellect (Verstand) & reason (Vernunft) in the subject of knowledge ;<br>

b) 'Copernican Revolution' : Man imposes Nature his own a priori-categories ;<br>

c) focussed on a new, scientific metaphysics which does not move beyond the boundaries necessary for our intellect to function properly ;</li><br><br>

The <b>fall </b>of the Modern Ideal :<br><br>

<li>5.<b>Technologicism</b> from 1850 till Worldwar I :<br>

a) metaphysics & theology are negative values, facts are positive (Comte) ;<br>

b) 'sense-data' are the foundation of knowledge & emergent materialism ;<br>

c) a definite movement towards a new 'scientific' class & its logical-postivist monolith ;<br></li><br>

<li>6.<b>Institutionalism</b> from 1945 till early '70 :<br>

a) rapid global divulgation of the 'black box'-model ; <br>

b) valid knowledge is tested & consensual : scientific elitarism ; <br>

c) focussed on the metaphysics of permanent scientific discovery & material growth !

<br><br><h3><a name="log">Has postmodernism a particular logic ?</a></h3>

<li>The 'logic' of postmodernism can be found in the texts of Lyotard, Rorty, Foucault, Derrida, although the latter (often called a poststructuralist) does not use the term to define his views. This 'logic' is very unformal but analytically sharp. It is refined & grotesk. Derrida introduced so-called 'deconstruction' into Western philosophical thought. For Derrida, <b>Western thought as a whole is a philosophy of presence</b>. Socrates, who inspired Plato when the latter wrote the first Western philosophical texts did not write. However, because Plato listened to Socrates and textualized his words, Socrates is said to be present in our minds when we read Plato's text (we, not present when Socrates was uttering his own words !). The text refers to something outside the text itself. This presence is summoned up by the text to sustain a mental mechanism through which a certain conscious unity of the text and the presence outside the text is realized. Spoken words are considered as symbols of mental experiences and written words are the symbols of spoken words (cfr. Aristotle). This logocentrism is also a phonocentrism : absolute proximity of voice and being, of voice and meaning of being, of voice and the ideality of meaning. Derrida does not reject this philosophy of presence. Because his deconstruction takes place 'in the margin' of its mayor texts, it seems that presence & absence form a pair. Deconstruction takes place in a consciousness aware of the pair, of this formidable difference between the so-called presence of being in texts and the absence of the being of the man Plato knew, Socrates. Derrida answers : there is nothing outside the text.

<br><br>(In our view modernism is an example of an exclusivism of presence.)<br><br>

Logocentricm is a determination of the being of an object as presence. In this way linguistics remains completely enclosed within a classical conceptuality in which false exits occur, i.e. a transcendental signified. By marking these in a text (for example by adding an asterix*) one menaces the history and the life of the spirit of self-presence, one menaces substantiality. For by allowing the text to summon a presence outside the text we delude ourselves by creating a fiction through the medium of that book, programme or film. So although deconstruction does not interfere with the summoning of the spirit of identity, it adds little notes in the margin of the text. In these a remark is made which shows how a hidden passage was taken in this or that passage of the text. These passages taken together suggest a meta-level of meaning delimitation, unnoticed strands of hidden variables which -after analysis- prove to contain infinite reiterations, with unexpected & unparallelled complexities. Otherwise these remain absent. Has Heidegger's conception of thruth after "die Kehre" as "a-lethèia", i.e. both unhidden & hidden inspired Derrida ? Two conclusion at the close of modernism are really consensual : most questions remain open & the human kingdom is still ignorant. <br><br>

By understanding the importance of the difference between presence and absence one may become aware of the word-ontology characterizing Western philosophy. Perhaps the real thing is not made present by words ?<br><br>

For more information on deconstruction see our two <b>Dutch texts </b>on epistemology (for which translators are sought) : <a href="7nproleg.htm">Prolegomena (1994)</a> & <a href= "7nkennis.htm"> Knowledge, Chaos & Metaphysics, volume 1 : Knowledge (1995).</a></li><br><br>

<li><a name= "crit">The criticism of our mild postmodern position :</a><br><br>

a) discarts a discourse in which knowledge is eternalized ;<br>

b) stresses a pluralistic, faillibilistic & multidisciplinary approach of rationality instead of a one-dimensional model ; <br> 

c) avoids a vision of science in which the uniqueness of scientific knowledge -when considering the different ways to organize society- is stressed ;<br>

d) replaces the confrontational dialectics between science & metaphysics with the idea that metaphysics can not be eliminated without hurting the scientific ideal, i.e. information of which one can say that is 'true' knowledge ;<br>

e) avoids the foundational approach in which all 'true' knowledge has a sufficient ground (in experimental data and/or in theoretical constructs) ;<br>

f) confirms the Piagetian theory that cognitive growth is the result of conceptual conflict (between an individual & his intellectual peers) rather than conceptual similarity (between individuals).</li><br><br>

<li>In our opinion scientific knowledge is related to 2 of 3 approaches to the one reality :</li><br><br>

a) <b>reality-for-me</b> (the personal approach) : can be known by experiencing & conceptualizing the constituants of my own personal experience ; <br>

b) <b>reality-for-us</b> (the intersubjective approach) : can be known by conceptualizing the constituants of the experience of reality shared with others through facts (experiment) hand in hand with dialogue (and if necessary argumentation) ;<br>

c) <b>reality-as-such</b> (the transcendent approach) : has to be postulated as 'knowable' without us being able to encompass it with our minds, implying that the facts (considered as revealing this absolute, one reality) have always to be thought off as open to further corrections. Reality-as-such is the object of a transcent metaphysics*, moving beyond the limits imposed upon our intellects (or scientific minds). Science is not equipped to enter this realm of the absolute order of things. Transcent metaphysics* implies a non-verbal & unknowing intuitive insight* into the order of things-as-such. <br>

<h3>How to structure our Mild Postmodern Philosophy ?</h3>   

<li>HISTORICAL Philosophy : 'logistics' of philosophy on the basis

of past facts.</li><br><br>

<li>SYSTEMATIC Philosophy : 'topology' of philosophy on the basis

of different objects of investigation :</li><br><br>

- <I>Normative Philosophy </I> : the rules Man should Mind in following

disciplines :<br><br>

* logic : order, meaning & symbolization (true/false)<br>

* epistemology : theory on knowledge & method (corroborated/falsified)</li><br>       

* esthetics : the exemplaric & emancipation (beauty/ugliness)</li><br>

* ethics : theory on just change & geo-politics (good/evil)</li><br><br>

- <I>Descriptive Philosophy </I> : philosophical investigations into psychology, economics, sociology, politicology, religion, mysticism & other areas.<br><br>

<li>THEORETICO-PRACTICAL Philosophy : meta-nominal speculations on Nature

(natural philosophy), Man (philosophical antropology), Being (ontology), God (theology), Language, History, Religion ... and their practical applications.</li><br><br> 

<a name="cor"><hr><h3>Corpus Equiaeon</a></h3>

<h5>During 1996 <I>all texts & musical compositions</I> will be made available in WP51-format op CD-rom. Texts marked with # will be offered in this departement soon.</h5><br>

<li><h4><a href= "#philo">Philosophy</a></li><br>

<li><a href= "#text">Texts & Comments</a></li><br>

</h4><hr><br>

<FONT size="+2">T</FONT>he Corpus Equiaeon is the body of a moderate postmodern philosophical system*. Its method is open & flexible without negating the reasonable. Example : as in

the case of a catalyst, the influence of this rigidly sustained philosophical

discipline should not be discernable in the final product, i.e. solved problems.<br>

<br>

So to its readers, the Corpus offers cognitive instruments which they can &

must use in order to build up their own new insights. In spite of this rather

mysterious way to bestow knowledge, the Corpus do holds totalizing rational

claims, seemingly fulfilled through a large body of texts (on epistemology,

cosmology, anthropology, aesthetics, ethics, metaphysics, hermetics, ...).

These texts contain the knowledge necessary to allow its readers to deal in a

creative way with the fact that our rational knowledge is incomplete.<br><br>

<li><h3><a name="philo">Philosophy</a></h3> </li>

Basic text :<br>

<a href= "7etltc.htm">1.Tractatus Logico Tragi-Comicus</a> (TLTC, 1992, 245p)<br><br>

The TLTC is an English lexicon (cornerstone or keystone) in which all ideas which are to be elaborated later are loosely defined. In 1996 this book will be revised and  supplemented with comments.<br><br>

Core : an 8-dimensional model of the Universe ruled by 3 independent, irreducible but centralizing meta-entropic operators, namely Consciousness (C), Information (I) and Matter (M). Study of the axioms of its 4 divisions : 'prima materia', logic, aesthetics and ethics. Basic definitions and premises. Keys for a comparative philosophy.<br><br>

<a href= "7nstuurk.htm">2) Towards a Cybernetic Anthropology (1993, 113p, Dutch)</a><br><br>

Conventional but eclectic study of man, examining -through a functionalistic approach- the cognitive genesis of the 4 'nominal' dimensions of consciousness, taking into account the ideas of S.Freud, L.Kohlberg & A.Maslow.<br><br>

3) Codex Eroticus (1993, 41p, English) #<br><br>

Logic of love. The 'codices' are texts that are linked up with the TLTC (numbers of concordance can be found on every page).<br><br>

4) Codex Diabolicus (1993, 11p, English) #<br><br>

Logic of hate. Unlike the Roman Catholic dogma, this infernal metaphysics argues in favour of the complete and irreversible end of the Devil, who -mythically spoken- at the end of time (when the 'Jubilee of Jubilees' or the 'apokatastasis' is celebrated) is totally consumed by God.<br><br>

<a name="pneu"><hr><h3>Pneuma Equiaeon</a></h3><hr><br>

<FONT size="+2">A</FONT>s soon as this body of texts is large enough, a hermeneutical metalevel is introduced. A critical deconstruction (false exits being marked with an asterix) counters the claims expressed by the texts. Among others, the author -in his autobiographical critique- uncovers the hidden motives of some of his choices. This metalevel, called 'Pneuma', will also be co-responsible for the further development of the system*. Its main aim is to undermine in a radical & stern way any dogmatic inclination manifesting itself in the indexed textual auditorium. The Pneuma is part of a Know Tree i.e. a multi-accessible systematic hypertext with a maximum of 10.000 categories. This Know Tree is build or customized in accordance to a thesaurus or any chosen library classification system. Moreover, there are also hyperlinking possibilities and a general indexing feature indexing all words of all texts.<br><br>

<a name="self"><hr><h3>Self Equiaeon</a></h3><hr><br>

<FONT size="+2">O</FONT>ffering this philosophy to the worldcommunity via the Internet is the Self-level of this system. For no human creative work starts off "ex nihilo". An author has to communicate continuously if s/he wants to interact with the problems at hand. In that respect the Internet offers unseen possibilities. We invite everyone to <a href="mailto:siberti@innet.be">react to our texts</a>. The further development of our system will thus be influenced by, with and in the worldcommunity of sign-interpreters. <br><br>In the commercial 'new age'-movement emphasis is placed upon individual growth, meaning that the Self of each person is understood to be essential. This is a narrow view, for <b> it is a fact that we receive most and that intersubjective interaction is essential when emancipating</b> <b>consciousness.</b> So this Self-level of our system is of a christian denomination. It grows as a result of the reactions we get from others and the interactions we trigger. No philosophy aiming at giving meaning to life is devoid of the co-creative input from others.<br><br>  

<a name="spira"><hr><h3>Spira Equiaeon</a></h3><hr><br>

<FONT size="+2">T</FONT>he 'spira' of this system is its inner twist, i.e. its growth-symbols & conclusions, guiding people to solve their questions about <I> the origin, meaning & finality of human existence</I>. It's evident that the information presented in the  2.300 pages of the Corpus (anno 1995) <b>are most surely unable to convey all the arguments in favour of the conclusions reached</b>. More work has to be done. However, these conclusions constitute a first frame-work acting as a floodgate between levels of critical introspection ('pneumatic' in the first degree, 'Selfmatic' in the second, 'spiramatic' in the third). Because of auto-critical considerations the network of each conclusion is liable to change when more Corpus-texts materialize. The frame-work itself is an abstract & formal formulation of the basic tenets or options found in the body of texts.<br><br>

The categories of these conclusions are :<br><br>

<li>10. Holism :</li> the World (nature, cosmos, universe & Man) is an absolute & continuous continuum in which members have their proper explicate fields of manifested  existence & mutual, fruitful, dynamical & intelligent operations, whereas all members of it are united through an implicate superfield, permanently negating the idea of the world as a collection of 'disjecta membra' (the World as 'nature morte').<br><br>

<li>9. Hylic pluralism :</li> the World is a continuum in which material processes take place in a multi-dimensional way, i.e. <a href="matter.htm">matter</a> (M) embraces both ordinary, 'nominal' or four-dimensional M, and its finer, more subtle manifestations. As meta-nominal M has less inertia than nominal M, our state of consciousness interacts more vividly in every real encounter with the former. Our knowledge about meta-nominal M is -to our own peril- diminishing.<br><br>

<li>8. Organicism :</li> the parts of the World are like the organs of a body. The universe is limited & temporal. To understand a part of the World one should make sure that all possible connection with the other parts of the World are not artificially reduced to that number figuring in one's own theory. The logic of organicism does not exclude chaotic functions from the discription of life, nor is it necessarily linked with a pyramidal <a href="informat.htm">information</a>-format, as networking & so-called 'stochastic coincidental events' are part of the opportunistic logic of life's evolution. <br><br>

<li>7. Agapism & Erotism :</li> spiritual love hand in hand with passions bridled in every way, are the only valid means to achieve a permanent & evergrowing state of  happiness.<br><br>

<li>6. Creationism :</li> the World has been created, is permanently recreated and will eventually end. Creationism values creativity as a very important intellectual property as such, both for the individual as in society.<br><br>

<li>5. Auto-criticism :</li> no philosophy, science or common sense regarding the World is completely without unsolved paradoxes, flagrant incompletenesses or shameful contradictions. Moreover, a philosopher should construe his (her) system* in such a way as to make sure his (her) messages comes across while the means to do so (the texts) hopefullly auto-deconstruct themselves by uncovering their proper absurdities.<br><br>

<li>4. Unicism :</li> a mayor regulating idea in science is the unity of all possible knowledge. Without variety the generalizing power of unity is eclipsed. Without unity no order is possible and anarchy ensues. To have both variety & unity is possible if unity is always reached at but never gained (never possessed).<br><br>

<li>3. Symbolism :</li> cognitive growth beyond the nominal level of formal-operational conditioning necessitates (besides signs) the use of totalizing visual matrices (symbols) enabling the emotional hemisphere to form an understream of <a href= "consc.htm">conscious</a> emotions triggering new processes of thought (cfr. action, meta-action = emotion, meta-emotion = thought, meta-thought = intuition).<br><br>

<li>2. Apophatism :</li> God (in the qabalah 'ain soph aur') can not be known or experienced. In a possible negative theology we arrive at the formula : God equals 'all possibilities' (potential reality). As this virtual reality -from our perspective 'sub specie temporis'- does 'not exist', God is not. However, this so-called 'nothingness' of God created, so does tradition claim, the cosmoi. Clearly it differs from the void visualized as the terminal of so-called thermodynamical death. Here the possibility of regeneration is totally absent. From intuïtive gatherings the idea emerges that God (unknown, creating, uncreated) created the first of the Elohîm (Kether, creating, created) and the World (2, 3, ... 10).  So through Kether God is living (in this cosmos).<br><br>

<li>1. Pan-en-theïsm :</li><br>(objective) : God is one absolute one-fold potential creating "ex nihilo" a manifested Creator (first Elohîm, demiurg). How can we know whether God cares for the World created by God's Creator ? The Creator (alternating between virtuality & manifestation) is paradoxical. He is equal to His creation (pantheïsm) but is not 'causa sui'.<br>

(subjective) : Man is unable to know God (cfr.deïsm). He is however able to move back to the First Cause (cfr.theïsm), experience & know his Creator through Jesus the Christ (christianity).<br>

On Perfect Peace with Light

0 : Divine Darkness



§ 1 (Alpha) God's essence ('pleromic' full-emptiness) is only for God to be in. 

The Divine procession starts when God begins realizing GOD & ends at the Jubilee of

Jubilees (JJ) when He celebrates His last Cosmos. Between beginning & end, God's Plan

proceeds from God, i.e. God is 'becoming' more than essence ('ousia'), He creates

existence ('energeia'). God's essence is inaccessible to Its outside ('esse subsistens'). It

is Its own first cause ('causa sui'). It is for God to partake in. God (YHadonaiVY) shows

Himself through His Cosmoi. But to what He (as Elohîm) manifests, God is potential,

silent & withdrawn, i.e. an unknowable Divine darkness.

 

§ 2  The Cosmoi are born, live, die and are reborn through a Divine Comedy (God

realizing GOD). When each & every point of God's Infinite Space finally has been a living 

Kether, making all of Space lit up (mirroring GOD through Himself as God realizing GOD)

THE GREAT JOY bursts forth. The onefold Light of this JJ shines once and forever. The 

Divine, God Creator, understood as bipolar (i.e. transcendent, unqualified, potential & 

immanent, qualified, real) is paradoxical, apophatic, onefold, perfect and unique.



§ 3  Three veils cover God. They stand between Man & God as a cloud of unknowing, 

for God is One God Alone : 

0 = Absolute No-Thing-ness or Ain ; ?

the Will of God to Realize or not to Realize GOD  ;

00 = Infinite Space or Ain Soph ;  

all possibilities receiving this Will in order to bestow :

000 = Limitless Light or Ain Soph Aur ; !

a Hidden Light shining within God's Infinite Space.



00 : Divine Procession



§ 4  Creation is 'real' because Some-Thing came out of No-Thing. This emanation is not 

God's essence, but God's Energy. It is His Life. God's essence is a 'potential' reality, His 

existence a 'manifest' reality. So this outpouring is His procession. Creation serves the 

JJ, when God -through His Fatherhood as Crowned Creator- realizes GOD. At the JJ all 

ends & only GOD is all essences & existences ; all is One totally & perfectly selfrealized 

GOD-Self.

 

§ 5  Is His existence a 'deification' of each & every point of Infinite Space ? Each 

Cosmos being but a small particle of this Space containing all options which -at the Final 

End- all have become real ? When All Ideal Is Real & All Reality Is Ideal only GOD  

remaineth.



§ 6  The procession is the outside of God. God's essence does not imply necessity. This 

begins when God stops being potential (i.e. when He exists). In order to realize GOD, 

God had to carve a hollow, constrict Its Aur & repolarize It. For He is the Great Architect 

of His Cosmoi. 



§ 7  Because the procession takes place outside God, life is a Divine Comedy ; a play of 

the Divine with the DIVINE for the sake of God's willed GOD-realization as GOD-Self. 

Behold : 

a) God's will to know Himself as GOD (vacating Space) ;

b) the contraction of the Light of this hollow to One point ;

c) the outpouring of this Kether of this present Cosmos by the Operations of His Divine 

Trinity, fashioning the holy sevenfold order of our Creator through finite but Divine 

forms.



000 : Divine Exterior



§ 8  The veils cover God's interiority. They can be rendered only by GOD. Because God 

willed GOD, God willed the separation (bridged by the Kether of each Cosmos) between 

the hidden interior & Its procession, the exterior. The finite Cosmoi are contained within 

God who, hyper-existing in Kether as Our Father, enfolds them. Blessed is He !

 

§ 9  Tradition states that Will (Absolute No-Thing) carved out a Letter in Infinite Space 

(Absolute All). God contracted the Light of that vacated hollo to One singular point of

force and made It repolarize. So was born the outpouring Crown (or Light-fountain) of 

God's exterior (the Father of this Cosmos) making God the Creator of this Creation.



§ 10 The Will of God, the Act of allowing a Contraction to happen & the Outpouring of 

the Kingdom are the Spendours given to Malkuth to behold the sevenfold Law of 

Existence.



§ 11 Kether is a dimensionless Monad, a Cosmic Father & Creator ; the immanent mode 

of the Absolute. The Seven Laws originate from His Trinity. His is a divine mode of 

alternation. The interior non-manifested Potential & Its exterior manifestation as a 

Creative & Divine Hyper-Existing Life-Energy are both separated & united.



§ 12 Kether is both the Potential & the Real. His hyper-existence is the Ever-Becoming-

God, the perpetual change permeating the illusionary permanence of the Cosmoi. Our 

Father's hyper-activity makes virtual & real to be divided for the ultimate goal of the Final 

Consumption of God -through an infinite, infinitely His, infinite realizations- by GOD (Omega).

REMARKS



The core of this theology is apophatic (only silence speaks about God's essence), 

monistic (if God is not alone there is no God, for God is One and Alone), pan-energetic 

(the One Creator permeates His Cosmos always and everywhere), hierarchical (God 

creates a Creator, Who, as a Trinity, through 7 Laws creates 4 different planes of 

manifestation), theurgical (through the operations of the Order His Energy can always be 

channeled) and qabalistic (God does not exist. God does not hyper-exist, God exists in 

an ineffable, pure, infinite, potential, virtual way). THAT Essence can never be known 

(i.e. 'finitum non capax infiniti'). So apophatism subscribes to the view that God is

and remains transcendent.  



Considered to be of importance in all Western monotheistic theological systems based 

on scriptural revelation (a 'Holy Book'), i.e. Judaism (Tora), Christianism (New 

Testament) & Islam (Koran), transcendentalism implies a radical dualism between God & 

His World. So the World is a real paradox !



God can not be spoken of as 'He'. For God is both personal & impersonal and moreover 

transcends every antinomy. Is God one-fold, naked, virginal, virtual, potential, pure ? Is 

God not always somewhere, everywhere & beyond ? Concerning God unknowing reigns. 



Not unlike Brahman when asleep (nirguna), God can only be approached by negating all 

what is not God, i.e. all possible dimensions of the present Cosmos (cfr. ps-Dionusios & 

John the Scot, but see also the 'neti-neti'-method of the brahmins). God is like the 

absent King of a Kingdom which remains in perfect order (Deus absconditus). The three 

veils cover God. Can God show Himself to His World as He wills ? 



Our mystic tradition & inner teaching holds that God created each Creator of the Worlds. 

God = 0 : an unknowable unity, virtual and one-fold.

The Creator = 1 : a knowable variety under creative unity.



The latter is God manifesting (actualizing) as a particular Cosmic CreatorSelf, i.e. the 

contraction to a point of one out of many possibilities of God's Infinite Space of 

virtualities. He is and shall be. He is that what He is. He is never out of Himself, lost for 

Himself or without foreknowledge of all that comes after Him, for He is the King, the 

One Ruler of the Universe, both visible and invisible. He is the unity, the concentration, 

the pressure and the fountain of light out of which all has been generated. Blessed is He, 

for if it pleases Him,  He reveals Himself to us mortals. He is the only will to follow. The 

only law, love, way, purity, sanctity and holiness. To know Him, the Supreme Being, is 

like knowing All which is like Nothing for God. This alternation is crucial to bestow what 

was received. Christians call Him 'Abba', Father. 



Both are paradoxically divided for the ultimate goal of union. God created His Majesty, 

King of His First Universe, Prima Causæ of that First Cosmos. At the end of that Order 

light and darkness were divided. This is the first Jubilee. At one point infinity will have 

been infinitely 'filled' (the end of the series of cardinal numbers will have been reached). 

This happens at the Jubilee of the Last Cosmos, also Jubilee of Jubilees. Between two 

Cosmoi spacetime vanishes. 



At the end of the Last Cosmos all possibilities have become manifest so that Infinite 

Space reflects All Worlds and God beholds through this infinite number of CreatorSelves 

GOD. Unity and variety are one.



It is essential to distinguish God (essence unknown) from His work (or known 

existence). God written as : "YHadonaiVH" is pronounced "Adonai", the Creator 

"Elohîm". God is one-fold, singular (0), "Elohîm" is a masculine plural (1) of a feminine 

noun and means : "Gods & Goddesses".



The One Supreme Being fashioned the Cosmos together with 9 Divine Beings, both 

active (right pillar, i.e. creational) & passive (left pillar, i.e. generational).



In Genesis the 10 Sephiroth emerge as the result of 10 Divine utterances. These 

utterances indicate the nature of the work of each Sephira, all connected by 22 different 

paths, shaping the Tree of Life, i.e. the lightmatrix & the natural laws of our Cosmos. 

The first three utterances relate to the First Three of the Elohîm. They constitute the 

World of Atziluth.



1.And Elohim said : Let there be light = AHYH

2.And Elohim said : Let there be a firmament = YH

3.And Elohim said : Let there be earth = YH Elohîm



Who knows God ? Infinite space, endless light ... a small hollow constricted upon which 

I AM LIGHT is whispered ?



The nature of the First of the Elohîm is revealed as LIGHT. I am and shall be LIGHT. 

Consider All of Divinity, i.e. God (singular) and Elohîm (plural) : "YHadonaiVH Elohîm". 

Our Lord, blessed is He, is not against other gods & goddesses. He, the First of the 

Elohîm, is their Supreme Ruler from which They (the other Elohîm) receive their Light in 

order to bestow and  fashion His living Cosmos. Is He not the Lord of Abraham, Isaak, 

Mozes, Jesus Christ & Mohammed ? The Lord who reveals Himself both (objective) as 

Supreme Cause of the present Cosmos as well as in a (subjective) personal, private 

experience (in body, mind, soul & spirit) ?     



In the Old Convenant, this Father (. 1), permanently created Energy for the sake of the 

cosmic creativity of His Hierarchy of Elohîm (Y or Chockmah, 2) which fructified the 

roots & matrix or the Mother (H or Binah, 3) and caused the birth of both Son (V or 

Tiphareth, 6) & (fallen) Daughter (final H or Malkuth, 10). Behind the Plan of the Father, 

YHadonaiVH was, is and shall be recognized.



Apophatism gives form to transcendentalism by stressing the  power of unknowing, i.e. 

a special living knowledge obtained by allowing the mind to contemplate spiritual heights 

and depths while simultaneously restricting any of its attempts to move beyond its 

natural limits. 



This living knowledge (gnosis, intuition, intellectual perception) was known to the early 

qabalists as 'Daath'. It was, is & will be the foundation of all spiritual progress, i.e. the 

awakening of the experience of the omnipresence of the hyper-existence of our Father. 

Through Daath His Presence (or  'shekinah') can be experienced in consciousness. When 

a complete assimilation occurs, consciousness may learn to touch the cosmic state at 

will.



Qabalah is the only systematical spiritual calculus which takes into account : 



a) the fundamental differences between the words 'God' (i.e. "YHadonaiVH", or Lord) & 

'Creator' (i.e. "Elohîm", or Divine Beings) ; 

b) the distinction between the singularity of God and the plurality of the hierarchical 

Divine Beings (i.e. God's essence or interior versus God's Kingdom or exterior) ;

c) the distinctions between potential being, super (or hyper)-being, being & not-being.  



These distinctions are necessary in the light of God's Will to realize -through His Cosmoi- 

GOD,which happens only once & is conceived of as taking place after the End of the 

Worlds or Jubilee of the Last Cosmos (cfr. the "apokatastasis" of Origen or the "Jubilee 

of Jubilees" of the qabalists). This duality is seen in Hinduism as the dissolution at the 

end of the World (pralaya) versus the creation of a new Cosmos (manvantara). So the 

idea of a cyclic return of manifestation is clearly Eastern (compare this with Herakleitos' 

view). 



When Brahman sleeps (the impassive ground of all creation) there is no manifestation (or 

'nirguna Brahman'). When He awakens He is the Activity of the primal constituants of 

matter, the 'gunas' or ('saguna Brahman'). As such He (or 'Îshvara') simultaneously 

creates by his mâyâ the new (Vishnu) after having destroyed the old ( iva), and this till 

the end of His Day (or 'brahmic cycle'). The JJ moves beyond by suggesting the end of 

the cyclic return itself. 



In the Mândûkya Upanisad Lord Î vara is seen as the first emanation from the Absolute 

Brahman. In the sphere of the World He is absolutely supreme, but in relationship to 

Brahman He exists in so far as he is an emanation of this Absolute Brahman. The 

liberated soul (âtman), as Shankara explains in his Brahmasûtras (4.17-21) never 

identifies with Îshvara but passes clean beyond Him into the undifferentiated nirguna 

Brahman. In His capacity of Lord of Illusion, occupied with the affairs of the World, and 

as supreme object of worship He, Îshvara is alone. This privilege is His, not of any soul, 

bound or released. A 'trimûrti' occurs :



1. I am the One creator : Îshvara (= saguna Brahman)

2. I am Divine maintenance (Dharma) : Vishnu (Krisna) 

3. I am Divine dissolution :  Shiva



Although the duality between the One transcendent God and the immanent Creators of 

the cosmoi is implied by the fact of the World and the idea of becoming -both necessary 

to the birth of the Cosmoi- its polarity is harmonized by a 'tertium comparationis' : 

Kether. The dyad ensues a triad : 



God's essence, God's exterior & God-the-Creator. Abba, first of the Divine Beings, 

Godhead of the Trinity or Supernal Triad : He who is love (Father), He who is the 

beloved (Son) and He who is loving (Holy Spirit). The ever-begotten unity is called in 

christian qabalah "Father", filiation "Son" (Chockmah) and understanding "Holy Spirit" 

(Binah). 

 

Old Convenant (Mozes)=====New Convenant (Christ)



1. I AM THAT AM : light====ABBA, father

2. YH : heaven========YHshinVH, His Son Iéshoua' 

3. YH Elohîm : earth===== YHshinVH Elohîm, their Spirit



The revelations of Mohammed ibn Abdallah (570 - 632) are plain. The God (or 'Allah') 

wants a righteous planetary society and a pure religion. His devotees are immediately 

made unworldly so that they may concentrate on the Koran and the study of the signs of 

Nature, the epiphany of Allah, allowing man to glimps into His Might. Man can never 

know Allah as He is. Where Allah exists, Man is not. This is His final Law.



Allah, the One with Many Names, surely is the most perfect expression of the intuitional 

foundation of monotheism, i.e. God can not be known, felt or experienced. Distinctions 

between God and His Creator are considered to be of no real importance. 



The devotee of The One God Alone, i.e. Allah, is unable to experience the Divine 

directly. "YHadonaiVH Elohîm" (= the Divine) is absolutely different from the World 

Allah created. 



The idea that God's exterior, being part of Cosmos, can be known will be refuted on the 

grounds that hyper-existence is so paradoxical and non-verbal that a very firm theology 

of the Divine is impossible or highly exemplaric and thus too rare to allow for its 

incorporation into a planetary theosocial view on the natural bonds between Allah and 

the World.



That Allah is able to illuminate His devotees is not rejected. But for orthodox theologians 

this does not mean a transfiguration (of the human soul into Allah Himself). Allah is One. 

The idea that Chockmah & Binah are co-eternal with Kether is rejected on the grounds 

that the lightning flash decended from 1 to 2 and next to 3. Allah is both 0 and 1, i.e. 1 

= 0. So YH VH is rejected, for the Name of God can not be divided, even not by a man 

born without sin (i.e. a prophet).



Due to the experiences of Abû Yazîd, Abû Sa'îd and Junayd, a dose of Indian Vedânta 

was injected into Sûfism, the mystical body of Islam. Their efforts clearly show the 

necessity to bridge the gulf between Allah and His devotees. The Koran clearly states 

that Allah chooses for Himself a Son, but he is not co-substantial with Allah, being but 

the best creation has to offer (these Sons are the most pure of His devotees). 



The Old Convenant was physical but impersonal (shekinah) & expressed Binah. The New 

Convenant was superphysical & personal, expressing Chockmah (YH VH). Allah ignited a 

global social action (Kether). Jews have to accept Jezus as anoited. Christians have to 

differentiate (in Atziluth) between YHshinVH -Jezus- (Chockmah) and Christ (Tiphareth), 

son of Mary (Yesod), from Nazareth (Malkuth). Muslims have to accept transfiguration 

(the liberated soul becoming Divine). In doing so these mystical, relational & radical faces

of monotheism may strike a rare & fragile peaceful balance.



Types of Realities



1. potential reality : Ain Sof Aur «0»

not being & not nonbeing : - (B and - B) : 

God



--- 



2. creative reality : Kether : « 1 & 2 & 3 »

hyper-being & potential reality : Bh and  -(B and  -B) :

Creator



3. manifest reality : Cosmos : 1, ... 10 



 manifest supernal hyper-reality : 1 + 2  + 3 :

 Godhead = Bh (hyper-being)



 manifest constructed reality : 4, 5, 6 ... 10 :

 the Universe = B (being)



---



4. negative reality : Chaos : - 10, ... - 1 

nonbeing  : - B

this is the 'excreta' or 'shadow' of the Cosmoi



5.mediator reality : Daath : can not be numbered

being & nonbeing : B and  - B

OVER ZEVEN MANIEREN VAN HEILIGE MINNE (ca.1236)

door Beatrijs van Tienen (1200 - 1268) 

priorin van Nazareth (nabij Lier)

vertaald en kort gesitueerd door Wim van den Dungen,

Antwerpen, 1993.

SITUERING :



Beatrijs van Nazareth (1200 - 1268) te Tienen als slagersdochter

geboren, was de eerste Vlaamse mystica die in een eigen mystieke

taal (het Diets) op een synthetische & originele wijze uitspraak deed

over de 'mystieke' intimiteit die er kan bestaan tussen de spirituele 

mens & datgene wat deze als 'Goddelijk' ervaart.



Zij deed dit in haar Seuen Manieren van Heiliger Minnen (ca.1236), 

geschreven voor novicen. Dit is het oudst bekende Middelneder-

landse 'geestelijke' proza. In 1236 was ze met haar zusters naar

het klooster van Nazareth (nabij Lier) getrokken. Aldaar werd ze

later tot priorin verkozen. Eerst stond genoemde tekst bekend als

een 'preek' uit de Limburgsche Sermoenen, 48 preken geschreven

door een Limburgse monnik uit de buurt van Maastricht of Tienen 

(ca. 1320-1350). In 1926 konden Reypens & Van Mierlo Beatrijs 

formeel als auteur identificeren. 



In de XIIIde eeuw maakte het gehele gebied, dat nu Noord-Frankrijk

 & België uitmaakt, een tijd van merkwaardige spirituele 

veranderingen door. De 'Begijnen-beweging' (begonnen aan het

einde van de XIIde eeuw) floreerde. Eerst als kleine groepen

niet erkende (en soms vervolgde) spirituele vrouwen, leefden & 

werkten de begijnen van het eerste uur in de buurt van

ziekenhuizen (soms geleid door een 'zienster', zoals Hadewijch).

Later (van  Rome losstaand) plaatsten zij een direct, vaak

visionair, omgaan met God centraal.



De cisterciënzers (waartoe Beatrijs behoorde) waren in het

toenmalige Vlaanderen vooral door het werk van Bernardus van

Clairvaux (1090 - 1153) & diens mystiek van het hart populair

geworden. Voortbouwend op de 'kloosterrevolutie' van Cîteaux

(waarbij het 'model' van het benedictijnse officie klooster -

zoals Cluny- werd afgewezen omdat het een oorspronkelijke

beleving van de christelijke Boodschap belette) werkte Bernardus

een systematische mystieke metaforiek uit. Hierin kwam in de

eerste plaats de gevoelszijde van de mystieke ervaring aan bod.

Bernardus zélf stichtte 68 kloosters.



In de Bruidegomsmetaforiek van Bernardus wordt het duidelijk

dat wie op een volmaakte wijze liefheeft, huwt. De mystieke ziel

ervaart in en door haar hart de éénvormigheid van willen die tot

één geest worden ; een mystieke kus of bekroning van de

transportatie naar het hart. 



In sterk affectief geladen 'nuptiale' & christocentrische

beeldspraak geeft Bernardus gestalte aan de mogelijkheid God

direct te ervaren, en dit zonder het wezensverschil tussen God

& ziel op te heffen. Immers, de Bruidegom verschijnt aan de bruid

zoals Hij wenst, niet zoals Hij is. Beatrijs bestudeerde het werk

van Bernardus, vooral dan diens Sermones in Cantica cantoricum.

Plaats geven aan het belevend individu kaderde in het 'Gotisch'

wereldbeeld. Beatrijs zal echter het voorwerp van de affectieve

metaforiek systematisch pogen te benaderen. 



Tevens werd zij beïnvloed (via haar tijdgenote Hadewijch)

door Willem van St.-Thierry (1085 - 1148). Deze adellijke

Luikenaar verliet zijn geboortestad voor de school van Anselmus.

Later ontmoette hij Petrus Abelardus, en onderging de invloed van

de school van St.-Victor, de 'via negativa' (of 'negatieve'

theologie), de Joods-Arabische medische traditie & de Griekse

patristiek (Origenes & Gregorius van Nyssa). Hij trad uit om

cicterciënzer te worden. Via hem assimileerde Beatrijs de

Oosterse Kerk (de 'Orientale Lumen') & de mystiek van het 'niets'

(ps-Dionusios de Areopagiet), die Griekse (Pythagorisme,

neoplatonisme) & Oosterse (Egyptische & Indische) tinten bezat. 



Zij werd zowel met de 'monastische' als de christelijke

neoplatoonse traditie geconfronteerd. Dit in een 'revolutionair'

& 'open' spiritueel klimaat. De synthese die we in haar tekst

terugvinden bezit dan ook een rijke & diepe mystieke verzonken-

heid. Door zijn authentieke belevingsintensiteit (hart) & zijn

impact op de 'homo normalis' (verstand) legt deze tekst de basis

voor een 'Dietse' 'cognitio Dei experimentalis' (de Parijse

kanselier Jean Gerson).



Beide wegen naar eenheid (affect & rede) hielpen Beatrijs

bij het aanboren van een oorspronkelijke mystieke bron : een

synthetische minne-mystiek waarin duidelijk wordt gemaakt hoe 

de relatie tussen ziel & God de synthese is van lichamelijk

'werken', 'verstand', 'gevoel' (hart/ziel) & 'geest'

(wezen/'Eden').



Het gebruik van de volkstaal (o.m. door de Hertogen van

Brabant die minne-liederen schreven ... ) droeg op een

belangrijke wijze bij tot de ontplooiing van een 'mystieke bron'

die school maakte via Jan van Ruusbroec (1293 - 1381), de

Rijnlandse mystiek, Meister Eckehart (1260 - 1327/8) & de Moderne

Devotie. Beatrijs' minne is de 'moeder' van al deze mystiek. 



De Zeven Manieren van Heilige Minne vormen een sluitend

geheel. Toch is het niet onwaarschijnlijk (gezien de slotzin aan

het einde van de zesde) dat Beatrijs haar jeugdwerk op latere

leeftijd omwerkte. De zevende manier vormt inderdaad het

magistraal sluitstuk van de verhandeling.



Elke 'manier' van 'minne' is als een bloemblaadje. Bij het

openen van de bloem speelt elk blaadje zijn rol. Bij een eerste

lectuur worden de 'manieren' in volgorde gelezen. Later merkt men

echter dat ze telkens één onderdeel van hetzelfde belichten, n.l.

'de minne'. Net zoals de bloemblaadjes bovenaan de stengel samen-

komen (daar waar waarnemer & waaier 'in minne' één zijn) ?

 

De 'minne' verenigt door toe te werken naar een 'Edenische

staat' & onderscheidt door haar exemplarische expressievormen,

die daarom 'heilig' heten. Elke 'wijze van doen' toont ons een

tijdelijk & uniek moment van de 'minne'. Zij zélf is voortdurend

'in proces'. Haar standvastigheid wordt enkel een feit nadat de

minnende ziel zich voortdurend geoefend heeft in al deze

expressievormen van de minne.      



De 'manieren' zijn niet onverbonden, maar vormen samen de

'mystieke roos', die het dynamisch equilibrium eigen aan het

spiritualisatieproces uitbeeldt. In de 'zevende manier' bekroont

Beatrijs haar pad in & door de minne met een tijdloze, diepe

Wijsheid die gebed ligt tussen het Rijk van de Heilige Geest &

het tranendal van de 'wereld' (contemptus mundi).



Al mijn vertalingen gaan uit van de diplomatische uitgave

(Nijmegen, 1973) van het oudste handschrift (Brussel,

ca.1350). De studie van Beatrijs van Nazareth is onderdeel van

mijn onderzoek naar de relaties tussen kennis & mystiek. Het

eerste deel van deze studie werd in 1989 uitgegeven. Hierin kwam

het filologisch, historisch & hermeneutisch materiaal aan de orde

(of Beatrijs-studie), alsook mijn eerste vertaling die strikt

aansloot bij de poëtisch-ritmische kenmerken van het mystiek

Middelnederlands van Beatrijs.



Gedurende 1993 werd de tweede (modernere) vertaling door

anderen bekritiseerd & met nieuw materiaal geconfronteerd

(Vekeman, 1993). Zo krijgt deze tekst heden (eind 1993)

definitief vorm.



In Kennis & Minne-Mystiek (1994) wordt het onderzoek

samengevat als de studie van de kenstructuren eigen aan mystiek.

Structuur & pragmatiek van deze 'mystieke vorm' leggen samen de

basis voor een 'mysticologie'. Verwacht wordt dat deze

'mysticologie' centraal is voor een theoretische & praktische

'filosofie van de mystiek'.

OPMERKING OVER COMPOSITIE :



Alle commentatoren zijn het erover eens dat Beatrijs uitzonderlijk

compositorisch begaafd was (ermee rekening houdend

dat zij een vroeg Dietse tekst schreef). 

 

De compositie kent een interne (binnen elke manier) & een

externe (tussen de manieren onderling) afdeling. 



Intern loopt het als volgt :



a) definitie : legt de kern van de betreffende 'minne-

manifestatie' vast ;

b) ontwikkeling : beschrijft deze typische manifestatie als een

'groeiproces' met eigen psychische & fysische kenmerken ;

c) slot : herhaling van de kern & verwijzing naar een andere

manier.



Intern bemerken we de toepassing van de circulariteit die

we ook in de ondertitel aantreffen ('uit het hoogste terug

werken naar het hoogste'). De neoplatoonse inspiratie ligt voor

het grijpen (viz. Plato's Allegorie & Plotinus' hypostatische

emanatieleer -Enneaden-). 



Voor de externe afdeling onderscheiden we drie modellen :



a) het 'gegradeerd' model (1320 in haar Vita) : elke 'manier' is

als een 'graad'. De mystieke 'opgang' wordt chronologisch &

hiërarchisch georganiseerd. Het in de qabalah gebruikte

'gradensysteem' (gebaseerd op de 'Boom des Levens' uit de Zohar)

komt hiermee overeen.



De 'Boom van het Leven' (Etz ha-Chayim) is het model van het

spiritueel groeiproces vervat in het Oude Testament. Het omvat

een 7-tal graden. De hoogste graad (de zevende) verleent toegang

tot de directe ervaring van de Drieëenheid tussen 'Atiqa', de

Oude, de Kroon of "oer-eenheid" (Kether of 1), 'Abba', de Hemelse

Vader, de Wijsheid of "intuïtie" (Chockmah of 2) & 'Aima', de

Hemelse Moeder, het Begrip of "cosmisch intellect" (Binah of 3).

Dit geeft in totaal 10 graden.



Met elke graad komt een 'symbolisch register' overeen.

Hierin krijgen alle kenmerken van de ervaringen die met de graad

overeenkomen algebraïsch, geometrisch, analoog & metaforisch

vorm. De Spaanse qabalisten waren vooral in de XIIde & XIIIde

eeuw actief (Moses ben de Leon). Er werd veel kennis tussen

joden, christenen & islamieten uitgewisseld.



Volgende overeenkomsten springen op de voorgrond :



Ie manier = 1° (10 - Malkuth, Koninkrijk): het verwerven van

trouw in het mystiek zoeken. In de Westerse traditie (Qaba-

listen, Tempeliers & Vrijmetselaars) is dit de graad van

"Zelator", d.w.z. elkeen die het  'mystieke vuur' (ignis

philosophicus), dat in het 'alchemistisch fornuis' (athanor) voor

de gewilde transfiguratie moet zorgen, kan 'wakker houden'. Dit

is vergelijkbaar met de intensiteit waarmee de ziel de Edenische

toestand wil actualiseren. Ook met de 'Eros' van de ware zoeker. 



IIde manier = 2° (9 - Yesod, Fundament):

het verwerven van de juiste mystieke grondhouding : het dienen

zonder waarom, om niet. Dit is van belangeloosheid het

'fundament' van het 'Grote Werk' maken. Volgens de Westerse

traditie is dit enkel mogelijk wanneer de ziel over een gedegen

'theoretisch' kader beschikt (weten om te dienen). Het is de

graad van "Theoreticus", of de purificatie van het Ego door

vrijwillige dienstbaarheid.  



IIIde manier = 3° (8 - Hod, Luister) :

een eerste concrete 'oneindigheidservaring' (diep & zeker besef

van de luister Gods) ; de graad van "Practicus". Vooral de

botsing tussen het oneindigheidsverlangen (ontstaan nà genoemde

ervaring) & het concrete feit van de eindigheid van de ziel weegt

door.



IVde manier = 4° (7 - Netzach, Overwinning) : een eerste

'extatische ervaring' (extreme ervaring van de oneindigheid

waarin elke vorm van identiteit dreigt op te lossen) ; de graad

van "Philosophus". De ziel moet beseffen dat de extase haar niet

tot het wezen van haar eigen activiteit voert (de extase maakt

de ziel één met God waardoor haar lichaam haar ontvalt). Beseffen

dat dit niet mogelijk is brengt de overwinning.



Vde manier = 5° (6 - Tiphareth - Schoonheid) : de graad van

"Adeptus Minor". De ziel wordt aan het kruis genageld om via de

pijn de grenzen van haar geest direct te ervaren om zo een wezen-

lijk & blijvend evenwicht te scheppen.



VIde manier = 6° (5 - Geburah - Strengheid) : de graad van

"Adeptus Mayor". De ziel kent de grenzen van haar geest en

contempleert wanneer zij dat wil. De handeling veruitwendigt het

wezen van de ziel. De ziel is vrij om alles te doen wat zij zelf

wil. Dit handelen naar wil impliceert een strengheid, want de

ziel ontziet niets of niemand ...



VIIde manier = 7° (4 - Gedulah - Mededogen) : de graad van

"Adeptus Exemptus". De ziel is bevrijd van zichzelf. Zij is

gelukzalig. Door haar contemplatieve krachten schouwt zij voorbij

de grenzen van haar geest en bewandelt zij het pad van haar eigen

transfiguratie. In dit tranendal kan zij enkel al Geest worden

(Binah) en dit terwijl zij verzuchtend op haar Bruidegom

(Chockmah) wacht. Zij helpt haar medemens zonder zich het leed

van deze sombere wereld wezenlijk aan te trekken. Zij helpt,

kijkt toe & schouwt. Dit is haar mededogen. Zo wacht ze tot haar

lichaam zacht sterven mag en zij geestelijk de Bruidegom blijvend

kan beminnen.



Het is weinig waarschijnlijk dat Beatrijs rechtstreeks door

de qabalah beïnvloed werd. Om de overeenkomsten tussen beide

modellen uit te leggen, kunnen allerlei hypothesen geformuleerd

worden. Dat de mystieke ervaring universele kenmerken bezit,

werd recentelijk door de vergelijkende godsdienstwetenschap &

de transpersoonlijke psychologie duidelijk aangetoond (Bucke,

Stace, Tart, Maslow, Wilber et.all.). 



b) het 'energetisch' model (onze eeuw) : de tekst toont ons die

'momenten' die van centraal belang zijn voor de 'stroom' van de

'minne-energie'. Deze 'stroom' impliceert : 1) aanvang/afsluiting (0), 

2) afwijzing (-) & 3) aantrekking (+) :



- = III & IV

0 = I & VI & VIII

+ = II, IV



c) het 'Edenisch' model : de 'Edenische Oerstaat' (puur, vrij en

edel) vormt de 'rode draad' waarmee we alle manieren met elkaar

kunnen verbinden. Deze staat symboliseert het 'oorspronkelijke'

dat door de 'goede' ziel kan teruggewonnen worden. Begrijp elke

'manier' als één 'moment' (of 'graad') eigen aan het

spiritualisatieproces 'in de minne'. De Edenische toestand

impliceert dat het 'imago Dei' in het bewustzijn geactualiseerd

is. Dit gebeurt in en door de zeven manieren, zodat we de 'minne'

ook kunnen vatten als het spiritualisatieproces zélf. Elk moment

organiseert 'de minne' in het licht van de unieke inhoudelijke

kenmerken van de Edenische toestand. De modellen kunnen

gecombineerd worden.

HET GEBRUIK VAN HET GETAL 7 :



De studie van de historische bronnen van dit gebruik is hier

niet aan de orde. Ik beperk mij tot de analoge classificatie van

begrippen & rituelen uit de Katholieke Catechese. Hieruit blijkt

op zijn minst dat het Christendom aan het getal '7' steeds een

centrale symbolische betekenis heeft toegekend. 



Dat deze analogieën historisch pre-Christelijk geworteld zijn

mag blijken uit deze eerste 'heidense' tafel :



Getal (qabalah)/Planeet-Goden (hermetiek)/Artes Liberales

---

1) 10/Saturnus/Rekenkunde

2) 09/Maan/Meetkunde

3) 08/Mercurius/Sterrenkunde

4) 07/Venus/Muziek

5) 06/Zon/Grammatica

6) 05/Mars/Logica

7) 4,3,2,1/Jupiter/Retorica



Sacramenten/Christelijke Orde-graden/Gaven H.Geest

---

1) doopsel/portier/Godsvrees

2) vormsel/voorlezer/vroomheid

3) Eucharistie/exorcist/wetenschap

4) huwelijk/acoliet/kracht



de pas : onderdiaken



5) zalving/diaken/raad

6) penitentie/priester/begrip

7) priesterschap/bisschop/wijsheid



Dat we de verschillende momenten eigen aan het minne-proces

ook analoog kunnen 'inpassen' blijkt uit de correspondenties met

de kardinale & theologale deugden : 



Minne-moment/Deugden

---

1) imago Dei zoeken/matigheid

2) dienen om niet/voorzichtigheid

3) orewoet ervaren/rechtvaardigheid

4) extase ervaren/krachtdadigheid

5) insania amoris/geloof

6) contemplatie/hoop

7) transfiguratie/naastenliefde



Door omkering vinden we de correspondenties met de 'Boom van

de Dood' (qlipoth) die door het principe 'diabolus est Deus

inversus' schijnbaar reëel wordt. Immers, het kwaad 'is'

intrinsiek niet (privatio boni). Is het als de schaduw van dat

wat werkelijk bestaat ?



Soort demon (monastisch)/Doodzonde(theologisch)

---

1) gulzigheid/gulzigheid

2) ontucht/onzuiverheid

3) hebzucht/gierigheid

4) droefheid/afgunst

5) toorn/woede

6) lusteloosheid/luiheid

7) ijdele glorie/hoogmoed



De coherentie van deze correspondenties blijkt na studie van

de Catéchisme de L'Eglise Catholique, Mame/Plon - Paris, 1992.

VERTALING NAAR HET HEDENDAAGS NEDERLANDS :



OVER ZEVEN MANIEREN VAN HEILIGE MINNE.



Uit het hoogste komen zeven manieren van minne die terugwerken

naar het hoogste.



       De eerste is een begeerte die al werkend voortkomt uit de

minne. Ze moet lang heersen in het hart eer ze alle tegenstand

terdege kan verdrijven, en ze kan niet anders dan met kracht en

schranderheid te werk gaan en moedig hierin groeien.  



       Deze eerste manier is een begeerte die zeer zeker uit de minne

voortkomt, want de goede ziel die trouw wil volgen en duurzaam

wil minnen wordt voortgetrokken door de hunkering naar deze

begeerte -die ten zeerste te minnen en te behoeden is- om te

bestaan in puurheid en vrijheid en edelheid waarin zij gemaakt

is door haar schepper naar zijn beeld en tot zijn gelijkenis. 



       Zij begeert op deze manier heel haar leven door te brengen,

en hieraan te werken en hierin te groeien en op te klimmen tot

nog hogere uitmuntendheid in de minne, meer verbonden door 

kennis van God, tot aan de volkomenheid toe waartoe zij uitgerust 

en geroepen is door God. 



       Daar richt zij zich op vroeg of laat, en daarom zet zij zich

helemaal in. En dit is haar vragen en haar wil tot weten en haar

bede tot God. En haar nadenken over hoe zij dit bereiken kan en

hoe zij het nabijzijn aan de gelijkheid met de minne verkrijgen

kan in alle pracht van de deugden, en in de gehele puurheid van

de in haar herstelde adel van de minne. 



       Deze ziel onderzoekt dikwijls ernstig wat zij maar is, en wat

zij zou moeten zijn, wat zij heeft, en wat er aan haar begeerte

toch ontbreekt. Met al haar ernst, en met steeds grotere begeerte, 

en met al de schranderheid die zij vermag, spant zij zich in zich te

hoeden voor en te schuwen wat haar hinderen en beletten kan 

van vorderingen te maken in de minne. Zo spant zij zich in om al

wat haar helpen kan en voortbrengen kan naar de minne naar zich

toe te trekken en te behouden. En nooit rust het hart of bedaart

het van het zoeken, het eisen en het leren.  



       Dit is de hoogste zorg van de ziel die in deze toestand is

geplaatst en die hierin moet werken en zwoegen, tot op het

ogenblik dat zij door haar ernst en door haar trouw van God

verkrijgt dat zij voortaan zonder belemmeringen van het verleden

blijvend de minne dienen kan, met een vrij bewustzijn en met pure

geest en klaar verstand. 



       Een dergelijke manier van begeren van zo'n grote puurheid en

edelheid, komt zeker uit de minne voort en niet uit vrees. Want

vrees doet lijden, doen en laten uit angst voor de toorn van onze

Heer en het oordeel van de rechtvaardige rechter, of uit angst

voor eeuwige wraak, of uit angst voor vergankelijk onheil. 



       Maar de minne evenwel streeft in haar werking uitsluitend naar

de puurheid en de uitmuntendheid, en de hoogste edelheid, die

haar eigen wezen eigen zijn. 



       En aan hen die zich aan haar wijden, leert ze om eveneens zo

te leven.



De andere manier van minne.



       Nu en dan heeft de ziel ook een andere manier van minne. Dan

dient zij de Heer om niet, alleen uit minne, zonder enig waarom

en zonder enig loon van genade of van heerlijkheid. 



       En precies zoals een jonkvrouw die haar Heer dient uit grote

minne en zonder loon, en die er behagen in schept dat zij Hem

dienen mag, en dat Hij het toestaat dat zij Hem dient, zo begeert

zij de minne te dienen met minne, zonder maat en boven mate en

boven alle menselijk begrip en rede uitstijgend, met alle

dienstbaarheid eigen aan de trouw.



       Als zij hier in is, dan is zij zo brandend in haar begeerte, zo 

bereid tot dienst, zo licht in het zwoegen, zo zacht in de tegenslag, 

zo blij in de droefenis ; en met alles wat zij is, verlangt zij Hem 

genoegen te doen. 



       En zo vindt zij er haar vreugde in om iets te kunnen doen, en

van nut te zijn ten dienste van de minne en tot eer van Hem.



De derde manier van minne.



       Soms heeft de goede ziel een andere manier van minne waaraan

veel pijn en ellende verbonden zijn. Het komt hierop neer dat zij

begeert de minne ten volle te beantwoorden, en haar te volgen in

alle hulde en in alle dienst, gehoorzaamheid en onderdanigheid. 



       Deze begeerte wordt bijwijlen heftig in de ziel teweeg gebracht,

 en dan heeft zij het vaste voornemen met sterke begeerte letterlijk

alle werk te doen en met het lijden op weg te gaan, alles toe te 

laten en te verdragen, en al haar werk zonder zich te ontzien en 

zonder maat voort te zetten in de minne. In die zin is zij helemaal 

bereid tot elke dienst, en bereidwillig en onbevreesd te zwoegen 

en pijn te lijden ; toch blijft zij onvoldaan in alles wat ze doet. 

Maar bovenal is het voor haar de zwaarste pijn, dat zij in verhouding 

tot haar grote begeerte niet genoeg kan doen voor de minne, en dat 

haar in de minne zoveel onthouden wordt. 



       Zij weet wel dat dit bovenmenselijk werk is en dat het boven

al haar macht gaat om dit te doen, want wat zij begeert -hetgeen

onmogelijk en onwezenlijk is voor elk schepsel- is dat zij alleen

zoveel zou willen doen als alle mensen van het aardrijk samen,

en als alle geesten van het rijk van de hemelen en als al de

schepsels boven en beneden en ontelbaar veel meer, om de minne

te dienen, lief te hebben, en te eren volgens haar waardigheid. 



       En hoeveel zij ook in haar werk tekortschiet, toch wil zij dat

verwezenlijken met heel haar inzet en met sterke begeerte. Maar

dat alles kan haar niet voldoen. 



       Zij weet wel, dat deze begeerte slechts te vervullen is ver

boven haar macht en boven de menselijke rede en boven alle begrip

; toch kan zij deze begeerte niet matigen, of bedwingen of tot

bedaren brengen. 



       Zij doet al wat ze kan : zij dankt en looft de minne, zij

werkt en zwoegt om de minne, zij begeert verzuchtend de minne,

zij levert zichzelf helemaal over aan de minne. En dat alles

geeft haar geen rust.



        Het is voor haar een zware pijn dat zij datgene moet begeren

wat zij niet verwerven kan en daarom moet zij in de ellende van

haar hart blijven en verblijven in haar onvoldaanheid.



        Zo is het voor haar alsof zij al levend sterft, en stervend

de zware pijn van de hel gevoelt, en heel haar leven is hels en

ongenadig en misnoegdheid vanwege de verschrikking van de

angstwekkende begeerte die zij niet kan bevredigen of tot zwijgen

brengen of bedaren.



       In zware pijn moet zij blijven, tot op het ogenblik dat onze

Heer haar troost en plaatst in een andere manier van minne en van

begeerte, in nog grotere kennis van Hem. Dan moet zij werken

volgens wat haar wordt gegeven door onze Heer.



De vierde manier van minne.



       Onze Heer is gewoon ons nog een andere manier van minne te

geven, nu eens in grote verrukking, dan weer in grote pijnen, en

daarover willen wij nu spreken.



       Het gebeurt dat de minne zoetjes in de ziel gewekt wordt en

blij opstaat, en dat ze zich beweegt in het hart, zonder enig

toedoen van menselijke inspanning. 



       En zo wordt dan dat hart teder geraakt door minne, en zo vol

hevig verlangen tot binnen in de minne getrokken, en zo

hartelijk bevangen door minne, en zo sterk overheerst door minne,

en zo lieflijk behelst door de minne, dat zij helemaal overwonnen

wordt door de minne. 



       Hierin ervaart zij een sterke verbondenheid met God, een

geestelijke klaarheid, een wonderlijke zaligheid, een nobele

vrijheid, een verrukkelijke zoetheid, een grote overmacht van

sterke minne, en een overvloedige volheid van grote vreugde. Dan

ervaart zij dat al haar zinnen één zijn in de greep van de minne

en haar wil minne geworden is, en dat zij toch zo diep verzonken

en verzwolgen is in de afgrond van de minne, en zelf geheel minne

geworden is. 



       De schoonheid van de minne heeft haar opgegeten. De kracht

van de minne heeft haar verteerd. De zoetheid van de minne heeft

haar in het niet doen verzinken. De grootheid van de minne heeft haar

verzwolgen.

 

       De adel van de minne heeft haar omhelsd. De puurheid van de

minne heeft haar de hoogste ontplooiing laten bereiken. De

verhevenheid van de minne heeft haar naar boven getrokken en

ééngemaakt op zo'n manier, dat zij helemaal van minne wezen moet,

en niet anders meer leven kan dan met de minne. 



       Als zij op die manier zichzelf ervaart in die overvloed van

zaligheid, en in die volkomen en grote volheid van hart, dan

verzinkt haar geest helemaal in de minne en ontgaat haar lichaam

haar, en smelt haar hart weg en wordt al haar kracht onbruikbaar.



       Zozeer wordt zij overwonnen door de minne dat zij nauwelijks

zichzelf beheersen kan, en zij dikwijls geen macht meer heeft

over al haar leden en zinnen. 



       En evenals een boordevol vat onmiddellijk overvloeit en

overstroomt wanneer men erin roert, zo wordt zij plotseling hevig

beroerd en helemaal overwonnen door de grote volheid van haar

hart en wel zó dat zij dikwijls in weerwil van zichzelf uitbreken

moet.



       Terzelfder tijd geschiedt het ook, als vijfde manier van

minne, dat de minne krachtig in de ziel opgewekt wordt, en

overweldigend opstaat met grote ontstuimigheid en met grote

hartstocht, alsof ze met geweld het hart van de ziel breken wou,

en de ziel trekken wou uit en boven zichzelf in de loutering van

en het falen in de minne. 



       Krachtig wordt zij ook bewogen om de grote opgaven van het

minnewerk tot stand te brengen of de verschillende opdrachten van

de minne uit te voeren.

 

       Ofwel begeert zij te rusten in de zoete omhelzingen van minne,

in de begeerlijke zaligheid en in de voldaanheid van wat zij van

Hem heeft. Haar hart en haar zintuigen zoeken er ernstig naar en

streven er vurig naar. In deze gesteldheid, is zij zo krachtig

van geest, zeer ondernemend van hart en sterk van lichaam, zo

vlug in het werken en druk doende van buiten en van binnen, dat

het haar toeschijnt alsof alles wat met haar te maken heeft werkt

en bezig is, al is zij nog zo rustig van buiten. 



       Daarbij voelt zij een sterk verdriet van binnen en een grote

gespannen verwachting omtrent de minne en veel wissel-

valligheden in de begeerte, en veelsoortig leed van diep

ongenoegen. Of zij ervaart zielewee door het grote gevoel van de

minne zelf, zonder enig waarom, of daarom omdat zij bijzonder

veeleisend is ten aanzien van het verlangen naar minne, of omdat

zij misnoegd is over het wegblijven van de minne.



       Bij dit alles wordt de minne zo onmatig en breekt ze zodanig

uit in de ziel, zoals ze daar zo sterk en zo verwoed in het hart

brandt, dat het haar toeschijnt dat haar hart herhaaldelijk

pijnlijk verwond wordt, en dat de wonden dagelijks vernieuwd en

pijnlijker gemaakt worden door nog smartelijker wee en nieuwe

gevoelspijnen. Het lijkt haar alsof haar aderen openbreken, en

haar bloed verhit wordt, en haar merg uitteert, en haar benen

verzwakken en haar borst verzengt, en haar keel uitdroogt zodat

haar gezicht en al haar ledematen deelhebben aan de hitte

daarbinnen, aan die 'orewoet' van de minne. Dan voelt zij ook een

pijl door haar hart gaan tot de keel, en verder tot de hersenen,

alsof zij haar zinnen kwijtraken zou. 



       En zoals een verslindend vuur dat alles tot zich trekt en

verteert wat het vernietigen kan, zo voelt zij dat de minne

blakend in haar woedt, zonder haar te sparen en zonder maat, en

dat ze alles tot zich neemt en verteert. Hierdoor wordt zij zwaar

gekwetst en haar hart zeer verzwakt en al haar kracht te niet

gedaan. 



       Maar eigenlijk wordt haar ziel gesterkt, en wordt haar minne

gekoesterd en haar geest in spanning gehouden. Want zozeer is de

minne boven de bevattelijkheid verheven, dat de ziel de eenheid

met haar niet op eigen kracht verkrijgen kan.



       Soms wil zij met alle zielewee de band breken en uit de

minne-eenheid losscheuren. Maar het minne-verbond heeft haar zo

in zijn greep en door de overmaat van minne is zij zo volkomen

overwonnen dat zij geen redelijke maat meer houden kan of op een

verstandelijke wijze rekenschap geven kan, of zich met maat

intomen kan, of verstandig zichzelf blijven kan.



       Hoe meer haar wordt gegeven van boven des te meer zij vraagt,

en hoe meer haar meegedeeld wordt, des te meer het verlangen

groeit om in begeerte nader te komen tot het licht van de

waarheid en van de zuiverheid, van de adel en van het genot van

minne. Altijd weer opnieuw wordt zij getrokken en meer en meer

geprikkeld en niets voldoet of verzadigt haar. Wat haar het meest

heelt en haar wonden geneest, dat alleen geeft haar gezondheid.



De zesde minne :



       Wanneer de bruid van onze Heer gevorderd en opgeklommen is

naar groter heil, ervaart zij nog een andere manier van minne,

inniger verbonden en met hogere kennis. 



       Zij voelt dat de minne alle weerstand in haar overwonnen

heeft, en dat zij alle tekorten hersteld en haar zinnen in haar

macht gebracht heeft. Zonder tegenstand is zij zichzelf volkomen

meester geworden, zodat zij haar hart veilig weet en het in rust

gebruiken mag en zich in vrijheid beijveren mag.



       In deze toestand schijnen alle dingen haar gering, gemakkelijk

te doen en te laten, licht te dulden en te verdragen, zoals dat

tot de waardigheid van de minne behoort. 



       Dan is het haar aangenaam zich te oefenen in de minne. Dan ook

ervaart zij een Goddelijke macht en een klare zuiverheid en een

geestelijke zoetheid en een begeerlijke vrijheid en een

onderscheidende wijsheid en een rustige toegankelijkheid van God.



       En dan is zij gelijk een huisvrouw die haar huis goed verzorgd

heeft. Die het op een verstandige wijze ingericht en mooi op orde

gesteld heeft. Die het wijs beschermt, het verstandig behoedt,

en die volgens plan werkt. Zij brengt binnen en buiten. Zij doet

en laat al naar haar wil.



       Zo is het ook gesteld met deze ziel : de minne heerst geweldig

in haar, werkt machtig en rust in haar, doet en laat, innerlijk

en uiterlijk ; en dat alles naar haar wil. Net zoals een vis

zwemt in de wijdheid van de zee, en uitrust in de diepte, of een

vogel die vliegt in de ruimte en hoogte van de lucht, zo voelt

zij haar geest ongebonden omgaan in de diepte, ruimte en hoogte

van de minne.



       Deze overmacht van minne heeft de ziel aangetrokken en

begeleid, behoed en beschermd. Ze heeft haar het verstand en de

wijsheid gegeven, de zoetheid en de sterkte van de minne. Toch

heeft ze haar geweld voor de ziel verborgen gehouden totdat zij

tot een grotere hoogheid opgeklommen is en helemaal vrij is

geworden van zichzelf, en de minne met meer kracht in haar

heerst. 



       Dan maakt de minne haar zo sterk en zo vrij dat zij geen mens

of duivel, geen engel of heilige, God zélf niet ontziet in al haar doen

 en laten, in haar werk of haar rust. 



       Zij weet heel goed dat de minne in haar is, geheel wakker en

even sterk werkend in de rust van het lichaam als in het vele

werken. Zij weet heel goed en wordt gewaar dat de minne niet

gelegen is in het zwoegen en zweten van hen waarin ze soeverein

heerst.



       Maar allen die tot de minne willen komen, moeten haar zoeken

met ontzag, moeten haar trouw volgen en haar met hevig verlangen

beoefenen. Ze slagen daar niet in als ze zich veel gezwoeg en

inspanning en het ondergaan van ongemakken besparen. En alle

kleine dingen moeten ze groot achten tot op het ogenblik dat ze

ertoe komen dat de minne binnen hen heersen gaat, waardoor de

minne met overmacht soeverein wordt en alle dingen gering maakt

en alle gezwoeg verzacht, en alle inspanning zoet maakt, en alle

schulden betaalt. 



       Dit is vrijheid van geweten en zoetheid van hart, en reinheid

van zeden en gemoed, en adel van de ziel, en verhevenheid van de

geest en beginsel van het eeuwige leven. 



       De ziel leeft reeds op aarde als een engel, en daarop volgt

het eeuwige leven, dat God ons allen in zijn goedheid moge geven

(...) 



                   (eindigde haar tekst in 1236 hier ?)



De zevende manier van minne :



       De gelukzalige ziel heeft nog een subliemere manier van minne

die haar niet weinig te doen geeft van binnen. Zij wordt getrokken

boven de mensenmaat van de minne, boven de zinnen en de rede, 

hoger dan alles waartoe ons hart uit zichzelf in staat is. 



       Uitsluitend met de minne van de eeuwigheid zelf wordt zij

getrokken in de eeuwigheid van de minne, in de onvatbare wijsheid

en de stille hoogheid, in de diepe afgrond van de Godheid die

alles is in al wat bestaat, onvatbaar verheven boven alles, 

onvergankelijk, almachtig, alomvattend, en die alheersend handelt

in al wat bestaat.



       Zo innig is zij hier in de minne verzonken en zo sterk wordt

zij door haar begeerte getrokken, dat haar hart heftig bewogen

wordt en ongedurig is van binnen, zodat haar ziel uitvloeit en

smelt van de minne, en haar geest vurig verhangen is aan een

sterk verlangen. 



       Al haar zinnen leggen er zich op toe, dat zij mag leven in het

genot van de minne. Volhardend verlangt zij dit van God en met

heel haar hart verzoekt zij God hierom. 



       Dit moet zij zeer begeren, want de minne laat haar niet tot

rust of op verhaal komen. Geen rustig leven. De minne verheft

haar en drukt haar neer, stelt haar plotseling op de proef en

kwelt haar weer. Ze brengt de dood en geeft het leven, ze maakt

gezond en verwondt opnieuw. Ze maakt krankzinnig en dan weer

wijs.



       Zo verheft ze haar tot een hoger zijn. Zo is zij geestelijk

opgeklommen, boven de tijdelijkheid en naar de eeuwigheid van de

minne, die zonder tijd is. Boven de menselijke vormen van minne

en boven haar eigen natuur is zij verheven door het verlangen

daar boven te leven.



       Dààr is haar wezen en wil, haar begeerte en minne van de

zekere waarheid, de zuivere klaarheid, de edele hoogheid, de

weelderige schoonheid en het zoete gezelschap van de hoogste

geesten die allen vervuld zijn van overvloedige minne, en die in

klare erkenning in het bezit en het genot van hun minne zijn.



       Dan begeert zij daar onder de geesten te verblijven en het

meest onder de laaiende serafijnen. In de verheven Godheid en

Drievuldigheid vindt zij haar liefelijke rustplaats en haar vreugdige

woning. 



       Zij zoekt Hem tot in zijn majesteit, zij volgt Hem tot daar

en aanschouwt Hem met haar hart en met haar geest. Zij kent Hem

en bemint Hem en begeert Hem zo zeer, dat zij geen heiligen, geen

mensen, geen engelen of schepselen achten kan, tenzij met

dezelfde minne waarmee zij alles door Hem bemint. Hem alleen

heeft zij in minne verkozen, boven en onder en in al het andere. 



       Met alles wat haar hart aan begeerte opbrengen kan, en met

heel de kracht van haar geest, verlangt zij ernaar Hem te zien

en te bezitten en te genieten. 



       Daarom is het aardrijk haar een grote ellende, en een harde

gevangenis en een zwaar leed. Zij minacht de wereld, de aarde

valt haar zwaar en wat het aardrijk toebehoort kan haar niet

bevredigen of voldoen. Het is haar een grote pijn dat zij zo ver

moet wezen en wel een vreemdeling lijkt.

 

       Haar ellende kan zij niet vergeten, haar begeerte kan niet

gestild worden, haar verlangen kwelt haar jammerlijk, en hierdoor

wordt zij bovenmatig en zonder genade gekweld en gepijnigd.

Daarom leeft zij in een groot verlangen en in een sterke begeerte

om uit deze ellende bevrijd te worden en van dit lichaam

ontbonden te zijn. Dan zegt zij met een droevig hart, zoals de

apostelen, : "Cupio dissolvi et esse cum Christo". D.w.z. "Ik

verlang ontbonden te worden en verenigd te zijn met Christus."



       Niet uit verdriet om het heden of uit vrees voor toekomstig

leed maar alleen uit heilige en eeuwige minne begeert zij gretig,

smachtend en vol verlangen te gaan naar het landschap van de

eeuwigheid, in de glorie van het genot.     



       Dit verlangen is in haar groot en sterk, en haar ondraaglijke

toestand is zwaar en hard, en de pijn die zij uit begeerte lijdt

is onnoemelijk groot. 



       Toch moet zij in hoop leven, en het is net deze die haar doet

reikhalzen en wegkwijnen. 



       O heilige begeerte van de minne, hoe sterk is uw kracht in de

minnende ziel ! Het is een zalige passie, een scherpe foltering,

een langdurige smart, een verraderlijke dood, een stervend leven !      



       Daarboven kan zij nog niet komen en hier beneden heeft zij

rust noch duur. De gedachte aan Hem kan zij van verlangen niet

meer dragen, en Hem ontberen is door haar begeerte een foltering.

Aldus moet zij leven met groot ongemak. 



       Daarom kan en wil zij niet getroost worden, zoals de profeet

zegt : "Renuit consolare animam meam." d.w.z. "Mijn ziel wil niet

getroost worden".



       Zodoende wijst zij elke troost door God zelf of zijn schepselen

af. Want het genot dat dit haar kan geven verleent de minne 

nieuwe kracht. Het stuwt haar begeerte naar nieuwe hoogten

en vernieuwt haar verlangen om zich aan de minne te wijden, van

de minne te genieten en haar ballingschap zonder enig genot te

dragen.



       Zo blijft zij onverzadigd en onbevredigd, ondanks alle giften,

omdat zij de aanwezigheid van haar minne nog missen moet. 



       Dit is een heel zwaar leven, want zij wil niet getroost worden

als zij niet verkregen heeft wat zij zo rusteloos zoekt.



       De minne heeft haar voortgetrokken en geleid en geleerd haar

weg te gaan. Deze heeft zij trouw gevolgd, dikwijls met veel

moeite en inspanning, in grote geestelijke machteloosheid, met

sterke begeerte, met veel ongeduld, in grote onrust, in wel en

wee, met menig leed, in zoeken en vragen, in gemis en bezit, in

groeiende en dalende zekerheid, in navolging en verlangen, in

zorgen en angst, in wegkwijnen en bederven. Met veel trouw en

ontrouw is zij in lief en leed tot alles bereid. Dood of levend

wil zij de minne toebehoren. En in het innigste van haar hart

lijdt zij. 



       Omwille van de minne wil zij het rijk van de hemelen verdienen.

Als zij hier in alle ellende op de proef gesteld wordt, dan is in die

glorie daar al haar toevlucht. Want precies daarin is het werk van 

de minne gelegen, dat ze het nabije wezen begeert, en het meest 

dat nabijzijn nastreeft waarin ze het meeste minnen kan. Daarom

wil zij steeds de minne volgen, minne ervaren en van minne genieten, 

en dit kan haar hier in deze ellende niet te beurt vallen ...



       Naar haar eigen land toe, waar zij haar woning heeft

gegrondvest, en waarin zij met minne en met begeerte rust ! Alle

belemmeringen weggenomen, wordt zij liefelijk door liefde

ontvangen. Dààr zal zij eindelijk aanschouwen wat zij zo teder

bemind heeft, en zij zal Diegene die zij zo trouw gediend heeft

bezitten voor de eeuwigheid. Zij zal met vreugde van Diegene

genieten die zij zo vaak in haar ziel met minne heeft omhelsd.

 

       Dààr zal zij blij van hart binnentreden, zoals St. Augustinus

het zegt : "Qui in Te intrat in gaudium Domini sui ...", d.w.z.

"O Heer, wie binnentreedt in U, hij gaat binnen in de vreugde van

zijn Heer.". Daar is geen plaats voor angst. Want daar zal hij

Hem bezitten op de beste manier in het allerbeste.



       Dààr is de ziel bij haar Bruidegom en wordt zij geheel één

geest met Hem in onscheidbare trouw en in wederkerige liefde

voor altijd. De ziel die alles voor Hem over had ten tijde van

de genade zal van Hem genieten in de eeuwige glorie, waar men

niets anders zal doen dan loven en minnen. Moge God ons allen

daar toe brengen. Zo is het.

Preface



The Empty Set has three angles of approach : a) objective

nothingness, b) subjective 'agnosia' & c) unknowing knowledge.

A) is mathematical (Zero) ; B) is (optimally) philosophical

(Socrates), whereas C) is a blend of both ; if someone claims to

know everything his omniscience is the knowledge of knowing

naught. The wise know this knowledge to be built upon the idea

of 'all possibility'. Thus knowing all they terminate becoming

by realizing their potentiality.



Slowly facts convinced me that the limits of our

'consensus/adequatio'-reality (nominal Universe) are not the

limits of the possible World (Cosmos). As the periphery of a

paradigm is the 'impact-zone' of the change coming from beyond

the limitations of the model, its study is very important to

guarantee the future of Man's creativity. For at the periphery

a circumambulation of the 'area' of a given paradigm is made

possible. In this way borderlines can be better observed & new

links with the 'hard core' can be easier established (preparing

the advent of a radical paradigmatic change of perspective).

Without this perspective science is bound to fossilize.



---



Introduction



Let me briefly summarize all mayor philosophical 'options'

contained herein :



* logical : (non) Fregian approach, dialogal logic of action &

coherence ;

* epistemological : 

theoria : strict nominalism, constructivism & regulative

criticism ; 

praxis : participative method, functionalism & pragmatism ;

* ontological : critical illusionism, hylic pluralism,

energetism, apophatism ; 

* esthetical : exemplarism, illuminism, anarchism & eco-lyricism ;

* ethical : neo-humanism, enlightened Edenism & planetary

participationism ;

* metaphysical : unitarism, pluri-realism, absurdism ;

* antropological : functionalism, genetic rationalism,

intuitivism ;

* mysticological : study of the mystical knowledge-manipulation

(yoga & Western tradition both mystical & ceremonial).



One of the results of contemporary philosophical reflection

on the 'science-factory' is the notion that the scientific

language-game is a) open, incomplete (on the move), confined to

well-defined limits & pragmatical ; b) a conventional &

historical paradigm accepted by a very small number of humans ;

c) impossible without 'metaphysical' background-data & a doubtful

'ceteris paribus'-clause. So the notion of 'science' as an

exclusive 'Via Regia' to a full understanding of the empty 'rock-

bottom' of Reality is history.   



Science (like theology) does not escape the inevitable fact that

no two observers share identical perspectives  (all the rest being

merely conventional, i.e. practical and utilitarian). This means that

the exclusiveness of the scientific language-game has been replaced

by the idea of a plurality of language-games (each seeking to

olve the question : what is Life all about ?). 



How to 'translate' the answer of physical equations to that

of theology : God ? How to elaborate the connection between these

two games (played by most humans) ? It is clear to me that con-

sciousness is the only 'tertium comparationis'. So only the

direct experience of both 'reality-for-us' and the 'meta-nominal'

will be helpful to an 'enlightened science'. 

          

When the aim of genuine religion (individual spiritual

emancipation ending with enlightenment) is combined with the

formal-empirical method, an experiental technology triggering the

emergence of spiritual consciousness ensues (mysticology). In

it, emphasis is placed on a universal orthopraxis & its 'code'.

Theology is important as soon as consciousness needs to

understand what is really happening.

A selection of quotations out of the Prima Materia of the book.



---

 

PRIMA MATERIA



1. Prima MATERIA : our Unknowing Knowledge, Cosmos & Full-

Emptiness.



* 1.1. The continuous use of the double difference between a)

'reality-as-such' (Kant's 'Ding-an-Sich') versus 'reality-for-us'

(or 'knowledge about the objective') and b) 'consensus-for-us'

versus 'consensus omnium' in the realm of cognition is the mental

operation engendering a critical attitude, seeking logical

clarity, workable knowledge & authentic emancipation.



1.1.1.5.4.1. It is clear to me that from a formal perspective

Self-experience is a paradoxical Idea. However, what is more

important ? Fact or Mind-fiction ?



1.1.1.5.4.2. Although Kant did his best to avoid giving contents

to the Self he was unable to formally understand the role played

by 'das Unbedingte' without introducing a 'Focus Imaginarius'.

He knew he had to say something to tighten his scheme but

preferred imagination instead of accepting the evident fact of

Self-experience. Its effect on 'practical' reason ? Kantians do

not understand action.



1.1.5.5. Theories concerning the meta-nominal are futile if the

meta-nominal experience is not shared (by introducing meta-

nominal conventions, sign-posts & check-points). In such a theory

naught arches the whole, i.e. it is never said that the Cause of

Causes 'exists'. So meta-nominal ontological illusion does not

tempt us ; we avoid :



'ontological conventionalism'

in nominal dimensions : what 'we' or 'I' think 'is' &

'theo-ontology'

in meta-nominal dimensions : what 'Self' experiences 'is' for all

other Selves.



1.1.7. Because people observe together & talk about their

experiences, synthesis of a possible 'paradigmatic' Universe-for-

us is made possible (the not-I's overlap). So 'objective

knowledge' is the final (relative and dynamic) 'picture of the

World' established through dialogue (regulated by idealism) and

observation (regulated by realism). Only when these two extreme

positions merge into one 'Focus Imaginarius' (Kant) has the

essential tension, with which Mind solves the spatio-temporal

formal-operatoric problems of the nominal Universe, produced so-

called 'objective knowledge'.



1.1.7.2. Knowledge will be relatively stable if and only if

(horizontally) democratic law is implemented & (vertically) the

pyramid of knowledge is considered 'de iuris' as being

'truncated' (symbolizing the fact that formal reason needs meta-

nominal dimensions in order to solve its 'higher equations'). 



1.1.7.3. The string : "'Reality-for-us' (facts) - 'Reality-for-

me' (consciousness) & 'Paradigmata (dialogue)" defines the

trichotomy of a critical & 'empty' (without "rock bottom")

epistemology. 'Fundamental Reality' can never be a fact as long

as objective & subjective limitations prevail. Only the absolute

I (or Monad) can be said to abide in the 'hyper-existing' unity

of object & subject. Beyond this we only know for sure that we

know nothing, being (at the top) -unknowing.  Facts (nominal &

meta-nominal) are the unity of 'a reality' & 'a paradigm'

consciously experienced (as a dual-union) in a context of a local

area of knowledge-production. Nothing & nobody experiences all

completely & constantly.



* 1.2. Cosmos (all possible reality) has, ex hypothesi, 24

dimensions (orientations or reference-frames) & three 8-

dimensional operators. The nominal Universe is a 12th-dimensional

part of Cosmos (each of its operators having 4 dimensions). Its

origin is thought off as singular & finite ; whereas the 'Alpha'

of the latter is clouded by our unknowing ('Omega').



1.2.3. Per definition M is the set of facts organized by a

functional 'real number'-differential (R ) describing the

movements of sub-atomic particles & waves operating according to

the Schrödinger's wave-equation of a quantum-state |phi|. Squaring

the function of a quantumstate or M-wave (de Broglie) we obtain

the probability of its position (Schrödinger ; 'point-on-a-

plane'-mathematics). Position & momentum can not be both

accurately determined (Heisenberg). No M without a margin of

error. 



1.2.4. I is the set of facts concerning all organized codes based

upon Natural numbers (N ) used by Nature & Man (culture) for the

survival of living substance & its environment. So code (or I)

implies logical identification (M logical contradiction) and a

point-on-a-line-geometry. All I is incomplete. The consistency

of a code can not be proven from within it (Gödel). I has four

dimensi2ons, so every item has four levels of order. Because every

code is an ordered pattern of possible order, code and syntax are

very related. Code defines the informational Universe.



1.2.5. C is the set of all auto-definitions of position &

momentum made by the Monad, Self-expressing Itself in the I.M.-

Universe (& moving on its unique cosmodesic - viz. Esthetica).

 

1.2.5.1. Auto-definition is the core of C. Through it C gives

meaning to I & M. So C is logically first. What neo-Kantians call

'reflection' is a form of auto-definition. 



1.2.5.2. Together, points become sets, compounds or systems :



* subatomic, atomic, molecular & mineral systems (dim 1) ;

* bio-synthetic systems (dim 2) ;

* motoric-instinctual systems (dim 3) ;

* intelligent systems (dim 4).



1.2.5.3. Each system is characterized by a particular type of 'C'

or type of definition of position & momentum. The degree with

which a system is able to move beyond the conditions of the

dimensions constituting its possibilities of action is called its

'degree of liberty'. Nominal C lives between the infinitely small

& the infinitely large (Pascal). Meta-nominal C is a synthesis

of the spectrum of C.



1.2.6. In the nominal Universe 'C' can be understood as the

functional result of interactions between 'M' & 'I' or C (n) =

f (M (n) , I (n)). So nominal C is 4-dimensional, allowing for

'nominal' experiences (or 'nominal' bodies of facts). C suggests

a point-in-(possible) space-geometry.



1.2.7. C is measured in complex numbers (or Com ), for its

definition contains a paradox (balanced by material uncertainty

& informational incompleteness) symbolized by the 'imaginary'

extension of C : for the square root of - 1 (or 'i') has no

ordinary solution. The basic equation for all conscious activity

is : C (x) i = M (x) + I (x) . i

      

1.2.10.1. The apex of nominal C is the formal state,

mathematically expressing a unifying code of life. Nominal C

develops from libidinal to formal cognition. As soon as formal

C is established, repetition of the underlying universal

energetical cycle results (the Buddhist  'Wheel of Dharma').



1.2.10.2. Energy (E) is the result of difference(s) between M and

I mediated by C, causing a change in position & momentum.



1.2.13. Cosmos is a layered continuum. Its strands are coded

using the set of natural numbers in order to organize the Cosmic

layers (in a general way). In particular we make use of the

subset of 'original' natural numbers, i.e. the string 1 ... 10

With each of these numbers we let a transfinite string of

(relative) infinities correspond. Each string is a 'mathematical

archetype' of one aspect of our unknowing regarding ultimate

absolute infinity (Hilbert's Omega or  ). 



1.2.14. The different transfinite numbers  we are looking for can

be deduced on the  basis of following rules : a) if 'a' is a

number then a+1 is the next number ; b) if a rising sequence

 of numbers occurs then it is possible to find a number larger

than all a's or lim (a). So if we have 

0, 1, 2, ... n / lim n = a number beyond all finite numbers (n) 

called 'w' (Cantor). If we apply the rules to 'w' we arrive at :

             

 0. The Empty Set 0, 1, 2, ... n / lim n = w  (Aleph-0) ;



1.2.14.1. Rules for addition :

              

10. w, w+1, w+2, ...  w+n / lim  w+n =  w+w or  w.2 

9.  w.2+1,  w.2+2, ...  w.2+n / lim  w.2+n = w.2+n orw.3 

             

1.2.14.2. Rules for multiplication & powers :

             

8.  w.3,  w.4, ...  w.n /lim  w.n = w.w =  w² 

7.  w²,w³ ... wn   / lim wn = ww = (2)w  

             

1.2.14.3. Rules for tetration :        

             

6. (2)w, (3)w, ... (n)w / lim (n)w = (w)w   or Epsilon-0 

             ((3)10 = three times 10 to the 10th) 

             

1.2.14.4.  By restructuring the (infinite)  set an infinite 

number can always be added to it. Aleph-1 is the first number 

that does not allow for this. It represents an 'order of infinity' 

larger than 'w'

             

5.    Aleph 1, ...  Aleph n/lim  Aleph n = Aleph w     

4.    Aleph w, ...  Aleph w+n/lim Aleph w+n = Aleph w+w  

3.    Aleph w.2+1, ...   Aleph w.2+n/lim Aleph w.2+n = w.3

2.    Aleph w.3, Aleph w.n ...  Aleph w²/lim Aleph wn =Aleph ww

1.    Aleph (2)w, ... Aleph (n)w  / lim Aleph (n)w  = Aleph (w)w  ;

             

 0. Omega : Ultimate Absolute Infinity : full-emptiness



1.3.3. The UEC is projected upon the plane of C. Moreover,

nominal C results from these interactions, whereas meta-nominal

C is able to alter (parts of) the UEC. C (being mirror-like) will

reflect the contents projected upon it as a result of the UEC.

Nominal C is not able to make the liberating distinction between

C & I/M.



1.3.3.1. Two types of nominal C result from the first moment of

the UEC : involutive C (dim C = 1, 2 & 3) & evolutive (dim C =

4). The involutive type of C lacks a formal unificatoric

intention. It has libidinal, tribal & imitative orientations

only. The evolutive type of C lacks the meta-nominal dimensions

of C, and so is unable to change the causal circumstances of

nominal existence (or life's 'fate'). The highest top of this

evolutive type is a global world order organizing ecology,

demography, E, primary goods (food, clothing, housing etc),

health & education for all human beings (first neo-humanistic

postulate). Why ? Because humanity will not survive if it does

not aknowledge the solidarity between all different living beings

emerging from one spiritual source (second neo-humanistic

postulate).



1.3.3.3. Five dimensional C implies 'synchronicity', the 'Via

Regia' to the 'nunc stans' (Boëthius) & the wonderful science &

art of philosophy. A synchronistic event implies the sudden &

meaningful 'coincidence' of a subjective item of great conscious

symbolic pressure (subject) with a limited set of experienced

facts clearly related to this subjective meaning (or object) ;

all this within the boundaries of a finite and contained part of

the nominal Universe (for-me & for-us). As a faculty synchro-

nicity could be compared with serendipity. It implies a stable

access to the meta-nominal.



1.3.3.4. Magic(k) brings about change according to true will. Of

all conditions to operate magic(k) the laws of utterance and

assimilation are central (in order to precipitate change). In

order to add a new dimension to 5 dim C, C must be able to a)

utter its true will in a clear & determinated way & b) assimilate

negativity (the reflex-current of the original magic(k)al intention).



1.3.3.5. As soon as all possible circumstances are controlled

because the probability-fields of M are understood to change in

accordance with true will (as every "that" is experienced as 'my

will'), 6 dim C returns to the 'Fatherland' or 'Edenic state',

i.e. merges with 'the One'. From the experience of the related-

ness between C and its 'origin' (mystical experience) ensues the

"suchness"-perspective of which nothing can be revealed except

the prolonged, deep & refreshing laughter of those able to

experience 'hyper-existence' directly.



Meta-nominal dimensions of C :



4 dim C = here-ness : localization, solidification, everyman ;

5 dim C = now-ness : globalization, dynamization, comedian ;

6 dim C = that-ness : alteration, spiritualization, magus ;

7 dim C = such-ness : deification, hyper-realization, mystic ;

8 dim C = full-emptiness : the Empty Set, the Void, Virtual

Potentiality, no-body.



1.3.4.1. Point : no dimension, only position definable by

reference to coordinate axes, i.e. secundary principles which

only pertain to it 'per accidens' & which must be postulated in

order to let our mathematical conception of it grow (i.e.

extending the first principle). 

 

1.3.4.2. Radius or Line : one-dimensional set of points defining

2a 'line', i.e. one axis (R) beginning (alpha) & ending (omega)

(Point + finite addition of Unity), formulating a one-dimensional

'space' or 'accidental extension' of the first principle (Point)

through Self-addition ; the creation of 'two' out of 'one' or the

'dyadification' of the 'one' Point. 



1.3.4.3. Circumference : two-dimensional set of points defining

a 'plane', i.e. two coordinate axes defining a two-dimensional

'limiting space', the particularity of a circle-plane being that

the distance of all Points (in a plane) from the (given) Point

is a fixed constant (R). 



1.3.4.4. Sphere : three-dimensional set of points, defining a

'solid plane' ; actually the infinite set of all circle-planes

defined by a constant R. In this 'solid' space the Idea of

Circumference is pushed to transfinite limits. The localized

manifestation of unity is 'permutated' to allow for variety

within variety limited by original unity.

 

1.3.4.4.1. If R tends towards infinity then the curvature of the

sphere-surface tends to 0 : a 'coincidentio oppositorum' (Nicolas

of Cusa). 



1.3.4.4.2. If R is infinite then the middle-point of the sphere

is everywhere, i.e. every point of the sphere is its middle-point

(Luria).



1.3.4.5. Horizon : illusionary ever-escaping boundary created

when (positioned in the middle) the sphere is divided into two

hemispheres. The horizon manifests as the limit of the dividing

observer.



1.3.4.6. Zenith (nadir) : only when a source of light culminates

are all shadows temporarily reduced to nil.



* 1.4. Full-emptiness (shunyata) lies at the root of the mystic

experience of Cosmos (the 'Divine Comedy' or 7 dim C). Mystics

experience the Creator of Cosmos (the 'First Cause') directly. 



1.4.1. Mystics understand full-emptiness to be the 'essence' of

the Creator of Cosmos. Logic teaches that nothing never is, that

out of nothing only no-thing ensues. Full-emptiness is

unconditional & absolute. We acknowledge its unknowability &

postulate our paradoxical understanding of it.<pre><hr><a href="#top">Return to the Top of this Page.</a></body></htlm>

Sugar cane</h1>


<font size=4>Sugar cane, a giant grass from the same family as sorghum and maize, thrives in the heat and damp of tropical climates - so most of it comes from the Third World<p>

<center></center><br clear=all>

<hr width=71%><p>


<br><br>

Growing up to five metres high, with stalks 5cm thick, canes can be propagated from cut stems. Once the cane has been cut, the stubble sprouts again for the following year. This process, called ratooning, can get a yearly harvests from cane for up to seven years<p>

<br clear=all><p>
<hr width=71%><p>




Sugar can be converted into ethanol for use as motor fuel. Brazil started 'gasahol' production in an attempt to use up sugar stocks, but the rise in oil prices in the late 70s made sugar-fuel an attractive alternative for many Brazilians. Now almost half Brazil's sugar output goes to make fuel<br clear=all><p><hr width=71%><p>

<br><br>

Sugar cane is tough enough to survive floods, cyclones, and hurricanes, but in many places it is still cut by hand. Controlled burning removes the leaves: this reduces the sucrose content, but makes the crop easier to harvest<br clear=all>
<p>
<hr width=71%><p>



<center></center><br>

Although most sugar cane is grown for commercial use, some is grown by small farmers for their own consumption<p><hr width=71%><p>



<br>


Cane has to be processed soon after cutting. It is washed, shredded, and crushed, then the extract soaked in water. The mixture is heated until the water evaporates, leaving concentrated sucrose which crystallises into 'raw' sugar. By-products are molasses (used to make rum), baker's yeast, and cattle feed, and fibrous bagasse, used to fuel the sugar factory

<title>Family planning: the male point of view</title>

<h1>Family planning: the male point of view</h1>

<b>by Malcolm Potts</b><p>








<b>All reasonable people subscribe to the ideal of a loving human family, where the man shares in all levels of bringing up his children.  At the same time, when it comes to mating and parenting, men and women have different needs and expectations.  Here, <i>Malcolm Potts, President of International Family Health and Bixby Professor of Population and International Health at the University of California at Berkeley</i>, looks at male attitudes to family planning methods and services.</b><p>




In the animal world the sex that makes the greatest investment in reproduction tends to adopt the most cautious mating behaviour and the one that makes least investment tends to be more competitive and risk taking.  Birds such as penguins and swans are monogamous because both sexes are able to incubate the eggs and bring food to the fledglings.  In mammals, however, biology forces the females to make a disproportionate investment in pregnancy and breast-feeding, and therefore most male mammalian species are polygamous.  The males compete for access to females but they make no investment whatsoever in their offspring other than to supply the fertilizing sperm.<p>






Human beings are unusual in that all societies recognize a male interest in his children and men naturally nurture, protect and educate their children.  However, parenting remains an asymmetrical investment.  In practically every known society men are more likely than women to have extra-marital affairs, but when divorce occurs the women nearly always end up caring for the children.<p>




Overall, women have good reasons to be more concerned and careful over family planning because they have more to lose.  But men have an equally strong desire to separate the pleasures of sex from the cost of bringing up children.  For both sexes family planning providers must make services accessible and take the perceptions of users into account.  Are men more interested in the erotic aspects of contraception?  Do they sometimes seek group solidarity?  Do they want to be assured of their partner's faithfulness?  Family planning is listening to what people want, not telling them what to do.<p>



<h4>Male orientated services</h4>
In Iran in the 1960s an alert psychologist called Siassi noted only 12 per cent of women who began taking oral contraceptives were still using them six months later.  Instead of blaming the consumer for this disappointing result, he changed the distribution system. He gathered together the husbands of the same group of women and told them how Pills worked and distributed the contraceptives to the men to pass on to their wives.  The continuation rate at six months jumped to over 80 per cent.  No change in pharmacology ever led to such a dramatic change in use as this alteration to the distribution system.  Clearly, Iranian men were comfortable seeing their wives use contraception if they could be directly involved, but threatened if the women appeared to act unilaterally.  Outsiders may hope Iranian society will evolve to give women greater autonomy, but in the real world helping couples avoid unintended pregnancies is an immediate and real liberation of women.<p>


<h4>Many men accept vasectomy</h4>

Male attitudes have not proved a barrier to the adoption of vasectomy.  The problem is creating commonsense services that men can attend.  Vasectomies outnumber tubal ligations (female sterilization) in Ireland because some family doctors provide them, while tubal ligation is not performed in Catholic hospitals.  In South Korea in the 1960s vasectomy exceeded tubal ligation because government policy made it available.  Most family planning services around the world are orientated towards women and it is a fairly simple rule that men, particularly from a traditional society, are not going to wait in a clinic crowded with women.  Dr Marcus de Castro of PROPATER showed this brilliantly in Brazil in the 1970s:  men who chose vasectomy tended to be those who divided their marital roles.  They were firemen, policemen, members of the armed services, who on the whole did not help with the washing up or volunteer to change the baby's nappies.<p>




The art of family planning is to provide a service the provider might not choose for him or herself, but which responds to the perceptions of the user.  In Bombay in the 1960s Dr Datta Pai<br> 

<pre>
</pre>
<ul><blockquote>
<font size=5><i>&quot;For both sexes we must make services accessible and respond to the perceptions of the users.&quot;</i></font><br></blockquote></ul>
<pre>
</pre>


noted that poor, illiterate men in India who wanted a vasectomy perceived a hospital to be somewhere where "you we nt to die".  Hence when he offered vasectomy in a hospital setting few men came.  When he offered the same operation on railway stations more vasectomies were performed in one month than had been done in hospitals in the previous year - if the operation could be done on platform 9 it must be safe!  In Bangkok thousands of vasectomies have been offered in a "camp" setting as part of the celebrations of the King of Thailand's birthday.  Unfortunately, ethnocentric Western advisers have browbeaten the Indian Government to stop promoting such events.<p>


<h4>Male unmet need for contraception</h4>

Many couples are happy with coitus interruptus (withdrawal) as a method of preventing pregnancy.  Withdrawal averts many more births than new methods like sub-dermal hormonal implants ever will, yet it receives almost no scientific attention and it is commonly dismissed as ineffective or as damaging to a sexual partnership.  The little objective data available, however, suggest that the failure rate for the method overlaps with that for condoms.  If a couple love each other they can achieve satisfaction when using coitus interruptus, and if they do not, then the best technology will not repair absent affection or lack of a wish to share in sexual pleasures.<p>




Easy availability and a sensitive ability to respond to the client's perceptions is the key to most family planning provision . The most useful and important male method remains the condom.  It is also the first line of defence against infection with a sexually transmitted disease and HIV transmission. In many countries (for example Ethiopia and Pakistan) condom sales in social marketing programmes are held back not by lack of demand, but by lack of supplies.  Given the appropriate promotion of correctly priced brands, sales will go up, and as some men use the method more will want to.<p>




Men will willingly become involved in family planning decisions if service providers try to see the world through their eyes, and focus resources on helping those with the greatest need.<p>

<b>German development cooperation is in a difficult phase. The Federal

government claims its aid is contributing to securing the global

future. But this is confronted by declining financial commitments

and a growing scepticism among the German public about the success

of development cooperation as a whole. So Bonn's development policy

is facing several challenges. It needs more money, sustainable

improvement of its effectiveness and efficiency, more influence

on other policies, intensive public relations, a more realistic

portrayal of the impacts development cooperation can achieve,

and a more precise determination of its role in Germany's relations

with developing countries.</b>

<P>

Germany's Official Development Assistance (ODA) began in 1952

with a financial contribution to a UN programme to support the

economic development of Third World countries. In 1956, the Foreign

Ministry set up a DM 50 million fund for bilateral aid. And at

the end of the 1950s the Bonn Parliament came out for an active

North south policy. The growing volume of aid, handled by various

federal ministries, as well as party politics within the conservative liberal

coalition government of the day, led to the establishment of the

Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation (BMZ) in 1961. Liberal

Free Democrat Walter Scheel was its first minister. In 1993, the

words &quot;and Development&quot; were added to its name.

Initially, the BMZ was a coordinating ministry. In 1964, it was

given competence for development cooperation principles and programmes,

as well as for Technical Cooperation (TC). In 1972, under minister

Erhard Eppler, its remit was expanded to cover bilateral and multilateral

Financial Cooperation (FC). It was only then that development

policy was established de facto as a separate policy.

<P>

<B>Quantitative aspects</B>

<P>

Measured against absolute ODA volumes, Germany is one of the world's

largest donors (1993: DM 11.5 billion, or US$ 6.95 billion). It

ranks fourth after Japan, the USA and France. But Germany's ODA-GNP

ratio positions it midfield among the 21 donor country members

of the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC). In 1993,

with an ODA-GNP share of 0.36 per cent, it came ninth.

<P>

Assessment of the ODA volume depends upon the frame of reference.

Germany's ODA appears marginal when compared, for example, with

its trade with developing countries (1993: exports plus imports

totalled about DM 200 billion). This is also the case when Bonn's

ODA is measured against its transfers to Germany's new eastern

Lander (states) of about DM 150 billion a year. These have recently

often been used as a yardstick. But on the other hand, German

ODA has to date exceeded private flows to developing countries

at market conditions.

<P>

No-one disputes that Germany has not yet achieved the UN's 0.7

per cent ODA GNP target, to which the Federal government again gave the nod

at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. Nor that Bonn has in recent years

dropped further away from it. The German ODA-GNP ratio reached

its high water mark in 1982/83 with 0.48 per cent. But since 1990

(0.42 per cent), its ODA share has fallen steadily. In 1993 it

was 0.36 per cent, and it dropped to 0.33 per cent in 1994.

<P>

True, Germany is not the only DAC donor with declining ODA-GNP

ratios. The ODA budgets of numerous other countries have been

squeezed for some years, justifying talk of a financial crisis

in international development assistance. But the drop in Germany's

ODA-GNP ratio is disproportionately large when measured against

the DAC average (1990: 0.33 per cent; 1993: 0.30 per cent). Bonn

blames public spending constraints for the fall. But development

cooperation's diminished political status in the Federal budget

must not be overlooked. BMZ's share of the budget, which covers

most of German ODA (see Table 1), dropped from 2.4 per cent in

1989 to 1.7 per cent in 1995 (its top share was 2.6 per cent),

and will probably hardly increase to 1998.

<P>

German development cooperation includes not only ODA, but also

development assistance by NGOs, such as churches, foundations

and associations, from their own funds and donations. Over the

years, they have accounted for an amazingly constant equivalent

of 11-12 per cent of ODA, which should be differentiated from

the subsidies these organizations receive from the government.

<B>Who provides aid?</B>

<P>

German ODA's actors are very diverse. This applies to the financing

(provision of funds), as well as the implementation of projects

and programmes. The German ODA reported to the DAC embraces:

<P>

<ul>

<li>BMZ development assistance totalling more than 70 per cent of ODA, making it the most important actor;

<P>

<li>development assistance of other Federal ministries, above all the Foreign Ministry (humanitarian aid,

materials and equipment assistance, cultural cooperation, contributions

to UN organizations); the Ministry of Education, Science, Research

and Technology; and the Ministry of Economics; and

<P>

<li>development assistance of the federal states (Lander) (study

place costs for students from developing countries, and own cooperation

measures).</ul>

<P>

In addition, there are Germany's contributions to the EU's development

budget, debt servicing relief, and part of the expenditure on

political refugees in Germany. The involvement of several ministries

in development cooperation is more

marked in some other donor countries than in Germany, for example,

in France and Japan.

<P>

A peculiarity of German development cooperation is the developmental

commitment of the L&#228;nder. They are involved primarily in the education

sector, but for some years have also promoted their own projects.

German municipalities also engage in developmental activities

in the context of partnerships and local government cooperation.

<P>

<B>Bilateral and multilateral aid</B>

<P>

Germany perceives itself first and foremost as a bilateral donor.

Its bilateral ODA

accounted for 70 per cent of its overall development assistance

to 1993 (see Table 1). Bonn bases this above all on its claim,

as one of the major donors, to operate its own development policy.

It says it has specialised and differentiated instruments for

implementing this policy. But it has also in recent years increasingly

criticized the lack of efficiency of multilateral cooperation.

Its unwritten guideline could read: &quot;As much bilateral aid

as possible, as much multilateral aid as necessary.&quot;

<P>

After Japan and the USA, Germany is the third largest financial

supporter of multilateral cooperation (as at 1993), and ranks

first on the EU development aid league table. Over the years,

Bonn has fulfilled its intention, declared in the 1970s, to earmark

about 30 per cent of its ODA for multilateral cooperation. This

is despite fluctuations which were due primarily to the payment

cycle. Germany has also collaborated steadfastly in multilateral

organizations and pressed for reforms. And it has renounced spectacular

steps such as the withdrawal of the USA and Britain from UNESCO.

From 1950 to 1993, 41.6 per cent of Germany's multilateral ODA

went to the European Community or Union, 39.6 per cent to the

World Bank and the regional development banks, 14.7 per cent to

UN organizations and funds, and 4.1 per cent to others.

<P>

Germany has always supported EC or EU development cooperation

(strictly speaking, the EU is a supranational, and not a multilateral,

institution), which above all had its roots in French and British

self interests, as well as European Parliament ventures. Not least,

Bonn has been the main financial contributor. But it has never

played a leading role as an initiator. In contrast to France and

Britain, whose colonial legacy has strongly influenced the regional

alignment of EC/EU development cooperation, Germany has from the

start preferred a more global approach to it. Bonn has also criticized the European Development Fund's

disproportionately low level of procurement orders to German contractors

compared with French companies, and the inefficiencies of EU aid.

<P>

The federal government has for a long time advocated better coordination

of EU development cooperation, although not a stronger communalising

of the member countries' individual aid programmes. Germany therefore

appears to be more reserved in the development cooperation field

than might be expected because of its intensive efforts for political

union. In that respect, the Maastricht Treaty, which lays down

that EU and bilateral development cooperation should be complementary,

corresponds completely with the Federal government's intentions.

<P>

<B>Regional focal points</B>

<P>

The development cooperation of France and Britain reflects their

ties to their former colonies. US aid is concentrated on Israel

and Egypt for security policy reasons. In contrast, Germany's

assistance was from the beginning guided by the principle that

it was open to the world. This was in line

with Bonn's foreign policy interests; a striving for worldwide

recognition and preventing international acceptance of the GDR.

But it also stuck the then West Germany's aid with the label of

being based on the principle of &quot;something for everyone&quot;.

<P>

This type-casting hits the mark in terms of the great number of

countries with which the Federal Republic fosters developmental

relations. In 1992, German Technical Cooperation (TC) projects

were either being appraised, prepared or implemented in 150 countries.

And new TC commitments had been made to 130 countries. The corresponding

figures for Financial Cooperation (FC) were 105 and 66 countries.

<P>

However, German development cooperation is clearly concentrated.

During the period 195093, 26 per cent of Germany's net bilateral

ODA disbursements were made to the five most important recipient

countries (India, Israel, Egypt, Turkey and Indonesia), and 37

per cent to the 10 most important countries. This reflects foreign

policy and geopolitical interests.

<P>

Table 2 shows the regional distribution of German aid. It makes

clear that sub saharan Africa's share has increased, while Asia's has declined. The share of least developed countries (LDCs)

fluctuates considerably, and in 1993 equalled about the DAC average.

Other donors such as the EU or some Scandinavian countries have

greater LDC disbursements.

<P>

The BMZ (not least due to pressure from the Parliamentary Budget

Committee) has for some years been trying to reduce the number

of recipient countries and achieve a stronger regional concentration

of German aid. The main motive is to improve the effectiveness

and efficiency of cooperation by bundling it. The BMZ also intends

to foster development cooperation only with partner countries

whose political and economic general conditions favour successful

cooperation. The effort to downsize the number of recipient countries

is in line with the &quot;graduation&quot; of threshold countries

who &quot;grow out&quot; of development aid. On the other hand,

other countries have become new German development cooperation

partners (Albania, the Central Asian and Caucasian developing

countries, and South Africa).

<P>

<B>Aid for the East at the cost of the South?</B>

<P>

Since the beginning of the 1990s, Germany has been the leading

western donor in financially supporting the transformation process

of the Central and East European countries and the successor states

of the former Soviet Union. In 1993, it accounted for about one third

of the official aid of all DAC member countries. German official

aid to those countries, without the Central Asian and Caucasian

states which the DAC has meanwhile recognised as developing countries,

as well as Albania, totalled about US$ 8.4 billion in 1991 93.

The disbursements thereby accounted for almost 40 per cent of

Bonn's total ODA to developing countries. But they were not made

at the cost of the South. Most of the money did not come from

the BMZ's budget, but of course it increased the general spending

burden of the Federal budget.

<P>

<B>Sectoral focal points</B>

<P>

Table 3 shows that social and administrative infrastructure and

economic infrastructure are the two main promotion sectors of

German bilateral development cooperation. Three things are noteworthy

in the period covered (1989-93). These are the more or less constant

weighting of social infrastructure, the distinct decrease of economic

infrastructure and the productive sectors, and the sharp increase in the share of debt relief

and humanitarian aid. The latter was above all aid for refugees,

which has also risen markedly in some other donor countries.

<P>

But while Table 3 presents a picture of sectoral focal points,

German aid, or more precisely its TC, is involved in a great number

of individual areas. This is a result of the growing differentiation

of development policy goals since the 1970s. But it bears the

inherent risk of over fragmentation, or becoming a sectoral &quot;wateringcan&quot;.

<P>

Since the beginning of the 1990s, the BMZ has defined as priorities

of bilateral cooperation the three &quot;key areas&quot; of alleviating

poverty, protection of the environment and resources, and education,

supplemented by the promotion of women. Developmental measures

in the various sectors and areas are to concentrate on these priorities

which, except perhaps for education, are cross-sectoral tasks.

<P>

According to the BMZ, 4050 per cent of the government's recent

commitments relate to projects of satisfying basic needs (these

include 13 per cent for alleviating poverty by help for self help),

about 30 per cent relate to environmental and resources projects

(1988: 15 per cent), and 13 per cent to the educational sector.

Gathering statistics on alleviating poverty is not easy, and it

has therefore, not surprisingly, also given rise to controversy.

<P>

<B>Instruments and conditions of bilateral cooperation</B>

<P>

Germany's bilateral development cooperation has essentially the following instruments (space limits

preclude a more precise breakdown):

<P>

<ul>

<li>Financial Cooperation (FC): favourable credits (depending

on the development level of the partner country, interest rates

of 0.75 per cent or 2 per cent and 40or 30year terms of maturity

with 10year periods of grace), or grants (LDCs) for investment

projects and programmes, as well as aid in kind and structural

adjustment aid. Implementation: Reconstruction Loan Corporation

(KfW);

<P>

<li>Technical Cooperation (TC): strictly speaking, the provision

of experts and materials and equipment assistance on behalf of

the federal government, primarily by the GTZ (cost-free). In the

broader sense, subsidies for the developmental activities of private

project executing organizations;

<P>

<li>Personnel Cooperation (PC): in particular, advanced training

programmes for specialists and executives from developing countries

(cost free), organized mainly by the German Foundation for International

Development (DSE) and the Carl Duisberg Society (CDG); and

<P>

<li>Other forms: food aid, promotion of the cooperation of German

industry with developing countries, and promotion of the latter's

exports.</ul>

<P>

<B>Development cooperation and German unification</B>

<P>

Unification of the two German states meant for Bonn's overall

development policy less of a task of adjustment than in other

political sectors. Most of the former GDR's development programmes

and projects implemented as part of its last Five year Plan had

ended in 1989/90, or had not survived the dissolution of the GDR

structures. After examining former East Germany's 106 projects,

the BMZ continued 64 of them. Moreover, numerous scholarship-holders

from developing countries who were studying in the GDR continued

to be promoted in the new L&#228;nder in eastern Germany.

<P>

<B>Organizational structure</B>

<P>

In contrast to those of most other DAC donor countries, the organizational

structure of German development cooperation has, among other things,

the following characteristics:

<P>

<ul>

<li>Germany has its own development cooperation ministry which

has competence for: laying down the principles, and the financing,

planning, controlling, steering and coordination of all development

policy measures; government negotiations with recipient countries;

and coordination with other donors;

<P>

<li>implementation of development cooperation is assigned to

two central, parastatal organizations (KfW, GTZ), as well as to

numerous other parastatal, semigovernmental and private organizations;

<P>

<li>implementation of FC and TC is institutionally separated

for historical reasons;

<P>

<li>not least due to the traditional reservations of the Foreign Ministry,

the local representation of German development cooperation in

developing countries is weaker than that of a number of other donors.

The latter have to a great extent delegated the planning, implementation

and management of their projects to on site development cooperation

offices. German representation has only in recent years taken

on a more marked form. At present, it encompasses 26 officers

of development cooperation seconded by the BMZ to German embassies,

24 project administration offices and 30 small project service

offices of the GTZ. The KfW has had two local project representatives

(in Cairo and New Delhi) since only recently.</ul>

<P>

<B>Strengths and weaknesses of organizational structure</B>

<P>

The organization of German development cooperation has advantages

and disadvantages. The advantages include:

<P>

<ul>

<li>the existence of strong project implementing organizations

such as the KfW and GTZ. The other donors, where implementation

is incumbent upon development cooperation authorities or agencies,

either do not have such organizations or only to a limited extent.

The KfW and GTZ can work more flexibly than a cooperation authority.

They have also accumulated a great deal of regional and sectoral

professional knowledge, and in this respect enjoy international

repute; and

<P>

<li>the very differentiated organizational structure of implementation,

involving the participation of numerous NGOs and organizations

of German industry and commerce. Despite coordination problems,

these structures deliver pluralism, offer possibilities for specialization,

and tend to increase the public's acceptance of development cooperation.

The five foundations of the political parties are a German peculiarity.</ul>

<P>

On the other hand, the organization of German development cooperation

also has several disadvantages:

<P>

<ul>

<li>the inadequate division of labour between the BMZ on one side

and the KfW and GTZ on the other. This results in the BMZ's competence

ranging from decisions on principles to the levels of developmental (in contrast to specialist-technical) planning and management

of every individual project. It also leads to overlapping of work

between the institutions and cramps the BMZ's capacity for conceptional

work;

<P>

<li>the institutional separation of FC and TC, which is unknown

to most other donors. In view of the trend to more comprehensive

forms of aid (programme assistance, support of structural adjustment

programmes, capacity building), the split is also causing increasing

difficulties; and

<P>

<li>the relatively weak local representation of German development

cooperation in developing countries. The DAC has repeatedly criticized

it, and it also hampers the adequate planning and management of

activities in close contact with partner countries.</ul>

<P>

<B>Developmental concept, paramount goals, self-interests</B>

<P>

In order to characterize the intents of German development cooperation,

it is useful to differentiate between the developmental concept,

paramount goals and &quot;self interests&quot; (nondevelopment

cooperation objectives) linked with it:

<P>

<ul>

<li>Developmental concept: the declared goal of German development

policy  to support economic and social development in the recipient

countries by help for self help, and thereby contribute to improving

living conditions  has basically not changed since it began. What

has changed are the concepts in pursuit of that goal. German development

cooperation has in principle gone all the way with the changes in

international developmental concepts over the years. Expressed

in very simple terms, these saw strong emphasis on economic infrastructure

and education in the 1960s; on satisfying basic needs in the 1970s;

on structural adjustment, policy dialogue and strengthening the

private sector in the 1980s; and concentration on poverty alleviation,

the environment and education since the beginning of the 1990s.

Germany assumed a certain role of initiative giver among the donors

when the BMZ introduced its new allocation criteria in October

1991. These identified human rights, participation of the people,

rule of law, a market friendly and social economic order, and government

action oriented on development as priorities, of which the first

three are explicitly political benchmarks. The change in the concepts

(which in the view of the administration is sometimes too rapid)

does not in the nature of things lead every time to fundamental

changes in developmental practice, but rather to gradual adjustments.

<P>

<li>Paramount goals: Traditionally, German development cooperation

has always been perceived in Bonn as part of a global peace policy

(which is still enshrined in the Federal Government's &quot;Basic

Principles of Development Policy&quot; of 1986). Since the end

of the East west conflict, the motive of securing the future of

humankind has come increasingly to the fore. That reflects growing

awareness of the new global threats posed by environmental degradation,

population growth, international refugee flows or regional and

ethnic conflicts with cross-border impacts.

<P>

<li>Self interests: German development cooperation has always been

integrated in the network of overall foreign relations. Like every

other political sector, it is subject to the Constitutional imperative

to benefit the German people and avert danger to them, and therefore

also has to serve German interests.</ul>

<P>

The definition of German interests is thereby decisive. They can

relate either to such basic goals as securing peace or the 

 future, or to quite specific foreign policy, 

foreign trade or domestic political interests. In the second case, conflicts of objectives can arise in development cooperation. In fact, concrete self interests have

always influenced and partly also impaired

the practice of German development cooperation. Such as the Hallstein Doctrine

(the rundown of diplomatic relations with countries which recognized former East

Germany), the checking of Communism, securing exports and raw

materials, creation of domestic employment by securing procurement

orders from ODA, and improving German industry's competitive position

in important export markets.

<P>

Compared with other donors, when it comes to the relationship

between development policy and self interests Germany stands midfield.

It has never subordinated its development cooperation policy to

foreign and security interests so blatantly as the USA has done,

or, like Japan in the past, to foreign trade interests. But on

the other hand, Germany has also never sought such a distinct

developmental profile as various &quot;likeminded countries&quot;,

for example some Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands, have

done in the past.

<P>

<B>Development policy among political parties, parliament and public</B>

<P>

Germany's development policy enjoys a positive consensus among

all the main political parties, parliament and the public, despite

many differences (which are also partly a matter of style for

political &quot;show business&quot; reasons) and some scepticism

over the practice of cooperation. This is a great developmental

asset, even if development policy has naturally less importance

in political and public minds than domestic and economic topics.

<P>

Development policy is an agenda for all parties represented in

the Bundestag. Not only for their manifestos and election campaigns,

but also for parliamentary debates, question times and, not least,

in consultations and decision taking on the BMZ budget. Parliament's

development policy debate is carried out intensively in the Development

Policy Committee, whose influence on the practice of cooperation

is, however, less than that of the Budget Committee.

<P>

According to opinion polls, the great majority of Germans (in

both the old and the new L&#228;nder) endorses development cooperation,

even in hard economic times. This positive basic attitude is also

reflected in their great readiness to make donations, which they

have shown for decades. Furthermore, the polls show:

<P>

<ul>

<li>an increase in awareness of the interdependence of the developments in the

North and South;

<P>

<li>overestimation of not only the quantitative significance but also the possible impacts of development cooperation;

<P>

<li>low awareness of government development cooperation compared with the work of NGOs; and

<P>

<li>growing scepticism over the practice of government development

cooperation, which is based on reports of failures, doubts about

the &quot;feasibility&quot; of the aid, and suspicion that it

is only an &quot;alibi&quot; to camouflage the pursuit of economic

selfinterests.</ul>

<P>

<B>Challenges</B>

<P>

A development policy that claims to contribute to global securing

of the future needs the following to remain credible at home

and abroad:

<P>

a) in the medium term, an increase again in funds;

<P>

b) more political influence in the sense of political coherence.

Many policies play a role in relations with developing countries

(e.g. in the areas of foreign policy, agriculture, trade, direct

investment, indebtedness, environment, refugees) which are not

part of the domain of development policy, but which touch upon

it strongly and in part counteract it. These policies must be

reviewed more intensively for their global impacts and developmental

soundness. In the Maastricht Treaty, Germany acknowledged the

imperative of coherence.

<P>

c) a sustainable improvement of effectiveness and efficiency.

This applies not only to the general conditions in the

partner countries, as important as they are, but also the aid

delivery on the German side.

<P>

Lines of approach, besides greater political coherence, are: relieving

the BMZ of responsibility for projects (except for the evaluation

of results which, rather, must be intensified); strengthening

its capacity for politicalconceptual work (which will also enable

it to &quot;occupy&quot; the agenda of global securing of the

future even more intensively among the Bonn ministries); concentrating

development cooperation on fewer countries (perhaps in agreement

with other EU donors) and also fewer sectors in bilateral cooperation;

consistent fostering of the country strategy papers as an important

developmental management instrument; closer cooperation (and finally

merging) of FC and TC; and strengthening of foreign representation.

<P>

d) a more precise definition of the role of development cooperation

in the overall network of relations with developing countries.

Development policy is undisputedly part of German cooperation

relations with developing countries and regions, and with its

special terms of reference and instruments can make an important

contribution to shaping them.

<P>

The criticism that a development policy which feels itself obliged

to alleviate poverty is only something for the LDCs and cannot

cope with the cooperation needs of advanced developing countries

misses the point in many respects. On the one hand, poverty is

also a relevant problem in many of the latter countries. And on

the other, it is precisely development cooperation that can make

them interesting offers (e.g. advisory services in fields such

as social, labour market, education, environment or urban development

policies). These offers have a great deal to do with alleviating

poverty, and are ones with which development cooperation, compared

with other German cooperation policies, have advantages. A social

and environmentally sound development of the partner countries

is in Germany's including in the economic sense.

<P>

But although active promotion of German exports is a legitimate

concern, it is not a task of development cooperation. It should

therefore be represented vigorously in parliament and among the

public as a policy in itself, if necessary also with a view to

appropriate funds.

<p><br>
<b>Why have we created these pages?</b><br>
To make life simpler for teachers and students learning about sustainable human development - especially if you are : <br>
<ul><li>battling with the 'dev-ed' sections of the UK's <b>National Curriculum for Geography</b>
<li>doing Development Studies  
<li>14-18 years old
<li>doing GCSEs or A-levels.  
</ul>


<p><b>But these pages are not just for Geographers and Dev-Edders!</b><br>
Why not? Because the material is divided into themes - like: 
<ul><li>Population
<li>Economic development
<li>Environment
<li>Literacy
<li>Health
<li>Conflict
</ul><p>

<p>
<br>
<b>... which should also be useful to teachers and students of many other subject areas - like: </b>
<ul><li>Economics
<li>Religious Education/Moral Philosophy
<li>Sociology
<li>English 
<li>Environmental Studies
</ul>


<b>How do the pages work?</b><br>
It's very simple. You can either: 
<ul>
<li>go to our <a href="index.html#sch">list of subject areas</a>
<li>use our <a href="../owo_options.html">search index for a specific topic</a>

<P>



<B>Small but excellent - this is how Switzerland likes to present

itself and its development assistance. With barely 1.5 billion

Swiss francs of official development assistance (ODA), it is just

not possible to move mountains. The Swiss do not even try. Rather,

they emphasize quality. Other policy concerns, however, interfere

with this concept, such as their position on flight capital.</B>

<P>

In regard to the terms of its aid, there is no doubt that Switzerland

is one of the most generous donors: Almost 100 percent of all

aid is given in the form of grants (since 1988, bilateral assistance

has consisted exclusively of non repayable grants; no loans are

provided). Assistance is more or less unconditional, and the instruments

are very flexible. Although Switzerland pursues its own foreign

trade interests through mixed financing (8% of ODA, or 1 % of

Third World exports), even the usually faultfinding NGOs acknowledge

that the bulk of assistance is decidedly oriented toward development.

Proof is in the selection of partners, predominantly low income

countries, and the concentration on rural development and food

security.

<P>

<B>Volume of Swiss aid</B>

<P>

In the past, however, the Swiss were not exactly the most generous

donors. Until the end of the eighties, their relative total contributions

were at the lower end of the donor list (in 1970, ODA was only

0.12% of GNP, 1980 only 0.24%). Thanks to high growth rates, the

DAC (Development Assistance Committee) average was met for the

first time in 1991, and again increased to 0.46% in 1992. However,

downward movements are anticipated and it is not very likely that

the goal for 1995 of at least 0.4% will be reached. Despite good

intentions on the part of the government  the federal council

 to increase the volume of development assistance in future years

by 8 per cent annually, parliament  the council of states and

the national council  again applied the budget brake. In view

of its deep economic recession even rich Switzerland must economize.

<P>

At any rate, the Swiss have a bad conscience. This was obvious

during the 700th anniversary celebration of the confederacy in

1991, when 700 million francs in excess of ODA appropriations

were approved for debt relief. (Even commercial banks contributed).

The extremely active NGOs had gone all out with their publicity

campaign and submitted a petition signed by 250 000 Swiss citizens,

which asked the federal assembly to be generous. Furthermore,

creative approaches ensure that the population's willingness to

donate to development projects continues (0.06% of GNP). However,

the social consensus that more needs to be done for the South

quickly comes to a stop when the Swiss economy airs its concerns

as to fair foreign trade, opposition to the bank secrecy act,

or asylum policy. When in doubt, the confederates are in favour

of cautious restraint.

<B>Guidelines of Swiss aid</B>

<P>

Political guidance is provided by the 1976 federal law on international

development cooperation and humanitarian aid. The department for

development assistance (DEH) in the Ministry for Foreign Affairs

operates on this generally accepted basis. It channels approximately

80 per cent of Swiss ODA. In implementing its measures mostly

small projects  the DEH cooperates closely with consulting firms

and NGOs.

<P>

While the image of the DEH is that of a basic needs oriented helper,

the civil servants at the BAWI, the federal agency for foreign

trade, are generally looked upon as representatives of domestic

export interests, which are realized through mixed financing and

balance of payments assistance. For a long time, responsibilities

were clearly separated due to division of labor and dissimilar

lobbies. Recently, these lines have been blurred because of coordination

pressures and personnel changes. The new head of the DEH, Walter

Fust, is a known expert in Swiss trade promotion. Nevertheless,

there can be no question of a general change of direction, since

personnel was also transferred from the DEH to the BAWI. Besides,

the political direction is determined by the cabinet and parliament,

after all.

<P>

Given the relatively low ODA volume and the modest staffing of

development agencies, it is only logical to concentrate assistance

in a few priority countries. About 70 per cent of bilateral assistance

goes to 19 countries where the Swiss work predominantly in regions

and sectors which are not already pervaded by other donors. It

is hardly surprising that the effort to find a niche literally

led to the mountains to develop dairy farming and small industries.

Traditionally, Nepal, Pakistan, Bolivia, Peru, Rwanda, and Madagascar

have been priority countries, where rural projects have been quite

successful.

<P>

Regionally, Swiss aid is increasingly concentrated in Africa (40%),

followed by Asia (30%), and Latin America (12%). Since the nineties,

a small amount of ODA funds has been given to Eastern European

countries for humanitarian purposes (Albania and the former Yugoslavia).

<P>

Sectorally, the Rio Conference on Environment and Development

in 1992 was responsible for a shift in favor of environmental

protection. Environmental impact studies are now required for

all projects. Furthermore, food security, education, handicrafts,

and small industry are preferred project sectors. Following the

trend of other international donors, more attention is devoted

to migration, the war on drugs, and AIDS. Conditionality is openly

supported, which was manifested in the highly selective allocation

of the &quot;anniversary contribution&quot;. Switzerland rewards

efforts on the part of the recipient countries toward &quot;good

governance&quot; (in a rather vague sense) and observance of human

rights, although it is quite aware of its limited leverage.

<B>Organization of Swiss aid</B>

<P>

Both aid agencies are responsible not only for ministerial decisions,

but also for their implementation (the DEH for one third of its

projects). Institutions comparable to the German KfW (Reconstruction

Loan Corporation) or GTZ (German Agency for Technical Cooperation)

have not been established. The higher education sector cooperates

with federal institutions, as for instance the Confederate Technical

University in Z&#252;rich with the Development Institute in Geneva.

Usually, the implementation of projects is subcontracted to consulting

firms and NGOs. This cooperation is facilitated not on only by the

transparent personnel structure but also by the multi year budgets

of the federal council, which are flexible as to spending priorities

and include conditional credits approved by parliament. (Although annual appropriations;

i. e. cash payments, cannot be carried over to the next fiscal

year, a loss of funds is usually avoided by shifting expenditures

between programs).

<P>

Conceptionally, the DEH is fully committed, particularly in regard

to its country programs. The first one was introduced in 1988

for Bangladesh. These programs utilize the findings of regular

evaluations. The goal is to link technical cooperation (of the

DEH) with balance of payments assistance (of the BAWI).

<P>

<B>No country quotas for Swiss aid</B>

<P>

Swiss missions and local coordinating agencies play an active

role in project planing, which makes it unnecessary to adhere

to specific quotas. Countries do not receive general promises

of assistance. Planning is done by sector. Project proposals take

into account local potential sustainability, and help for self help.

In Switzerland, these are more than just slogans that sound good.

<P>

Fast and efficient humanitarian aid is definitely one of Switzerland's

strongest attributes. It builds on the vast experience and professionalism

of the Swiss Disaster Relief Corps. Food aid, on the other hand,

has been very controversial, since the domestic agro lobby has

not been very concerned about its negative impact on the recipient countries. Still, relief

organizations are trying to follow a sensible distribution policy

within the framework of food-for-work projects.

<P>

Relief agencies and other NGOs are quite involved in Swiss development

cooperation. Since 1980, ODA funds for NGOs have quadrupled. It

is no coincidence that the NGOs are better known among the general

public than the public aid agencies. To name only the largest

organizations: The Swiss Red Cross and Caritas provide mainly

humanitarian aid; Helvetas, Swissaid as well as the religious

organizations &quot;Bread For Brothers&quot; and &quot;Fasting

Sacrifice&quot; provide primarily development assistance. The

importance of these NGOs becomes clear when one considers that

they implement about one third of bilateral technical cooperation.

Swissaid, whose international reputation equals Oxfam's, does

not manage any projects, but receives DEH subsidies in the form

&quot;block grants&quot;. Several NGOs have pooled their resources

to solicit donations and publicize their activities, which has

a positive impact on the coordination of aid measures as well.

<P>

<B>Multilateral aid</B>

<P>

Notwithstanding the negative referendum on joining the United

Nations, aid agencies are not averse to working with multilateral

organizations. For many years, Switzerland has contributed cash

and special services to UN institutions, particularly to UNDP

and UNICEF. With its positive vote in 1992 to join the World Bank

group and the IMF, the electorate finally sanctioned this already

well established cooperation (although many NGOs pleaded for a

no vote). Even before joining, Switzerland was allowed to participate

in World Bank tenders, since Washington was very aware of the

great importance of the Swiss credit market. The fact that Switzerland

profited from this relationship as well as from the orders it

obtained was instrumental for the yes vote.

<P>

Aside from such profit calculations, aid agencies feel obligated

to provide multilateral assistance. For example, they co financed

structural adjustment programs and readily participated in IDA

replenishments. Switzerland is also involved with the regional

banks of the IFAD.

<P>

A big question mark remains concerning Switzerland's ties to Europe

after the negative referendum on joining the European Union (EU),

which made it less likely that the desired membership in the EU

would be approved in the near future. Will Switzerland join after

all in the nineties and accept all the rights and obligations

that go with membership? These will probably be more stringent

after the likely entry of all the Nordic nations. Or will Switzerland

continue to go it alone, under the motto &quot;small but excellent?&quot;

<P>

Relative to its affluence and capacity, the development policy

of Switzerland is actually too small and certainly not excellent

in general. Much remains to be desired relevant to trade policy,

since Switzerland is even more protectionist in the agricultural

sector than the EU states. And the Swiss financial world, despite

all its lip service in the wake of the Marcos accounts affair,

does not give any indication that flight capital is returned to

where it is so urgently needed. With all due respect to Swiss

neutrality non partisanship is a questionable attitude in view

of the global conflict situation.

<P>

<B>Germany after World War Two was subject to a very strict aid conditionality

under the Marshall Plan. When it became a donor of aid itself,

it gradually introduced conditions connected with its aid. Today,

aid conditionality is accepted as a concept by government, NGOs

and the public.</B>

<P>

Before the role of conditionality attached to German development

aid can be analysed it has to be realized that the Federal Republic

of Germany itself was exposed to severe conditionality during

the Marshall Plan period after World War II. Contrary to general

belief it was not so much the amount of money transferred to the

Western European countries which made this exercise &quot;history's

most successful structural adjustment programme&quot;, but rather

the strict conditionality attached to it. Each recipient had to

sign a bilateral pact with the United States in which they agreed

to balance government budgets, restore financial stability and

stabilise exchange rates at realistic levels. In addition for

every dollar of Marshall Plan aid received, the recipient country

was required to place a matching amount of domestic currency in

a counterpart fund to be used only for purposes approved by the

U.S. government.

<P>

<B>The emerging political conditionality</B>

<P>

When Germany switched from an aid recipient to an aid donor in

the early 1960s, there was a first attempt at political conditionality

by connecting diplomatic relations and development aid with the

nonrecognition of the German Democratic Republic. This was not

successful at all, since in the end the Federal Republic had to

accept that the GDR became a member of the United Nations.

<P>

A second attempt, which was much more in line with international

trends began in the early 1980s when development aid was linked

to human rights and democracy. In 1982 the federal parliament

(Bundestag) stated in a unanimous resolution: &quot;ln its development

cooperation the Federal Republic of Germany regards the implementation

of human rights as an essential goal of the federal government...

those countries

should be especially supported, which try to establish democratic

structures... In states where despotism, intimidation and physical

threat characterize~the relationship between the governing and

the governed only those projects can be supported which benefit

directly the oppressed population.&quot;

<P>

Although two years later the Bundestag adopted again unanimously

guidelines for the federal government stating that the goal for

development cooperation should be to guarantee a life in dignity

(securing basic needs) and to contribute to a higher level of

civil and political rights in developing countries the ministry

for economic cooperation did not really react to these resolutions

and left the human rights policy to a large extent to the foreign

office.

<P>

It was only five years later, when political reforms in countries

with structural adjustment processes seemed to be unavoidable

and especially after the collapse of the socialist states in Eastern

Europe that political conditionality and &quot;help through intervention&quot;

were discussed in Germany. Finally in October 1991, the minister

of economic cooperation, Carl-Dieter Spranger, publicly announced

five criteria for German development cooperation: respect for

human rights, popular participation in the political process,

observation of the rule of law, market friendly approach to economic

development and the recipient government's commitment to development.

Thus the first three criteria constitute a clear political conditionality

based on the respect for human rights and an orientation towards

democracy.

<P>

<B>The administration of the political conditionality</B>

<P>

In order to ensure that the criteria were applied in the country

aid allocations the development policy section developed a

<P>

check list of indicators. As far as the first three human rights

related criteria were concerned it was made sure that all indica

tors were based on internationally codified UN human rights like

freedom from torture equality before the law or freedom of as

sembly so that no recipient country could object on the ground

of being subjugated to German standards. Also in this checklis

there is a clear distinction between the as sessment of the current

status of respect for human rights in a given country and the

tendency in the human rights performance which is considered even

more important.

<P>

The introduction of the human rights criteria for country allocations

also led to an increased support for human rights and democracy

projects, the so called &quot;positive measures&quot;. Especially

the foundations ol the major political parties but also church

organizations and other NGOs have a long tradition of projects

to strengthen the civil society of developing countries like support

for trade unions, chambers of commerce, human rights groups, etc.

Now the ministry also engages directly in such positive measures

like strengthening the legal system, demobilisation and reintegration

of soldiers (Mozambique, Uganda, Ethiopia, Nicaragua) or decentralisation

and communal development. The Foreign Office is converting a fund

which was formerly used for military aid and training of policemen

into a source for positive measures like supporting free elections,

consulting services for parliaments or seminars on democratic

constitutions.

<P>

The major administrative instrument for the implementation of

a human rights orientation is the country concept. There has been

a major effort to draw up such concepts for about 40 countries.

Besides the usual economic analysis they also have to deal with

social and political conditions and should explicitly refer to

the situation and trends in relation to the five criteria. The

country concepts are the basis for decisions in relation to country

allocations and serve as a basis for government to government

consultations.

<P>

A recent assessment of these concepts by the policy section of

the ministry revealed that the implementation of the new criteria

within the administration is quite a complicated process and will

take some time. It is however hoped that a series of internal

training workshops will improve the quality of the country concepts.

<P>

<B>Conditionality and the German public</B>

<P>

The reception of the new criteria for development aid in the German

public was very positive, the opposition in parliament could only

state that they would watch their implementation and even the

most critical NGOs did not reject the criteria but criticised

the double standards applied in their implementation. Even with

the &quot;ordinary voter&quot; not very much interested inThird

World affairs, this new policy was quite popular under the slogan

that no taxpayer's money should be given to dictators who oppress

their own people or to corrupt regimes, which use development

money for their private purposes. There was no criticism from

the private sector, as far as the general policy guidelines were

concerned, different interests of the business community were

however very relevant at the implementation stage in certain economically

important countries (see below the case of China).

<P>

<B>Some case studies</B>

<P>

As a human rights conditionality in German development cooperation

can only be observed since the announcement of the five new criteria

in October 1991 just a first tentative assessment of the implementation

of this new policy can he given. Already in the country allocations

for the 1992 budget there were a number of changes which exceeded

by far the usually very minor variations. Thus countries like

China, India, Indonesia and Pakistan saw their allocations substantially

reduced either because of human rights violations or because of

excessive arms spending. With Zaire, Malawi, Togo and Haiti development

cooperation was stopped because of very strong human rights violations

and obstruction of the process towards democracy.

<P>

On the other hand countries where civil wars had ended saw their

development aid resumed or newly started (Ethiopia, El Salvador,

Namibia) and countries that had implemented democratic reforms

like Benin, Zambia, Bangladesh, Nepal and Chile had their aid

allocations substantially increased. However for countries like

Turkey, where human rights violations continue and spending on

arms is high, allocations were not changed at all.

<P>

A very instructive case, which shows that aid conditionality can

work, is Kenya. When in 1990 and 1991 the opposition to the repressive KANU one-party

system was mounting and people were more and more demanding a

multi-party system and the respect for human rights, it was the

German ambassador together with his American colleague, who was

openly supporting the drive towards democracy and the application

of aid conditionality. Finally in November 1991 the Western donors

with the exception of France decided during a meeting of the Consultative

Group for Kenya to suspend any quick disbursing aid until the

multi-party system was reestablished, corruption was reduced and

economic reforms implemented.

<P>

Within a few days president Moi announced that article 2a of the

constitution declaring Kenya a one-party state would be abolished

and free elections be held. Although these elections were far

from being fair and although the KANU regime was able to stay

in power, there is no doubt that in comparison to the pre-1991

situation the human rights situation has improved considerably.

<P>

A very interesting case that shows the limits of applying conditionality

in development cooperation is China. After the massacre on the

Tianmen square in June 1989 the German Parliament decided unanimously

that development cooperation should be stopped with the exception

of projects &quot;that directly benefit the population&quot;.

On October 30, 1990 the Bundestag with the majority of the coalition

parties voted for a limited resumption of development cooperation

adding projects &quot;for the protection of the environment and

projects which contribute to the reform of the Chinese economy&quot;.

This change was justified with the necessity for protection of

the environment and with the constructive position of China in

the Iraq conflict.

<P>

Based on the amended resolution of the Bundestag minister Spranger

in November 1991 refused his signature for a special financial

arrangement for a contract for container ships which were to be

built in an EastGerman shipyard, because none of the exceptions

of the Bundestag resolution would apply. After continued criticism

from members of the coalition reflecting mainly massive economic

interests, the majority in the Bundestag in June 1992 cancelled

its resolution of October 1990 enabling the government to finance

the shipbuilding contract on preferential terms. The arguments

were that although the respect for civil and political rights

was very poor the improvement of economic and social rights was

very impressive, that economic reforms would eventually lead to

improvements in the human rights situation, that China was of

high security interest and that other countries were ready to

capture the big export contract. Although the ministry did reduce

its aid allocation for China by DM 40 million, major improvements

of the human rights situation could not be observed.

<P>

<B>Conclusions</B>

<P>

The major experience with the human rights conditionality in German

development cooperation was that this policy can be implemented

with good success in countries which depend heavily on foreign

aid and where economic and foreign policy interests are minimal.

There is little chance for success in economically important or

strategically interesting countries. This has led to severe criticism

in the German public accusing the government of &quot;double standards&quot;.

As a consequence greater &quot;coherence&quot; of all policies

towards developing countries is demanded, which means that development

policy should have a higher priority than economic or security

interests.

<P>

This demand, however, would have to be based on strong political

support in the German public and in important interestgroups.

Although development aspects have in general increased in importance

after the disappearance of the EastWest conflict, other interests

like preservation of jobs or economic development of Eastern Germany

have a much higher priority and will have higher priority for

quite some time.

<P>

The basic question is then: should one accept &quot;double standards&quot;

in relation to political conditionality and try to slowly increase

the number of countries where development orientation has highest

priority orshould one postpone in amore puristway the application

of a human rights oriented conditionality even in those small

countries where it is implementable and wait until such time when

human rights conditionality can be successfully introduced in

all countries? Since such a policy would be at the cost of potential

improvement of human rights and democracy in many countriesthe

answer that human rights and development oriented NGOs in Germany

give is to support the political conditionality where it is sincerely

applied and to to use the &quot;double standards&quot; argument

as political pressure to increase the application of political

conditionality in as many countries as possible.

un environnement fondamentalement instable</A></H3>

<P>

<H4>1. Des performances socio-&eacute;conomiques g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement

m&eacute;diocres, mais des situations contrast&eacute;es d'un

pays &agrave; l'autre</H4>

<P>

Depuis deux ans, la situation &eacute;conomique s'est sensiblement

am&eacute;lior&eacute;e dans un nombre croissant de pays ACP.

Bien qu'encore fragile, ce redressement pourrait s'av&eacute;rer

durable et avoir des effets d'entra&icirc;nement sur d'autres

pays dans la mesure o&ugrave; l'am&eacute;lioration des politiques

&eacute;conomiques pourra se poursuivre. 

<P>

Sur longue p&eacute;riode toutefois, les pays ACP ont jusqu'&agrave;

pr&eacute;sent connu des performances m&eacute;diocres, globalement

inf&eacute;rieures &agrave; celles des autres pays en d&eacute;veloppement.

Ceci est particuli&egrave;rement le cas pour <B>l'Afrique sub-saharienne</B>,

qui apparait actuellement comme la r&eacute;gion du monde qui

connait le plus de difficult&eacute;s. De nombreux indicateurs

illustrent ce constat: 

<P>

<UL>

<LI>le produit par t&ecirc;te en Afrique sub-saharienne ne s'est

accru qu'au rythme moyen de 0.4% par an entre 1960 et 1992, compar&eacute;

&agrave; 2.3 % pour l'ensemble des pays en d&eacute;veloppement.

Ce chiffre refl&egrave;te &agrave; la fois une croissance &eacute;conomique

moyenne nettement plus faible (3.3% par an) et des taux d'accroissement

d&eacute;mographique plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s (2.9% par an).

L'&eacute;cart entre le produit par t&ecirc;te de l'Afrique sub-saharienne

et celui des autres pays en d&eacute;veloppement n'a d&egrave;s

lors fait que se creuser: il est actuellement de l'ordre de 1

&agrave; 4, et, si la diff&eacute;rence entre les taux de croissance

se maintenait au cours des quinze prochaines ann&eacute;es, cet

&eacute;cart passerait &agrave; 1 &agrave; 6;

<P>

<LI>dans ce contexte de faible croissance, la persistance de la

pauvret&eacute; en Afrique sub-saharienne est particuli&egrave;rement

pr&eacute;occupante, illustr&eacute;e par des indicateurs de revenus,

de sant&eacute;, de nutrition, d'&eacute;ducation, d'acc&egrave;s

&agrave; l'eau potable, tr&egrave;s d&eacute;favorables. En consid&eacute;rant

la mesure de la pauvret&eacute; la plus couramment utilis&eacute;e,

&agrave; savoir le niveau du revenu ou de la consommation par

t&ecirc;te, la Banque Mondiale estime que 1300 millions de personnes

vivent en-de&ccedil;&agrave; du seuil de pauvret&eacute; dans

les pays en d&eacute;veloppement, dont 515 millions se trouvent

en Asie du Sud et 220 millions en Afrique sub-saharienne. L'ampleur

des situations de pauvret&eacute; est particuli&egrave;rement

marqu&eacute;e en Afrique sub-saharienne, avec un revenu moyen

des groupes pauvres inf&eacute;rieur de 15% au seuil de pauvret&eacute;.

Malgr&eacute; les importants progr&egrave;s r&eacute;alis&eacute;s

ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es dans l'analyse du d&eacute;veloppement

social (travaux du PNUD et de la Banque Mondiale notamment) il

reste difficile d'appr&eacute;hender la r&eacute;alit&eacute;

de la pauvret&eacute; et surtout d'en appr&eacute;cier la dynamique,

compte tenu du manque de donn&eacute;es fiables sur longue p&eacute;riode

pour de nombreux pays. Les estimations disponibles indiquent qu'entre

1987 et 1993, l'incidence de la pauvret&eacute; semble s'&ecirc;tre

globalement maintenue &agrave; 39% de la population en Afrique

sub-saharienne, les am&eacute;liorations parfois nettes constat&eacute;es

dans certains pays (au Nig&eacute;ria, au Ghana, en Tanzanie,

en Ethiopie) ayant &eacute;t&eacute; compens&eacute;es par une

aggravation parfois brutale dans d'autres; 

<P>

<LI>les niveaux d'&eacute;ducation et de formation se sont am&eacute;lior&eacute;s,

&agrave; partir d'une situation particuli&egrave;rement faible

au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es soixante. Le taux d'analphab&eacute;tisme

parmi les adultes en Afrique sub-saharienne d&eacute;passe cependant

encore 40%, et les taux de scolarisation demeurent sensiblement

plus bas que dans les autres pays en d&eacute;veloppement (36%

de la population &acirc;g&eacute;e de 6 &agrave; 23 ans tous niveaux

confondus, compar&eacute; &agrave; 47% pour l'ensemble des PVD

en 1990);

<P>

<LI>l'esp&eacute;rance de vie s'est certes am&eacute;lior&eacute;e

(passant de 40 ans en 1960 &agrave; 51 ans en 1993) et la mortalit&eacute;

infantile a recul&eacute; (de 167 &agrave; 97 pour 1000 naissances

vivantes), mais ces progr&egrave;s ont &eacute;t&eacute; moindres

que dans les autres r&eacute;gions en d&eacute;veloppement. Le

pourcentage de la population n'ayant pas acc&egrave;s aux services

de sant&eacute; demeure important (plus de 40% compar&eacute;

&agrave; 20% en moyenne pour les PVD);

<P>

<LI>l'Afrique sub-saharienne est la r&eacute;gion du monde o&ugrave;

le rythme d'accroissement d&eacute;mographique est le plus &eacute;lev&eacute;,

et ne diminue pas. Aux taux actuels, la population doublerait

entre 1992 et 2017. L'acc&eacute;l&eacute;ration de l'urbanisation

pose des probl&egrave;mes de plus en plus aig&uuml;s de conditions

de vie en rendant plus difficile la gestion des infrastructures

(&eacute;coles surpeupl&eacute;es, surcharge des services de sant&eacute;,

quantit&eacute; et qualit&eacute; de l'eau insuffisantes, probl&egrave;mes

dans la distribution d'eau et d'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;). Selon

les r&eacute;centes projections du FNUAP, d'ici &agrave; 2015

pr&egrave;s de 20% de la population africaine vivront dans des

villes de plus de 5 millions d'habitants, compar&eacute; &agrave;

8% en 1994;  

<P>

<LI>la production alimentaire ne permet pas de couvrir les besoins

de la population, et ce d&eacute;ficit structurel risque de s'aggraver.

Au cours des quinze derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, la production

alimentaire par habitant en Afrique sub-saharienne a diminu&eacute;

de 5%. Aux rythmes actuels, la croissance d&eacute;mographique

est trop rapide pour envisager de combler le d&eacute;ficit alimentaire

dans un avenir proche, surtout dans les pays &agrave; bas revenu.

Il existe cependant une marge importante pour mieux exploiter

le potentiel de production agricole dans ces pays. Dans ces conditions,

la d&eacute;pendance &agrave; l'&eacute;gard des importations

- et donc des possibilit&eacute;s d'exportation - et de l'aide

alimentaire, reste forte;

<P>

<LI>la d&eacute;gradation de l'environnement naturel repr&eacute;sente

un frein de plus en plus important au d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique

et social. Les groupes pauvres sont les plus directement affect&eacute;s

par les effets de la d&eacute;forestation et de la sur-utilisation

des sols. Les probl&egrave;mes de pollution de l'eau et de l'air

deviennent de plus en plus aig&uuml;s dans les zones sur-peupl&eacute;es;

<P>

<LI>l'exportation reste bas&eacute;e sur l'exploitation primaire

des ressources naturelles. L'Afrique sub-saharienne a commenc&eacute;

&agrave; perdre des parts de march&eacute;s internationaux d&egrave;s

les ann&eacute;es soixante-dix, et ces pertes se sont poursuivies

au cours des ann&eacute;es quatre-vingt et jusqu'en 1993. Cette

partie du monde a, dans l'ensemble, attir&eacute; tr&egrave;s

peu d'investissements directs &eacute;trangers, malgr&eacute;

certaines exceptions, et elle n'a jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent

pas b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; de l'essor des investissements

vers les pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Ainsi en 1995, sur un total

de 90 milliards USD d'investissements &agrave; destination des

pays en d&eacute;veloppement, 2 milliards seulement ont concern&eacute;

l'Afrique sub-saharienne. Alors que l'investissement &eacute;tranger

tend &agrave; devenir la source majeure de financement ext&eacute;rieur

pour de nombreux pays en d&eacute;veloppement, pour l'Afrique

sub-saharienne il ne repr&eacute;sente qu'un peu plus de 10% de

ces flux. Au total, cette r&eacute;gion se trouve actuellement

marginalis&eacute;e par rapport au syst&egrave;me &eacute;conomique

mondial, repr&eacute;sentant 2% du commerce international et moins

de 1% des investissements directs &eacute;trangers;

<P>

<LI>la persistance d'importants d&eacute;s&eacute;quilibres macro-&eacute;conomiques,

en particulier d'un taux d'&eacute;pargne tr&egrave;s insuffisant,

dans un contexte de faible croissance, s'est traduite par l'accumulation

d'un endettement ext&eacute;rieur devenu insoutenable dans un

certain nombre de pays. L'Afrique sub-saharienne est d&eacute;sormais

la r&eacute;gion du monde relativement la plus endett&eacute;e

avec une dette repr&eacute;sentant 270% des recettes d'exportation

et 75% du PNB, et des arri&eacute;r&eacute;s de paiements chroniques.

</UL>

<P>

Ce bilan global recouvre cependant des situations tr&egrave;s

contrast&eacute;es, et, comme dans d'autres r&eacute;gions en

d&eacute;veloppement, les &eacute;carts entre les pays africains

ont tendance &agrave; se creuser.

<P>

Le niveau moyen du revenu par t&ecirc;te qui &eacute;tait de 460

USD en 1994 en Afrique sub-saharienne, recouvre des valeurs qui

vont de 80 et 90 USD au Rwanda et au Mozambique &agrave; 600 USD

en C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire ou au S&eacute;n&eacute;gal, et &agrave;

3000 USD environ au Botswana et &agrave; Maurice. 

<P>

Les perspectives d'&eacute;volution pour les ann&eacute;es qui

viennent sugg&egrave;rent en outre une diff&eacute;renciation

de plus en plus marqu&eacute;e entre les pays qui font preuve

d'une capacit&eacute; &agrave; mener des politiques cr&eacute;dibles

de d&eacute;veloppement et les pays en proie au cercle vicieux

de la violence et de la pauvret&eacute;. Les pays couverts par

le Programme Sp&eacute;cial pour l'Afrique, ont enregistr&eacute;

des performances de croissance particuli&egrave;rement encourageantes

ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es; la croissance du PIB y a &eacute;t&eacute;

en moyenne sup&eacute;rieure de 1.5 point &agrave; celle des autres

pays d'Afrique sub-saharienne pour les ann&eacute;es 1994-96 (en

valeurs m&eacute;dianes). Cette acc&eacute;l&eacute;ration de

la croissance a &eacute;t&eacute; li&eacute;e &agrave; une progression

de leurs exportations et &agrave; une hausse du taux d'investissement,

qui est d&eacute;sormais proche de 20% du PIB. L'accroissement

des investissements priv&eacute;s est notamment significatif d'une

am&eacute;lioration notable du climat &eacute;conomique dans ces

pays. Autre signe encourageant, l'am&eacute;lioration des performances

a &eacute;t&eacute; pratiquement continue depuis la mise en oeuvre

du SPA en 1987.

<P>

Dans les <B>Cara&iuml;bes</B>, &agrave; l'exception de Ha&iuml;ti,

qui figure parmi les pays les plus pauvres de la plan&egrave;te

avec un revenu moyen de 230 USD par t&ecirc;te, de la Guyana et

du Suriname, la plupart des pays se situent dans la cat&eacute;gorie

des pays &agrave; revenu interm&eacute;diaire, certains dans la

tranche sup&eacute;rieure comme Trinidad &amp; Tobago (3740 USD

par t&ecirc;te); la Barbade appartient &agrave; l'&eacute;lite

&eacute;conomique de la r&eacute;gion. Dans l'ensemble cependant,

les performances de croissance demeurent trop faibles - m&ecirc;me

en excluant Ha&iuml;ti, la croissance moyenne du PNB par t&ecirc;te

a &eacute;t&eacute; inf&eacute;rieure &agrave; 1% par an depuis

1990 -, et l'incidence de la pauvret&eacute; est &eacute;lev&eacute;e.

Les indicateurs sociaux r&eacute;v&egrave;lent toutefois que,

pour un m&ecirc;me niveau de revenu, la situation en mati&egrave;re

de sant&eacute; et d'&eacute;ducation est moins d&eacute;favorable

qu'en Afrique sub-saharienne; ceci refl&egrave;te les progr&egrave;s

accomplis au cours des d&eacute;cennies pr&eacute;c&eacute;dentes,

par des politiques qui ont mis l'accent sur les besoins fondamentaux.

Ces acquis sont toutefois menac&eacute;s depuis quelques ann&eacute;es,

par l'effet des pressions budg&eacute;taires qui ont particuli&egrave;rement

affect&eacute; certaines d&eacute;penses sociales, dans le contexte

des efforts de stabilisation macro-&eacute;conomique et d'ajustement

structurel. 

<P>

L'investissement &eacute;tranger direct est en hausse depuis le

d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es quatre vingt-dix dans la plupart

des pays des Cara&iuml;bes, &agrave; l'exception des pays les

plus pauvres, en r&eacute;ponse &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration

des politiques &eacute;conomiques. Cependant les conditions d'une

diversification des activit&eacute;s du secteur priv&eacute; sont

encore loin d'&ecirc;tre r&eacute;unies, et la d&eacute;pendance

&agrave; l'&eacute;gard des exportations de quelques produits

agricoles (essentiellement les bananes, le sucre et le riz) et

de produits miniers demeure forte. Leur caract&egrave;re insulaire

conf&egrave;re en outre &agrave; la majorit&eacute; de ces pays

une vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute; particuli&egrave;re aux facteurs

climatiques et aux ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes naturels, et accro&icirc;t

consid&eacute;rablement le co&ucirc;t par habitant des investissements

et infrastructures &eacute;conomiques et sociales.

<P>

Les huit Etats ACP du <B>Pacifique</B> forment un ensemble relativement

h&eacute;t&eacute;rog&egrave;ne tant du point de vue &eacute;conomique

que culturel. Le pays le plus important, PNG, repr&eacute;sente

70% de la population de l'ensemble, soit un peu plus de 5 millions

de personnes, le plus petit, Tuvalu, comptant &agrave; peine 9000

habitants. Dans cette r&eacute;gion aussi les &eacute;carts de

niveau de vie sont consid&eacute;rables, allant de 710 USD par

t&ecirc;te au Kiribati &agrave; 2130 USD &agrave; Fiji. Le caract&egrave;re

insulaire et la tr&egrave;s petite taille de ces &eacute;conomies

les rendent tr&egrave;s vuln&eacute;rables aux facteurs ext&eacute;rieurs;

elles sont fortement d&eacute;pendantes des &eacute;changes commerciaux

et sont expos&eacute;es aux catastrophes naturelles (cyclones,

etc).

<P>

Le constat de la diversit&eacute; croissante des conditions &eacute;conomiques

et sociales incite &agrave; sub-diviser le groupe des Etats ACP

en plusieurs cat&eacute;gories de pays. Sur la base des r&eacute;alit&eacute;s

d'aujourd'hui, il est en effet possible de distinguer entre:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>les pays qui se trouvent en situation de troubles politiques

et &eacute;conomiques graves. Des pays comme la Somalie, le Liberia,

le Soudan, le Za&iuml;re, le Rwanda, le Burundi, rel&egrave;vent

actuellement de cette cat&eacute;gorie; 

<P>

<LI>les pays qui ont commenc&eacute; &agrave; engager des r&eacute;formes,

mais n'ont pas encore pu en tirer les fruits en termes de croissance

acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute;e et qui stagnent. C'est actuellement

le cas de la majorit&eacute; des pays d'Afrique sub-saharienne;

<P>

<LI>les pays en &eacute;mergence, qui ont d&eacute;montr&eacute;,

au cours des ann&eacute;es r&eacute;centes (depuis 1992-1993),

une certaine capacit&eacute; &agrave; g&eacute;rer les transformations

n&eacute;cessaires, et o&ugrave; les perspectives de croissance

paraissent aujourd'hui meilleures (le p&ocirc;le C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire

/ Ghana / Mali / Burkina Faso, l'Ouganda, la Namibie). Dans les

Cara&iuml;bes, la Jama&iuml;que, Trinidad &amp; Tobago, la R&eacute;publique

dominicaine, ont acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute; le processus de

r&eacute;forme en vue de rejoindre l'accord de libre-&eacute;change

nord-am&eacute;ricain. Dans le Pacifique, PNG participe depuis

1989 au processus de lib&eacute;ralisation engag&eacute; dans

le cadre de l'APEC (Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation). Les ACP

comptent aussi des &quot;success stories&quot;, exceptionnelles:

Bostwana et Maurice. 

</UL>

<P>

Si cette typologie peut &ecirc;tre utile en termes d'analyse,

il convient toutefois d'en souligner les limites quant &agrave;

ses implications pour la politique de coop&eacute;ration. Ces

cat&eacute;gories s'av&egrave;rent en effet tr&egrave;s instables,

et sur longue p&eacute;riode de nombreux pays africains ont connu

de brusques renversements de situation et en conna&icirc;tront

encore. Ainsi, des pays qui avaient enregistr&eacute; d'assez

bonnes performances ont connu des bouleversements majeurs. Tel

est par exemple le cas du Rwanda, ou encore du Nigeria o&ugrave;

les bouleversements politiques ont imprim&eacute; un brusque coup

d'arr&ecirc;t aux r&eacute;formes. A l'inverse, certains pays

qui ont connu une longue p&eacute;riode de r&eacute;cession figurent

actuellement parmi les exemples de r&eacute;formes r&eacute;ussies;

le Ghana, l'Ouganda, illustrent ce cas de figure.

<P>

Dans ce contexte, il est donc indispensable de porter un diagnostic

d'ensemble sur les difficult&eacute;s auxquelles les pays africains

ont &eacute;t&eacute; et risquent de demeurer confront&eacute;s.

<P>

<H4>2. Les causes de la moindre croissance en Afrique sub-saharienne</H4>

<P>

La moindre croissance du produit par t&ecirc;te en Afrique sub-saharienne

par rapport &agrave; d'autres r&eacute;gions en d&eacute;veloppement

peut &ecirc;tre associ&eacute;e &agrave; plusieurs facteurs. Du

point de vue &eacute;conomique, elle r&eacute;sulte &agrave; la

fois d'un taux d'investissement plus faible, d'une croissance

d&eacute;mographique plus forte, et d'une moindre progression

de la productivit&eacute; des facteurs, elle-m&ecirc;me li&eacute;e

&agrave; des politiques &eacute;conomiques inad&eacute;quates.

Ind&eacute;niablement, l'Afrique a souffert de mauvaises politiques

&eacute;conomiques, caract&eacute;ris&eacute;es par des d&eacute;ficits

publics &eacute;lev&eacute;s, des taux de change sur&eacute;valu&eacute;s,

une r&eacute;glementation excessive des march&eacute;s, des distorsions

induites par le protectionnisme, un secteur public mal g&eacute;r&eacute;,

toutes ces conditions ayant eu pour effet de d&eacute;courager

le secteur priv&eacute;. Les facteurs ext&eacute;rieurs ont sans

aucun doute jou&eacute; un r&ocirc;le non n&eacute;gligeable dans

ces mauvaises performances, en raison d'une vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute;

particuli&egrave;re des pays ACP aux fluctuations des march&eacute;s

des produits de base, aux conditions mon&eacute;taires internationales

et aux contraintes de l'endettement ext&eacute;rieur.

<P>

En poussant plus loin l'analyse et en cherchant &agrave; identifier

les &eacute;l&eacute;ments qui, sur longue p&eacute;riode, ont

soit r&eacute;duit l'efficacit&eacute; des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement

en Afrique, soit t&eacute;moignent de l'adoption par les pays

africains de politiques moins favorables &agrave; la croissance

que ne l'ont fait d'autres pays dans d'autres r&eacute;gions,

deux types de facteurs se profilent: des caract&eacute;ristiques

structurelles d&eacute;favorables et un environnement pr&eacute;sentant

un degr&eacute; &eacute;lev&eacute; de risque. La difficult&eacute;

de mener de bonnes politiques &eacute;conomiques, le fait que

les ajustements et les r&eacute;formes s'av&egrave;rent plus difficiles

en Afrique qu'ailleurs, semblent en effet li&eacute;s &agrave;

l'existence de handicaps initiaux d'une part, aux facteurs d'instabilit&eacute;

qui pr&eacute;valent en Afrique d'autre part. 

<P>

Parmi les handicaps initiaux, pr&eacute;sents au d&eacute;but

des ind&eacute;pendances et qui semblent avoir exerc&eacute; une

influence durable sur les conditions du d&eacute;veloppement en

Afrique sub-saharienne, les niveaux d'&eacute;ducation particuli&egrave;rement

bas, m&ecirc;me si on les consid&egrave;re relativement au niveau

du produit par t&ecirc;te, et la croissance d&eacute;mographique

plus rapide que dans toute autre r&eacute;gion en d&eacute;veloppement,

ont sans aucun doute engendr&eacute; des besoins excessivement

importants par rapport aux capacit&eacute;s des Etats. 

<P>

Sur un autre plan, un esprit d'entreprise relativement peu r&eacute;pandu,

explique aujourd'hui la faiblesse de r&eacute;action de l'offre

&agrave; des politiques plus incitatives apr&egrave;s plusieurs

d&eacute;cennies d'interventionnisme administratif.

<P>

L'Afrique sub-saharienne a aussi &eacute;t&eacute; la r&eacute;gion

du monde sujette aux plus fortes instabilit&eacute;s. Les conditions

climatiques engendrent des difficult&eacute;s particuli&egrave;res,

qui se refl&egrave;tent dans l'instabilit&eacute; d'une production

agricole dont l'importance &eacute;conomique et sociale demeure

forte. L'instabilit&eacute; des recettes d'exportation, des transferts

d'aide publique et des flux de financement ext&eacute;rieur, qui

&agrave; leur tour induisent une instabilit&eacute; du volume

des importations, ainsi que l'instabilit&eacute; mon&eacute;taire

interne, &agrave; laquelle n'ont &eacute;chapp&eacute; que quelques

pays et les pays de la zone franc, constituent autant d'obstacles

&agrave; la croissance.

<P>

A ces diff&eacute;rents facteurs d'instabilit&eacute; &eacute;conomique

s'ajoute une forte instabilit&eacute; politique, qui p&egrave;se

largement sur le climat de l'investissement et sur le d&eacute;veloppement

de l'activit&eacute; &eacute;conomique en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral.

Le manque de transparence dans la gestion de la chose publique,

la mentalit&eacute; renti&egrave;re et le client&eacute;lisme

des &eacute;lites au pouvoir, ont r&eacute;duit la capacit&eacute;

des Etats &agrave; assumer leurs responsabilit&eacute;s. Ces probl&egrave;mes

de &quot;governance&quot; compromettent les efforts de d&eacute;veloppement

social, qui requi&egrave;rent continuit&eacute; des politiques

et vision de long terme, et contribuent &agrave; retarder les

effets de l'ajustement structurel, dans la mesure o&ugrave; ils

alimentent l'attentisme des investisseurs.

<P>

<H4>3. L'instabilit&eacute; politique et les dysfonctionnements

de l'Etat</H4>

<P>

L'instabilit&eacute; politique, l'affaiblissement des Etats et

leur incapacit&eacute; &agrave; mettre en oeuvre des politiques

de d&eacute;veloppement, la criminalisation croissante des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s,

la violence organis&eacute;e et la prolif&eacute;ration de conflits

arm&eacute;s d'un type nouveau, avec leurs cons&eacute;quences

aux plans humanitaire, social, &eacute;conomique, environnemental,

figurent parmi les caract&eacute;ristiques de l'&eacute;volution

r&eacute;cente dans un certain nombre de pays ACP. 

<P>

Les raisons de ces crises remontent en partie &agrave; l'h&eacute;ritage

des r&eacute;gimes coloniaux, caract&eacute;ris&eacute;s par un

mode de gestion fortement centralis&eacute; et interventionniste,

et par l'&eacute;tablissement de fronti&egrave;res sans rapport

avec les affinit&eacute;s sociologiques.

<P>

Elles r&eacute;sultent aussi de la d&eacute;rive autoritaire des

r&eacute;gimes politiques lors des deux ou trois premi&egrave;res

d&eacute;cennies de l'ind&eacute;pendance favoris&eacute;e par

le conflit Est-Ouest, et &agrave; une utilisation du pouvoir tr&egrave;s

souvent soumise &agrave; des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts particuliers

et de court terme. Le mauvais fonctionnement des services publics,

le gonflement excessif du secteur para-&eacute;tatique, la d&eacute;t&eacute;rioration

des infrastructures, et la difficult&eacute; de mobiliser les

recettes publiques, sont autant de signes les plus &eacute;vidents

des dysfonctionnements accumul&eacute;s.

<P>

La persistance de la crise &eacute;conomique, pr&eacute;cipit&eacute;e

au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 1980 par la baisse des prix

des mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res, la hausse des prix p&eacute;troliers

et les perturbations mon&eacute;taires internationales, a diminu&eacute;

les revenus des Etats et la valeur r&eacute;elle des r&eacute;mun&eacute;rations,

a modifi&eacute; la structure des rentes et la r&eacute;partition

des richesses, induisant un glissement vers les activit&eacute;s

informelles mais contribuant aussi &agrave; un accroissement sans

pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent de la fraude et des trafics illicites,

qui s'ins&egrave;rent d&eacute;sormais dans des r&eacute;seaux

internationaux.

<P>

C'est dans ce contexte qu'au cours des quinze derni&egrave;res

ann&eacute;es, trois facteurs nouveaux ont contribu&eacute; &agrave;

l'affaiblissement des structures de gouvernement et aux ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes

de d&eacute;sint&eacute;gration sociale:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>les premi&egrave;res tentatives d'ajustement et de r&eacute;formes

&eacute;conomiques mises en oeuvre au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es

quatre-vingt ont r&eacute;v&eacute;l&eacute; des probl&egrave;mes

d'une autre nature que ce qui avait intialement &eacute;t&eacute;

envisag&eacute;. Ainsi les premi&egrave;res interventions, visant

notamment &agrave; r&eacute;duire la taille du secteur public

et &agrave; diminuer les d&eacute;ficits, ont r&eacute;duit l'efficacit&eacute;

des services publics et ont contribu&eacute; &agrave; &eacute;roder

la base &eacute;conomique et sociale de l'Etat, et donc son autorit&eacute;

politique et sa l&eacute;gitimit&eacute;. D'une mani&egrave;re

g&eacute;n&eacute;rale, l'appui ext&eacute;rieur aux r&eacute;formes

&eacute;conomiques a eu des cons&eacute;quences importantes et

non anticip&eacute;es sur le plan politique. Ce n'est que plus

tard que les institutions de Bretton Woods notamment, ainsi que

l'UE dans le cadre de sa politique d'appui &agrave; l'ajustement

engag&eacute;e &agrave; partir de 1990, ont soulign&eacute; la

n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'am&eacute;liorer le fonctionnement des

institutions de l'Etat pour accro&icirc;tre l'impact des programmes

d'ajustement. Une vue plus globale du r&ocirc;le de l'Etat dans

un environnement &eacute;conomique nouveau se d&eacute;veloppe

peu &agrave; peu;

<P>

<LI>la fin de la guerre froide et l'effondrement du bloc de l'Est

en 1989 s'est traduit par un changement important dans l'attitude

des pays industrialis&eacute;s vis-&agrave;-vis des Etats ACP

en raison d'un remodelage de leurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts g&eacute;ostrat&eacute;giques.

Ce changement s'est concr&eacute;tis&eacute; de deux fa&ccedil;ons:

d'une part de nombreux pays ont perdu l'assurance du soutien financier

inconditionnel dont ils b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaient; d'autre part

la communaut&eacute; internationale a d&eacute;velopp&eacute;

une exigence plus ambitieuse en mati&egrave;re de respect des

droits de l'homme et des principes d&eacute;mocratiques. Mais

l'approche qui a &eacute;t&eacute; adopt&eacute;e &agrave; cet

&eacute;gard, sous la forme d'une conditionnalit&eacute; politique

probablement trop formaliste venue s'ajouter &agrave; la conditionnalit&eacute;

&eacute;conomique, n'a pas eu un impact suffisant pour assurer

une plus grande stabilit&eacute; politique et une am&eacute;lioration

significative de l'Etat de droit. Dans certains cas, la &quot;d&eacute;mocratisation&quot;

appuy&eacute;e par la communaut&eacute; internationale a conduit

&agrave; la mise en place de structures factices ou d'institutions-fa&ccedil;ades;

<P>

<LI>enfin la transition vers la d&eacute;mocratie dans les pays

ACP, initi&eacute;e parall&egrave;lement &agrave; la fin de la

guerre froide, s'av&egrave;re particuli&egrave;rement difficile.

Le processus de d&eacute;mocratisation ne s'est pas encore accompagn&eacute;

d'un renforcement de l'Etat de droit. En particulier en Afrique

sub-saharienne, l'absence de mod&egrave;les d'organisation politique

et sociale qui puissent r&eacute;pondre aux exigences de la situation

actuelle est &eacute;galement manifeste: le mode de gouvernement

est li&eacute; au mode de fonctionnement des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s

africaines, o&ugrave; la notion de groupe pr&eacute;domine sur

celle de l'individu. Par ailleurs, l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t particulier

du groupe ayant conquis et d&eacute;tenant le pouvoir sans partage

ni acceptation du principe de l'alternance, supplante souvent

l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t g&eacute;n&eacute;ral; ceci ne facilite

pas la t&acirc;che de l'Etat qui doit encourager le progr&egrave;s

&eacute;conomique et social dans un contexte &eacute;conomique

mondial de plus en plus concurrentiel, et respecter les principes

d&eacute;mocratiques reconnus par la communaut&eacute; internationale.

Le retour au pouvoir, par voie d'&eacute;lections, des anciennes

&eacute;lites dirigeantes dans de nombreux pays, t&eacute;moigne

de cette difficult&eacute;, dans le contexte de r&eacute;formes

&eacute;conomiques et d'ajustements budg&eacute;taires qui, dans

le court terme, comportent bien souvent des co&ucirc;ts sociaux,

d&eacute;cevant ainsi les attentes des populations. Cette situation

contraste avec l'exp&eacute;rience europ&eacute;enne de l'apr&egrave;s-guerre,

lorsque le progr&egrave;s social et la mise en place de syst&egrave;mes

sociaux tr&egrave;s d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s ont pu constituer

une r&eacute;ponse politique face &agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

de renforcer la d&eacute;mocratie.

</UL>

<P>

Des signes positifs apparaissent n&eacute;anmoins aussi, dans

la mesure o&ugrave; les &eacute;ch&eacute;ances des &eacute;lections,

une plus grande libert&eacute; de la presse, la mise en place

de structures consultatives qui permettent au secteur priv&eacute;,

aux communaut&eacute;s de base, &agrave; des organisations de

femmes, aux ONG, de faire entendre leurs voix, rendent le d&eacute;bat

possible et sont des &eacute;tapes importantes vers une gestion

plus transparente. La demande croissante des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s

dans les ACP pour un d&eacute;veloppement plus participatif et

plus respectueux des besoins des individus constitue un important

facteur de changement.

<P>

Les difficult&eacute;s de gestion politique existent certes &agrave;

des degr&eacute;s tr&egrave;s divers d'un pays &agrave; l'autre.

Cependant elles entretiennent un sentiment d'incertitude g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;,

qui affecte non seulement les pays touch&eacute;s par les troubles

les plus graves, mais qui tend aussi, en Afrique sub-saharienne

du moins, &agrave; r&eacute;duire la confiance vis-&agrave;-vis

de l'ensemble du continent. Ce &quot;d&eacute;ficit de confiance&quot;

contribue pour une large part &agrave; la faiblesse et &agrave;

l'instabilit&eacute; de l'investissement en Afrique, en particulier

de l'investissement &eacute;tranger, en m&ecirc;me temps qu'il

p&egrave;se sur la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

<H4>1. Les conditions de base du d&eacute;veloppement et les r&eacute;formes

&eacute;conomiques</H4>

<P>

Les troubles, parfois profonds, li&eacute;s &agrave; la d&eacute;stabilisation

politique et sociale ainsi que les difficult&eacute;s rencontr&eacute;es

dans la mise en oeuvre de politiques &eacute;conomiques de croissance,

qui ont persist&eacute; en d&eacute;pit de quinze ann&eacute;es

d'ajustement et d'assistance des institutions financi&egrave;res

internationales, apparaissent comme les deux maux majeurs de l'Afrique

sub-saharienne aujourd'hui.

<P>

Dans de nombreux pays les conditions minimales de paix et d'une

gestion &eacute;conomique satisfaisante ne sont pas remplies.

On peut estimer qu'actuellement, 30% seulement de la population

d'Afrique sub-saharienne vit dans des pays disposant &agrave;

peine d'un environnement de base raisonnable. Ceci exclut les

pays en proie &agrave; des guerres civiles, et les pays o&ugrave;

la gestion &eacute;conomique n'assure pas un minimum de conditions

propices au d&eacute;veloppement .

<P>

Six aspects, interd&eacute;pendants, apparaissent fondamentaux

dans toute appr&eacute;ciation des possibilit&eacute;s de d&eacute;veloppement

futur:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>(i) <U>La paix et la s&eacute;curit&eacute;, conditions minimales

du d&eacute;veloppement</U>.

<P>

Le co&ucirc;t des guerres civiles p&egrave;se tr&egrave;s lourd

dans le bilan d'ensemble des pays ACP. Or &agrave; moyen terme,

ce type de conflits sera toujours d'actualit&eacute;. Outre leurs

effets d&eacute;vastateurs directs dans les pays concern&eacute;s,

un effet de &quot;contagion&quot; est manifeste, dans la mesure

o&ugrave; des &eacute;v&eacute;nements dramatiques dans un pays

ont des retomb&eacute;es n&eacute;gatives pour l'ensemble de la

r&eacute;gion, notamment parce qu'ils alimentent le manque de

confiance des op&eacute;rateurs &eacute;conomiques. 

<P>

Si ce constat global est pr&eacute;occupant, il fournit aussi

quelques motifs d'optimisme: on constate en effet que les pays

qui assurent ne f&ucirc;t-ce qu'un minimum de stabilit&eacute;

sociale enregistrent des performances de croissance certes encore

modestes par rapport &agrave; leur potentiel, mais suffisantes

pour permettre une progression du revenu par t&ecirc;te.

<P>

<LI>(ii) <U>Des r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques et institutionnelles

n&eacute;cessaires.</U>

<P>

Le taux d'investissement demeure trop faible dans de nombreux

pays. Or parmi l'ensemble des facteurs qui influencent les d&eacute;cisions

d'investir, l'appr&eacute;ciation du &quot;risque-pays&quot;,

c'est &agrave; dire de l'instabilit&eacute; politique et des risques

de revirements de politique &eacute;conomique et commerciale,

est &agrave; ce stade souvent d&eacute;cisive.

<P>

L'engagement de r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques dans un nombre

croissant de pays depuis la fin des ann&eacute;es quatre-vingt

contribue &agrave; cet &eacute;gard &agrave; &eacute;tablir un

cadre plus favorable. Comme dans d'autres r&eacute;gions du monde,

ces r&eacute;formes, g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement engag&eacute;es

&agrave; l'occasion d'un effort de stabilisation macro-&eacute;conomique,

vont au-del&agrave; de la probl&eacute;matique de l'ajustement

&agrave; court terme et portent sur un ensemble de politiques

&eacute;conomiques et de transformations institutionnelles. Outre

le r&eacute;tablissement d'un cadre macro-&eacute;conomique durablement

stable, les r&eacute;formes visent d'une mani&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;rale

&agrave; am&eacute;liorer la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; des &eacute;conomies

&agrave; travers une politique de change plus r&eacute;aliste,

des march&eacute;s plus efficients, la lib&eacute;ralisation commerciale

et l'ouverture &agrave; l'investissement &eacute;tranger. La r&eacute;forme

du secteur public a en outre pour objectif de recentrer l'action

de celui-ci sur ses missions fondamentales, &agrave; savoir l'offre

de services essentiels et la fourniture des infrastructures de

base. 

<P>

Les r&eacute;formes de type institutionnel sont plus longues et

plus difficiles &agrave; r&eacute;aliser que les politiques de

lib&eacute;ralisation; elles concernent le d&eacute;veloppement

et la modernisation du syst&egrave;me financier, les r&eacute;formes

fiscales, la gestion des d&eacute;penses publiques, l'am&eacute;lioration

du cadre r&eacute;glementaire et du syst&egrave;me juridique,

la r&eacute;forme des entreprises publiques et les privatisations.

<P>

Ces constatations, qui concernent surtout l'Afrique sub-saharienne,

sont &eacute;galement valables pour les pays des Cara&iuml;bes,

qui font face, &agrave; une autre &eacute;chelle, au m&ecirc;me

type de probl&eacute;matique. Les r&eacute;formes engag&eacute;es

dans certains de ces pays au cours des derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es

pour faciliter le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;

et du potentiel d'exportation sont encore tr&egrave;s incompl&egrave;tes.

La lib&eacute;ralisation du commerce, l'am&eacute;lioration du

cadre r&eacute;glementaire, le d&eacute;veloppement du syst&egrave;me

financier, le fonctionnement du march&eacute; du travail, et la

n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de retrouver une marge de manoeuvre pour

les politiques sociales, vont donc continuer &agrave; dominer

l'agenda des politiques &eacute;conomiques dans cette r&eacute;gion

pendant une p&eacute;riode plus ou moins longue.

<P>

Des r&eacute;sultats tangibles sont d&eacute;j&agrave; perceptibles

dans certains domaines. Bien qu'il soit difficile d'identifier

avec pr&eacute;cision les raisons de l'am&eacute;lioration des

performances de croissance, notamment dans les pays couverts par

le Programme Sp&eacute;cial pour l'Afrique, il est clair n&eacute;anmoins

que l'appui financier de la communaut&eacute; internationale a

jou&eacute; un r&ocirc;le important, dans la mesure o&ugrave;

il a permis une certaine continuit&eacute; des politiques &eacute;conomiques

et des r&eacute;formes. 

<P>

<LI>(iii) <U>La d&eacute;mocratisation et la lib&eacute;ralisation

&eacute;conomique.</U>

<P>

Le double processus de transition &eacute;conomique (vers l'&eacute;conomie

de march&eacute;) et politique (vers un r&eacute;gime pluraliste)

pr&eacute;sente &agrave; la fois des synergies et des difficult&eacute;s

particuli&egrave;res. Synergies dans les cas o&ugrave; les r&eacute;formes

peuvent faire l'objet d'un large d&eacute;bat public entre le

gouvernement et la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, notamment les

repr&eacute;sentants du secteur priv&eacute;, et engager un gouvernement

de mani&egrave;re cr&eacute;dible. Difficult&eacute;s dans la

mesure o&ugrave; la mise en oeuvre de politiques de stabilisation

accompagnant la lib&eacute;ralisation est temporairement rendue

plus difficile par l'ouverture d&eacute;mocratique. Ceci se produit

surtout lorsque les progr&egrave;s sont lents et modestes, retardant

les effets positifs attendus en termes d'am&eacute;lioration des

conditions de l'offre, et prolongeant la p&eacute;riode o&ugrave;

la politique socio-&eacute;conomique est domin&eacute;e par une

logique de restriction budg&eacute;taire. Dans ces conditions,

le soutien des &eacute;lecteurs et le consensus en faveur des

r&eacute;formes s'av&egrave;re plus difficile &agrave; maintenir,

et la continuit&eacute; des politiques &eacute;conomiques est

mise en danger.

<P>

<LI>(iv) <U>Les questions li&eacute;es &agrave; la transformation

sociale.</U>

<P>

S'il existe un consensus sur un socle minimal de r&eacute;formes

&eacute;conomiques, les r&eacute;formes structurelles, qui ont

des implications plus profondes et plus difficiles &agrave; cerner

dans leurs effets distributifs sont en revanche plus controvers&eacute;es

et rencontrent une plus forte r&eacute;sistance. En Afrique sub-saharienne,

cette r&eacute;sistance est entretenue par les groupes dominants,

et s'appuie sur une des caract&eacute;ristiques principales du

fonctionnement des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s africaines, &agrave;

savoir le refus de l'accumulation individuelle. Or les m&eacute;canismes

de solidarit&eacute; de groupe ont tendance &agrave; d&eacute;river

vers une redistribution de plus en plus partielle du produit de

l'activit&eacute; &eacute;conomique, vers une logique pr&eacute;datrice

o&ugrave; les groupes proches du pouvoir ne sont plus solidaires

que d'une fraction tr&egrave;s r&eacute;duite de la population.

Ces conditions d'organisation sociale imposent une limite aux

prescriptions de politique &eacute;conomique des bailleurs de

fonds, dans la mesure o&ugrave;, au-del&agrave; d'un socle minimal

commun, l'impact et la viabilit&eacute; des r&eacute;formes est

difficilement pr&eacute;visible. 

<P>

L'ensemble de la communaut&eacute; internationale, tous pays confondus,

est en outre confront&eacute;e &agrave; la difficult&eacute; de

concilier les grands engagements politiques pris &agrave; Rio,

au Caire, &agrave; Copenhague et &agrave; P&eacute;kin, en faveur

d'un d&eacute;veloppement durable centr&eacute; sur les besoins

de la personne humaine, et les r&eacute;alit&eacute;s du d&eacute;veloppement

&eacute;conomique dans un environnement mondial de plus en plus

concurrentiel;

<P>

<LI>(v) <U>La r&eacute;duction de la pauvret&eacute;.</U>

<P>

L'am&eacute;lioration r&eacute;cente des performances de croissance

a sans doute permis d'interrompre ou de limiter l'accroissement

de la pauvret&eacute; dans quelques pays mais pas de la r&eacute;duire.

D'une part, une croissance &eacute;conomique plus soutenue est

n&eacute;cessaire. La Banque Mondiale estime que, compte tenu

de la structure des &eacute;conomies et des taux d'accroissement

d&eacute;mographique, un taux de croissance du PIB de 5% par an

en Afrique sub-saharienne permettrait &agrave; peine de stabiliser

le nombre de personnes vivant en-de&ccedil;&agrave; du seuil de

pauvret&eacute;; or au cours des dix derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es,

parmi les pays de plus d'un million d'habitants, seuls six pays

d'Afrique sub-saharienne ont d&eacute;pass&eacute; ce seuil.

<P>

D'autre part, il existe une marge importante pour am&eacute;liorer

l'impact de la croissance sur la pauvret&eacute;: l'acc&egrave;s

aux services sociaux de base doit encore &ecirc;tre sensiblement

&eacute;largi, et l'acc&egrave;s aux ressources productives (&eacute;ducation,

formation, propri&eacute;t&eacute; de la terre, acc&egrave;s au

capital et au cr&eacute;dit, ...) demeure tr&egrave;s imparfait

dans de nombreux pays. Des groupes entiers de population se trouvent

pratiquement exclus du secteur structur&eacute; de l'&eacute;conomie.

Les femmes sont particuli&egrave;rement vuln&eacute;rables &agrave;

cet &eacute;gard, et une am&eacute;lioration de leur situation

socio-&eacute;conomique aurait un effet de levier consid&eacute;rable

en termes de r&eacute;duction de la pauvret&eacute;. Le secteur

informel est certes souvent tr&egrave;s dynamique; mais il ne

permet en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral pas d'am&eacute;liorer les conditions

de vie des gens de mani&egrave;re durable. Enfin toute transition

&eacute;conomique entra&icirc;ne des changements de positions

relatives pour diff&eacute;rents segments de la population; or

les syst&egrave;mes sociaux existants, largement bas&eacute;s

sur les solidarit&eacute;s de groupe mais aussi sur des relations

de d&eacute;pendance, ne permettent pas de r&eacute;pondre de

mani&egrave;re efficace &agrave; ces probl&egrave;mes.

<P>

<LI>(vi) <U>L'int&eacute;gration dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale.</U>

<P>

L'int&eacute;gration des pays ACP dans les &eacute;changes internationaux

d&eacute;pendra &agrave; la fois du succ&egrave;s des politiques

&eacute;conomiques internes et de l'am&eacute;lioration de la

comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; des &eacute;conomies, et de l'acc&egrave;s

aux march&eacute;s &eacute;trangers. 

<P>

Alors que la mondialisation a r&eacute;duit les barri&egrave;res

commerciales et les co&ucirc;ts inh&eacute;rents &agrave; la pratique

du commerce international, I'acc&egrave;s aux march&eacute;s internationaux

devient de plus en plus complexe et d&eacute;pendant d'autres

consid&eacute;rations non li&eacute;es aux obstacles tarifaires.

Dans l'&eacute;quation de l'acc&egrave;s au march&eacute;, le

niveau des tarifs joue un r&ocirc;le de plus en plus r&eacute;duit

et d'autres aspects tels que les politiques de concurrence, les

normes techniques, sanitaires et phytosanitaires, les subventions,

les politiques antidumping et de droits compensatoires, les

r&egrave;glements en mati&egrave;re d'environnement et

de politique sociale, les lois sur la propri&eacute;t&eacute;

intellectuelle, les codes en mati&egrave;re d'investissements,

etc., sont des facteurs de plus en plus importants d&eacute;terminant

l'acc&egrave;s au march&eacute;. 

<P>

En cons&eacute;quence, m&ecirc;me si la <B>lib&eacute;ralisation

multilat&eacute;rale</B> d&eacute;coulant de 1'accord du cycle

de l'Uruguay a enregistr&eacute; un succ&egrave;s consid&eacute;rable,

il n'en demeure pas moins que de nombreux domaines li&eacute;s

au commerce mentionn&eacute;s cidessus sont encore insuffisamment

r&eacute;glement&eacute;s par l'OMC, ce qui donne lieu &agrave;

des comportements potentiellement anticomp&eacute;titifs de la

part d'entreprises multinationales et de pays commer&ccedil;ants

qui risquent de constituer des barri&egrave;res effectives emp&ecirc;chant

l'acc&egrave;s aux march&eacute;s internationaux. Le d&eacute;veloppement

de disciplines convenues au niveau multilat&eacute;ral dans ces

nouveaux domaines li&eacute;s au commerce ainsi que le renforcement

de la cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; des r&egrave;gles r&eacute;gissant

le r&egrave;glement de diff&eacute;rends pour l'application des

nouveaux accords sur les ETE et autres barri&egrave;res non tarifaires

constituent un travail consid&eacute;rable qui sera &agrave; l'ordre

du jour de l'OMC pendant les prochaines ann&eacute;es. 

<P>

La lib&eacute;ralisation multilat&eacute;rale r&eacute;sultant

de l 'accord du cycle de l'Uruguay n'a pas r&eacute;duit l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t

accru pour le <B>r&eacute;gionalisme</B> apparu &agrave; la fin

des ann&eacute;es quatre-vingts. Les pays commer&ccedil;ants,

industrialis&eacute;s comme en d&eacute;veloppement, semblent

percevoir une valeur ajout&eacute;e dans le fait d'aller,

sur une &eacute;chelle g&eacute;ographique plus r&eacute;duite,

au-del&agrave; de &quot;I'acquis&quot; du cycle de l'Uruguay per&ccedil;u

comme ne r&eacute;pondant pas encore &agrave; la demande

accrue d'&eacute;changes plus libres et de plus de certitude

et d'harmonisation dans les nouveaux domaines li&eacute;s au commerce.

<P>

Les <B>accords commerciaux Nord-Sud</B>, au-del&agrave; des

effets normaux de cr&eacute;ation d'&eacute;changes et de r&eacute;orientarion

des exportations, accroissent la cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; politique

des PMA participants et permettent d'attirer des investissements

plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s, nationaux et &eacute;trangers, am&eacute;liorent

les effets en faveur de la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;, assurent

un acc&egrave;s am&eacute;lior&eacute; &agrave; la technologie

et enfin, ce qui n 'est pas n&eacute;gligeable, assurent un

certain degr&eacute; de protection en ce qui concerne les

d&eacute;veloppements politiques dans les domaines li&eacute;s

au commerce. 

<P>

La lib&eacute;ralisation multilat&eacute;rale et la tendance

croissante en faveur du r&eacute;gionalisme modifient les possibilit&eacute;s

&eacute;conomiques pour les PMA. D'une part, ceux qui b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient

d'un traitement pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel non r&eacute;ciproque

dans le cadre des SPG ou d'autres r&eacute;gimes pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiels

tels que Lom&eacute;, constatent une &eacute;rosion de la valeur

de leurs pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences. En outre, les PMA exclus des

blocs r&eacute;gionaux risquent de conna&icirc;tre des r&eacute;orientations

des &eacute;changes et des investissements &agrave; leur d&eacute;triment.

D'autre part, la lib&eacute;ralisation multilat&eacute;rale et

r&eacute;gionale, dans la mesure o&ugrave; cette derni&egrave;re

peut favoriser un abaissement des barri&egrave;res tarifaires

non seulement entre les partenaires mais &eacute;galement vis-&agrave;-vis

du reste du monde, devrait am&eacute;liorer les d&eacute;bouch&eacute;s

des PMA. 

<P>

Les pays en d&eacute;veloppement &agrave; la tra&icirc;ne en

mati&egrave;re de croissance et d'int&eacute;gration sont confront&eacute;s

&agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'inverser ces tendances n&eacute;gatives

et doivent prendre des d&eacute;cisions difficiles quant &agrave;

la mesure et &agrave; la vitesse de lib&eacute;ralisation et,

en particulier, doivent choisir la meilleure strat&eacute;gie

d'int&eacute;gration dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale: doiventils

adopter l'option multilat&eacute;rale, ou la lib&eacute;ralisation

unilat&eacute;rale est-elle la meilleure solution ? Doivent-ils

s'engager sur la voie du r&eacute;gionalisme (Sud-Sud et/ou Nord-Sud)

? Doivent-ils adopter une combinaison de ces options?

<TR><TD>

Un des objectifs majeurs des pays ACP au seuil du vingt-et-uni&egrave;me

si&egrave;cle est d'assurer leur int&eacute;gration optimale dans

l'&eacute;conomie mondiale, c'est-&agrave;-dire une int&eacute;gration

qui r&eacute;duit au minimum le risque de marginalisation, inversant

les courants actuels en ce sens, et qui maximise les opportunit&eacute;s

Les ACP peuvent envisager plusieurs strat&eacute;gies d'int&eacute;gration,

en fonction de leurs situations et conditions sp&eacute;cifiques,

et retenir les mod&egrave;les ou les voies les mieux adapt&eacute;s

afin de s'int&eacute;grer dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>a) la non-r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;. Insister sur le

rationaliser, r&eacute;duire et respecter les conditions tarifaires

de l'OMC pour d&eacute;fendre les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts commerciaux;

<P>

<LI>c) la lib&eacute;ralisation unilat&eacute;rale. Poursuivre

la lib&eacute;ralisation autonome des &eacute;changes, non r&eacute;gis

par le GATT, dans le cadre de programmes d'ajustement structurel

autonomes ou soutenus par les institutions de Bretton Woods. Maintenir

toute la flexibilit&eacute; accord&eacute;e en vertu

du GATT, en termes d'engagements et de calendriers, pour la

politique commerciale; 

<P>

<LI>d) une r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; Sud-Sud. Elargir et

&quot;naturelle&quot; (en termes de flux commerciaux et de compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute;s);

<P>

<LI>e) une r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; Nord-Sud. S'engager

dans des accords d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale comprenant

des &eacute;conomies d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es ainsi que des &eacute;conomies

en d&eacute;veloppement afin d'ancrer de fa&ccedil;on dynamique

sa propre &eacute;conomie dans celle des grands blocs commerciaux,

compensant ainsi les r&eacute;orientations en mati&egrave;re d'&eacute;changes

et d'investissements dont d'autres PMA pourraient profiter ou

avoir d&eacute;j&agrave; profit&eacute; (les Cara&iuml;bes dans

Bien entendu, ces diff&eacute;rentes options ne s'excluent

pas mutuellement. De nombreuses combinaisons sont possibles. C'est

en fonction des options dont disposent les ACP que

<H4>2. Des r&eacute;sultats encourageants qui pourraient marquer

un tournant</H4>

<P>

L'am&eacute;lioration r&eacute;cente des performances de croissance

en Afrique sub-saharienne (3.5 &agrave; 4% pour l'ensemble de

la r&eacute;gion en 1995 et 7% pour les 31 pays du SPA) est certes

en partie li&eacute;e &agrave; des facteurs de court terme, tels

que la remont&eacute;e des prix des mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res

sur les march&eacute;s internationaux. Mais elle est aussi encourageante

dans la mesure o&ugrave;, d'une part, elle concerne un grand nombre

de pays, d'autre part, elle est li&eacute;e &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration

de la gestion socio-&eacute;conomique et &agrave; l'adoption de

r&eacute;formes qui commencent &agrave; porter leurs fruits, se

traduisant notamment par une augmentation du volume des exportations.

<P>

L'&eacute;mergence de l'Afrique du Sud post-apartheid constitue

sans aucun doute l'un des &eacute;l&eacute;ments favorables les

plus &eacute;vidents. Les perspectives d'&eacute;volution dans

ce pays restent certes fonction de sa capacit&eacute; &agrave;

r&eacute;duire les facteurs de tension sociale et &agrave; am&eacute;liorer

la situation sur le march&eacute; du travail. Mais le potentiel

de croissance de l'Afrique du Sud est important, et les &eacute;volutions

favorables qui se profilent en termes d'investissement &eacute;tranger

et de relations commerciales sont appel&eacute;es &agrave; rejaillir

sur la r&eacute;gion tout enti&egrave;re, par les effets d'entra&icirc;nement

&eacute;conomique et gr&acirc;ce &agrave; une am&eacute;lioration

de la situation interne dans les autres pays de la r&eacute;gion.

<P>

Les pays de la zone franc en Afrique de l'Ouest contribuent &eacute;galement

&agrave; redresser l'image d'ensemble du continent: la d&eacute;valuation

de 1994 a eu des effets b&eacute;n&eacute;fiques, d'autant plus

marqu&eacute;s dans les pays o&ugrave; elle s'est accompagn&eacute;e

d'une politique d'ajustement et de r&eacute;formes. Le processus

d'int&eacute;gration &eacute;conomique r&eacute;gionale en Afrique

de l'Ouest ouvre en outre des perspectives favorables et pourrait

marquer un tournant d&eacute;cisif pour le d&eacute;veloppement

&eacute;conomique des pays de la r&eacute;gion, d'une part &agrave;

travers ses effets positifs en termes d'intensification des &eacute;changes

et d'am&eacute;lioration de la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;, d'autre

part dans la mesure o&ugrave; il devrait constituer un point d'ancrage

pour des politiques macro-&eacute;conomiques orient&eacute;es

vers la stabilit&eacute;, leur conf&eacute;rant ainsi une cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;

accrue, facteur-cl&eacute; pour dynamiser l'investissement tant

interne qu'&eacute;tranger.

<P>

En Afrique de l'Est &eacute;galement certains pays ont vu leur

situation s'am&eacute;liorer sensiblement au cours des deux derni&egrave;res

ann&eacute;es (Kenya, Tanzanie, Ouganda). Ces trois pays se sont

eux aussi r&eacute;cemment engag&eacute;s dans un processus de

coop&eacute;ration et d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale, qui

porte actuellement sur une coop&eacute;ration en mati&egrave;re

de transport, de communications et de paiements.

<P>

Plusieurs pays des Cara&iuml;bes ont accompli des progr&egrave;s

significatifs dans la stabilisation de leurs &eacute;conomies,

et ont profit&eacute; d'un environnement externe plus favorable

dans les ann&eacute;es 1980 pour engager des r&eacute;formes fiscales

et mon&eacute;taires, et entreprendre une lib&eacute;ralisation

commerciale dans le cadre d'un processus de coop&eacute;ration

et d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale visant &agrave; terme

une insertion dans l'&eacute;conomie de l'H&eacute;misph&egrave;re

occidental (voir encadr&eacute; 3). 

<P>

Dans tous ces pays cependant, les perspectives &agrave; moyen

terme d&eacute;pendront des progr&egrave;s qui pourront &ecirc;tre

r&eacute;alis&eacute;s dans la conduite des politiques &eacute;conomiques.

Mais les handicaps structurels demeurent un important facteur

de vuln&eacute;rabilit&eacute;. Tant que les nouveaux investissements

n'auront pas permis une diversification de la structure des exportations,

l'&eacute;volution des termes de l'&eacute;change restera fortement

tributaire des variations des prix des mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res,

risquant &agrave; tout moment de remettre en question le rythme

des r&eacute;formes et les acquis de l'ajustement.

<P>

En l'absence de chocs ext&eacute;rieurs majeurs, dans l'hypoth&egrave;se

d'une lente baisse tendencielle des prix des mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res

sur longue p&eacute;riode, et en tenant compte du caract&egrave;re

tr&egrave;s pr&eacute;caire de la situation dans les pays aujourd'hui

confront&eacute;s &agrave; des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes de d&eacute;sint&eacute;gration

sociale et de d&eacute;stabilisation politique plus ou moins forte,

les projections &agrave; moyen terme de la Banque Mondiale tablent

sur une croissance moyenne de 3.8% par an pour les dix prochaines

ann&eacute;es (1996-2005) pour l'ensemble de l'Afrique sub-saharienne

(y compris l'Afrique du Sud). Ce chiffre, qui est fond&eacute;

sur l'hypoth&egrave;se d'une poursuite des r&eacute;formes &agrave;

un rythme globalement inchang&eacute;, marquerait un progr&egrave;s

sensible par rapport aux dix derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es (1.7%

par an entre 1986 et 1995) et permettrait une modeste progression

du revenu par t&ecirc;te (+ 0.9% par an). Ceci ne permettra toutefois

pas de r&eacute;duire de mani&egrave;re significative la pauvret&eacute;

dans de nombreux pays; il s'agit l&agrave; d'un d&eacute;fi majeur

pour les gouvernements de ces pays et pour tous ceux qui sont

concern&eacute;s par la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

Les perspectives de d&eacute;veloppement de l'&eacute;conomie

mondiale font apparaitre un ensemble de param&egrave;tres potentiellement

favorables pour les pays ACP: une croissance relativement soutenue

du commerce mondial (plus de 6% par an selon les projections de

la Banque Mondiale), un syst&egrave;me commercial international

qui s'organise en fonction des r&eacute;sultats de l'Uruguay Round

et des travaux de l'OMC, d'importantes possibilit&eacute;s de

d&eacute;veloppement dans le secteur des services, notamment du

tourisme, l'&eacute;mergence de nouveaux march&eacute;s en forte

croissance en Asie de l'Est, en Am&eacute;rique latine, et potentiellement

en Europe de l'Est, qui pourraient permettre une diversification

des relations &eacute;conomiques et commerciales pour les pays

ACP. L'am&eacute;lioration pour les pays les plus pauvres de l'acc&egrave;s

aux march&eacute;s des pays industrialis&eacute;s, dont le principe

pouss&eacute; par l'UE a &eacute;t&eacute; approuv&eacute; lors

du r&eacute;cent Sommet du G7, constituera &eacute;galement un

facteur important.

<CAPTION><B>Encadr&eacute; n&#176;4. Les Cara&iuml;bes: perspectives d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale</B></CAPTION>

<TR><TD>

Dans sa d&eacute;finition g&eacute;ographique la plus large, le Bassin des Cara&iuml;bes       

comprend un ensemble de trente sept pays et territoires situ&eacute;s dans         

l'archipel des Antilles et sur la bordure maritime du continent             

latino-am&eacute;ricain. Ce sont: les quinze pays ACP ind&eacute;pendants des Cara&iuml;bes;   

deux Territoires n&eacute;erlandais et cinq Territoires britanniques (PTOM);       

trois D&eacute;partements fran&ccedil;ais d'outre-mer (DOM); deux Territoires associ&eacute;s    

aux Etats-Unis; Cuba et neuf pays hispanophones ind&eacute;pendants d'Am&eacute;rique     

centrale et du sud riverains de la mer des Cara&iuml;bes (March&eacute; Commun          

d'Am&eacute;rique Centrale, Mexique, Venezuela et Colombie). La grande majorit&eacute;    

de ces entit&eacute;s sont regroup&eacute;es au sein de la tr&egrave;s r&eacute;cente Association des   

Etats des Cara&iuml;bes qui repr&eacute;sente un espace &eacute;conomique potentiel de 205     

millions d'habitants.                                                       

<P>                                                                     

En raison de leur situation et de leur structure g&eacute;ographique, les          

Cara&iuml;bes se distinguent des autres r&eacute;gions de la zone ACP. L'avenir         

&eacute;conomique des pays de la r&eacute;gion passe sans doute par une int&eacute;gration       

progressive avec les Am&eacute;riques, &eacute;quilibr&eacute;e par le maintien de liens         

&eacute;troits et solides avec l'Europe. La recherche de cet &eacute;quilibre est         

motiv&eacute;e par le double souci de pr&eacute;server la souverainet&eacute; nationale et       

l'identit&eacute; r&eacute;gionale des pays des Cara&iuml;bes face au d&eacute;ferlement &eacute;conomique,  

culturel et technologique des Etats-Unis et d' ouvrir la possibilit&eacute;        

d'alliances commerciales alternatives. N&eacute;anmoins, la strat&eacute;gie de           

lib&eacute;ralisation des &eacute;changes engag&eacute;e dans l'h&eacute;misphere Ouest et le principe  

de r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; commerciale adopt&eacute; dans le cadre de l'ALENA  imposeront aux  

Cara&iuml;bes un changement plus rapide qu'en Afrique.                           

<P>                                                                           

La perspective d'accords de libre-&eacute;change et d'une plus grande coop&eacute;ration  

&eacute;conomique au sein de l'h&eacute;misph&egrave;re occidental relance l'int&eacute;r&euml;t d'une       

strat&eacute;gie d'int&eacute;gration &eacute;conomique r&eacute;gionale. L'objectif principal de       

cette int&eacute;gration serait de fournir un cadre &eacute;conomique et commercial       

permettant une insertion sans &agrave;-coup dans le processus de lib&eacute;ralisation    

et de p&eacute;parer les op&eacute;rateurs &eacute;conomiques de la r&eacute;gion &agrave; affronter la        

concurrence. Parall&egrave;llement, les Cara&iuml;bes doivent mesurer l'impact du       

nouvel environnement international sur la viabilit&eacute; politique et la survie  

&eacute;conomique des petits Etats insulaires qui composent la grande majorit&eacute;     

des pays de la r&eacute;gion.                                                      

 <P>                                                                           

La recherche d'une int&eacute;gration approfondie a depuis longtemps &eacute;t&eacute; au coeur  

des pr&eacute;occupations r&eacute;gionales. Les efforts dans ce domaine remontent &agrave;      

l'exp&eacute;rience avort&eacute;e de la F&eacute;d&eacute;ration des West Indies &agrave; la fin des ann&eacute;es   

5O et au d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 60. Au cours des dix derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, les        

tendances structurelles de l'&eacute;conomie mondiale on d&eacute;termin&eacute; au niveau       

r&eacute;gional plusieurs types de r&eacute;ponses que refl&egrave;tent les divers cercles       

concentriques d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale ou sub-r&eacute;gionale. De la petite union  

mon&eacute;taire des pays de l'Organisation de la Cara&iuml;be de l'Est (OECS), &agrave; la    

Communaut&eacute; et au March&eacute; unique du CARICOM, jusqu'&agrave; la r&eacute;cente et plus       

vaste Association des Etats des Cara&iuml;bes (ACS), l'&eacute;volution des structure   

r&eacute;gionales a suivi un cours &agrave; g&eacute;om&eacute;trie variable et tendu davantage vers    

l'&eacute;largissement que  l'approfondissement du processus d'int&eacute;gration.  

<P>

Si le bilan de ces efforts est mitig&eacute;, c'est en raison de la complexit&eacute;     

croissante et de la multiplicit&eacute; des d&eacute;fis auxquels sont confront&eacute;s les     

pays des Cara&iuml;bes. Ces d&eacute;fis concernent principalement :

impact social n&eacute;gatif;

<P>

L'une des strat&eacute;gies possibles pour les Cara&iuml;bes, dans ce contexte,         

demeure la promotion d'une forme r&eacute;aliste et ouverte d'int&eacute;gration          

r&eacute;gionale dont la dimension reste l'objet des r&eacute;flexions en cours.

<P>

Les conditions du d&eacute;veloppement tant au plan socio-politique

interne qu'au plan &eacute;conomique et politique international,

ont radicalement chang&eacute;.

<P>

L'analyse des contraintes et des potentialit&eacute;s des pays

ACP sugg&egrave;re un certain nombre de conclusions importantes

pour la r&eacute;flexion sur l'avenir de la coop&eacute;ration,

dans l'optique d'un appui mieux cibl&eacute; et plus efficace

pour accompagner ces pays dans leurs politiques d'ajustement et

de d&eacute;veloppement. Les aspects suivants devront notamment

&ecirc;tre pris en compte:

<P>

<UL>

<LI><U>l'appui aux politiques d'ajustement</U>. Dans une grande

partie de l'Afrique sub-saharienne, les probl&egrave;mes identifi&eacute;s

dans les ann&eacute;es soixante seront toujours pr&eacute;sents

en l'an 2000: tissu &eacute;conomique peu int&eacute;gr&eacute;,

infrastructures insuffisantes, organisation sociale et politique

peu propice au d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique. En d&eacute;pit

des handicaps structurels dont souffrent la plupart des pays de

la r&eacute;gion, les quelques &quot;success stories&quot; montrent

cependant qu'une am&eacute;lioration des niveaux de vie est possible,

et qu'elle est &eacute;troitement li&eacute;e &agrave; la r&eacute;insertion

de ces pays dans les &eacute;changes mondiaux. Le principal d&eacute;fi

pour les pays ACP r&eacute;side d'une part dans une am&eacute;lioration

de la gestion politique et &eacute;conomique interne, pour assurer

des conditions plus favorables au d&eacute;veloppement du secteur

priv&eacute; et pour attirer l'investissement &eacute;tranger;

d'autre part dans un &eacute;largissement des relations &eacute;conomiques

ext&eacute;rieures afin de tenir compte des nouvelles donnes de

la croissance &eacute;conomique mondiale. Les pays les plus pauvres

auront cependant encore longtemps besoin d'une aide ext&eacute;rieure

pour contribuer au financement des investissements et des services

de base essentiels; 

<P>

<LI><U>l'importance de la cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; et de la &quot;good

governance&quot;</U>. L'impact positif des r&eacute;formes n&eacute;cessaires

ne se r&eacute;alisera qu'&agrave; condition de gagner en cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;.

Les aspects politiques et institutionnels doivent aller de pair

avec les aspects &eacute;conomiques. Le futur partenariat s'inscrira

dans le cadre d'un processus de transition qui sera long, et qui

concerne non seulement l'organisation &eacute;conomique mais aussi

la transformation d'un mod&egrave;le de soci&eacute;t&eacute;;

<P>

<LI>the need for increasing attention to be given to the <U>environmental

aspects</U> of sustainable development. The focus should be primarily

on capacity strengthening and the environmental priorities of

the ACP States themselves, but attention also needs to be given

to engaging in dialogue with our partners on the consequences

they are likely to suffer as a result of global environmental

trends and their role in combatting unwelcome changes;

<P>

<LI><U>la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'adopter des approches diff&eacute;renci&eacute;es</U>.

Le r&ocirc;le, le contenu et les modalit&eacute;s de la coop&eacute;ration

ne peuvent &ecirc;tre identiques dans un pays en proie &agrave;

un processus de d&eacute;sint&eacute;gration &eacute;conomique

et sociale, ou dans un pays engag&eacute; dans un programme de

r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques et institutionnelles. La pr&eacute;vention

des conflits, la reconstruction des Etats et d'institutions efficaces,

doivent occuper une place importante parmi les objectifs de la

coop&eacute;ration. Dans les pays qui jouissent d'un degr&eacute;

minimal de coh&eacute;sion sociale, la coop&eacute;ration peut

contribuer &agrave; r&eacute;duire les risques et les facteurs

d'instabilit&eacute; qui font obstacle &agrave; l'investissement

et &agrave; la croissance. Les arrangements commerciaux peuvent

jouer un r&ocirc;le important &agrave; cet &eacute;gard, dans

la mesure o&ugrave; ils autorisent ou non des revirements de politiques.

Les modalit&eacute;s d'octroi de l'aide ext&eacute;rieure et notamment

de l'appui aux r&eacute;formes peuvent constituer une incitation

&agrave; proc&eacute;der aux adaptations n&eacute;cessaires des

politiques, et surtout &agrave; en assurer la continuit&eacute;.

Enfin d'autres formes de coop&eacute;ration pourraient &eacute;galement

&ecirc;tre recherch&eacute;es dans le but de r&eacute;duire les

facteurs d'instabilit&eacute;, notamment dans le domaine mon&eacute;taire;

</UL>

<P>

Les analyses d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es dans cette premi&egrave;re

partie montrent que les relations de coop&eacute;ration entre

l'UE et les pays ACP doivent d&eacute;sormais se concevoir dans

un environnement mondial radicalement diff&eacute;rent. Elles

s'inscrivent &eacute;galement dans la perspective d'une transformation

profonde de l'Union europ&eacute;enne, et dans le contexte d'&eacute;volutions

socio-&eacute;conomiques et politiques fortement contrast&eacute;es

dans les diff&eacute;rents pays de la zone ACP. Face &agrave;

une perte de l&eacute;gitimit&eacute; qui affecte le principe

m&ecirc;me de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement, sur fond de contraintes

budg&eacute;taires et de crise sociale europ&eacute;enne, les

le&ccedil;ons que l'on peut tirer des succ&egrave;s et des &eacute;checs

du pass&eacute; devront permettre d'am&eacute;liorer <U>l'efficacit&eacute;</U>

et <U>l'impact</U> de la coop&eacute;ration.

<P>

Pour l'Union, il s'agira avant tout de dominer les tendances individualistes

et de mettre en valeur les solidarit&eacute;s fondamentales. Pour

ce faire l'Union doit se donner pour principal objectif de &quot;faire

mieux&quot;, et de donner de plus grandes chances de succ&egrave;s

&agrave; sa coop&eacute;ration avec les pays ACP. De nombreuses

initiatives communautaires r&eacute;centes vont dans ce sens et

il conviendra de bien identifier les acquis &agrave; pr&eacute;server,

d'une politique aux facettes multiples. En revanche, nombre de

param&egrave;tres devront &ecirc;tre remis en cause. L'Union devra

faire des choix de politique &agrave; long terme et envisager

diff&eacute;rentes options.

<h2>Scouts Around World Promote ORT</h2>
<p>
In  Latin America, North and southern Africa Scouts are following up on a World Scout pledge to increase the use of oral rehydration therapy and reduce deaths from diarrhoeal dehydration.  The President of the World Scout Movement and UNICEF's late Executive Director, James P. Grant, signed their agreement on ORT last summer.<P>
In September, 5,000 Scouts representing over 1 million  throughout southern Africa took an oath to disseminate information on ORT to individuals, families and communities in a region which accounts for 40% of the 3 million annual child deaths from diarrhoeal disease.<p>  
In late December, diarrhoea and ORT became the central theme of the Panamerican Scout Jamboree in Cochabamba, Bolivia, attended by 7,000 Scouts.<p>  
In Cairo, 20 Scout and Girl Guide leaders from the Middle East and North Africa attended a 3-day training workshop on ORT sponsored by the Arab Scout Organisation and UNICEF.  Back home, participants will train 175,000 Scouts to promote ORT.
<p>
At the World Summit for Children in 1990, world leaders resolved to halve child deaths from diarrhoeal disease by the year 2000.  To achieve this target, it was further agreed that 80% of families should be empowered to use ORT by  the end of 1995.  By the end of 1994, UNICEF calculated that 44 developing nations are on track to achieve the 80% target within one year, while 46 could do so with some extra effort.

<P>

L'&eacute;ch&eacute;ance de l'an 2000 ne remet pas en cause toutes

les composantes de la politique de coop&eacute;ration mise en

oeuvre jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent. Au contraire une grande

partie des orientations qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es

au fil du temps, en particulier celles qui ont &eacute;t&eacute;

adopt&eacute;es au cours des ann&eacute;es r&eacute;centes, doivent

&ecirc;tre confirm&eacute;es et dans certains cas approfondies.

La politique de coop&eacute;ration est en &eacute;volution continue,

de nouvelles approches sont progressivement introduites dans de

nombreux domaines, et il convient d'en reconnaitre la pertinence.

<P>

Dans la ligne de ces orientations r&eacute;centes, tenant compte

des objectifs g&eacute;n&eacute;raux assign&eacute;s par le Trait&eacute;

&agrave; la politique communautaire de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement,

de l'exp&eacute;rience de la Convention de Lom&eacute; et de l'analyse

des contraintes et des potentialit&eacute;s des pays ACP pour

l'avenir, la coop&eacute;ration future entre l'UE et les pays

ACP doit permettre d'appuyer les efforts de ces pays pour assurer

les conditions d'un d&eacute;veloppement durable. Ces conditions

sont &agrave; la fois politiques, &eacute;conomiques et sociales.

L'am&eacute;lioration de la <U>comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;</U>

des &eacute;conomies ACP, indispensable pour accro&icirc;tre l'emploi

et relever le niveau de vie g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, peut &ecirc;tre

encourag&eacute;e par un ensemble de mesures qui rel&egrave;vent

des politiques externes - en faveur du d&eacute;veloppement et

de la diversification des &eacute;changes &eacute;conomiques et

commerciaux - et des politiques internes - en faveur d'une am&eacute;lioration

des capacit&eacute;s d'offre. A partir de ce constat, la politique

de coop&eacute;ration de l'UE vis-&agrave;-vis des pays ACP pourrait

&ecirc;tre restructur&eacute;e autour de trois axes prioritaires:

<P>

<UL>

<LI><U>la dimension &eacute;conomique et sociale.</U> La r&eacute;duction

de la pauvret&eacute; est au centre de nombreuses actions engag&eacute;es

par l'UE dans le cadre de sa coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re.

De nombreux pays ACP demeurent parmi les plus pauvres du monde,

et la lutte contre les situations de stagnation et de marginalisation

requiert un &eacute;ventail de politiques sectorielles et g&eacute;n&eacute;rales.

Diff&eacute;rentes options peuvent &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;es

pour &eacute;largir le champ d'action de l'UE en faveur de la

croissance &eacute;conomique, de l'investissement et du secteur

priv&eacute;, du d&eacute;veloppement social et de la r&eacute;duction

de la pauvret&eacute;;

<P>

<LI><U>la dimension institutionnelle et l'appui au secteur public</U>.

La mani&egrave;re dont l'Etat assume ses fonctions, les questions

de &quot;good governance&quot;, de gestion politique et &eacute;conomique,

s'av&egrave;rent souvent cruciales pour assurer les conditions

du d&eacute;veloppement dans de nombreux pays ACP. Outre leur

dimension politique essentielle, qui justifierait un renforcement

du dialogue politique UE-ACP tel qu'&eacute;voqu&eacute; au chapitre

IV.B, ces probl&egrave;mes pr&eacute;sentent &eacute;galement

des aspects &quot;techniques&quot; importants qui doivent &ecirc;tre

abord&eacute;s dans le cadre de la coop&eacute;ration. Il existe

d&eacute;sormais un large consensus sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

de soutenir les r&eacute;formes institutionnelles et le d&eacute;veloppement

des capacit&eacute;s dans toute politique de coop&eacute;ration.

L'UE est certes d&eacute;j&agrave; active dans ce domaine. Mais

elle pourrait envisager d'accentuer son appui &agrave; la r&eacute;forme

du cadre institutionnel et juridique, ainsi qu'&agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration

des capacit&eacute;s des services publics; cette capacit&eacute;

apparait en effet comme un domaine d'action susceptible d'avoir

un effet de levier important, dans la mesure o&ugrave;, dans de

nombreux pays ACP, elle concerne directement la gestion d'une

grande partie de l'aide, et elle en d&eacute;termine souvent l'impact

et la viabilit&eacute;;

<P>

<LI><U>le commerce et l'investissement</U>. The Lom&eacute; trade

arrangement, with its focus on tariff and quota preferences, has

been insufficient for the ACP countries, in contrast with the

much better performance of the LDC group, to preserve, least so

to improve, their participation in the world markets of goods,

services and capital.  Tariff advantages are, thus,  neither a

sufficient nor a necessary condition for good export and growth

performance. Supply-side factors, in particular good governance

and sound macro and microeconomic policies, notably stable, secure

and efficient internal trade and investment policies, are determinant

factors, more so than unilateral tariff preferences, in achieving

high rates of export and economic growth. L'impact limit&eacute;

des &quot;pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences Lom&eacute;&quot;, l'&eacute;rosion

pr&eacute;visble des marges pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentielles, et

la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de pr&eacute;voir des dispositions

compatibles avec les nouvelles r&egrave;gles de l'OMC, imposent

d'examiner les diff&eacute;rentes options devant lesquelles se

trouveront l'UE et les pays ACP pour d&eacute;finir de nouveaux

r&eacute;gimes d'&eacute;changes. L'objectif recherch&eacute;

est de contribuer &agrave; une meilleure insertion des pays ACP

dans les &eacute;changes &eacute;conomiques et commerciaux internationaux,

de les aider &agrave; mieux tirer parti des possibilit&eacute;s

de d&eacute;veloppement qu'ils peuvent offrir et d'&eacute;carter

les risques d'une marginalisation croissante.

</UL>

<P>

Pour chacun des trois axes de coop&eacute;ration ainsi identifi&eacute;s,

un <U>acquis communautaire</U> existe &agrave; des degr&eacute;s

divers. Dans les sections qui suivent, cet acquis fait l'objet

d'un bref rappel, en r&eacute;f&eacute;rence aux textes du Conseil

consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme les plus significatifs dans ces

domaines. Mais des options nouvelles devront aussi &ecirc;tre

consid&eacute;r&eacute;es, soit par n&eacute;cessit&eacute; institutionnelle

 - comme dans le cas des dispositions commerciales - soit pour

approfondir, renforcer et en finale accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&eacute;

de l'action de l'UE par rapport aux objectifs qu'elle poursuit

&agrave; travers sa politique de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="soc"><HR>A. La dimension socio-&eacute;conomique</A></H3>

<P>

Les analyses d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es aux chapitres I et III

ont soulign&eacute; le fait que les conditions du d&eacute;veloppement

&eacute;conomique et social sont en pleine &eacute;volution, au

niveau international et au plan interne dans les pays ACP. En

particulier la demande de d&eacute;mocratisation et d'une participation

accrue du secteur priv&eacute; et de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;

civile s'y exprime de plus en plus fortement. La plupart des pays

ACP sont engag&eacute;s dans la voie de l'&eacute;conomie de march&eacute;

et de l'ouverture commerciale, s'efforcent d'assurer des conditions

plus favorables au d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;,

et reconnaissent les effets b&eacute;n&eacute;fiques de l'investissement

&eacute;tranger. Un certain nombre d'entre eux ont entrepris,

avec des succ&egrave;s in&eacute;gaux et &agrave; des degr&eacute;s

divers, des r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques allant dans ce

sens. Les investisseurs priv&eacute;s sont cependant demeur&eacute;s

tr&egrave;s r&eacute;serv&eacute;s, et l'investissement &eacute;tranger

n'a en particulier &eacute;t&eacute; significatif que dans un

nombre limit&eacute; de pays et de secteurs. Les perspectives

de croissance se sont n&eacute;anmoins am&eacute;lior&eacute;es

dans un grand nombre de pays, sans pour autant permettre de r&eacute;duire

de mani&egrave;re significative l'incidence de la pauvret&eacute;.

Cette analyse a notamment conclu &agrave; l'importance d'assurer

une plus grande cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; &agrave; la politique

de r&eacute;forme afin d'en acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer les effets

positifs attendus, en r&eacute;duisant le degr&eacute; de risque

et d'instabilit&eacute; qui caract&eacute;rise l'environnement

&eacute;conomique. Les r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques et institutionnelles

n&eacute;cessaires devront en outre s'accompagner d'une transformation

profonde du fonctionnement de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;, ce qui

suppose in&eacute;vitablement des processus longs et progressifs.

<P>

Les pays ACP ont besoin d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer leur croissance

&eacute;conomique. Mais il existe aussi une marge importante pour

am&eacute;liorer l'impact de la croissance sur la r&eacute;duction

de la pauvret&eacute;. La participation du plus grand nombre &agrave;

l'activit&eacute; &eacute;conomique, l'acc&egrave;s aux ressources

productives (la terre, le capital et le cr&eacute;dit, la formation,

l'information) et aux services sociaux de base (&eacute;ducation,

sant&eacute;, nutrition, eau potable), l'am&eacute;lioration de

la situation socio-&eacute;conomique des femmes et des jeunes,

sont autant de dimensions essentielles et compl&eacute;mentaires

de toute strat&eacute;gie de lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;,

et qui rel&egrave;vent en premier lieu des politiques &eacute;conomiques

et sociales internes. Le r&ocirc;le de la coop&eacute;ration est

d'encourager l'&eacute;volution politique n&eacute;cessaire, et

de soutenir, par une assistance financi&egrave;re et technique,

les efforts entrepris. Aucune action en faveur de l'all&eacute;gement

de la pauvret&eacute; n'est r&eacute;ellement efficace et ne peut

avoir des effets durables, en l'absence d'un engagement et d'une

volont&eacute; claire du pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire.

<P>

Le concept du d&eacute;veloppement durable, la centralit&eacute;

du d&eacute;veloppement social et humain, ont &eacute;t&eacute;

largement d&eacute;battus au niveau international au cours des

derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es; lors des grandes conf&eacute;rences

internationales de <U>Rio, Le Caire, Copenhague, P&eacute;kin,

et Rome</U> notamment, un grand nombre de pays ont adopt&eacute;

des principes et  des valeurs communes, et ont identifi&eacute;

des objectifs prioritaires. Le cadre strat&eacute;gique g&eacute;n&eacute;ral,

les grandes orientations des politiques &eacute;conomiques et

sociales sont donc trac&eacute;es. Les r&eacute;f&eacute;rences

europ&eacute;ennes quant &agrave; elles sont claires: l'UE r&eacute;percute

dans ses relations de coop&eacute;ration, sa vision du d&eacute;veloppement

&eacute;conomique et social, elle-m&ecirc;me issue d'exp&eacute;riences

nationales diversifi&eacute;es. La question pour l'UE est donc

d&eacute;sormais de rechercher les moyens les plus efficaces d'encourager

la mise en oeuvre de ces strat&eacute;gies, le respect des principes

annonc&eacute;s.

<P>

L'analyse de la situation socio-&eacute;conomique dans la zone

ACP a aussi mis en &eacute;vidence la diff&eacute;renciation croissante

entre ces pays. L'UE doit envisager une <U>coop&eacute;ration

modulable</U>, permettant au fur et &agrave; mesure qu'un pays

ou un groupe de pays progresse dans la voie de la stabilisation

et des r&eacute;formes, de passer d'une politique centr&eacute;e

sur l'appui au processus de r&eacute;forme &agrave; une relation

s'&eacute;largissant &agrave; de nouveaux domaines de coop&eacute;ration

et &agrave; l'&eacute;tablissement de partenariats plus diversifi&eacute;s,

&agrave; l'instar de ce que l'UE propose dans d'autres r&eacute;gions

en d&eacute;veloppement (coop&eacute;ration &eacute;conomique

plus avanc&eacute;e, coop&eacute;ration scientifique, technique,

etc).

<P>

Les options en mati&egrave;re d'appui au d&eacute;veloppement

socio-&eacute;conomique devront donc &ecirc;tre appr&eacute;ci&eacute;es

dans cette perspective: non seulement des priorit&eacute;s strat&eacute;giques

diff&eacute;rentes devront &ecirc;tre adopt&eacute;es vis-&agrave;-vis

de chaque pays, mais les domaines de coop&eacute;ration pourront

&ecirc;tre diff&eacute;rents d'un pays &agrave; l'autre.

<P>

Ces options peuvent &ecirc;tre regroup&eacute;es autour de deux

axes prioritaires, qui rel&egrave;vent tous deux d'un objectif

de d&eacute;marginalisation: <U>l'int&eacute;gration des pays

ACP dans le syst&egrave;me &eacute;conomique international</U>

et <U>l'int&eacute;gration des populations pauvres dans la vie

&eacute;conomique et sociale.</U>

<P>

<H4>1. Stimuler la croissance &eacute;conomique par la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;

et le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;.</H4>

<P>

Bon nombre de politiques actuelles de coop&eacute;ration de

la CE sont ax&eacute;es sur la promotion d'une croissance plus

rapide et d'investissements priv&eacute;s plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s

dans les pays ACP et visent une int&eacute;gration plus vaste

dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale par l'interm&eacute;diaire du

commerce et des investissements. Ces politiques impliquent le

soutien financier et technique aur r&eacute;formes d'ajustement

structurel, le soutien sectoriel dans les domaines de l'infrastructure,

de l'agriculture, de l'industrie, des services et du d&eacute;veloppement

des ressources humaines et le soutien direct du secteur priv&eacute;

gr&acirc;ce &agrave; I'encouragement du d&eacute;veloppement

des entreprises, aux investissements, au d&eacute;veloppement

des &eacute;changes et &agrave; l'aide financi&egrave;re et

technique octroy&eacute;e par la BEI et le CDI. Un secteur

priv&eacute; robuste est essentiel pour am&eacute;liorer en permanence

et de fa&ccedil;on durable le niveau de vie et les possibilit&eacute;s.

<P>

Pour la CE, la question est de savoir, compte tenu des taux

de croissance modestes r&eacute;alis&eacute;s par de nombreux

pays partenaires dans le pass&eacute;, ce qu'elle peut faire de

plus pour promouvoir une croissance &eacute;conomique plus rapide,

une plus grande comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; des entreprises

des ACP, de meilleures performances &agrave; l'exportation et

des niveaux plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s d'investissements priv&eacute;s,

et quelles nouvelles politiques et approches elle peut adopter.

<P>

II existe plusieurs solutions pour am&eacute;liorer l'efficacit&eacute;

de l 'assistance future: 

<P>

<UL>

<LI><H4>a) Un soutien plus syst&eacute;matique et plus complet

en faveur du d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; </H4>

<P>

La r&eacute;ponse positive que l'on attendait du secteur priv&eacute;

aux r&eacute;formes economiques a &eacute;t&eacute; faible et

lente dans un certain nombre de pays, particuli&egrave;rement

en Afrique subsaharienne. Souvent, les r&eacute;formes n'ont pas

r&eacute;ussi &agrave; inspirer la confiance et &agrave; produire

les r&eacute;sultats attendus et en cons&eacute;quence &agrave;

limiter &agrave; des niveaux raisonnables les co&ucirc;ts et les

risques pour les investisseurs. L'exp&eacute;rience des derni&egrave;res

ann&eacute;es montre que les pays qui font preuve d'une volont&eacute;

cr&eacute;dible de mettre en oeuvre des politiques et des r&eacute;formes

politiques saines et qui offrent un environnement transparent

et favorable pour les entreprises r&eacute;ussissent &eacute;galement

&agrave; attirer les investissements, &agrave; cr&eacute;er des

emplois et des entreprises innovatrices, &agrave; augmenter leurs

recettes d'exportation et &agrave; enregistrer une croissance

&eacute;conomique durable. En cons&eacute;quence, les t&acirc;ches

&agrave; effectuer consistent: (i) &agrave; convaincre les autorit&eacute;s

publiques et le secteur priv&eacute; que les r&eacute;formes sont

r&eacute;elles et durables et que des politiques &eacute;conomiques

stables et pr&eacute;visibles seront mises en oeuvre; (ii)

&agrave; s'attaquer aux politiques et aux institutions qui sont

encore &agrave; l'origine de frais &eacute;lev&eacute;s, d'une

faible productivit&eacute; et d'un manque de comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;;

(iii) &agrave; renforcer les syst&egrave;mes financiers et les

institutions de fa&ccedil;on &agrave; permettre au secteur priv&eacute;

d'investir davantage et d'avoir un meilleur acc&egrave;s aux services

financiers; (iv) &agrave; d&eacute;velopper I'infrastructure &eacute;conomique

et (v) &agrave; renforcer les capacit&eacute;s du secteur priv&eacute;

&agrave; g&eacute;rer des entreprises, former des employ&eacute;s,

d&eacute;velopper et commercialiser des produits et &agrave;

r&eacute;aliser des gains d'efficacit&eacute;. 

<P>

Un certain nombre d'options s'offrent &agrave; la CE pour

d&eacute;velopper son plan d'action afin de contribuer &agrave;

la r&eacute;alisation de ces t&acirc;ches: 

<P>

<UL>

<LI><B>Renforcer la confiance</B>. La CE peut souligner le fait

que les r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques qu'elle soutient ainsi

que l'assistance qu'elle fournit pour promouvoir les secteurs

productifs de l'&eacute;conomie sont con&ccedil;ues dans le but

de soutenir les objectifs globaux de d&eacute;veloppement des

ACP et en particulier ceux du secteur priv&eacute;. Apr&egrave;s

consultation avec la population, ces arguments doivent &ecirc;tre

correctement expliqu&eacute;s aux partenaires nongouvernementaux.

<P>

Elle peut fournir des ressources pour aider les gouvernements

partenaires &agrave; affiner leurs relations avec le secteur

priv&eacute;, &agrave; am&eacute;liorer leurs communications avec

ce secteur, &agrave; le consulter au sujet de ses politiques

pr&eacute;vues et &agrave; &eacute;couter ses griefs et ses propositions.

Certains pays ACP ont d&eacute;j&agrave; des instances consultatives

r&eacute;unissant le gouvernement et le secteur priv&eacute;

qui peuvent jouer un r&ocirc;le important pour renforcer la

confiance, &agrave; condition de disposer de ressources adapt&eacute;es.

Dans ce contexte, le renforcement des organisations professionnelles

et des chambres de commerce est crucial, pour qu'elles soient

en mesure de remplir correctement leur r&ocirc;le et de fournir

des services utiles aux entreprises. 

<P>

<LI><B>Environnement politique et institutionnel</B>. La CE peut

aider les gouvernements partenaires &agrave; poursuivre leurs

r&eacute;formes administratives et institutionnelles (notamment

les r&eacute;formes de l'administration fiscale) et &agrave;

renforcer l'Etat de droit et I'administration de la justice qui

ont un impact sur les entreprises. Elle peut aider les gouvernements

&agrave; identifier les pratiques r&eacute;glementaires et administratives

inefficaces et sources de retard, qui sont un obstacle &agrave;

l'investissement et &agrave; la cr&eacute;ation d'emplois et qui

augmentent inutilement les co&ucirc;ts et les risques inh&eacute;rents

&agrave; la conduite normale d'affaires. 

<P>

Elle peut apporter une contribution technique plus &eacute;nergique

&agrave; la planification et &agrave; la mise en oeuvre de la

privatisation des entreprises publiques (voir plus loin sous-paragraphe

b)) et rechercher avec les gouvernements partenaires des solutions

cr&eacute;atives et durables aux d&eacute;ficiences infrastructurelles

qui constituent des obstacles pour le secteur priv&eacute;

<P>

Elle peut soutenir l'introduction de politiques, de r&egrave;gles

et de pratiques r&eacute;gissant la concurrence, la protection

des consommateurs et la r&eacute;glementation des monopoles, la

recherche, I'information et les transferts de technologie qui

compl&egrave;tent les r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques et la

privatisation. 

<P>

<LI><B>Syst&egrave;mes financiers et institutions</B>. La CE peut

mettre plus de moyens en oeuvre pour soutenir les march&eacute;s

locaux des capitaux et am&eacute;liorer l'acc&egrave;s des entreprises

au services financiers. Elle peut fournir des services de conseil

techniques et un soutien financier pour la restructuration d'institutions

financi&egrave;res faibles et pour le renforcement du cadre juridique

et r&eacute;glementaire au sein duquel des nouveaux services financiers,

fond&eacute;s sur une base saine, peuvent &ecirc;tre mis en

place au service des entreprises. des petites entreprises,

des agriculteurs et des &eacute;pargnants. Une attention particuli&egrave;re

doit &ecirc;tre accord&eacute;e &agrave; des questions telles

que (i) le renforcement de la formation de capitaux nationaux,

(ii) le soutien de la diversification des institutions et des

services financiers et (iii) l'am&eacute;lioration des syst&egrave;mes

et r&eacute;seaux de paiement. 

<P>

<LI><B>Ressources et capacit&eacute;s du secteur priv&eacute;</B>. Le

FED soutient directement les entreprises priv&eacute;es par l'interm&eacute;diaire

des programmes indicatifs nationaux, par le d&eacute;veloppement

des entreprises et du commerce et par l'action de la Banque europ&eacute;enne

d'investissement (BEI) et du Centre pour le d&eacute;veloppement

industriel (CDI). Le CDI a r&eacute;cemment actualis&eacute;

son portefeuille d'instruments &agrave; la lumi&egrave;re de l'exp&eacute;rience

positive du dispositif financier ECIP op&eacute;rationnel

dans les pays ALA et de la M&eacute;diterran&eacute;e et en

Afrique du Sud. 

<P>

Les programmes nationaux de la CE assurent le soutien financier

et technique des microentreprises, des PME et des entreprises

artisanales sous la forme de lignes de cr&eacute;dit. de fonds

de garantie, de services consultatifs, de formations et d'assistance

technologique. Ces programmes ont fait leurs preuves et devraient

probablememt encore pouvoir se d&eacute;velopper (notamment gr&acirc;ce

&agrave; des financements ad&eacute;quats). La BEI a &eacute;galenment

jou&eacute; un r&ocirc;le important dans l'octroi de pr&ecirc;ts

et de capitaux &agrave; risque. La CE soutient &eacute;galement

des entreprises plus importantes gr&acirc;ce &agrave; ses actions

dans Ie domaine des investissements industriels et du d&eacute;veloppement

du commerce. 

<P>

La Commission, en collaboration avec le CDI, pourrait &eacute;largir

la port&eacute;e de son assistance en finan&ccedil;ant des services

de consultation et de conseil (locaux et externes) destin&eacute;s,

moyennant une participation aux frais, &agrave; des entrepreneurs

locaux cherchant &agrave; d&eacute;velopper leurs affaires. Elle

pourrait &eacute;galement mettre plus de moyens en oeuvre pour

accro&icirc;tre les capacit&eacute;s des associations

commerciales et professionnelles locales &agrave; assurer &agrave;

leurs membres des services de renforcement des capacit&eacute;s.

<P>

La BEI octroie &eacute;galement des pr&ecirc;ts et des capitaux

&agrave; risque, subventionn&eacute;s par des ressources FED,

&agrave; des projets plus importants du secteur priv&eacute; dans

les domaines de l'infrastructure, de l'industrie, des mines et

de l'agro-industrie. Une partie de ces ressources est r&eacute;troc&eacute;d&eacute;e

par des interm&eacute;diaires financiers locaux &agrave; des petites

et moyennes entreprises priv&eacute;es. 

<P>

Une option pour augmenter le soutien aux entreprises officielles

consisterait &agrave; orienter davantage de ressources FED vers

la Commission et la BEI, conform&eacute;ment au r&ocirc;le des

deux institutions et &agrave; satisfaire les demandes croissantes

d'op&eacute;rations priv&eacute;es dans les pays ACP. En outre,

les fonds FED pourraient &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre mis

&agrave; la disposition d'autres institutions de financement du

d&eacute;veloppement bas&eacute;es dans I'UE (comme par exemple

les institutions EDFI), dont certaines sont activement engag&eacute;es

dans le d&eacute;veloppement de services financiers innovateurs

pour le secteur priv&eacute; dans les pays ACP. Toutefois, le

but &agrave; plus long terme doit &ecirc;tre d'encourager la croissance

des march&eacute;s de capitaux locaux et r&eacute;gionaux et,

en ce qui concerne les entreprises plus importantes et mieux &eacute;tablies

dans les pays ACP, de financer leur d&eacute;veloppement &agrave;

partir des sources du march&eacute;, et non &agrave; partir de

cr&eacute;dits officiels. Dans ce contexte, le d&eacute;veloppement

de l'&eacute;pargne locale et sa canalisation vers les investissements

productifs sont d'une importance cruciale. 

<P>

Le CDI a toujours &eacute;t&eacute; le principal instrument

de la Convention de Lom&eacute; assurant des services de conseil

techniques au secteur des petites et moyennes industries, particuli&egrave;rement

pour ce qui concerne la pr&eacute;paration et l'&eacute;valuation

de projets ainsi que pour arranger des financements et des partenariats.

II poss&egrave;de des antennes locales sur de nombreux march&eacute;s

ACP et est bien plac&eacute; pour jouer un r&ocirc;le d'interm&eacute;diaire

entre les nouvelles entreprises en expansion d'une part et le

savoir-faire financier, technologique et de gestion d'autre part.

<P>

La Commission pourrait, dans le cadre d'une politique d'accroissement

de la fourniture de nouvelles technologies orient&eacute;es

par la demande et de services de conseil &agrave; l'intention

du secteur priv&eacute; des pays ACP, encourager le CDI ainsi

que d'autres founisseurs potentiels de services de l'UE et

des pays partenaires &agrave; accro&icirc;tre leurs capacit&eacute;s

pour assister les entreprises, moyennant un partage des frais,

ce qui constituerait une option prometteuse pour l'avenir.

<P>

<LI><B>Promotion des investissements</B>. La Convention de Lom&eacute;

a longtemps reconnu l'importance des investissements &eacute;trangers

directs pour la croissance et la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;

des &eacute;conomies des ACP. La Commission fournit une assistance

technique pour la r&eacute;daction de codes en mati&egrave;re

d'investissements et de lois et de r&egrave;glements pour prot&eacute;ger

les investissements et pour les initiatives de promotion des investissements

lanc&eacute;es par les gouvernements. Elle a financ&eacute; des

investissements sectoriels et des forums de partenariat pour faire

conna&icirc;tre les opportunit&eacute;s aux investisseurs &eacute;trangers

potentiels et promouvoir les partenariats. Ces activit&eacute;s

compl&egrave;tent utilement les r&eacute;formes et les mesures

de renforcement de la confiance qui am&eacute;liorent l'environnement

favorable au d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;.

<P>

Les efforts visant &agrave; constituer une &quot;vitrine&quot;

attrayante pour les possibilit&eacute;s d'investissements dans

des pays qui offrent un environnement politique et institutionnel

satisfaisant doivent indubitablement &ecirc;tre poursuivis. Les

options pour des actions de protection des investissements font

I'objet d'une analyse plus d&eacute;taill&eacute;e dans la section

V.C cidessous. 

<P>

Pour mettre en oeuvre ce plan d'action, la CE devra faire preuve

de souplesse, d'empirisme et de pragmatisme en ce qui concerne

les priorit&eacute;s r&eacute;elles et les besoins ressentis par

les parties int&eacute;ress&eacute;es, et ce, pays par pays. Elle

devra &ecirc;tre s&eacute;lective et cibler avec attention Ie

choix de ses programmes. Dans son approche du d&eacute;veloppement

du secteur priv&eacute;, la CE doit cependant &ecirc;tre coh&eacute;rente

et bien coordonn&eacute;e avec d'autres acteurs (locaux et

&eacute;trangers) poursuivant les m&ecirc;mes objectifs. Lorsque

le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute; et le soutien

d'une plus grande comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; sont des traits

marquants de ses strat&eacute;gies de coop&eacute;ration, elle

doit, en collaboration avec les autres parties int&eacute;ress&eacute;es,

chercher &agrave; &eacute;laborer des strat&eacute;gies de d&eacute;veloppement

du secteur priv&eacute; sur lesquelles peuvent s'appuyer des programmes

et des projets individuels. 

<P>

Les modifications possibles des instruments de coop&eacute;ration

visant &agrave; soutenir une politique &eacute;largie et recentr&eacute;e

d'encouragement du secteur priv&eacute; sont examin&eacute;es

dans le chapitre Vl.A cidessous. Une approche consiste &agrave;

envisager, lorsque c'est possible, l'affectation d'une partie

de l'assistance nationale programmable au soutien du d&eacute;veloppement

du secteur priv&eacute; gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des actions visant

&agrave; am&eacute;liorer l'environnement politique et institutionnel

et gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des mesures de soutien direct des entreprises.

Le secteur priv&eacute; pourrait &ecirc;tre invit&eacute;

&agrave; participer &agrave; la d&eacute;finition des priorit&eacute;s

pour l'utilisation de cette enveloppe de ressources. 

</UL>

<P>

<LI><H4>b) appuyer des programmes de restructuration des entreprises

publiques et de privatisations</H4>

<P>

Les privatisations constituent souvent l'un des volets des r&eacute;formes

visant &agrave; relancer l'investissement, &agrave; assurer un

environnement plus concurrentiel et &agrave; d&eacute;velopper

des structures &eacute;conomiques plus flexibles et plus diversifi&eacute;es.

Les privatisations ne constituent pas pour autant une solution

en soi, et une approche au cas par cas doit pouvoir &ecirc;tre

adopt&eacute;e. Ces programmes sont g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement

complexes et difficiles &agrave; r&eacute;aliser, exigeant des

capacit&eacute;s d'analyse et administratives importantes. Une

assistance technique, notamment pour &eacute;valuer les diff&eacute;rentes

options (restructuration, r&eacute;habilitation de l'outil &eacute;conomique,

etc) et un accompagnement des plans sociaux lorsqu'ils s'av&egrave;rent

n&eacute;cessaires, peuvent contribuer &agrave; am&eacute;liorer

la situation.

<P>

L'UE est bien plac&eacute;e pour soutenir des programmes de privatisation

dans la mesure o&ugrave; elle peut mobiliser l'expertise d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e

dans les diff&eacute;rents Etats membres et valoriser l'exp&eacute;rience

acquise dans une grande vari&eacute;t&eacute; de pays. L'UE pourrait

envisager de d&eacute;velopper ce type d'appui dans les pays o&ugrave;

manifestement les privatisations faciliteraient l'entr&eacute;e

de nouveaux investisseurs priv&eacute;s et contribueraient &agrave;

des gains de comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;.

<P>

<LI><H4>c) poursuivre et intensifier l'appui &agrave; l'int&eacute;gration

r&eacute;gionale</H4>

<P>

Depuis la premi&egrave;re Convention de Lom&eacute;, la Communaut&eacute;

a soutenu de nombreuses formes de coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale.

En termes de financement, les principaux domaines ont &eacute;t&eacute;

les suivants: transports et communications, environnement,

contr&ocirc;le des maladies animales et formation. Progressivement,

le soutien a &eacute;t&eacute; unifi&eacute; dans le cadre de

l'objectif g&eacute;n&eacute;ral de renforcement de l'int&eacute;gration

&eacute;conomique. Le raisonnement sous-jacent est que pour les

pays ACP, l'int&eacute;gration &eacute;conomique r&eacute;gionale

est une &eacute;tape indispensable vers leur int&eacute;gration

r&eacute;ussie dans I '&eacute;conomie mondiale. Parall&egrave;lement,

I 'UE a attir&eacute; l'attention sur les effets n&eacute;gatifs

qu'entra&icirc;nent la formulation et la mise en oeuvre de programmes

de r&eacute;forme &eacute;conomique dans un contexte purement

national. Actuellement, la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de tenir compte

de la &quot;dimension r&eacute;gionale de l'ajustement&quot; est

universellement reconnue. Au cours de ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es,

la CE a soutenu activement plusieurs organisations r&eacute;gionales,

notamment la r&eacute;cente UEMOA (Afrique occidentale) et la

SADC (Afrique australe) r&eacute;cemment transform&eacute;e et

&eacute;largie. En collaboration avec trois autres bailleurs de

fonds (Banque africaine de d&eacute;veloppement, FMI et Banque

mondiale), la CE soutient l'initiative transfrontali&egrave;re

en Afrique orientale et australe et dans l'Oc&eacute;an indien,

&agrave; laquelle 14 pays participent activement. 

<P>

Deux aspects importants de cette initiative doivent &ecirc;tre

soulign&eacute;s: la participation du secteur priv&eacute; et

la coh&eacute;rence de l'agenda politique national et r&eacute;gional.

<P>

Par l'interm&eacute;diaire de ses programmes indicatifs r&eacute;gionaux,

la CE soutient des initiatives en mati&egrave;re d 'infrastructure,

d 'environnement, de sant&eacute; et autres qui pr&eacute;sentent

un int&eacute;r&ecirc;t pour plus d'un pays et se pr&ecirc;tent

extr&ecirc;mement bien &agrave; la conception et &agrave; la mise

en oeuvre sur une base r&eacute;gionale. 

<P>

Afin d'am&eacute;liorer les performances pass&eacute;es, il

est n&eacute;cessaire de soutenir l'int&eacute;gration &eacute;conomique

r&eacute;gionale dans le cadre d'une strat&eacute;gie coh&eacute;rente.

Compte tenu de I'exp&eacute;rience r&eacute;cente de l 'UE, une

telle strat&eacute;gie devrait reposer sur les trois &eacute;l&eacute;ments

de base suivants: 

<P>

<UL>

<LI>1. <B>Renforcement des capacit&eacute;s</B> (entre autres

l'assistance technique, la formation et la recherche interne)

dans le domaine de l'int&eacute;gration &eacute;cononomique r&eacute;gionale

tant au niveau des institutions r&eacute;gionales que des gouvernements

nationaux: 

<P>

<LI>2. <B>Assistance au secteur priv&eacute; pour faciliter

la restructuration</B> dans le march&eacute; r&eacute;gional

plus vaste et le march&eacute; mondial, ce qui impliquerait &eacute;galement

des am&eacute;liorations dans le secteur financier afin de

faciliter et de garantir les paiements; 

<P>

<LI>3. <B>Soutien aux gouvernements ,souhaitant r&eacute;ellement

effectuer une int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale</B>

afin de neutraliser les effets de la transition sur

les ressources budg&eacute;taires (soutien de la balance

des paiements ou budg&eacute;taire, en compl&eacute;ment au

soutien &agrave; l'ajustement &eacute;conomigue national et

compl&egrave;tement en ligne avec celui-ci). 

</UL>

<P>

Les instruments disponibles &agrave; l'heure actuelle conviennent

parfaitement pour soutenir une telle strat&eacute;gie coh&eacute;rente.

<P>

Il existe pour l'UE une autre nouvelle voie pour promouvoir

l'int&eacute;gration &eacute;conomique r&eacute;gionale qui m&eacute;rite

d'&ecirc;tre &eacute;tudi&eacute;e plus avant, &agrave;

savoir celle de la <B>politique commerciale</B>. L'UE participe

&agrave; l'heure actuelle &agrave; des n&eacute;gociations pour

r&eacute;aliser une zone de libre-&eacute;change (ZLE) avec plusieurs

(groupements de) pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Compte tenu du

poids de l'UE dans les questions commerciales, les dispositions

de ces ZLE affecteront l'int&eacute;gration des pays en d&eacute;veloppement

dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale. Il est possible d'exploiter ces

dispositions d'une fa&ccedil;on qui favorise une plus grande coh&eacute;rence

&eacute;conomique des pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Conform&eacute;ment

aux conclusions de la Commission et du Conseil de juin 1995 sur

les zones de libre&eacute;change, ces accords doivent respecter

les dispositions correspondantes de l'OMC et tenir compte des

cons&eacute;quences pour les politiques communes de l'Union et

pour ses principaux partenaires commerciaux. 

<P>

<LI><H4>d) intensifier les actions d'appui au d&eacute;veloppement

du commerce.</H4>

<P>

Le d&eacute;veloppement du commerce constitue un volet particulier

d'une politique plus globale centr&eacute;e sur la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute;

et le d&eacute;veloppement du secteur priv&eacute;. Outre les

instruments propres au r&eacute;gime commercial et de l'investissement,

qui seront discut&eacute;s au chapitre V.C., un large &eacute;ventail

d'actions de coop&eacute;ration peuvent contribuer au d&eacute;veloppement

du commerce. Cette dimension a &eacute;t&eacute; introduite dans

la Convention de Lom&eacute; lors de la r&eacute;vision de 1995

et l'UE a entrepris de d&eacute;velopper ce domaine de coop&eacute;ration

autour de diff&eacute;rents programmes d'appui: d&eacute;finition

de programmes int&eacute;gr&eacute;s de d&eacute;veloppement du

commerce au niveau national ou r&eacute;gional, programmes pluri-annuels

d'appui aux associations de commerce regroupant des op&eacute;rateurs

des ACP et des op&eacute;rateurs europ&eacute;ens, programmes

d'appui aux entreprises dans des secteurs d&eacute;termin&eacute;s,

et programmes d'appui au d&eacute;veloppement des infrastructures

et des services li&eacute;s au commerce (transport et communications,

interm&eacute;diaires financiers et autres, chambres de commerce,

etc).

<P>

Compte tenu du fait que les nouveaux d&eacute;fis pos&eacute;s

par la mondialisation et la comp&eacute;tition  modifieront

les param&egrave;tres de base des &eacute;changes internationaux,

I'UE doit en  cons&eacute;quence renforcer et intensifier

ses engagements en vue de soutenir les Etats ACP dans  leurs efforts

pour b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier des avantages potentiels d&eacute;coulant

des nouvelles possibilit&eacute;s  d'&eacute;changes.

<P>

Un accent particulier doit &ecirc;tre mis sur le secteur priv&eacute;

et ce soutien devra se concentrer sur la  demande des clients

et la participation. La priorit&eacute; doit &ecirc;tre accord&eacute;e

&agrave; la cr&eacute;ation de r&eacute;seaux de partenariat internationaux,

&agrave; la promotion des investissements et au d&eacute;veloppement

 d'industries et d'institutions de services de soutien.

<P>

Le renforcement des m&eacute;canismes d'am&eacute;lioration des

r&eacute;seaux entre les secteurs priv&eacute;s  europ&eacute;ens

et ACP doit faire l'objet d'une plus grande attention. 

<P>

En outre, compte tenu de la r&eacute;volution de la technologie

de l'information globale qui  caract&eacute;risera le prochain

mill&eacute;naire, I'UE doit intensifier son soutien aux Etats

ACP pour leur  permettre d'acc&eacute;der aux mat&eacute;riels

et logiciels qui y sont associ&eacute;s et pour en faciliter

 l'utilisation optimale.

<P>

<LI><H4>e) soutenir le d&eacute;veloppement des comp&eacute;tences

scientifiques et techniques comme &eacute;l&eacute;ment strat&eacute;gique

d'un d&eacute;veloppement durable</H4>

<P>

Le d&eacute;veloppement acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute; de technologies

de plus en plus complexes, en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute;,

d'alimentation et de communications notamment, et le foss&eacute;

scientifique et technologique grandissant qui s&eacute;pare la

plupart des pays ACP du monde industrialis&eacute;, devraient

motiver une action particuli&egrave;re de l'UE dans ce domaine.

Bien que cette dimension soit pr&eacute;sente dans la convention

de Lom&eacute;, elle n'a en effet jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent

pas donn&eacute; lieu &agrave; un plan d'action coh&eacute;rent

et durable. 

<P>

Compte tenu de l'exp&eacute;rience communautaire, l'UE est bien

plac&eacute;e pour d&eacute;velopper des partenariats scientifiques

et technologiques rassemblant des institutions publiques de recherche

&amp; d&eacute;veloppement et des entreprises priv&eacute;es des

secteurs concern&eacute;s, au Nord et au Sud. Ces actions devraient

s'appuyer sur un dialogue sur les enjeux de la R&amp;D avec les

pays ACP, en particulier dans un cadre r&eacute;gional, visant

&agrave; encourager ces pays &agrave; faire &eacute;voluer leurs

cadres r&eacute;glementaires (droits de propri&eacute;t&eacute;

intellectuelle, circulation des biens et des personnes, code des

investissements, ...) et &agrave; les aider &agrave; assurer les

implications budg&eacute;taires d'une politique visant &agrave;

d&eacute;velopper les partenariats Recherche-Entreprises.

<P>

<LI><H4>f) aider les pays ACP &agrave; se pr&eacute;parer aux mutations

en cours dans le domaine de l'information</H4>

<P>

L'&eacute;volution engag&eacute;e vers la soci&eacute;t&eacute;

de l'information concerne non seulement les &eacute;conomies avanc&eacute;es

ou &eacute;mergentes mais &eacute;galement les &eacute;conomies

et les soci&eacute;t&eacute;s ouvertes ou d&eacute;sireuses de

s'ouvrir sur l'ext&eacute;rieur. Comme l'ont reconnu les participants

&agrave; la r&eacute;cente conf&eacute;rence de Midrand,  ces

changements doivent s'int&eacute;grer dans &quot;une vision commune

du futur&quot; partag&eacute;e par les pays industrialis&eacute;s

et les pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Mais la Conf&eacute;rence

a &eacute;galement, dans les conclusions de sa Pr&eacute;sidence,

insist&eacute; sur la responsabilit&eacute; des pays et sur le

r&ocirc;le irrempla&ccedil;able que doit jouer le secteur priv&eacute;.

<P>

La premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape r&eacute;side dans l'am&eacute;lioration

des services de t&eacute;l&eacute;communications qui, avec l'eau

et l'&eacute;lectricit&eacute;, sont utilis&eacute;s par la totalit&eacute;

des branches de l'&eacute;conomie.

<P>

Ce domaine constitue un champ particuli&egrave;rement attractif

pour le secteur priv&eacute; en raison de son potentiel de croissance

(la totalit&eacute; des Etats &eacute;tant sous-&eacute;quip&eacute;s)

et de l'apparition r&eacute;cente de nouvelles technologies qui

r&eacute;pondent avec plus de flexibilit&eacute; aux besoins de

pays tels que  les ACP, notamment les transmissions satellites,

la t&eacute;l&eacute;phonie cellulaire mobile et fixe. L'exp&eacute;rience

europ&eacute;enne de transition est suffisamment riche et diversifi&eacute;e

pour offrir un appui sur mesure aux pays qui le souhaiteraient.

<P>

A cela, s'ajoute le d&eacute;veloppement de nouveaux services,

dont INTERNET qui est d&eacute;j&agrave; accessible dans de nombreux

pays et qui repr&eacute;sente une r&eacute;elle opportunit&eacute;

d'int&eacute;grer ses utilisateurs, chercheurs, universitaires,

ou entrepreneurs dans les r&eacute;seaux des &eacute;changes mondiaux

de l'information.

<P>

Dans une &eacute;tape ult&eacute;rieure, des applications t&eacute;l&eacute;matiques

notamment en mati&egrave;re de sant&eacute;, d'&eacute;ducation,

de r&eacute;seaux de la recherche mais aussi de commerce &eacute;lectronique,

pourront contribuer &agrave; la solution de certains probl&egrave;mes

dans les pays ACP. Ces actions seront d'autant plus efficaces

que les acteurs concern&eacute;s auront &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;par&eacute;s

et associ&eacute;s &agrave; la d&eacute;finition de leur contenu

et aux modalit&eacute;s de leur usage gr&acirc;ce &agrave; des

projets pilotes. 

<P>

Ainsi, &agrave; des modes d'usage principalement individuels dans

les &eacute;conomies avanc&eacute;es peuvent se substituer des

mod&egrave;les communautaires, comme l'illustrent bien les exp&eacute;riences

de t&eacute;l&eacute;-boutique.

<P>

<LI><H4>g) proposer une coop&eacute;ration mon&eacute;taire</H4>

<P>

Le degr&eacute; &eacute;lev&eacute; d'instabilit&eacute; politique

et &eacute;conomique constitue, dans de nombreux pays ACP, un

frein majeur &agrave; la progression de l'investissement et &agrave;

l'acc&eacute;l&eacute;ration de la croissance. Un environnement

mon&eacute;taire et financier stable est un &eacute;l&eacute;ment

indispensable d'une politique &eacute;conomique visant &agrave;

la poursuite d'un objectif de croissance &eacute;quilibr&eacute;e

et durable. Ceci implique non seulement l'existence d'institutions

efficaces et ind&eacute;pendantes, la mise en oeuvre d'une politique

mon&eacute;taire et de change orient&eacute;es vers la stabilit&eacute;

et des politiques budg&eacute;taires soutenables, mais aussi un

&eacute;largissement du r&ocirc;le du syst&egrave;me bancaire

dans l'affectation de l'&eacute;pargne.

<P>

L'Europe pourrait soutenir les efforts de modernisation et d'adaptation

des pays ACP dans ces domaines. Les objectifs prioritaires seraient

la consolidation des institutions et la modernisation des modes

de gestion des politiques mon&eacute;taire et budg&eacute;taire,

le d&eacute;veloppement du syst&egrave;me bancaire, la r&eacute;alisation

de la convertibilit&eacute; courante et la lib&eacute;ralisation

progressive des mouvements de capitaux, en tenant compte des degr&eacute;s

de d&eacute;veloppement et de stabilit&eacute; macro-&eacute;conomique

atteints. En outre, l'Union devrait continuer &agrave; encourager

les efforts de coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale dans le domaine

de la politique macro-&eacute;conomique et mon&eacute;taire. 

 <P>

L'Union mon&eacute;taire et l'introduction de l'EURO ouvriront

des opportunit&eacute;s nouvelles aux pays ACP, notamment &agrave;

ceux pour lesquels l'UE repr&eacute;sente le principal partenaire

commercial. La cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; et l'efficacit&eacute;

de leur politique mon&eacute;taire seraient accrues s'ils choisissaient

d'orienter leur politique de change en se r&eacute;ferant &agrave;

une monnaie stable, tout en tenant compte de la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

de pr&eacute;server la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; de leurs &eacute;conomies.

En outre, le choix d'une m&ecirc;me r&eacute;f&eacute;rence externe

contribuerait &agrave; une plus grande stabilit&eacute; des taux

de change bilat&eacute;raux entre ces pays. Ceci faciliterait

les &eacute;changes &eacute;conomiques et commerciaux entre eux,

ainsi que la mise en oeuvre des projets d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale.

<P>

Ces diff&eacute;rents &eacute;l&eacute;ments permettront de poser

les bases d'un renforcement progressif de la coop&eacute;ration

dans le domaine macro-&eacute;conomique et mon&eacute;taire entre

l'UE et les pays ACP.

<P>

<LI><H4>h) entreprendre une action de soutien de l'UE permettant d'all&eacute;ger

la charge de la dette ext&eacute;rieure</H4>

<P>

Compte tenu de l'importance de la probl&eacute;matique de la dette

ext&eacute;rieure pour un grand nombre de pays ACP, la Communaut&eacute;

peut difficilement rester <U>insensible</U> aux initiatives <U>internationales</U>

en la mati&egrave;re. La coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re

de la Communaut&eacute;, presque exclusivement octroy&eacute;e

sous forme de dons, n'a pas d'effet d'accroissement de la dette.

N&eacute;anmoins, la Communaut&eacute; pourrait intervenir en

tant que cr&eacute;ancier, mais aussi en tant que donateur, en

d&eacute;veloppant des m&eacute;canismes  de soutien et des instruments

destin&eacute;s &agrave; r&eacute;duire la contrainte de la dette

des pays ACP poursuivant des programmes d'ajustement et de r&eacute;forme.

</UL>  

<P>

<H4>2. Favoriser l'accroissement de l'emploi et soutenir les politiques

sociales dans le cadre de la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;.</H4>

<P>

Il existe de fortes motivations du c&ocirc;t&eacute; europ&eacute;en

pour centrer les efforts de coop&eacute;ration avec les ACP sur

l'objectif de lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;: il s'agit non seulement

de donner la priorit&eacute; &agrave; une probl&eacute;matique

qui prend des dimensions particuli&egrave;rement pr&eacute;occupantes

dans un grand nombre de ces pays, et qui engendre une s&eacute;rie

d'interd&eacute;pendances n&eacute;gatives auxquelles se trouve

confront&eacute;e l'Europe, en termes de pressions migratoires,

et d'autres questions d'ordre s&eacute;curitaire; mais il s'agit

aussi de concr&eacute;tiser, dans sa dimension ext&eacute;rieure,

l'un des principes fondateurs de l'Union - le progr&egrave;s social

- largement pr&eacute;sent dans le Trait&eacute; et dans son Protocole

sur la politique sociale, et d&eacute;velopp&eacute; sous diff&eacute;rents

aspects (emploi, &eacute;ducation &amp; formation, &eacute;galit&eacute;

hommes/ femmes, etc) dans les politiques communautaires.

<P>

La lutte contre la pauvret&eacute; constitue d&eacute;j&agrave;

un axe prioritaire dans la politique de coop&eacute;ration actuelle,

qui a &eacute;t&eacute; renforc&eacute; ces derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es

par un certain nombre d'orientations nouvelles:

<P><UL>

<LI>dans la mise en oeuvre de l'instrument d'appui &agrave; l'ajustement

structurel dans les pays ACP et dans l'utilisation des fonds de

contrepartie, la priorit&eacute; est accord&eacute;e aux d&eacute;penses

dans les secteurs sociaux;  

<P>

<LI>une r&eacute;solution sur la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;

a &eacute;t&eacute; adopt&eacute;e en 1993, qui d&eacute;finit

un ensemble de principes pour mieux appr&eacute;hender cet objectif

dans les politiques de coop&eacute;ration de l'Union. L'approche

retenue insiste en particulier sur la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

d'int&eacute;grer l'objectif de r&eacute;duction de la pauvret&eacute;

dans l'ensemble des politiques internes men&eacute;es dans les

PVD ainsi que dans l'ensemble des actions de coop&eacute;ration,

tout en pr&eacute;voyant aussi la possibilit&eacute; d'actions

cibl&eacute;es sur les groupes pauvres;

<P>

<LI>l'accent mis sur le r&ocirc;le des femmes constitue une dimension

essentielle de toute strat&eacute;gie de r&eacute;duction de la

pauvret&eacute;. La r&eacute;solution adopt&eacute;e en novembre

1995 sur ce th&egrave;me, tout en abordant la probl&eacute;matique

de la participation des femmes de mani&egrave;re plus large, est

de ce point de vue largement compl&eacute;mentaire de la r&eacute;solution

de 1993 sur la pauvret&eacute;;

<P>

<LI>les interventions de la Communaut&eacute; dans les secteurs

sociaux contribuent largement &agrave; cet objectif, surtout depuis

l'adoption des nouvelles r&eacute;solutions sur la sant&eacute;

et sur l'&eacute;ducation et la formation, qui accordent une priorit&eacute;

tr&egrave;s claire aux soins de sant&eacute; de base et &agrave;

l'&eacute;ducation et formation primaire, b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiant

davantage aux populations les plus pauvres; 

<P>

<LI>les changements r&eacute;cemment adopt&eacute;s en mati&egrave;re

d'aide alimentaire et plus particuli&egrave;rement l'accent mis

sur l'appui aux politiques de s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire

et le probl&egrave;me de l'acc&egrave;s aux produits alimentaires

(notamment &agrave; travers le maintien de productions et de modes

de consommation alimentaires locaux), constituent un autre volet

important de la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;;

<P>

<LI>ces domaines (sant&eacute;, &eacute;ducation, s&eacute;curit&eacute;

alimentaire, femmes et d&eacute;veloppement) sont par ailleurs

des domaines prioritaires pour le renforcement de la coordination

entre les Etats membres et la Communaut&eacute;, au niveau op&eacute;rationnel

et dans la d&eacute;finition des orientations de politiques;

<P>

<LI>la pr&eacute;servation de l'environnement est un autre domaine

important dans la probl&eacute;matique de la pauvret&eacute;,

tant en milieu rural (probl&egrave;mes de d&eacute;gradation des

sols, exploitation durable des ressources naturelles) qu'en milieu

urbain o&ugrave; des probl&egrave;mes aig&uuml;s d'assainissement

et d'infrastructures se posent de plus en plus, dans le contexte

d'une urbanisation qui est particuli&egrave;rement rapide dans

les pays ACP. La port&eacute;e du lien entre pauvret&eacute; et

environnement a &eacute;t&eacute; largement reconnue lors du Sommet

de la Terre. Les pr&eacute;occupations environnementales impr&egrave;gnent

de plus en plus les politiques de coop&eacute;ration communautaire,

&agrave; travers la syst&eacute;matisation des &eacute;tudes d'impact

ainsi que par des programmes sp&eacute;cifiques;

<P>

<LI>enfin une s&eacute;rie d'autres actions de coop&eacute;ration

peuvent contribuer &agrave; la r&eacute;duction de la pauvret&eacute;:

il s'agit des interventions dans le secteur du d&eacute;veloppement

rural, de la formation professionnelle, dans le domaine des micro-r&eacute;alisations

et des actions d'appui au d&eacute;veloppement de l'initiative

priv&eacute;e qui privil&eacute;gient souvent l'objectif de cr&eacute;ation

d'emplois, des cofinancements &agrave; travers les ONG, de l'appui

aux politiques d&eacute;mographiques, ou encore d'une politique

des consommateurs. 

</UL>

<P>

<B>Ces orientations doivent sans aucun doute &ecirc;tre maintenues

et confirm&eacute;es. Pour l'avenir cependant, l'UE et ses partenaires

ACP devront d&eacute;terminer dans quelle mesure et comment l'impact

de la coop&eacute;ration communautaire sur la r&eacute;duction

de la pauvret&eacute; pourrait &ecirc;tre am&eacute;lior&eacute;.</B>

<P>

Le maintien d'une approche large, impliquant un vaste &eacute;ventail

d'interventions, est sans nul doute indispensable compte tenu

de la diversit&eacute; des situations de pauvret&eacute; dans

les pays ACP. L'Union pourrait toutefois proposer &agrave; ses

partenaires une approche plus strat&eacute;gique dans deux directions:

<P><UL>

<LI>a) <U>l'acc&egrave;s aux ressources productives, l'emploi et le

d&eacute;veloppement des ressources humaines</U>. Le rythme de

cr&eacute;ation d'emploi d&eacute;pend d'un ensemble de param&egrave;tres

qui peuvent, directement ou indirectement, &ecirc;tre influenc&eacute;s

par un large &eacute;ventail de mesures ou de politiques g&eacute;n&eacute;rales

et sectorielles. L'UE peut soutenir ces politiques par une action

centr&eacute;e sur:

<P><UL>

<LI>un appui &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration des capacit&eacute;s

d'analyse et &agrave; la conception des politiques en faveur d'un

accroissement des emplois productifs;

<P>

<LI>un appui aux r&eacute;formes visant &agrave; am&eacute;liorer

l'acc&egrave;s aux ressources productives, en particulier en mati&egrave;re

d'&eacute;ducation et de formation professionnelle, d'acc&egrave;s

au cr&eacute;dit, d'acc&egrave;s &agrave; la propri&eacute;t&eacute;

et &agrave; la terre. Ce type d'appui est susceptible d'avoir

un effet de levier consid&eacute;rable, dans la mesure o&ugrave;

il peut rapidement conduire &agrave; une am&eacute;lioration des

conditions de vie par un meilleur acc&egrave;s aux activit&eacute;s

g&eacute;n&eacute;ratrices de revenus;

<P>

<LI>un appui aux politiques du march&eacute; du travail, ayant pour

objet le d&eacute;veloppement d'une main d'oeuvre capable, mobile

et motiv&eacute;e.

</UL>

<P>

<LI>b) <U>l'appui aux politiques sociales.</U> L'UE est d&eacute;j&agrave;

largement engag&eacute;e dans des actions de coop&eacute;ration

dans les secteurs sociaux, et s'efforce d'am&eacute;liorer l'impact

de son aide par une approche sectorielle plus globale, s'&eacute;cartant

progressivement de l'approche-projets. Cette tendance pourrait

&ecirc;tre accentu&eacute;e et s'appuyer sur:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>un dialogue approfondi et continu sur les politiques sociales,

permettant de d&eacute;gager une strat&eacute;gie g&eacute;n&eacute;rale

et des priorit&eacute;s, et d'examiner les liens, souvent compl&eacute;mentaires

mais parfois aussi conflictuels, entre les objectifs &eacute;conomiques

et les objectifs sociaux;

<P>

<LI>une aide financi&egrave;re accordant une attention particuli&egrave;re

au financement des d&eacute;penses courantes dans ces secteurs,

en &eacute;troite liaison avec le dialogue macro-&eacute;conomique

et les processus d'ajustement structurel. 

</UL>

<P>

Les discussions engag&eacute;es au sein de la communaut&eacute;

internationale autour du concept du 20/20 ont mis en avant l'utilit&eacute;

d'engagements mutuels concrets entre b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires

et donateurs en faveur du d&eacute;veloppement social. Tout en

reconnaissant la pertinence de ce principe d'engagement mutuel,

l'UE, compte tenu de la nature de ses politiques, privil&eacute;gie

une approche plus globale et circonstanci&eacute;e.

<P>

Dans le cadre du futur partenariat UE-ACP, dans l'hypoth&egrave;se

d'une plus grande s&eacute;lectivit&eacute; de l'aide qui serait

li&eacute;e &agrave; l'&eacute;valuation de la &quot;bonne gestion&quot;,

l'effort consenti en mati&egrave;re de politiques sociales et

de politiques destin&eacute;es &agrave; favoriser l'acc&egrave;s

aux ressources productives et l'accroissement de l'emploi, pourrait

faire partie int&eacute;grante des crit&egrave;res &agrave; prendre

en compte.

</UL>

<P>

<H4>3. Int&eacute;grer la protection de l'environnement dans le

processus de d&eacute;veloppement</H4>

<P>

Un des principaux enseignements de la th&eacute;orie et

de la pratique du d&eacute;veloppement durable est que l'on

ne peut pas concevoir d'action environnementale efficace si les

politiques sociales et &eacute;conomiques restent inchang&eacute;es.

Au contraire, les pr&eacute;occupations environnementales doivent

&ecirc;tre int&eacute;gr&eacute;es dans la conception, la mise

en oeuvre et l'evaluation de l'ensemble des politiques, programmes

et projets. 

<P>

Bien que la Communaut&eacute; dispose d'un vaste &eacute;ventail

de d&eacute;clarations politiques sur Ia gestion de l'environnement,

il lui manque toujours une strat&eacute;gie claire et la d&eacute;termination

n&eacute;cessaire pour la rendre op&eacute;rationnelle. Si l'on

consid&egrave;re le consensus &eacute;mergeant du processus de

Rio, quatre priorit&eacute;s pour la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement

se d&eacute;gagent: 

<P>

<UL>

<LI>r&eacute;pondre aux besoins et lutter contre la pauvret&eacute;.

Bien que la relation de cause &agrave; effet entre la pauvret&eacute;

et la d&eacute;gradation de l'environnement soit complexe,

tant la pauvret&eacute; que la pollution peuvent &ecirc;tre

consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme le r&eacute;sultat de forces &eacute;conomiques

et sociales tendant &agrave; r&eacute;percuter les co&ucirc;ts

humains et environnementaux sur les g&eacute;n&eacute;rations

actuelles et futures; 

<P>

<LI>utiliser les forces du march&eacute; pour refl&eacute;ter

les co&ucirc;ts et les avantages pour I'environnement. L'Agenda

21 est fond&eacute; sur la reconnaissance du fait que les march&eacute;s

doivent progressivement internaliser les co&ucirc;ts sociaux et

environnementaux, afin que les prix r&eacute;v&egrave;lent la

&quot;v&eacute;rit&eacute; &eacute;cologique&quot;; 

<P>

<LI>int&eacute;grer les objectifs de l'environnment dans la formulation

d'une politique globale et dans des syst&egrave;mes de gestion,

afin que la protection de l'environnement devienne partie int&eacute;grante

du processus de d&eacute;veloppement et non un objectif

isol&eacute;. Ceci exige le renforcement des capacit&eacute;s

environnementales et l'adoption d'une approche en participation;

<P>

<LI>sensibiliser les portefeuilles d'investissement &agrave;

la &quot;cause verte&quot;, en &eacute;valuant l'impact sur

I'environnement pendant toute la dur&eacute;e du projet et

en finan&ccedil;ant des investissements prioritaires dans le domaine

de la conservation de l'environnement et de la lutte contre

la pollution.

</UL>

<P>

Certains th&egrave;mes m&eacute;ritent une attention particuli&egrave;re:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>pour de nombreux ACP la quantit&eacute; et la qualit&eacute;

des ressources en eaux devient un probl&egrave;me critique tant

dans les zones urbaines que dans les zones rurales. Les liens

entre l'eau, la pression d&eacute;mographique et la d&eacute;gradation

des sols acqui&egrave;rent une importance croissante;

<P>

<LI>la d&eacute;forestation devient un probl&egrave;me majeur dans

de nombreux pays, qui a des effets au plan local mais aussi au

plan global, dans la mesure o&ugrave; elle affecte la bio-diversit&eacute;;

<P>

<LI>les pays ACP insulaires sont particuli&egrave;rement expos&eacute;s

aux menaces potentielles li&eacute;es au changement climatique,

et en particulier &agrave; un accroissement de la fr&eacute;quence

des violentes temp&ecirc;tes. En outre en Afrique sub-saharienne,

les probl&egrave;mes de s&eacute;cheresse pourraient &eacute;galement

s'aggraver;

<P>

<LI>un appui au d&eacute;veloppement des capacit&eacute;s des pays

ACP en mati&egrave;re de politiques environnementales, tant au

stade de la formulation des politiques que de leur mise en oeuvre,

est n&eacute;cessaire, notamment pour ce qui concerne le suivi

des Conventions internationales d&eacute;j&agrave; ratifi&eacute;es

ou des conventions &agrave; venir.

</UL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="inst"><HR>B. La dimension institutionnelle</A></H3>

<P>

L'analyse des &eacute;volutions socio-&eacute;conomiques et politiques

dans les pays ACP pr&eacute;sent&eacute;e au chapitre III, montre

l'importance des dysfonctionnements de l'Etat et l'acuit&eacute;

des probl&egrave;mes de &quot;governance&quot;. Ces probl&egrave;mes

entravent le d&eacute;veloppement dans de nombreux pays, y retardent

la mise en oeuvre des programmes d'ajustement structurel ou en

emp&ecirc;chent la r&eacute;alisation compl&egrave;te, alimentent

l'instabilit&eacute; et le &quot;d&eacute;ficit de confiance&quot;

qui p&egrave;se sur l'investissement et sur la l&eacute;gitimit&eacute;

de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement. Cette analyse a aussi montr&eacute;

la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de r&eacute;habiliter ou de renforcer

l'Etat de droit, pour assurer les conditions minimales n&eacute;cessaires

au d&eacute;veloppement et &agrave; la r&eacute;duction des in&eacute;galit&eacute;s

et de la pauvret&eacute;. Le caract&egrave;re essentiel de ces

&eacute;l&eacute;ments a, depuis 1995, &eacute;t&eacute; reconnu

dans les textes de la convention de Lom&eacute; IV bis. 

<P>

Mais la r&eacute;forme des syst&egrave;mes administratifs et juridiques,

l'am&eacute;lioration des capacit&eacute;s d'analyse et de conception

des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement, le renforcement des institutions

&eacute;manant de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile susceptibles

de jouer le r&ocirc;le de contre-pouvoir, n'ont jusqu'&agrave;

pr&eacute;sent pas fait l'objet d'une politique d&eacute;termin&eacute;e

de la part de l'UE. Les actions communautaires d'appui institutionnel

et &agrave; la &quot;governance&quot; ont principalement consist&eacute;

&agrave; encourager des processus &eacute;lectoraux d&eacute;mocratiques,

&agrave; fournir une assistance technique li&eacute;e aux projets

ou programmes de coop&eacute;ration, et une aide financi&egrave;re

cibl&eacute;e destin&eacute;e &agrave; faciliter ou &agrave; compenser

les cons&eacute;quences de certaines r&eacute;formes. Au cours

des ann&eacute;es r&eacute;centes, une attention plus grande a

cependant &eacute;t&eacute; accord&eacute;e &agrave; l'ensemble

du paysage institutionnel, et non plus seulement &agrave; l'agence

ou l'institution charg&eacute;e de la mise en oeuvre d'un projet

d&eacute;termin&eacute;. L'instrument d'appui &agrave; l'ajustement

structurel et les actions d'appui aux politiques sectorielles

ont favoris&eacute; cette &eacute;volution, dans la mesure o&ugrave;

elle a permis &agrave; la Communaut&eacute; de jouer un r&ocirc;le

plus actif pour l'am&eacute;lioration du &quot;policy environment&quot;

au niveau sectoriel ou plus g&eacute;n&eacute;ral. Cette tendance

est appel&eacute;e &agrave; s'accentuer &agrave; l'avenir, notamment

pour tenir compte des conclusions des &eacute;tudes d'&eacute;valuation

qui ont montr&eacute; que, pour accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&eacute;

de la coop&eacute;ration communautaire, la prise en compte des

aspects institutionnels devrait &ecirc;tre plus syst&eacute;matique

et abord&eacute;e de mani&egrave;re plus approfondie. 

<P>

Mais ne faut-il pas aller au-del&agrave; de ces adaptations, qui

pourraient en tout &eacute;tat de cause d&eacute;j&agrave; &ecirc;tre

introduites dans le cadre de la politique actuelle? L'&eacute;volution

du r&ocirc;le de l'Etat dans le nouvel environnement &eacute;conomique

et politique international, vers une structure charg&eacute;e

d'assurer un certain nombre de conditions-cadres n&eacute;cessaires

pour que prenne place un d&eacute;veloppement r&eacute;pondant

aux crit&egrave;res du d&eacute;veloppement durable et &eacute;quitable,

incite en effet &agrave; repenser cette dimension des relations

UE-ACP: <B>l'UE ne doit-elle pas soutenir de fa&ccedil;on plus

strat&eacute;gique le processus de transition politique et social

n&eacute;cessaire? </B>

<P>

Le d&eacute;veloppement des institutions dans un pays est fondamentalement

un processus politique; une r&eacute;forme ne peut aboutir sans

appropriation locale et impose de surmonter de nombreux obstacles,

dans la mesure o&ugrave; elle affecte les structures de pouvoir

et rencontre in&eacute;vitablement de fortes r&eacute;sistances.

Le d&eacute;veloppement institutionnel a donc deux dimensions

compl&eacute;mentaires: une dimension politique et une dimension

plus &quot;technique&quot;.

<P>

<B>Dans ces conditions, l'UE doit-elle jouer un r&ocirc;le plus

actif dans le domaine du d&eacute;veloppement institutionnel,

et s'impliquer dans le dialogue qui a lieu sur ces questions avec

d'autres bailleurs de fonds? Comment peut-elle jouer ce r&ocirc;le?

</B>

<P>

1. <U>Il existe des raisons d&eacute;cisives pour approfondir

l'action de l'UE dans ce domaine</U> et lui donner une plus grande

priorit&eacute;, au point d'en faire un axe strat&eacute;gique

dans ses relations avec les ACP:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>les pays ACP sont aujourd'hui confront&eacute;s &agrave; la

n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de red&eacute;finir leurs conceptions

des fonctions de l'Etat, et d'am&eacute;liorer la mani&egrave;re

dont l'Etat assume ces fonctions, avec pour finalit&eacute; de

servir l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t g&eacute;n&eacute;ral. La dimension

politique qui sous-tend l'action de l'UE dans ce domaine est exempte

de consid&eacute;rations relatives &agrave; des int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts

purement nationaux. L'UE n'a pas de mod&egrave;le unique &agrave;

faire valoir - les Etats membres ont eux-m&ecirc;mes d&eacute;velopp&eacute;

des syst&egrave;mes d'organisation sociale et politique diversifi&eacute;s;

<P>

<LI>le caract&egrave;re essentiel pour l'Union du respect des droits

de l'homme et des libert&eacute;s fondamentales, et de l'application

des principes d&eacute;mocratiques. Or les difficult&eacute;s

rencontr&eacute;es dans le cadre des politiques actuelles d'appui

&agrave; la d&eacute;mocratisation, &eacute;voqu&eacute;es au

chapitre III, doivent inciter &agrave; une approche moins formaliste

et plus constructive; 

<P>

<LI>l'efficacit&eacute; et l'impact de l'aide communautaire d&eacute;pendent

largement de ces aspects institutionnels. L'impact de la plupart

des actions de coop&eacute;ration communautaire, dans les domaines

&eacute;conomiques et sociaux, se trouverait am&eacute;lior&eacute;

par une action plus d&eacute;cisive dans le domaine du d&eacute;veloppement

institutionnel. Les &eacute;tudes d'&eacute;valuation ont en effet

montr&eacute; que l'impact et la viabilit&eacute; des programmes

d'aide communautaire sont souvent affect&eacute;s par une insuffisante

prise en compte des contraintes et obstacles li&eacute;s au cadre

institutionnel. En outre dans la mesure o&ugrave; l'UE appuie

les r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques, elle a int&eacute;r&ecirc;t,

pour des raisons d'efficacit&eacute;, &agrave; intervenir &eacute;galement

dans les volets institutionnels qui y sont li&eacute;s. L'existence

et le fonctionnement d'un cadre juridique pr&eacute;visible, des

processus de d&eacute;cision et de gestion administrative et budg&eacute;taire

transparents, et des services publics de qualit&eacute;, constituent

des conditions indispensables au succ&egrave;s des politiques

d'ajustement dans les pays ACP. 

</UL>

<P>

La relation de partenariat que l'UE vise &agrave; d&eacute;velopper

avec les pays ACP, constitue un cadre propice pour aborder les

questions du d&eacute;veloppement institutionnel dans la mesure

o&ugrave; il permet aux pays concern&eacute;s d'assumer la responsabilit&eacute;

premi&egrave;re des r&eacute;formes, et o&ugrave; l'UE peut assurer

un appui &agrave; la fois technique, financier et politique, sur

la base d'engagements r&eacute;ciproques &agrave; moyen terme.

<P>

En outre l'exp&eacute;rience de l'Union en mati&egrave;re de r&eacute;formes,

engendr&eacute;es par la construction europ&eacute;enne elle-m&ecirc;me,

lui ont permis de d&eacute;velopper un savoir-faire particulier.

<P>

2. Concernant le contenu et les modalit&eacute;s d'une action

europ&eacute;enne dans le domaine institutionnel et du renforcement

des capacit&eacute;s, <U>trois options compl&eacute;mentaires</U>

pourraient &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;s pour d&eacute;velopper

l'action de l'UE: 

<P>

<UL>

<LI>l'UE pourrait r&eacute;examiner les moyens de mobiliser l'expertise

locale et europ&eacute;enne, et d'assurer un transfert de savoir-faire

entre l'Europe et les ACP. La mise en place d'un r&eacute;seau

d'analyse et d'assistance technique sp&eacute;cialis&eacute; permettrait

d'assurer un appui continu sur des p&eacute;riodes de temps suffisamment

longues, et d'accumuler une r&eacute;elle exp&eacute;rience et

un savoir-faire;

<P>

<LI>l'UE pourrait d&eacute;velopper des comp&eacute;tences sp&eacute;cifiques

dans certains secteurs, en fonction de la valeur ajout&eacute;e

qu'elle est susceptible d'apporter par rapport aux interventions

des autres bailleurs de fonds multilat&eacute;raux et bilat&eacute;raux.

Plusieurs secteurs peuvent &ecirc;tre identifi&eacute;s, qui sont

associ&eacute;s aux principaux domaines d'action de l'UE:

<P>

<UL>

(a) la promotion du respect des droits de l'homme;

<P>

(b) l'appui aux organisations r&eacute;gionales;

<P>

(c) la restructuration des services publics en concertation avec

les acteurs directement concern&eacute;s, l'am&eacute;lioration

de la capacit&eacute; d'analyse et de conception des politiques

&eacute;conomiques et sociales, de pr&eacute;paration des r&eacute;formes,

un soutien &agrave; la d&eacute;centralisation des administrations

publiques;

<P>

(d) la gestion budg&eacute;taire, en liaison avec les actions

d'appui &agrave; l'ajustement structurel;

<P>

(e) le d&eacute;veloppement de certaines capacit&eacute;s n&eacute;cessaires

au fonctionnement d'une &eacute;conomie de march&eacute;, telles

que le droit des affaires, le droit relatif &agrave; la protection

des consommateurs et les associations de consommateurs, la protection

 des investisseurs, la pr&eacute;servation de l'environnement,

les r&egrave;gles de concurrence, etc.

<P>

(f) la coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, non comme

une alternative &agrave; l'appui au secteur public mais bien comme

un domaine d'action compl&eacute;mentaire, visant &agrave; am&eacute;liorer

les interactions entre le secteur public et le secteur priv&eacute;,

et &agrave; rapprocher l'action de l'UE des acteurs de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;

civile;

<P>

(g) le renforcement des institutions parlementaires, de nature

&agrave; contribuer &agrave; la transparence des politiques et

&agrave; la bonne gestion des affaires publiques.

</UL>

<P>

<LI>enfin l'UE pourrait opter pour une nouvelle pratique de l'aide

en vue d'en r&eacute;duire les effets n&eacute;gatifs sur le d&eacute;veloppement

des capacit&eacute;s locales.

<P>

L'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t d'utiliser davantage l'expertise locale

a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; reconnu dans la Convention

de Lom&eacute;. Mais d'autres changements plus fondamentaux doivent

&ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;s. Dans certaines circonstances, et

pour une p&eacute;riode transitoire, un certain degr&eacute; de

substitution est sans doute in&eacute;vitable. Mais un signal

politique clair en faveur d'un changement d'approche et d'une

r&eacute;duction des effets n&eacute;gatifs de l'aide sur le d&eacute;veloppement

de la capacit&eacute; institutionnelle et administrative locale,

pourrait donner lieu &agrave; une s&eacute;rie de modifications

(simplification des proc&eacute;dures, r&eacute;duction de l'&eacute;ventail

des instruments, abandon de l'approche-projets,...). Il s'agit

bien l&agrave; d'une r&eacute;orientation strat&eacute;gique,

dans la mesure o&ugrave; le d&eacute;veloppement des capacit&eacute;s

locales deviendrait l'un des principaux crit&egrave;res pr&eacute;sidant

au choix des modalit&eacute;s pratiques de coop&eacute;ration.

Diff&eacute;rentes options &agrave; cet &eacute;gard sont discut&eacute;es

au chapitre VI. 

</UL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="comm"><HR>C. Le commerce et l'investissement</A></H3>

<P>

L'int&eacute;gration ad&eacute;quate du groupe ACP dans I'&eacute;conomie

mondiale et plus particuli&egrave;rement Ia d&eacute;finition

de sa place dans le r&eacute;seau en &eacute;volution des relations

&eacute;conomiques ext&eacute;rieures de l'UE, en tant que dimension

majeure de son int&eacute;gration dans l'&eacute;conomie mondiale,

constituent le d&eacute;fi &agrave; relever pour les nouvelles

relations UE/ACP apr&egrave;s l'an 2000. L'absence d'un cadre

ad&eacute;quat risque d'entra&icirc;ner l'&eacute;clatement du

groupe ACP, le rel&acirc;chement des liens actuels entre certains

pays et r&eacute;gions ACP et l 'UE et la poursuite de la marginalisation

des pays ACP les plus pauvres. 

<P>

<H4>Accords commerciaux </H4>

<P>

De nombreuses options sont possibles pour les futures relations

commerciales UE/ACP apr&egrave;s I 'an 2000. En principe,

ces options devraient permettre aux pays ACP d'am&eacute;nager

les strat&eacute;gies d'int&eacute;gration qu'ils pr&eacute;f&egrave;rent.

Ces options devraient &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre examin&eacute;es

compte tenu des dimensions du principe de partenariat sous-tendant

les relations commerciales UE/ACP: 

<P>

<UL>

<LI>i) accord commercial unique ou accords commerciaux multiples

<LI>ii) diff&eacute;renci&eacute; ou g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;

iii) r&eacute;ciproque ou non-r&eacute;ciproque 

<LI>iv) contractuel (assurant la s&eacute;curit&eacute;

ou unilat&eacute;ral (&agrave; la discr&eacute;tion politique

de l'UE) 

</UL>

<P>

Etant donn&eacute; que le principe de partenariat rev&ecirc;t

une valeur politique importante pour les pays ACP ainsi que

pour les membres de l'UE, les diff&eacute;rentes options envisag&eacute;es

devraient &ecirc;tre &eacute;valu&eacute;es compte tenu de leur

impact sur ce principe: estce qu'elles le saperont ou au contraire

le renforceront ? Serontelles cause de r&eacute;tr&eacute;cissement

ou d'&eacute;largissement? Ces consid&eacute;rations politiques

importantes doivent &ecirc;tre prises en compte lors de l'&eacute;valuation

des diff&eacute;rentes options; il faut &eacute;galement tenir

compte des contraintes techniques concernant plus particuli&egrave;rement

la n&eacute;gociation des ZLE (voir encadr&eacute; n&#176; 5 pour

l'analyse des options commerciales). 

<P>

Le menu qui pourrait &ecirc;tre propos&eacute; pour examen

aux pays ACP pourrait comprendre les &eacute;l&eacute;ments suivants:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>i) <B>&quot;Statu quo&quot;.</B> Le syst&egrave;me actuel non-r&eacute;ciproque,

diff&eacute;renci&eacute; (en ce qui concerne les autres PMA),

contractuel et uniforme ax&eacute; strictement sur les conditions

d'acc&egrave;s aux march&eacute;s est pr&eacute;serv&eacute;.

Une variante de &quot;statu quo am&eacute;lior&eacute;&quot; pourrait

comprendre des am&eacute;liorations en ce qui concerne l'acc&egrave;s

aux march&eacute;s, ainsi qu'un assouplissement des r&egrave;gles

et proc&eacute;dures, des accords sur les questions li&eacute;es

au commerce (normes, environnement, politique de la concurrence,

propri&eacute;t&eacute; intellectuelle, etc.) et un accord

sur les services. Une autre variante consisterait &agrave;

limiter cette option uniquement aux pays ACP les moins avanc&eacute;s,

tout en proposant au groupe plus avanc&eacute; une des options

ci-dessous en fonction de leurs souhaits ou de leurs capacit&eacute;s.

Enfin, un &eacute;l&eacute;ment de r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; pourrait

&ecirc;tre introduit dans cette option en demandant &agrave; tous

les pays ACP de soumettre une offre de droits consolid&eacute;e

au GATT. 

<P>

<LI>ii) <B>&quot;Int&eacute;gration dans le SPG&quot;.</B> Cette option

consiste &agrave; &eacute;liminer le volet commercial de la Convention

de Lom&eacute; qui serait ainsi r&eacute;duite &agrave; un syst&egrave;me

d'aide. Les pays ACP les moins avanc&eacute;s seront

regroup&eacute;s avec les pays hors ACP les moins avanc&eacute;s,

et les pays ACP les plus avanc&eacute;s entreraient progressivement

dans le syst&egrave;me normal. Pour &eacute;viter une perte

de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences trop importante pour les

PMA-ACP, les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences g&eacute;n&eacute;rales

accord&eacute;es aux pays les moins avanc&eacute;s pourraient

&ecirc;tre relev&eacute;es afin d'atteindre la parit&eacute; avec

le niveau des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences horizontales de Lom&eacute;.

Etant donn&eacute; qu'elles sont une politique unilat&eacute;rale

de I 'UE, les concessions octroy&eacute;es ne feront pas l'objet

d'une n&eacute;gociation avec les pays ACP. Rien ne peut leur

&ecirc;tre demand&eacute; en &eacute;change. Ou alors, l'accord

pref&eacute;rentiel UE/PMA pourrait &ecirc;tre int&eacute;gr&eacute;

(et finalement consolid&eacute; au GATT) dans un r&eacute;gime

pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel en faveur des PMA. 

<P>

<LI>iii) <B>&quot;R&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; uniforme&quot;.</B>

Demander &agrave; tous les ACP d'&eacute;tendre la r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;

(en accord avec les r&egrave;gles de l'OMC), apr&egrave;s une

p&eacute;riode de transition commune, aux exportations

de l'UE. Variante: pr&eacute;voir des p&eacute;riodes de transition

diff&eacute;rentes pour les PMA-ACP d'une part, et pour

les ACP plus avanc&eacute;s d'autre part. Variante am&eacute;lior&eacute;e:

cette option pourrait &eacute;galement comprendre des accords

sur les domaines li&eacute;s au commerce et un accord

sur les services. Elle implique &eacute;galement l'int&eacute;gration

totale des pays ACP dans le cadre de l'OMC. 

<P>

<LI>iv) <B>&quot;R&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; diff&eacute;renci&eacute;e&quot;.</B>

La r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; &agrave; g&eacute;om&eacute;trie

variable (en accord avec les r&egrave;gles de l'OMC) avec l'UE

d'une part, et avec des groupes r&eacute;gionaux homog&egrave;nes

de pays ACP ou avec des pays ACP individuels d'autre part,

sur le mod&egrave;le des accords commerciaux r&eacute;gionaux

Nord-Sud. Dans sa version am&eacute;lior&eacute;e, cette

option inclurait &eacute;galement les accords sur les domaines

li&eacute;s au commerce, un accord sur les services et l'int&eacute;gration

totale dans le cadre de l'OMC. Une autre variante envisagerait

des accords commerciaux r&eacute;gionaux entre l'UE, d'une part,

et une zone d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale compos&eacute;e

de pays ACP et hors ACP, d'autre part. 

</UL>

<P>

Enfin, deux options suppl&eacute;mentaires combinant les quatre

options ci-dessus peuvent &eacute;galement &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;es:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>v) <B>&quot;Diff&eacute;renciation dans un cadre unique&quot;.</B>

Cette option engloberait les options i) &agrave; iv) qui repr&eacute;senteraient

les &eacute;l&eacute;ments d'un menu unique pour l'UE et les ACP

&agrave; s&eacute;lectionner en fonction du niveau de d&eacute;veloppement

des besoins ressentis et de la volont&eacute; des ACP d'approfondir

la relation, des conditions politiques et du niveau de r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;

que les ACP seraient pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; octroyer &agrave; l'UE.

Elle maintiendrait, pour tous les pays ACP, le caract&egrave;re

contractuel de la relation actuelle mais pourrait n&eacute;cessiter

des modifications majeures en ce qui concerne certaines pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

horizontales de la relation actuelle (les protocoles sur les produits

de base et les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences agricoles), notamment

en ce qui concerne l'&eacute;ligibilit&eacute; du pays. 

<P>

Cette option envisagerait un ensemble d'accords commerciaux

organis&eacute;s en quatre tiroirs: 

<UL>

<P>

<LI>a) des ZLE de r&eacute;gion &agrave; r&eacute;gion selon le

mod&egrave;le de l'option iv); 

<P>

<LI>b) des ZLE bilat&eacute;rales comme &agrave; l'option iv) mais

avec des pays ACP volontaires ne participant &agrave; aucun processus

d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale et suffisamment grands et

capables (Nig&eacute;ria, Za&iuml;re, par exemple) et pour autant

que les conditions politiques soient favorables; 

<P>

<LI>c) des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences non r&eacute;ciproques, maintenues

pour les ACP les moins d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s (&eacute;tablies

unilat&eacute;ralement ou dans un cadre multilat&eacute;ral),

ceux dont le revenu par habitant est inf&eacute;rieur &agrave;

un niveau reconnu internationalement et qui ne participent &agrave;

aucun processus d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale relevant

de l'option a) ci-dessus; 

<P>

<LI>d) l'int&eacute;gration progressive dans le SPG, compte tenu

des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences horizontales non r&eacute;ciproques,

pour les pays ACP ne souhaitant pas relever des options

a) ou b) mais ayant un niveau de d&eacute;veloppement qui

les rendrait in&eacute;ligibles pour l'option c); les pays ACP

int&eacute;gr&eacute;s progressivement pourraient peut-&ecirc;tre

maintenir les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences en vertu des protocoles

sur les produits de base mais uniquement pendant une p&eacute;riode

de transition (une d&eacute;rogation pourrait &ecirc;tre

demand&eacute;e dans ce cas). 

<P>

Dans ce contexte, les pays ACP seraient en mesure, en

accord avec l'UE, de s&eacute;lectionner l'option commerciale

la mieux adapt&eacute;e &agrave; la strat&eacute;gie d'int&eacute;gration

retenue et &agrave; leurs besoins et capacit&eacute;s. Toutefois,

les questions des effets de r&eacute;orientation du commerce et

des investissements entre groupes de pays ACP seraient in&eacute;vitables

&eacute;tant donn&eacute; que le sch&eacute;ma de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

et l'attrait pour les investissements &eacute;trangers

directs varieraient pour chaque groupe en fonction de l'option

s&eacute;lectionn&eacute;e. 

</UL>

<P>

Cette option cadre pr&eacute;serverait le <B>caract&egrave;re

unique</B> de la Convention de Lom&eacute; existante mais permettrait

d'ajouter des notions de <B>r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;</B>, de <B>diff&eacute;renciation</B>

et d'<B>int&eacute;gration progressive</B> au principe du partenariat,

&agrave; titre de dimensions de base additionnelles. Ces notions

seraient des &eacute;l&eacute;ments dynamiques internes faisant

passer les diff&eacute;rents pays ACP d'un stade donn&eacute;

de la relation &agrave; des stades plus &eacute;lev&eacute;s,

en fonction de leurs conditions individuelles et de leurs souhaits.

En ce qui concerne la conformit&eacute; &agrave; l'OMC, ce cadre

unique devra, tr&egrave;s probablement, &ecirc;tre accompagn&eacute;

d'une demande de d&eacute;rogation &agrave; l'article XXIV.10

(&agrave; savoir une d&eacute;rogation en ce qui concerne les

conditions minimales de conformit&eacute; des ZLE). 

<P>

<LI>vi) &quot;Diff&eacute;renciation d&eacute;bouchant sur une

multiplicit&eacute; d'accords&quot;. Dans ce syst&egrave;me, les

alternatives i) &agrave; iv) d&eacute;bouchent naturellement

sur une multiplicit&eacute; d'accords commerciaux coexistant &eacute;ventuellement

avec un paquet d'aide unique. Le caract&egrave;re unique

de la Convention de Lom&eacute; est &eacute;videmment la premi&egrave;re

victime de cette approche. L'aspect contractuel et la s&eacute;curit&eacute;,

et certainement la force et l'&eacute;tendue du principe de partenariat

varieront selon les accords, et le niveau actuel de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

subira probablement une &eacute;rosion pour certains groupes de

pays ACP ou conna&icirc;tra une extension pour d'autres groupes

en fonction de l'option retenue. 

<P>

Ce cadre multiple sera relativement incompatible avec la pr&eacute;servation

des avantages octroy&eacute;s dans le cadre des protocoles sur

les produits de base ainsi qu'avec le syst&egrave;me horizontal

de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences agricoles. Les questions relatives

au traitement in&eacute;gal et &agrave; la r&eacute;orientation

des &eacute;changes et des investissements entre groupes

de pays ACP s'aggraveront encore plus que dans le cas de l'option

du cadre unique ci-dessus. 

<P>

Les avantages et les inconv&eacute;nients associ&eacute;s &agrave;

chaque option s'appliqueront en cons&eacute;quence &agrave; chaque

groupe de pays ACP concern&eacute;s. En ce qui concerne le

respect des r&egrave;gles de l'OMC, une d&eacute;rogation &agrave;

l'article XXV.5 devrait &ecirc;tre demand&eacute;e pour le syst&egrave;me

non pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel en faveur des pays ACP les moins

avanc&eacute;s, ce qui peut &ecirc;tre plus facile &agrave;

obtenir.

</UL>

<P>

Par ailleurs, quelle que soit l'option choisie, l'UE est engag&eacute;e

dans un processus d'harmonisation des r&egrave;gles d'origine

appliqu&eacute;e dans le cadre des r&eacute;gimes pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiels.

<P>

<H4>Protection et encouragement des investissements</H4>

<P>

Dans le cadre des dispositions de la quatri&egrave;me Convention

de Lom&eacute;, les pays ACP se sont engag&eacute;s &agrave; accorder

un traitement juste et &eacute;quitable aux investisseurs priv&eacute;s,

&agrave; cr&eacute;er et &agrave; maintenir un climat d'investissement

pr&eacute;visible et s&ucirc;r, &agrave; am&eacute;liorer

l'environnement des entreprises et &agrave; mettre en place un

cadre juridique, administratif et financier propre &agrave;

favoriser l'&eacute;mergence et le d&eacute;veloppement d'un secteur

priv&eacute; dynamique (article 258 cg). Les pays se sont efforc&eacute;s

individuellement de mettre ces objectifs en oeuvre, mais n'ont

pas toujours obtenu le r&eacute;sultat d&eacute;sir&eacute;

de reprise de l'investissement du secteur priv&eacute;. Les investisseurs

h&eacute;sitent encore. L'environnement commercial et le contexte

politique et institutionnel n'inspirent pas toujours suffisamment

confiance. 

<P>

Les pays continueront, au niveau national, de mettre en

oeuvre des mesures pour renforcer la confiance. Toutefois, la

transparence et la pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; de ces mesures

peuvent &ecirc;tre am&eacute;lior&eacute;es si elles sont per&ccedil;ues

comme s'inscrivant dans un cadre commun, bien compris et

internationalement accept&eacute; de droits et d'obligations.

En 1992, la CE a propos&eacute; aux ACP d'examiner un ensemble

de principes de protection des investissements couvrant, entre

autres, le traitement national, le principe de la nation la plus

favoris&eacute;e, le traitement juste et &eacute;quitable, la

protection compl&egrave;te de la loi, la compensation en cas d'expropriation

et le transfert de revenus et de capitaux. Les projets

de principes donnaient un effet textuel aux objectifs de la quatri&egrave;me

Convention de Lom&eacute;. Ils n'ont toutefois pas &eacute;t&eacute;

largement discut&eacute;s ou mis en oeuvre. Depuis 1992, des discussions

d&eacute;taill&eacute;es sont en cours au sein de l'OCDE sur la

proposition d'accord multilat&eacute;ral sur les investissements

qui &eacute;tablit un cadre plus ambitieux et plus complet pour

la protection des investisseurs. 

<P>

La question des normes de protection des investissements a

maintenant &eacute;t&eacute; examin&eacute;e au sein de

l'OMC o&ugrave; des n&eacute;gociations sur les principes acceptables

par un ensenible plus vaste de pays devraient bient&ocirc;t

commencer. Si ces n&eacute;gociations d&eacute;bouchent sur un

accord sur des principes transparents et applicables, les investisseurs

et les march&eacute;s de capitaux pourraient &ecirc;tre attir&eacute;s

par les risques r&eacute;duits et investir dans les pays

qui acceptent de respecter ces principes.

<P>

Les pays ACP souhaitant acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer la reprise

de confiance des investisseurs pourraient adopter et appliquer

une norme reconnue internationalement de protection des

investisseurs ayant force de loi. La CE serait &eacute;videmment

ouverte &agrave; toute demande d'assistance pour introduire

cette norme dans les pays ayant choisi de l'adopter. Plus il y

aura de pays ACP d&eacute;sireux de respecter cette norme,

plus les investisseurs internationaux auront confiance dans

les pays ACP en tant que groupe. 

<P>

Plusieurs solutions s'offrent aux pays ACP d&eacute;sireux

de regagner la confiance des investisseurs gr&acirc;ce &agrave;

une protection plus cr&eacute;dible des investissements: 

<P>

<UL>

<LI>a. <B>Poursuivre les politiques actuelles</B> de conclusion d'accords

bilat&eacute;raux de protection des investissements avec des pays

de l'UE et les pays d'origine d'autres investisseurs &eacute;trangers.

Ces accords couvrent les &eacute;l&eacute;ments de base

de la compensation en cas d'expropriation, mais sont par ailleurs

de port&eacute;e limit&eacute;e, offrant peu de recours contre

les d&eacute;cisions discriminatoires ou discr&eacute;tionnaires

prises par les gouvernements des pays h&ocirc;tes. Ils n'ont pas

vraiment r&eacute;ussi &agrave; attirer de nouveaux investissements,

particuli&egrave;rement en Afrique. 

<P>

<LI>b. <B>Conclure des accords r&eacute;gionaux de protection des investissements.</B>

Un exemple &agrave; suivre pourrait &ecirc;tre celui de l'UEMOA

dont les membres introduisent un code d'investissement commun,

un droit commercial commun et des normes communes de protection

des investissements. Gr&acirc;ce aux accords r&eacute;gionaux,

il devrait &ecirc;tre relativement facile de contr&ocirc;ler le

respect des r&egrave;gles et des engagements, et le recours judiciaire

devrait &ecirc;tre relativement accessible pour les investisseurs

s'estimant l&eacute;s&eacute;s. Les accords r&eacute;gionaux fructueux

pourraient &ecirc;tre &eacute;tendus &agrave; d'autres Etats ACP

int&eacute;ress&eacute;s, cr&eacute;ant ainsi une pratique ACP

reconnue.

<P>

<LI>c. Adh&eacute;rer &agrave; une norme reconnue internationalement

de protection des investisseurs, &eacute;ventuellement bas&eacute;e

sur les principes pouvant &ecirc;tre convenus au sein de l'OMC.

L'avantage pour les ACP d''adopter des normes internationales

de protection des investissement est que celles-ci sont plus connues

des investisseurs et renforcent donc l'effet de confiance.

</UL>

<P>

Toutefois, &eacute;tant donn&eacute; qu'il n'existe &agrave;

l'heure actuelle aucun mod&egrave;le reconnu au niveau international,

la solution la plus avantageuse pour les pays ACP consiste, entre-temps,

&agrave; participer (avec le soutien de la CE) &agrave; des accords

r&eacute;gionaux qui r&eacute;pondent aux principes de base d&eacute;crits

ci-dessus. Dans leur int&eacute;r&ecirc;t &agrave; plus long terme,

les pays de la CE et des ACP devraient collaborer simultan&eacute;ment

en vue d'un accord sur une norme internationale plus &eacute;tendue.

<P>

<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=8> 

<CAPTION><B>Encadr&eacute; n&#176; 5. Analyse des options commerciales</B></CAPTION>

<TR><TD>

<P>

Le <B>&quot;statu quo&quot;,</B> qui a l'avantage d'&ecirc;tre

d&eacute;j&agrave; connu, maintient le caract&egrave;re

unique et contractuel de l'accord commercial actuel, offrant donc

une s&eacute;curit&eacute; &agrave; long terme (jusqu'&agrave;

un certain po&iacute;nt, voir ci-dessous). Compte tenu du fait

qu'il pr&eacute;serve les caract&eacute;ristiques de diff&eacute;renciation

(par rapport &agrave; d'autres PMA), il continuera de transmettre

le message selon lequel la relation commerciale avec les ACP est

toujours au sommet de la pyramide des privil&egrave;ges commerciaux

de l'UE. Cette option pr&eacute;sente &eacute;galement l'avantage

sp&eacute;cifique que, par rapport &agrave; un certain nombre

de produits agricoles de base qui sont sensibles sur le march&eacute;

de l'Union et qui pr&eacute;sentent une importance capitale (d&eacute;cisive

m&ecirc;me) pour plusieurs pays ACP, elle permet &agrave; l'Union

de proposer des dispositions d'acc&egrave;s sous r&eacute;serve

de limitations pr&eacute;cises. Ces limitations fournissent aux

ACP un cadre clair de planification et perrnettent au march&eacute;

agricole de l'Union d 'absorber les quantit&eacute;s concern&eacute;es.

Cette option pourrait &eacute;galement fournir un moment de r&eacute;pit

pour l'&eacute;volution de la politique agricole commune

dans le cadre de la prochaine &eacute;tape de l'OMC et de l'&eacute;largissement

de l'Union. 

<P>

Les aspects n&eacute;gatifs de cette option sont les suivants:

<UL>

<LI>&eacute;tant diff&eacute;renci&eacute;e, elle sera toujours

soumise &agrave; l'obtention d'une d&eacute;rogation aux

r&egrave;gles de I 'OMC, qui devra &ecirc;tre r&eacute;examin&eacute;e

tous les ans. En cons&eacute;quence, la s&eacute;curit&eacute;

des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences, qui est un des principaux atouts

du paquet commercial de Lom&eacute;, sera gravement entam&eacute;e;

<P>

<LI>cette solution ne permettra pas non plus, compte tenu de

la s&eacute;curit&eacute; r&eacute;duite des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences,

d'attirer des niveaux importants d'investissements &eacute;trangers

directs, ni de compenser l'effet de r&eacute;orientation

que peuvent avoir sur les investissements europ&eacute;ens d'autres

accords commerciaux r&eacute;gionaux d&eacute;pendant de l'UE;

<P>

<LI>cette option ne fournira pas la s&eacute;curit&eacute; et la

cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute; n&eacute;cessaires aux r&eacute;gimes

commerciaux (importations et exportations) et r&eacute;glementaires

des pays ACP pour r&eacute;duire le niveau de risque et donc rendre

les pays ACP plus attrayants pour les investssements; 

<P>

<LI>elle ne donnera pas d'&eacute;lan suppl&eacute;mentaire aux

processus d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale en cours entre

les pays ACP; 

<P>

<LI>elle emp&ecirc;chera tout pays ou groupe de pays ACP d'adh&eacute;rer

&agrave; des accords commerciaux r&eacute;gionaux comprenant d'autres

&eacute;conomies d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es, parce qu'il serait

politiquement et &eacute;conomiquement inacceptable pour I'UE

de subir une discrimination sur les march&eacute;s ACP par rapport

&agrave; d'autres &eacute;conomies d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es.

</UL>

<P>

Quoi qu'il en soit, cette option doit &ecirc;tre examin&eacute;e

compte tenu de sa contribution &agrave; une participation accrue

des pays ACP au commerce mondial. En outre, elle doit &ecirc;tre

compl&eacute;t&eacute;e par l'exigence pour les pays ACP de soumettre

un tarif douanier consolid&eacute; au GATT, qui pourrait s'av&eacute;rer

utile pour demander une d&eacute;rogation &agrave; l'article XXV.5.

<P>

La deuxi&egrave;rne option, <B>l'int&eacute;gration dans le SPG</B>,

aura pour atout majeur, du point de vue de I'UE, I'harmonisation

de la politique cornmerciale pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentielle non

r&eacute;ciproque de l'UE et sa conformit&eacute; totale aux r&egrave;gles

de l'OMC. Elle cr&eacute;era des conditions &eacute;gales, en

ce qui concerne l'acc&egrave;s au march&eacute; de l'UE, pour

tous les PMA autres que ceux engag&eacute;s dans un accord

commercial r&eacute;gional avec l 'UE. Elle permettra &eacute;galement

&agrave; certains pays ou groupes de pays ACP de s'engager dans

le r&eacute;gionalisme avec d'autres &eacute;conomies d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es

(les Cara&iuml;bes au sein de l'ALENA ou du FTAA, les ACP du Pacifique

dans le cadre de l 'APEC). 

<P>

En ce qui concerne les inconv&eacute;nients, cette option comporte

les risques suivants:

<UL>

<LI>elle morcellera d&eacute;finitivement le syt&egrave;me de Lom&eacute;

&agrave; plusieurs &eacute;gards. Elle traitera diff&eacute;rents

types de pays ACP de mani&egrave;re diff&eacute;rente en fonction

de leur niveau de d&eacute;veloppement. Elle ne liera plus l'aide

aux politiques commerciales qui sont maintenant int&eacute;gr&eacute;es

dans la Convention de Lom&eacute;; 

<P>

<LI>elle r&eacute;duira s&eacute;rieusement, du moins pour les

pays ACP les plus avanc&eacute;s, la marge pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentielle

dont ils b&eacute;n&eacute;ficient en vertu des accords de Lom&eacute;,

&eacute;tant donn&eacute; que les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences sur

les produits agricoles devront &ecirc;tre align&eacute;es sur

les niveaux des SPG et que les avantages relatifs aux quantit&eacute;s

fix&eacute;es pour les produits couverts par les protocoles

sur les produits de base ne pourront plus &ecirc;tre accord&eacute;s.

La pourquite du protocole relatif au sucre pourrait poser, dans

le cadre de cette option, certains probl&egrave;mes, et non des

moindres, de nature juridique; 

<P>

<LI>elle r&eacute;duira la s&eacute;curit&eacute; en ce qui concerne

les conditions d'acc&egrave;s au march&eacute;, mais le taux r&eacute;duit

de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences, toujours susceptible d'un changement

de politique de la part de I'UE ou soumis au m&eacute;canisme

d'int&eacute;gration progressive dans les SPG, sera indiscutable

dans le cadre de l'OMC. Les pays ACP les plus avanc&eacute;s auront

plus de difficult&eacute;s &agrave; attirer les investissements

&eacute;trangers directs dans le cadre de cette option. Toutefois,

l'option des SPG multilat&eacute;rales pour !es PMA (ACP et hors

ACP), consolid&eacute;e au GATT, permettrait d'avoir un degr&eacute;

de s&eacute;curit&eacute; &eacute;lev&eacute;. 

<P>

<LI>elle n'exercera pas d'attrait suppl&eacute;mentaire sur les

investissements &eacute;trangers directs, et ne compensera pas

non plus les effets de r&eacute;orientation du commerce et des

investissements d&eacute;coulant des accords r&eacute;gionaux

conclus avec l'UE et impliquant d'autres PMA; 

<P>

<LI>elle sera neutre en ce qui concerne la viabilit&eacute; des

processus d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale Sud-Sud en cours.

Elle n'assurera pas de protection suppl&eacute;mentaire contre

l'apparition de r&egrave;glements de l'UE concernant les domaines

li&eacute;s au commerce. 

</UL>

<P>

Enfin, cette option affaiblira fondamentalement le principe

du partenariat repr&eacute;sent&eacute; dans la Convention de

Lom&eacute; qui serait r&eacute;duit &agrave; des dimensions politiques,

institutionnelles et d 'aide. 

<P>

La troisi&egrave;me option, celle de la <B>&quot;r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;

uniforme&quot;</B> (dans le sens de l 'article XXIV du GATT),

serait conforme aux r&egrave;gles de l'OMC. Elle renforcerait

fondamentalement le principe du partenariat, &eacute;tant donn&eacute;

qu'elle rendrait plus &eacute;gal le contrat entre les

deux parties et le transformerait en contrat &agrave; dur&eacute;e

ind&eacute;finie (du moins en ce qui concerne la partie

de la Convention relative au commerce). 

<P>

<UL>

<LI>Elle maintiendra, et am&eacute;liorera m&ecirc;me, la s&eacute;curit&eacute;

et la pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; des pref&eacute;rences, et en

ouvrant et &quot;d&eacute;limitant&quot; le r&eacute;gime des

importations des pays ACP, elle donnera de la cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;,

aux yeux des investisseurs nationaux et &eacute;trangers, &agrave;

leurs politiques commerciales. En cons&eacute;quence, on peut

s'attendre &agrave; un attrait suppl&eacute;mentaire pour les

investissements &eacute;trangers directs, ainsi qu'&agrave; une

bonne r&eacute;action de la part des investisseurs nationaux;

<P>

<LI>elle permettra &eacute;galement de cr&eacute;er des conditions

&eacute;gales par rapport &agrave; d'autres PMA s'engageant

dans des ZLE avec l'UE et perrnettra &agrave; certains pays ACP

d'adh&eacute;rer &agrave; des accords commerciaux r&eacute;gionaux

avec d'autres &eacute;conomies d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es et

de profiter de la dynamique de l'&eacute;conomie r&eacute;gionale;

<P>

<LI>en ce qui concerne les d&eacute;savantages, cette option, en

imposant un cadre horizontal uniforme, n'abordera pas la question

existante de la diff&eacute;renciation marqu&eacute;e entre

les pays ACP, en ce qui concerne le niveau d'int&eacute;gration

et de d&eacute;veloppement, ainsi qu'en ce qui concerne

les besoins et la capacit&eacute; de participer &agrave; des n&eacute;gociations

de libre-&eacute;change avec I 'UE.

</UL>

<P>

Le probl&egrave;me principal est sans conteste la faisabilit&eacute;:

comment tous les pays ACP pourraient-ils s'accorder sur un

seul &quot;plan&quot; et un seul &quot;programme&quot; (ainsi

que le requiert l'article XXIV.5. (c)) pour la formation d'une

zone de libre-&eacute;change UE/ACP, qui tienne compte de leurs

syst&egrave;mes commerciaux, de leurs besoins diff&eacute;rents

en mati&egrave;re de restructuration industrielle, de changement

de la politique fiscale qui seraient n&eacute;cessaires pour accompagner

le d&eacute;mant&egrave;lement des tarifs, etc. ? Il serait impossible

qu'un seul cadre puisse int&eacute;grer les besoins et les conditions

de tous les pays ACP. En outre, de nombreux pays ACP ne disposent

pas des comp&eacute;tences humaines et des capacit&eacute;s administratives

n&eacute;cessaires pour s'engager dans des n&eacute;gociations

de libre-&eacute;change avec l'UE. 

<P>

<B>&quot;La r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; diff&eacute;renci&eacute;e&quot;</B>

comprendrait tous les avantages de l'option pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente

tout en tenant compte des niveaux d'int&eacute;gration et de d&eacute;veloppement

diff&eacute;rents, ainsi que des besoins, des conditions, des

capacit&eacute;s et de la volont&eacute; des diff&eacute;rents

groupes de pays ACP. Pour chaque r&eacute;gion ACP, un &quot;plan

&quot; et un &quot;programme &quot; pour arriver au libre-&eacute;change

avec l'UE, adapt&eacute; &agrave; leurs besoins et capacit&eacute;s

particuliers, pourraient &ecirc;tre d&eacute;finis. Cette option

donnerait un &eacute;lan important au processus d'int&eacute;gration

r&eacute;gionale en cours dans les pays ACP. 

<P>

<UL>

<LI>Le grand inconv&eacute;nient de cette option serait la perte

du caract&egrave;re unique de la relation et la

fragmentation du principe de partenariat, qui serait cependant

renforc&eacute; dans le cadre de chaque accord. En outre, &eacute;tant

donn&eacute; que cette approche doit reposer sur des processus

existants d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale entre les pays

ACP (UEMOA, SADC, CARICOM, etc.), les pays ACP qui ne sont pas

partie ou qui ne d&eacute;sirent pas se joindre &agrave;

un de ces processus devraient entamer des n&eacute;gociations

uniques concernant une ZLE avec l'UE. Cette option pourrait &eacute;galement

int&eacute;grer des ZLE impliquant d'une part l'UE, et de l'autre,

des pays ACP et hors ACP qui constituent des zones regionales

&quot;naturelles&quot;. 

<P>

<LI>Cette option impliquerait &eacute;galement la fin des protocoles

sur les produits de base et du r&eacute;gime agricole pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel.

La n&eacute;gociation des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences relevant de

ces instruments particuliers poserait certains probl&egrave;mes.

<P>

<LI>Ici aussi, la faisabilit&eacute; est un probl&egrave;me majeur,

&eacute;tant donn&eacute; qu'on ne peut pas s'attendre

&agrave; ce que tous les pays ACP, ou tous les groupements

ACP d'int&eacute;gration r&eacute;gionale, remplissent les conditions

(politiques, commerciales, administratives et autres), soient

capables, ou d&eacute;sireux, d'entamer des n&eacute;gociations

sur des ZLE avec l'UE. En outre, si les accords n&eacute;goci&eacute;s

ne remplissent pas totalement les conditions de l'article XXIV,

une d&eacute;rogation (art. XXIV.10) devrait &ecirc;tre demand&eacute;e.

Si trop d'accords de ce type devaient &ecirc;tre examin&eacute;s,

la gestion au sein de l'OMC des d&eacute;rogations correspondantes

pourrait constituer un probl&egrave;me majeur pour l'UE. Dans

le cadre de cette option, et conforrn&eacute;ment aux conclusions

de la Commission et du Conseil de juin 1995 sur les zones

de libre-&eacute;change, ces accords devraient &ecirc;tre conformes

aux dispositions correspondantes de l'OMC et tenir compte des

cons&eacute;quences pour les politiques communes de l 'Union et

pour ses principaux partenaires commerciaux.

<title>Programme Update 19: Zaire</title>

<body>
<h3>PROGRAMME UPDATE 19</h3>
<i>The material that follows has been provided by</i> <a href="oxfam.html">Oxfam</a>
<hr>
<h2> ZAIRE - GOMA</h2>
<h3>Key developments</h3>
<p>
<ul><li>As reported previously, phase I of the registration
     operation in the camps took place on Sunday 29 January
     1995 without major security incidents although NGO's
     did observe some instances of fraud (estimated to be
     about 10%).  During phase II temporary ration cards
     were handed out.  In Kibumba camp refugees refused to
     dip their fingers in ink, resulting in security
     incidents and a one day delay. This process is to be
     continued in Kubumba but has been abandoned in other
     camps.  Some other security incidents were reported
     and MSF-Belgique, after speaking out about instances
     of fraud they had observed, then received threats from
     refugee leaders.  Feeling that the situation had
     become untenable, MSF-Belgique subsequently announced
     their intention to pull out of Kibumba camp. A
     communique signed by all the NGO's in the coalition
     and supported by UNHCR was issued on Monday 6
     February.  Following this announcement IRC also
     expressed their intention to withdraw their staff from
     the Kibumba camp.
<p>
<li>UNHCR continue with their policy of facilitation of
     voluntary repatriation. Information centres are still
     operating in the camps.  UNHCR have agreed to pay œ8.6
     million for 1,500 Zairean troops to protect more than
     a million refugees (1,000 in Goma and 500 in Bukavu)
     as part of a 'Zairean contingency for Security in the
     Camps.'  A special 30-50 member UNHCR liaison
     committee made up of international military 'experts'
     will work with the Zairean High Command on all aspects
     of the planning and implementation of the agreement. 
     Security posts will be set up in each refugee camp and
     the UN will fund all operational costs.
<p>
<li>Figures reported for monitored repatriation show a
     significant decrease of returnees.  In November 1994
     an average of 1,000 refugees per day were returning,
     decreasing to 500 a day in December and to only a few
     hundred a day at the current time. (These figures were
     obtained in a transit centre in Gisenyi but interviews
     with the returning refugees have been cancelled after
     criticism from the Rwandese authorities.  However,
     counting continues in Gisenyi).
<p>
<li>The latest information on the situation with the two
     volcanoes in the region is more hopeful but the
     situation remains unsure. 
</ul><p>
<h3>Oxfam's response</h3>
<p>
<ul><li>The water distribution system in Kahindo camp has been
     closed for short periods during the day to allow tanks
     to refill.  Investigations are being carried out to
     find out why the tanks have been running empty -
     whether it is due to increased consumption or reduced
     flow from the source.
<p>
<li>Oxfam is to consider its long term plans/strategy in
     the camps in the light of UNHCR's proposed intention
     to dismantle the camps in North Kivu by the end of
     1995 by a process of voluntary repatriation to Rwanda
     or a transferral of a significant proportion of the
     current camp population to alternative camps in the
     interior of Zaire.  A site has been proposed for the
     latter suggestion but it is over 200 km into the
     interior of Zaire with no available access. 
     Clarification is needed on this proposal as this has
     direct bearing on current programme decisions.
<p>
<li>Oxfam is considering its own contingency plans in
     light of the predicted volcanic eruption as well as
     participating in an information campaign for local
     leaders and the Zairean population.  A grant for
     œ73,000 has been approved to provide emergency water
     equipment for 200,000 people.
<p>
<li>Oxfam is to set up contingency stocks of non-food
     items in the Masisi area where we have been working
     since 1993 with victims of civil war to be distributed
     to up to 50,000 displaced people.

<b>Peace has confirmed the ethnic divisions forged by war; elections in September are likely to legitimate

their leader and war lords</b><p>



Sarajevo in June 1996 is a city transformed. The streets are crowded, pavement cafes have appeared on

virtually every street, trams and buses are running, some of them new, and the utilities have been

restored. Not quite 24 hours a day but enough to make the running of a water tap or the flick of an

electricity switch seem a miracle to survivors of he longest siege since World War II. In the brilliant summer

sunshine the war already seems distant to the outsider. Even to the citizens of a city whose name has

twice in a century been indelibly written into the history books, looking up at the hills from which Bosnian

Serbs mercilessly rained down artillery and sniper fire seems past history; and it probably is. The charred

remains of the National Library remain a haunting reminder of the devastation wreaked upon the city in

the ugliest challenge to European civilisation since 1945.<p>

Now the city is reunited, but not reconciled. For the most part the Serbs have left the suburbs that had

to be returned to the Bosnian government under the Dayton Agreement, and, disturbingly, there are

almost daily reports that those who remain are subject to harassment and intimidation from Muslims

who increasingly appear to have adopted the selfishness of their erstwhile enemies. Much of this comes

from refugees, victims of ethnic cleansing in eastern Bosnia. Their own home towns - Visegrad, Foca,

Zvornik and more recently Srebrenica - are ethnically pure and festooned with portraits not only of

Radovan Karadzic, President of the Serb Republic, but also of Arkan, the militia leader who pioneered

ethnic cleansing, first in Croatia and then in Bosnia. The famous bridge at Visegrad, still bears its Turkish

inscriptions, silent witness to the hundreds of Muslims who were murdered and thrown from it in the

cruel summer of 1992.<p>



In just over two months from now, on or before 14 September, the people of Bosnia-Hercegovina will go

to the polls, nine months to the day since the Dayton Agreements were formally signed in Paris last

December. Those agreements scheduled to last 12 months were always dictated not by the measure of

the tasks that confronted the international community in trying to rebuild Bosnia, but purely by US

electoral considerations. President Clinton, having decided finally in the summer of 1995 to intervene

diplomatically and militarily, was determined that results must be shown by the time he sought reelection

in November 1996. Correspondingly, it was yet another demonstration of European political weakness

that they accepted a timetable in Bosnia driven purely by US domestic political considerations. As a result,

scant time has been given for more moderate political opinions to emerge in all three communities, or for

the people of Bosnia to witness the results of economic reconstruction and harness a peace dividend.<p>

By contrast, in Cambodia in 1992-3 the UN Transitional Authority (UNTAC) had 15 months to organise a

similar exercise and did so only after the return of refugees and after minimal standards of freedom of

movement and of the media had been obtained. Fortunately, that exercise did not involve US troops

whose country's intervention in Bosnia has simultaneously delivered peace, but at the same time frozen

the political status quo, itself a result of ethnic cleansing. Thus, the Dayton Accord recognised the

Republika Srpska (the Bosnian Serb Republic), as a legitimate political entity, an ethnically pure statelet

founded on the physical liquidation or expulsion of all minorities, a chilling precedent for Europe at the end

of the century. Small wonder that in the endless speeches and events that commemorated the fiftieth

anniversary of the defeat of fascism, no statesman dared refer to Bosnia.<p>

The Dayton Agreements, in a mix of realpolitik and idealism, also provided for the rebuilding of a new

Bosnia and the construction of new federal institutions. But it did so on the basis of recognising two

entities, the aforementioned Serb Republic and the Muslim Croat Federation. This latter political

formation, the result of a previous US intervention - the Washington Agreement of March 1994 - groups

another ethnically pure statelet, the Croat Republic of Herzeg-Bosna with the rump Bosnian Republic based

in Sarajevo. The latter, while Muslim dominated, does to its credit still tolerate a degree of media pluralism

and many thousand of Serbs and Croats who constitute about 30 per cent of its population. The Serb and

Croat statelets are more than 99 per cent ethnically pure.<p>

In itself, the logic behind Dayton was not doomed to failure, and, even at this late hour, there may still be

some hope that it is not. But it can only succeed if minimal standards of democratic behaviour are

introduced and a greater degree of pluralism and tolerance encouraged and sustained in all communities.

Recognising the Republika Srpska, which the much maligned United Nations refused to do, would not have

been so bad had it been accompanied by a political strategy designed to prise the Serb population away

from the clutches of Radovan Karadzic and General Mladic, whose crazed behaviour has earned for Serbs

an almost universal opprobrium. Instead, not only are these two indicted war criminals still free men, but

they retain the levers of political and military power in the Serb Republic: in mid May, when the hapless

Prime Minister of the Serb Republic, Rajko Kasagic, exhibited a degree of independence from his President,

Karadzic promptly  dismissed him. That step was described by he High Representative charged with

implementing the civil side of Dayton, Carl Bildt, as a 'coup d'&eacutetat'. The problem for Dayton and the

prospects of democracy in Bosnia is that it was a successful coup d'&eacutetat.<p>

If the absence of media freedom and freedom of movement were not crippling in themselves, the

mocking presence of Karadzic cruelly undermines the expectations for September's election. In the first

place it makes the emergence of more tolerant politicians in the Serb Republic unlikely and almost

confirms that the psychiatrist's party will sweep the board there. Secondly, it encourages the likelihood

that other ethnic warlords will triumph electorally in the Croat and Muslim communities, hardly a basis

upon which to construct a new federal Bosnia. The recent Dayton review conference in Florence on 13-14

June called once again for the mad doctor's removal from political life, but only his physical arrest and

deportation to the war crimes tribunal in the Hague is likely to contain his poisonous influence. Daily the

commanders of 60,000 of the world's best trained, equipped and armed troops pronounce themselves

incapable, unwilling or fearful of the consequences of such an act; a view which, if it prevailed in a domestic

jurisdiction, would excuse police from the dangers of arresting armed criminals. <p>

NATO has met with considerable military success in implementing the Dayton accords, but that could not

have been otherwise. Most Serb politicians were deliriously happy to learn that the US and European

democracies were willing for NATO troops to separate them from Muslims and Croats. What they did not

want to see, and here, alas, they have been largely successful, is the rigorous implementation of the civil

side of the Dayton accords. While Carl Bildt has been much criticised in this regard, it has been the

unwillingness of IFOR (the NATO implementation force) to move beyond the narrowest interpretation of

its mandate that has frozen the status quo of ethnic partition. Thus, when the Sarajevo suburbs were

torched by Serb looters in March, IFOR's presence was stunningly absent. Similarly, NATO patrols stand by

as Karadzic's motorcade glides effortlessly back to Pale, his hilltop capital, from gambling forays at the

Hotel Metropole in Belgrade. How is one to answer the criticism of one commentator in the <i>New York

Times</i>, who described IFOR's policy as having moved 'from the inexplicable to the repellent'.<p>

Clearly the international community, and above all the USA, is determined to hold elections in September

come what may. If the earth needs to be declared flat in the process, so be it. That not a single refugee

has been able to return home other than to areas where his or her ethnic community prevail, that the

Croat Republic retains its neo-fascist leanings and the Serb Republic would not need to learn lessons from

North Korea in terms of media control, that the distinguished former Bosnian Prime Minister, Haris Silajdic,

can be beaten around the head with an iron bar by Muslim zealots at a campaign rally, none of this daunts

the architects of Dayton or leads them to a moment's hesitation about holding elections in September.

For without elections there is no clear exit strategy and President Clinton remains determined not to go

to his polls in November without having cleared a decisive hurdle in Bosnia.<p>

Herein lies one of the most painful consequences of the Bosnian conflict from its outbreak in May 1992. If

it were not tragedy enough that people who had lived alongside each other for decades descended into a

nightmare of fratricidal conflict, that conflict has in turn weakened and sapped the moral fibre of all the

international actors who have sought to intercede. The EU, having demonstrated its ineptitude in the

Croatian war of 1991, was happy to force the UN into Bosnia against the expressed recommendation of

its Secretary-General, Boutros-Ghali, who could see no place for a traditional peacekeeping force when

there was no peace to keep. The UN, having been unceremoniously evicted in 1995, has been replaced by a

military force three times its size deployed on both sides of the confrontation line which, in a six month

deployment, has so far suffered less casualties than the New York police department in a week. This

unwillingness to undertake the slightest risk, the predominant concern among IFORÕs US commanders,

renders implementation of the civil side of Dayton a Sisyphean endeavour. But it can hardly be a triumph

for NATO if its first military engagement ends up in a Cyprus-type solution for Bosnia. When has partition

ever been a lasting solution to communal conflict? Cyprus aside, one would have thought that the lessons

of Ireland, Palestine and India were eloquent enough. <p>

It is above all the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), still a child in institutional

terms, that has to bear the heavy responsibility for supervising the September elections. Under the

chairmanship of the Swiss Foreign Minister, Flavio Cotti, it has struggled to keep some institutional

independence with regard to the elections under intense American pressure. Ironically, the OSCE only has

the job because of Washington's visceral dislike of the UN. One of the things the UN has time and time

again demonstrated is precisely its capability in organising elections as Namibia in 1989 and Cambodia in

1993 strikingly demonstrated. What the UN achieved above all in Cambodia was the creation of a

democratic space in which newspapers and NGOs flourished for the first time in Cambodia, and, by the

very act of holding the elections, achieving an almost 90 per cent turnout. Pol Pot and the Khmer Rouge

were marginalised politically.<p>

Tragically, that has not happened in Bosnia. Indeed, as a recent meeting of journalists I chaired in Sarajevo

highlighted, it is above all journalists who do not enjoy any freedom of movement. Even with NATO's

substantial military presence, no Bosnian journalist could venture into the Croat or Serb statelets without

fear. No local NGOs are able to operate across confrontation lines. What democratic space there is exists

wholly in the territory of the Bosnian republic and even here it is under pressure from the SDA (Party of

Democratic Action), the increasingly authoritarian ruling party of President Alija Izetbegovic. The UN High

Commission for Refugees has laboured ceaselessly to breach the walls of partition, organising buses

across confrontation lines and visits by refugees to their former homes, but with little real success and,

so its officials claim with minimal assistance from NATO.<p>

There is always the distant hope that some 'good guys' will emerge in the polls. Some observers place

hope in Haris Silajdzic's Party for Bosnia-Hercegovina, which may do reasonably well in Bosnian government

territory. But it will be  to the enduring cost of the international community that it has signally failed in

changing the profoundly undemocratic structures of the Serb and Croat statelets. Critically, the

implementation of the Dayton Agreements has not done enough to create the space in which 'good

guys' could emerge as meaningful political actors. How could this be otherwise, some would argue, when

President Milosevic of Serbia and President Tudjman of Croatia were the West's main interlocutors in

bringing about the Dayton agreement. As one Sarajevan friend commentated. 'In 1995 we had the hope

of peace. This year we have peace and no hope.' I can only hope he is not right.<p>

<h3>Information, Capacity Development and Environmental Policy-making<p>

</h5>Report prepared by Peter Ballantyne and dated October 1995<br>(ECDPM Working Paper

No. 7)</h5>

</center>

<hr>

<h3>Policy-making on the Environment and Sustainable Development</h3>

<p>

The first part of the meeting concentrated on the policy process. This section elaborates on some

particular features of environmental policy-making, and it briefly looks at the policy process and

associated information dimensions.

<p>



<i>      Managing natural resources and the environment</i>

<p>

The environment is often discussed as if it is a homogenous concept or group of problems somehow

separated from other sectors. In his opening presentation, Michael Carley was at pains to emphasise

that we would be better to think of the "environment" as a set of complex socioeconomic problems

spread across and involving all of the sectors in which we work. Instead of confining it to an

isolated box, it needs to be treated as a cross-cutting theme requiring attention at all levels of

government and society. He argued that we almost never solve an environmental problem in the

sense that it goes away. Instead, problems evolve, change, and reappear elsewhere. We can

conclude therefore that environmental management is a process to manage change.

<p>

According to Leonard Nurse, decision-making on the use of coastal resources is essentially about

tradeoffs between and among competing uses. And, since many of the uses are not mutually

exclusive, decision-makers are often looking for compromises that minimise conflict and maximise

the benefits to the people and organisations most involved. In their decisions, small-country policy-

makers seek to facilitate economic development by maximising the benefits to be gained from

natural resources, while also limiting the negative impacts of development on what is usually

natureþs fragile and limited resources. We can conclude that environmental management is a process

to manage conflicting interests and competing demands for resource use. 

<p>

Some other characteristics of environmental management are identified in a recent report of the

Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD, 1995). They talk of cross-sectoral

and multi-disciplinary linkages, managed interdependence, the adoption of long-term and "system"

perspectives, participation in decision-making and implementation by a broad spectrum of

organisations, communities and institutions, and the need for disparate organisations to engage in

new inter-organisational relationships that emphasise cooperation and collaboration. We can

conclude that environmental management is about the search for institutional arrangements adapted

to complex inter-sectoral and inter-organisational demands.

<p>

In their efforts to adapt to the specific needs of environmental management, governments have been

trying out various organisational forms and approaches. At the consultation, Anthony Bartholomew

showed how responsibility for the environment in Trinidad and Tobago has shuttled between several

ministries over the years, and led to a situation where the environment was not managed in a

coherent and coordinated manner (see <a href = "conbox2.htm">Box 2</a>). <a name="box2"></a>In response to

some of these problems, he presented current plans by the government for an Environmental

Management Authority (EMA) to be responsible for overall environmental coordination in Trinidad

and Tobago. A high priority for the new agency is to develop a national environmental information

system that will link and integrate the many different national institutions that have environmental

interests.

<p>

Many of the worldþs small states are islands that can expect to benefit from efforts to improve the

management of their coastlines. At a major international conference on coastal zones organised by

the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 1993, coastal problems were identified

as "almost always rooted in resource use conflicts" (IPCC, 1994: p. 25). This was confirmed by

Leonard Nurse during the consultation when he singled out conflict between incompatible uses of

coastal resources as the major coastal management problem in Barbados.

<p>

Accordingly, a major objective of coastal policies is to encourage changes in human behaviour. At

the 1993 conference, the Panel recommended that this could be achieved if countries adopt an

integrated coastal zone management (ICZM) approach based on wide participation, inter-sectoral

collaboration and coordination, and horizontal as well as vertical integration.

<p>

Barbados has been using such an integrated approach to coastal zone management for several

years. There, as in other small islands, coastal zones vital to the economy are under great pressure,

mainly from human demands. The management of coastal zones provides a good example of the

complexities faced in environmental management. Coastal problems, as Carley indicated above for

the environment, can rarely be conveniently "boxed" and considered as uniquely "coastal." Trees

growing away from a coast may, for example, be implicated in coastal problems when downstream

water flows and quality are adversely affected by logging. Solving such a "technical" problem is

greatly complicated by institutional factors, not the least of these being the difficulties encountered

by a coastal zone scientist operating outside strictly "coastal" jurisdictions. In these situations, some

mechanisms are needed to bring diverse groups together. As an example of this organisational

diversity, <a href = "conbox3.htm">Box 3</a> <a name="box3"></a> shows some of the institutions that are involved in

coastal zone management in Barbados.

<p>

The example above, as well as illustrating the organisational issues, highlights the need for different

types of data to be brought together and used in problem-solving. Elaborating on this theme, Nurse

suggested that the ultimate task of coastal zone management is to fuse information and data from

different sources. He highlighted good inter-agency links as essential in carrying out this task, and

the value of a formal coastal zone management plan that identifies all of the actors and their

responsibilities. Looking again at Box 3, and assuming that each organisation is both a source and

a consumer of data and information, we can begin to appreciate the potential scope (and

complexity!) of an integrated information system on coastal zone management.

<p>

The IPCC also sees information playing a major role in this integrated approach. They found that

coastal managers are "increasingly basing their decisions on analytical and scientific information"

(IPCC, 1994: p. 48), and that "technical capacities, encompassing hardware, practices and human

skills, appear to be crucial for organizing information" (IPCC, 1994: p. 35). They also recognised

that data collection is difficult and costly, and they suggested that it is still necessary to identify the

most relevant information that is needed for the ICZM process.

<p>

In this section, we have tried to elaborate on the nature of environmental management, emphasizing

the processes, the changes, and the institutional frameworks that underlie and influence

environmental decisions. Looking at the situations in Barbados and in Trinidad and Tobago in a little

more detail, we see that the development of inter-sectoral linkages and inter-organisational

collaboration get high priority in the search for effective national decision-making on environmental

issues. We also see that data and information collection and sharing are regarded as essential tools

for better linkages and collaboration. We can conclude therefore that environmental management

is largely concerned with the effective integration and use of information and data from diverse

sources.

<p>



<i>      Information dimensions of the policy process</i>

<p>

If we accept that information is indeed at the centre of environmental management, and by

extension environmental policy-making, then what do we know about the policy process itself, and

specifically the role of information in it?

<p>

These were the key questions posed to the meeting by Michael Carley. In earlier work, he

emphasises that the policy cycle is an information-intensive process (Carley, 1994). He describes

a cycle in which problems and challenges are identified, and information on the problem is gathered

and analysed to create a knowledge base from which strategies, policies, programmes and projects

can de developed and implemented. In this cycle, decision-makers and their advisers

interact with one another to exchange information and knowledge, and they each rely on several

complex information "systems", both formal and informal, that provide specialised data, advice, and

opinions.

<p>

According to Carley, an effective policy cycle has four key ingredients: First, political commitment,

second, institutional capacity, third, stakeholder participation that integrates both bottom-up and

top-down ideas, and fourth, knowledge capacity (Carley, 1995). In his view, the last has an enabling

role that helps to ensure the effectiveness and long-term viability of the other three. Enhancing

knowledge capacity leads to enhancements in the others. The question of how we enhance this

knowledge capacity is addressed in the second part of this paper.

<p>



<i>      Whose knowledge capacity?</i>

<p>

In the discussions, there were several views about whose knowledge capacity needs to be enhanced.

A recurring concern in the meeting was the need for precision in identifying the people whom we call

"policy-makers" as well as the processes in which they are engaged. Being concrete about specific

policies and the decision-makers involved in each was considered to be essential if we are to better

understand policy processes.

<p>

According to one of the working groups, information for policy-making is ultimately directed towards

the Cabinet of Government as the ultimate body who approves or disapproves of a policy decision or

choice. Since this is normally a small group of people, policy "advisers" or "technocrats" were also

identified as a policy-making group closely connected to Cabinet, and in fact mandated to inform and

advise it. This of course reflects a view of policy-making in which information and choices flow

upwards to Cabinet through well-established official channels that also provide opportunities for

consultation. In this view, policy-makers are surrounded by a plethora of advisers, researchers,

lobbyists, campaigners, information specialists, media, and the general public who direct opinions,

advice, data and information at the policy-making groups. The impact of these groups is measured in

terms of their access to the policy-making groups and presumed influence on subsequent decisions.

<p>

In such a scenario, it could be argued that the "knowledge capacity" of most concern to us is that of

the Cabinet and its supporting policy advisers, usually, but not always, in government. Bombarded

with vast quantities of information and advice, these policy-makers seek acceptable solutions that,

according to Louk Box, reduce risk but do not necessarily optimise decisions. Weighing the arguments

requires that decision-makers have access to a wide range of sources and opinions as well as hard

data, and sufficient analytical capacity to make sense of it all. One way to do this is to provide policy-

makers with the necessary skills and access to information resources to become information specialists

themselves. However, while they can become more skilled and can increase their access to

information, it is doubtful if they will ever have sufficient time for the required scanning and analysis.

<p>

An alternative that emerged in the discussions was for policy-makers to benefit from some kind of

"distillery" where ideas and information are sorted and processed for easier consumption. The precise

nature of this distillery was not defined. It might be seen as a function that needs to be performed;

or it could be seen as a specialised unit attached to a policy cluster. It might be staffed by some kind

of policy information manager (or information "broker") who, from within the policy-making

community, clearly articulates and interprets policy information requirements and plays an active role

in seeking out information that is needed. The essence of the idea is that someone focuses on gaining

a better understanding of the specific policy process and its information dimensions, and is thus in a

strong position to acquire the information that is really needed, to make sure it is analysed, and then

to make sure that it is used.

<p>

Another argument is that the "knowledge capacity" of the outside communities and organisations that

try to influence policy-makers is equally a candidate for enhancing. In particular, these groups are

constrained by lack of information and data itself, sometimes by their inability to transform and

present what data they have got, and also by an inadequate understanding of the policy process,

including how decisions are made and who by. For groups or organisations that target policy-makers

or are supposed to serve them, this last constraint was felt to be critical.

<p>

In this section, we have emphasised the view of the participants that policy-making is not a single

process, but a number of interlocking and simultaneous processes that involve a wide range of actors.

Understanding policy-making means looking not only at the top where decisions are taken, but at all

of the levels that contribute to policy preparation, formulation, and also implementation.

<p>

While Michael Carleyþs focus on "knowledge capacity" set the scene for later discussions on capacity-

building, it also led participants to discuss who actually makes policy (and therefore needs knowledge

capacity) and what role information plays in the decisions. He implied that the knowledge absorption

"capacity" of policy-makers was still quite limited and that information providers would do well to

concentrate on issues of information quality, content, and presentation. A "distilling" function closely

linked to the policy-makers was suggested as a possible way that knowledge could be brought into

policy-making and managed in a coherent manner.

<p>



<a name="reach"><h3>Reaching the Policy-makers</h3></a>

<p>

Moving from a discussion of the policy process, this section presents some experiences from

organisations located "outside" of policy-making, but eager to inform and influence policy decisions. 

<p>

<i>      . . . through advocacy and awareness</i>

<p>

Using recent debates on the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) as her principal example, Ruth

Raymond talked about the experiences of the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI)

in supporting national decision-making on biodiversity issues. The institute recognises that policy and

management decisions of this kind are the responsibility of national governments and she emphasised

that IPGRI, as an international organisation, aims to work in partnership with national organisations

in developing countries. IPGRI relies to a large degree on the abilities and capacity of their national

partners to inform local decision-makers, and thus it recognises the need to support strong national

organisations working on biodiversity issues. In its dealings with national decision-makers, IPGRI sees

its principal role as giving advice and providing options; it tries to avoid providing "prescriptions." 

<p>

In addition to this advisory role which is based on technical and scientific analysis, a major aim of

IPGRI is to generate public awareness of the need for effective management of plant genetic

resources. This public awareness and advocacy is intended to generate a climate of support that will

help to create the necessary political will to make decisions that favour the best management of genetic

resources. In this, the media plays a crucial role (as at the UNCED conference where huge media

attention helped to create a positive political climate for biodiversity). IPGRI also makes substantial

use of conferences and dialogues as a way to inform policy-makers. 

<p>

As an international agency keen to see countries adopting international conventions that benefit them,

Raymond emphasised that people who disseminate information need to better understand local policy

needs and local processes. This, she argued, was necessary to ensure that suitable information reaches

decision-makers and that it persuades them of the likely benefits from a certain course of action.

<p>

As well as calling for more attention to the policy process, Raymond was concerned with how

information can be better evaluated in order for it to be used more effectively. She suggested that

paying closer attention to improving the information "package" (including its content and presentation)

would result in national decision-makers being in a better position to know and understand the

consequences of their decisions.

<p>



<i>      . . . through structured data systems</i>

<p>

A contrasting approach was presented by Guy Engelen from the Research Institute for Knowledge

Systems in the Netherlands. His emphasis was on data, stored and manipulated through computer-

based simulation models, and graphically displayed using geographic information systems. The aim

of such policy information systems is to help decision-makers and planners to understand very

complex natural and socioeconomic systems and then to make informed decisions.

<p>

Engelen raised three main questions: What level of abstraction of information do decision-makers

need? What information systems are needed? And what information tools are needed?

<p>

In dealing with these questions, he identified three levels at which information systems generally

operate. In the lowest, the emphasis is on data and the principal tool is the database management

system. At the second level, the focus (and the data) is transformed into information -- a geographic

information system is a typical tool at this level. Above all of these, he identified a third level which

he called intelligence, and where a decision support system would typically be found. He suggested

that decision-makers can be considered as needing "intelligence" more than either information or data.

<p>

Regarding the specific needs of small states, he demonstrated a model to simulate the effects of

climate change and other environmental policy decisions on the island of Saint Lucia. Designed as a

policy support system (PSS), it is intended to facilitate the design and evaluation of alternative policy

options. It allows users to analyse long-term trends and the impacts of policy interventions using

"what-if" scenarios to visualise the likely results of decisions. He said that they had encountered

several problems in collecting the data that the model required, the most critical being their

dependence on the goodwill and collaboration of officials on the island. He emphasised that for a

model like this to be useful in environmental decisions, it needs to have access to location-specific data

that is not always easily-accessible or even collected. Finally, on the issue of data sources, he

indicated that although such modelling tends to rely on more formal data systems, future efforts must

also find ways to incorporate "traditional" knowledge.

<p>



<a name="some"><h3>Some Conclusions on Information and the Policy

Process</h3></a>

<p>

<ul>

<li>There is no single policy process involving a well-defined group of people. Instead, several processes

are in progress at the same time, with various participants depending on the problem or issue in question.

<p>

<li>There are many different actors in policy-making, each with different roles and contributions, and

different information needs.

<p>

<li>Knowledge capacity is both a pre-requisite for policy-making itself, and an "enabler" for three other

pre-requisites (political commitment, institutional capacity, and stakeholder participation).

<p>

<li>Knowledge capacity is a pre-requisite for decision-makers, and also for those who seek to advise,

inform and influence them.

<p>

<li>The nature of the information needed is influenced by the main purpose of the decision, for example,

to manage change, to resolve conflict, or to facilitate inter-organisational coordination and linkages. The

information will be different, it will come from different sources, and it will be presented and used in

different ways.

<p>

<li>Distinctions can be made between data used to prepare policy decisions, and intelligence that is

actually used by policy-makers.

<p>

<li>Policy-makers may benefit more from information that has been "distilled" and is presented in

accessible ways.

<p>

<li>Better understanding of specific decision-making processes, and the actors involved, can help those

outside the decision group to support the processes more effectively.

<p>

<li>Improving the content and presentation of an information "package" will help to reach the right

decisions.

<p>

<li>Environmental decisions need to draw on traditional, indigenous, and local knowledge sources as well

as more formal data-based tools of science.

<p>

</ul>

<a name="cap"><h3><hr>Approaches to Capacity Development</h3></a>

<p>

The second part of the consultation took the idea of "knowledge capacity" a little further and looked

at the information elements of the environmental policy process. The aims were to identify what

kinds of capacities need to be developed, and how. Recognising that our knowledge of the role of

information in policy-making is rather weak, participants drew on other experiences where it was

hoped insights might be gained. Thus, several agencies briefly presented their approaches to

information capacity-building and identified some of the lessons that they had learned. As in the first

part, working groups discussed the issues in more detail.

<p>



<i>      What is capacity?</i>

<p>

Tony Land opened the discussion by emphasising that capacity-building is not a new concept --

under various names and guises, it has been around for some time. What is new is the current

widespread use of the term in relation to many different situations, projects, and levels of activity.

According to some observers, this indiscriminate use of the concept is a danger. Instead of being

a well-defined set of tools and approaches, capacity-building looks like becoming a fashionable

catch-all, sufficiently vague and all-embracing to be applied in almost any situation (Bossuyt, 1995).

The danger is that capacity-building becomes a slogan that few people really understand and an

approach that is difficult to make operational and to measure.

<p>

Land pointed out that capacity is applied at various levels -- of a country, of the state (or public

sector), of an organisation or one of its components, in civil society, or even at the level of the

individual. This diversity makes the concept very difficult to encapsulate, and very difficult to

discuss in concrete terms. In the meeting, it was suggested that an additional nuance - capacity

utilisation - might also be considered. It is not a question only to build capacity, but also to ensure

that there is an enabling environment that allows capacity to be used meaningfully.

<p>

In conclusion, he emphasised that when we talk about an entity having "capacity," we mean that

it has reached a desirable condition in which it can perform its functions in a satisfactory manner.

But, how do we move from this still rather general definition of capacity, and how do we develop

it? While a single definition is hard to come by, we can identify some general characteristics that

may help us.

<p>

First, capacity is task and context-dependent. Capacity is not a goal in itself; the goal is what can

be done with capacity. Referring in a rather abstract way to national capacity or capacity

development without a qualifier is often not helpful. It is more useful to link capacity to the tasks

to be performed or the goals to be reached; thus we can talk of capacity to collect data, to

cooperate effectively, to use advice, or to make policy.

<p>

Second, capacity is often seen as a set of skills or resources or expertise that is considered

necessary to do a task. For example, organisations may define what they consider to be the optimal

skill set that their staff need in order to implement the organisationþs mandate. Information

managers need to be literate and numerate, proficient in the use of computers, and well-informed

about the activities of the organisation in which they work. However, this approach is rather limiting

in that it excludes more contextual or institutional capacities that are also necessary, but much more

difficult to define.

<p>

Third, it is difficult to measure capacity. Definitions tend to be qualitative and refer to capacity as

"sufficient" or "adequate" to carry out a task or to reach a goal. In the absence of quantifiable

measures of capacity, it is very difficult to define exactly what capacity is needed to reach a goal,

and to know when sufficient capacity has been reached. When for example, does an organisation

know that it has sufficient information technology capacity? Of course, not all capacities are so

difficult to measure. If sufficient capacity is specified as certain levels of staffing, equipment, and

financial support provided to an activity, then it can quite easily be defined and measured. However,

such precision is only really possible when tasks have been clearly defined and when the inputs are

mainly financial or technical. It is much more of a challenge to adequately define and assess human

capacity requirements or an "enabling institutional environment."

<p>



<i>      How is capacity developed?</i>

<p>

Moving away from what we are trying to enhance (capacity to use and organise information)

towards how we enhance it (capacity development) we face a multiplicity of options. In many

organisations, capacity development is about training. Increasingly however, this is not seen as

sufficient, and organisations like ECDPM aim to enhance institutional capacity and especially the

organisational structures, linkages, and systems that allow people to function effectively. This

entails a broader focus and also a concern for the institutional and governance contexts in which

organisations operate.

<p>

A useful framework for thinking about capacity development is presented in a recent report by the

OECD (1995). They argue that the central concerns of environmental management - to manage

change, to resolve conflict, to manage institutional pluralism, to enhance coordination, to foster

communication, and to ensure that information and data are shared - require a broad and holistic

view of capacity development.

<p>

The report goes on to discuss some approaches to developing environmental management

capacities. Better environmental legislation, incentives for improved management, the development

of environmental strategies, enhanced horizontal coordination among organisations, organisational

restructuring, and support for local organisations are all mentioned. The authors emphasise that

countries must be able to carry out certain key environmental management functions in an effective

way. While information management is not identified as a core function in the sample list,

"networking and collaborating" is highlighted as a way to bring environmental actors together to

jointly address environmental issues. To do this, the report suggests that donors can support local

networks, information exchange opportunities such as workshops and publications, and the

activities of local environmental NGOþs. 

<p>

Experiences of donor agencies suggest that the way in which capacity is developed is critical.

Capacities that are developed in a participatory way, over time, and in response to real local needs

are more desirable than those identified in a top-down way with relatively little local involvement.

Capacities developed in a participatory way will be more relevant to local realities, will create a

greater sense of ownership in subsequent activities, and the tasks carried out will have a far greater

chance of being sustainable.

<p>

Who develops them is also important. Indigenous, home-grown capacities that deal effectively with

local challenges are what most countries and organisations seek, although they may import specific

capacities at certain times. In the environment, local expertise is especially critical and environmental

capacity development gives more emphasis to local knowledge and experience and places less

importance on outside expert knowledge (OECD, 1995).

<p>

A final strong message in the OECD report (and others) is that a capacity development orientation

also poses significant challenges to donor agencies. It requires that they re-think how they support

development cooperation and the nature of their relationships with aid recipients. The whole project

cycle may need to be modified to give greater roles to recipients. And, as both the OECD Task Force

and Bossuyt emphasise, capacity development implies a greater emphasis on partnership in which

all the actors are involved, are committed, and have clear roles to play.

<p>

The notion that donors and other technical assistance agencies commit themselves to a recipient-

driven process received strong support at the meeting. Paul OþNolan was emphatic that his

organisation seeks to avoid contributing, however unknowingly, to local capacity problems.

Operationally, this means engaging in dialogue, involving local actors in decisions and ensuring that

interventions emerge from and reflect the needs and requirements of local organisations. It also

means that assistance organisations need to take a closer and more critical look at themselves to

ensure that their efforts are consistent, internally, with each other, and with the requirements of the

local organisation. He cited cases where this consistency was not present and where incompatible

computer hardware was provided by different assistance agencies to local organisations. This

incompatibility then holds back local plans to create a common platform for staff to exchange data

and information. 

<p>

While assistance agencies can do a lot to improve things, through coordination and cooperation,

participants agreed that local agencies have a major role to play in managing the relationship with

donors. They argued that the ability of local organisations to "say no" to inappropriate or unsuitable

assistance was one of the most important capacities that they need, but currently lack. In this

context, the ability to say "no" was understood to result from a process in which local actors

identify their own needs and priorities, develop their own vision, set their own standards, and clearly

articulate these to assistance agencies.

<p>

In summary, capacity is something that individuals, organisations, and countries need, in sufficient

amounts, to do a task in the most effective manner. It is possible to identify the elements or

components that comprise capacity, but it is difficult to quantify (and therefore to measure) how

much or how many of each are needed. The way in which capacity is developed has a major

influence on its subsequent usefulness and sustainability. According to Tony Land, capacity

development should be people-centred, based on local ownership and agendas, and reliant on

participation and the use of local resources and expertise. Finally, implementing capacity

development approaches in development cooperation needs changes in the orientations and

procedures of both assistance and recipient agencies. In this, the latter can be more proactive in

defining their own requirements and communicating them to prospective donors.

<p>

<a name="do"><h3><hr>Doing Capacity Development in Practice</h3></a>

<p>

The OECD report is valuable in identifying promising approaches to capacity development. But, as

Bossuyt (1995) has noted, there is frequently a large gap between what we say we should do about

capacity development, and what is actually done in the field. In an effort to overcome this, the next

section shows how some organisations are actually trying to develop information capacities, in

different ways and in different places.

<p>



<i>      Developing information management capacities in an environmental NGO</i>

<p>

Maritza Hee Houng introduced the work of the Caribbean Conservation Association (CCA) and its

information activities. She emphasised that it has individual, organisational and governmental

members and it is therefore a bit different from other NGOþs. Its mission is to "promote and

coordinate policies, programmes and practices which contribute to the conservation, protection and

judicious use of the region's natural and cultural resources in order to enhance the quality of life for

present and future generations." In the early years, the cultural heritage was most important; recent

years have seen an emphasis on natural resources and their management.

<p>

While the provision of information has been a major part of most CCA activities, the information

function has tended to be subsumed under other activities, especially education. There have been

no conscious attempts to set policies on information, nor to systematically plan how it interacts with

other CCA activities and its membership. Despite this, CCA has developed a solid information base

and it provides a variety of information services to its members. This "evolutionary" approach has

served CCA well. However, in recent years, driven by some of the day-to-day problems encountered

in managing documents, CCA has taken a closer look at its information management. With

assistance from the Commonwealth Secretariat, a specialist has been recruited to reorganise internal

services and to develop a programme to enhance the dissemination of information to CCA members.



<p>

Good progress has been made with the internal reorganisation and the focus is now on how CCA

can more effectively support the activities of its members through its information programme. The

current CCA strategic plan emphasises coordination and linkages with member governments and

NGOs (rather than implementation) and information management. Thus, CCA will have more of a

facilitating and, with regard to information, clearinghouse role. Despite this, it is not yet clear

whether CCA will be (or will try to be) the main source of information for its members, or whether

members will themselves maintain information units that CCA supports and works through. Most

member governments already have some kind of environmental information system that CCA can

work with. However, member NGOþs tend to have less-developed information capacities requiring

that CCA adopt different roles.

<p>

In working with both groups, CCA aims to better understand the information needs of its member

organisations, to identify the information capacities that members are likely to need and to have,

and to implement concrete activities that respond to the needs expressed, including the provision

of training. 

<p>

In initiating this programme, CCA has accepted some responsibility to provide or facilitate training

in information management for its members. By doing this, CCA is shifting its focus from efforts

to enhance its own information capacities towards initiatives that also strengthen the information

capacities of its members. This training is being developed with support from the British Council and

others, and in collaboration with UNEPþs INFOTERRA programme. The first phase in late 1995 is a

seminar where environmental organisations in the region will review and discuss efforts to enhance

their cooperation. It will be an occasion also where government and NGOþs can come together. In

early 1996, a training workshop will help CCA members to develop some of the information

capacities identified at the earlier meeting.

<p>



         <i>Information technologies in the service of sustainable development</i>

<p>

According to Chuck Lankester, non-governmental organisations also play a major role in the

activities of the Sustainable Development Networking Programme (SDNP). Set up by UNDP in 1991

and now active in more than twenty developing countries, the SDNP aims to build capacity and

linkages between those who have information, and those that want it. Lankester sees a "hunger for

information" in the participating countries but an unwillingness among policy-makers to pay for

information until they are converted to its value in their own decisions. Making the "conversions"

requires that information providers adopt a proactive and marketing approach in which user needs

are more clearly understood that at present, and in which the benefits of information access are

demonstrated. 

<p>

He likened the process to one in which policy-makers and others become "addicted" to

information.In the Programme, sustainable development networks (SDN's) in each of the

participating countries are the main vehicles used to satisfy this hunger and, at the same time, to

spread the information addiction. Intended as a concrete mechanism to help build capacity to

implement agenda 21, each SDN is a national effort launched by coalitions of local stakeholders in

sustainable development and supported by UNDP. The underlying rationale is that efforts to build

the capacities needed to implement Agenda 21 can be helped by a network that facilitates access

to information on sustainable development.

<p>

Among its formal objectives, the SDNP aims to: facilitate access to information for users in

developing countries; to encourage increased communication about sustainable development; to

enhance the capacity of national institutions to meet their own needs for information on sustainable

development; and to help increase participatory decision making by elements of civil society. Their

approach is to involve civil society as well as government; to provide relatively short-term

assistance; to use participatory approaches; to complement the efforts of others (such as UNEP)

rather than to compete; and to support local networks (national initiatives) by providing guidance

and a little money.

<p>

The SDNP seeks to use computer-mediated technology to facilitate a wider process of sustainable

development (see Zambrano and Daudpota, 1995). In many such projects, the technologies can

come to dominate the discussions and the activities. Participants in the SDNP have been aware of

this and in their meetings they repeatedly emphasise that an SDN is a people-centred network that

uses information technologies to reach wider objectives.

<p>

De-emphasising the technology was also at the centre of a presentation by Paul OþNolan from the

International Service for National Agricultural Research (ISNAR). His experience suggests that

information technology has a great potential as an integrating mechanism that can bring different

parts and levels of an organisation together, and to bring different organisations together. He argued

that much of this integration can be done without major investments in technologies, but it does

need changes in organisation and policy. His comments reinforce an UNCTAD study on information

technology use in small states in which the author suggests that non-technical barriers are the main

factors that prevent the development of well-functioning information technology applications in small

islands (Romer, 1990).

<p>

OþNolan suggests that the institutionalisation and management of information technology, including

the development of policies and standards, while often overlooked, is as important as its installation

and maintenance. Capacities are needed to plan information technologies as well as to use them.

Investing in capacities to plan, to coordinate, and to think strategically about information

technologies provides the self-knowledge that allows an organisation to define its own priorities and

standards, and ultimately it empowers an organisation to say "no" or "yes" to offers of technical

assistance.

<p>



<i>      Strengthening national information networks</i>

<p>

The SDNP is an example where information networking on the very broad theme of sustainable

development is promoted. The consultation also heard about more specific network building

experiences -- in the environmental, and water and sanitation sectors.

<p>

Cor Dietvorst reviewed the experiences of the International Water and Sanitation Centre (IRC) with

information capacity building. Effective information management in the water and sanitation sector

is constrained by the organisational diversity of the sector as well as by its multi-disciplinary nature.

The environment, health, public works, and community development are all involved. The basic

information management challenge is therefore to facilitate inter-institutional communication.

<p>

In a recent report, Stephen Parker (1993) looks at several years of IRC experience in Asia and Africa

and he identifies three major lessons. First, that the users of information and their needs are

relatively unknown and poorly described. Descriptions of target groups that do exist tend to be

exhaustive or rather vague, and little effort is made to prioritise the groups according to needs.

Second, while policy-makers seem to be aware of the need to provide information, they do not

know how to go about it. There also seem to be few information systems that target policy-makers

as users of information. Third, information services on water and sanitation tend to be fragmented

and incompatible. Top-down approaches to information network design have not managed to

overcome this.

<p>

In dealing with these constraints, IRC has concentrated on some specific activities. First, it assists

national organisations to establish an information management unit (IMU) that brings various

information functions together under one "roof." Second, it facilitates the establishment of national

networks of IMU's to cooperate in providing integrated and targeted services to the various user

groups. Third, it supports training activities for information staff to acquire the skills and

qualifications necessary to provide a demand-driven service. Dietvorst summarised their overall

capacity development objectives as to help national organisations get back to basics regarding the

aims and activities of an information system, and to use and develop local capacity.

<p>

Nanny Kempers from INFOTERRA described a different approach. Where IRC is supporting "stand-

alone" national networks of local organisations, INFOTERRA is a global environmental information

and referral system with national focal points (NFP's) in most countries. Thus, it has activities to

build the capacities of the national focal points as well as the capacity of the network as a whole.

<p>

Concern for the overall operation of the network includes a commitment to support efforts of the

national focal points in their own countries. According to Kempers, the work of the focal points has

been held back by a variety of constraints including staff turnover, slow communication, language

barriers, limited funds, and the poor institutional locations of some NFP's. In addressing these

constraints, INFOTERRA employs a variety of approaches -- "twinning" of focal points in developed

and developed countries, allowing the sharing of skills and resources; the development of common

tools, methodologies, and products; the organisation of training courses; and access to expertise

and skills in the people that make up the network. A recent development has been the signing of

a memorandum of understanding between INFOTERRA and the SDNP to collaborate in strengthening

the capacities of national SDN's/NFP's.

<p>

Finally, although not represented at the meeting, the World Conservation Monitoring Centre (WCMC)

circulated a draft note on their approach to biodiversity information management. Set up by UNEP,

the World Conservation Union and the World Wide Fund for Nature, the Centre provides information

services on the conservation and sustainable use of species and ecosystems, and supports others

in the development of their own information management systems. The WCMC is currently

developing the concept of a biodiversity information network which, in each country, would

consolidate scattered information resources and provide integrated access to them. At the heart of

the network approach is a capacity-building process that seeks to involve key local actors in

developing a country-specific system to manage biodiversity information (<a href

="conbox6.htm">see Box 6</a>.). The approach is still being

developed and it will be "tested" in several countries during 1995 and 1996.<a name="box6"></a>

<p>

<a name="def"><h3><hr>Defining the Capacities to be Developed</h3></a>

<p>

Moving beyond the presentations which talked mainly of how capacities are being developed,

participants were asked to identify which management capacities are needed to deliver the

information that policy-makers need. As an aid to presentation, the many suggestions and

recommendations on capacity development have been clustered in three areas: First, the capacities

necessary to manage the "capacity" agenda itself. Second, the capacities needed to define a vision

and purpose of information activities. And third, the capacities needed to manage information flows

between information providers and policy-makers (see box 7 for a summary).

<p>



<i>      Thinking about capacities</i>

<p>

Although the meeting was focused on capacity-building and capacity development, participants

identified other kinds of capacity-related tasks that are just as important to an organisation. Since

some capacities may not be permanent and not all institutions have the same needs, it was argued

that organisations could also look at how capacity can be obtained for shorter periods, through out

sourcing, local consultants, or borrowing. In addition, organisations need to think about how they

keep the capacities that they have. This requires extra effort to create opportunities for people to

grow and develop in their organisations. Critical organisational capacities are to be able to identify

the various kinds of information capacity that are needed, to locate them, and then to keep and

develop those that are considered essential to the operation of the organisation.

<p>

<i>      Defining a vision for information</i>

<p>

According to participants, a first step is to look at the policy processes and the people engaged in

them. Capacities cannot be determined without knowing the intended purpose of the information

and the context in which it will be used. This understanding of policy processes is greatly facilitated

by a "systems view" that accommodates the full breadth of the policy issue in question. Mapping

information resources, information sources, institutional strengths and weaknesses, and likely

participants in specific policy areas may help to define the scale and scope of the intended policy

information system. 

<p>

Linked to this quest for greater understanding of the purpose, participants suggested that capacities

to develop a "vision" of the information function in relation to environmental policy-making are

necessary. Developing such a vision or strategy can be a participatory process by which the policy

and information communities are brought together. It brings coherence to scattered or dispersed

resources, reduces duplication and overlap and builds complementarities among contributing

agencies. Finally, it is the basis for organisations to say "no" to systems or approaches that are not

based on local requirements. 

<p>

Discussions in the meeting suggested that although all participants recognised the value of a clear

vision that defined the objectives and tasks of an information activity or function, there was little

experience in actually going through a process to develop this vision.

<p>

Based on experience with coastal zone management (CZM) in Barbados, developing "vision" is a

process in which a problem is recognised, agreement is reached that it should be tackled, decisions

are taken on how to tackle the problem, and then the problem is tackled. In this approach, problems

are clearly identified and a strategy is set out to deal with them. However, in discussing the CZM

process in Barbados, it became clear that a vision was not developed for information resources.

Instead, Leonard Nurse argued that the CZM process provided participating organisations with

sufficient knowledge about the locations of different data and so a specific process for information

was not needed. Thus, the resulting information "system" on coastal zones emerged over time in

a bottom-up fashion with decisions taken as and when required, and without any up-front strategic

vision. 

<p>

Such an evolutionary approach is what happened at CCA and it probably reflects the real

development of most information systems. In light of this, the question was raised as to whether

information systems actually need to go through the process of developing a vision and whether

such capacities are indeed necessary. Perhaps evolution is a sufficient approach for information

systems. The general feeling of participants was that a strategic vision for information should be

developed, but that they had too little empirical experience to say exactly how and in what

circumstances it was better than a more evolutionary process.

<p>

Having an understanding of environmental systems and insight into policy processes, and being able

to develop a local "vision" for the information function are the critical capacities identified here.

<p>



<i>      Managing information flows</i>

<p>

Participants were concerned that while there is already plenty of information and data on the

environment, much remains under-used. As Ian King from Barbados suggested at a UNEP meeting

in 1994, the basic issue is "not necessarily the question of the existence of the information, or

rather the data, as much as the access [to] the information or the analysis of the data" (King, 1995:

p. 26).  He picked on two of the key issues that concerned participants at the Maastricht meeting.

Namely, that capacities are needed to enhance the access of policy-makers to information, and to

ensure that data is digested for easy consumption.

<p>

Participants felt that increasing the access of policy-makers to information required more attention

to what their actual information needs are. The capacity to define information needs is one that

information consumers themselves need if they are to clearly and effectively articulate their needs

to information sources and providers. At the same time, skills in tracking environmental policy

demands and in identifying associated information needs are at the core of effective information

provision. Thus, participants emphasised that information providers focus on developing capacities

needed to understand what users are doing, the tasks they are involved in, and their needs for

information. Also, they need to look closely at how this understanding of users can be used to

target information more effectively. Critical capacities are to be able to define information needs and

to target information.

<p>

In improving access to information, one of the most important capacities identified is to be able to

transform and adapt information to the needs of different target groups. Particularly where data are

present in a non-processed form, what is often needed are the specialised capacities to convert data

into information or even "intelligence." In this, participants emphasised the need for scientific

capacity to analyse data and turn it into knowledge, and for "packaging" skills to spread the results

both down to the public and up to the policy-makers. Linked to the issue of analysis, it was

suggested that technical or scientific capacity can also be used to determine the usefulness and

usability of information and to exert some quality control on the data and information. Critical

capacities are to be able to distil and package information.

<p>

While most of the discussion was about using and disseminating information, there was an

underlying concern that countries and organisations also ensure that data and information is stored

and preserved in accessible ways. Valerie Isaac talked about information and data in the smaller

eastern Caribbean states being lost and inaccessible for want of adequate basic storing and filing

systems. And Leonard Nurse referred to aerial photographs of beaches on the islands being

overlooked in reviews of coastal systems, simply because almost nobody knew of their existence.

The capacity to collect, store and to preserve local information is especially critical in environmental

management, and exciting new developments should not shade out one of the basic reasons why

we manage information -- to preserve it for future generations.

<p>

Moving from rather static storage and preservation, a strong plea was made for information to be

properly marketed to policy consumers. As Chuck Lankester had emphasised, making information

available is not sufficient, people have to become addicts with an information habit. Doing this in

practice is difficult. Nevertheless, participants felt that a critical capacity is to be able to sell

information to consumers and to convince them that investment in information brings benefits to

their policy decisions. 

<p>

And finally, as in all discussions of development issues, information activities need to be monitored

and evaluated. This is a capacity that is lacking, in both the information suppliers and the

consumers. Policy-makers tend, for a variety of reasons, to have only slight acquaintance with their

own information needs and especially with the possible sources of information that are open to

them. Education is needed to make them intelligent consumers of the information they already pay

for. Among the information providers also, not very much is known about performance of

information systems and services, and how it can be assessed. This is an area where organisations

like IDRC have been active in trying to identify promising ways to measure information activities.

Individual information managers need to learn from this and to develop performance indicators that

allow them to evaluate how information is used and to show how it improves the policy process.

<p>



<a name="some"><h3>Some Information Capacities Required in Environmental Policy-making</h3></a>

<p>

Organisations and individuals who provide or use information require capacities in three main areas. First, they

need the capacity to think about capacity, to know what information capacities are needed, and how they can

be obtained, developed and kept.

<p>

Second, identifying the purpose and direction for the information function requires vision in which policy-

making and information systems are well-understood. In doing this, some useful capacities are to:

<ul>

<li>adopt "systems" approaches;

<li>understand the policy process;

<li>"map" institutional and informational resources;

<li>formulate strategies and plans for the information function;

<li>say "no."

</ul>

Third, transforming data and information into something that can be used in policy-making requires distillation

where the essence of an idea is disentangled and directed towards key audiences. In doing this, some useful

capacities are to:

<ul>

<li>formulate and articulate information needs;

<li>identify target groups of users;

<li>track demands;

<li>market information products and services;

<li>scan, analyse, and distil useful information;

<li>transform and adapt information to the needs of different target groups;

<li>preserve information and data for future use;

<li>monitor and evaluate the information function.

</ul><p>



<p>

<a name="next"><h3>Next Steps -- Identifying a Programme of Work</h3></a>

<p>

The final aim of the meeting was to identify some areas where activities and projects can be developed

to address the issues and problems identified in the discussions.

<p>

First of all, however, participants supported the initial hypothesis of the meeting that "policy-making

can benefit from access to appropriate information and data and well-managed information systems."

Furthermore, they agreed that this requires, at the least, that we have a good understanding of policy

processes and associated information needs, as well as sufficient information capacities to manage,

deliver, and use information and data. Next steps should address these concerns.

<p>

So what concrete activities emerged from the discussions? In his summary of the working group

presentations, Louk Box identified five main areas of activity:

<p>

<ol>

<li>Understand the policy process. Carry out case studies to analyse the policy cycle, paths and

processes of a specific issue in a country to show how things happen, who the real and unexpected

players in policy-making are, and how key policy players interact with each other;

<p>

<li>Look at the information dimension in policy-making. Do case studies on the role of information

in policy management situations, exploring how information is organised, managed, and used in

different types of organisations, the nature of an information "distillery," and how information and

data are transformed and interpreted for use in policy-making;

<p>

<li>Examine how information capacities are organised. Carry out exercises to "map" environmental

information systems to show where specific capacities are located, and who the audiences, products,

players, fundamental objectives, and beneficiaries are;

<p>

<li>Review the performance of information. Assess the impact of specific information initiatives on

policy-making, such as awareness campaigns;

<p>

<li>Mobilise interest. Organise activities to raise awareness of the role of information in policy-

making -- workshops, presentations, training, and publications.

</ol>

<p>

In discussing these activities, participants identified some guiding principles. First, every effort should

be made to link this initiative with others in the same general area - through collaboration and

information exchange - and to make certain that each initiative finds common actions and activities

and thus can learn from one-another. Second, that a region like the Caribbean is very diverse and any

follow-up should emphasise the specific policy concerns and context in each country. Third, that

comparative data (from a region) is useful and new activities should allow countries to learn from their

neighbours. Finally, that case studies should try to learn from mistakes as well as from successes.

<h3>LIBERATION STRUGGLE CONTINUES IN THE CLASSROOM</h3>
<i>
Some Eritrean parents oppose having their children schooled in their minority 
tongue for fear of denying the youngsters knowledge of more widely spoken 
languages. However, three years after independence, reports <b>Gemini News 
Service</b>, the government is pushing ahead with such education, saying national 
culture must not perish.<p>


By <b>JENNIE STREET</b>,<br>
12 April 1996,<br>
Asmara </i><hr><p>


Eritrean authorities are determined to provide primary education in minority 
languages - even when parents oppose it. Some parents demonstrated in Adi Kaieh 
against the policy on the grounds that mother-tongue teaching in their own 
language, Saho, would marginalise their children.<p>

They demanded Arabic as the medium of instruction, although it is not widely 
spoken in their area. In reply to such fears, Kebede Gebregazabiher, head of 
the curriculum department in the Ministry of Education, points out that the 
government "is not going to hire those who passed elementary school - they have 
to go higher".<p>

After the fifth year of education, English is the medium of instruction in 
schools across the country, and knowledge of English will well-equip a child to 
land a good government job.<p>

"We tell the parents, 'Your language is your culture, your heritage, your 
identity. It has to be developed, or it will perish.'"<p>

Emphasising that "we are very much convinced of the need for this policy", he 
explains: "Its roots lie in the independence struggle." After a long war, 
Eritrea broke free of direct Ethiopian control in 1991 and an independent 
republic was founded in 1993. During the fighting, a Revolution School was set 
up in a liberated area by the Eritrean People's Liberation Front (EPLF).<p>

"When we opened the Revolution School in 1976, there were children who spoke 
neither Tigrinya nor Arabic (the two most widely spoken languages), and we 
realised we needed to give them education in their own tongue first."<p>

All of Eritrea's nine ethnic groups have their own language. Yet 354 of the 
510 elementary schools teach in Tigrinya and 96 in Arabic, compared with 25 in 
Tigre, 13 in Kunama and 14 in Saho.<p>

Teaching in Tigrinya and Arabic in areas where neither is a second language 
contributes to poor attendance and high drop-out rates - which in turn 
contribute to widespread illiteracy.<p>

Only about 20 per cent of the population is literate. In remote rural areas, 
and among women, the percentage of literates drops even lower, in some areas to 
below five per cent.<p>

"Imposing Tigrinya was practically not fruitful," says Kebede of the period 
before liberation. "They could learn nothing in a language they didn't 
understand. Children learn quicker in their own tongue."<p>

At that time, he recalls, there was no problem getting teachers from minority 
language areas, "as there were many in the army from all parts of Eritrea, and 
we developed the curriculum in minority languages for grades one to three. But 
now, we have a desperate shortage of mother-tongue teachers." <p>

He explains: "We cannot find the personnel because now people have more choice 
as to their work." <p>

Last year, 360 students graduated as elementary teachers, but only nine were 
from minority ethnic groups. They have been assigned to work in their mother 
tongues. <p>

"Nine is a tiny number compared with the needs for 52 minority language 
schools," admits Kebede.<p>

The nine graduates are from the Kunama, Saho, Afar and Nara nationalities, and 
have known each other and experienced much hardship over many years. <p>
As 
children of the independence struggle, they lost their families or were the 
children of fighters.<p>

They received their early education in the Revolution School, in classrooms 
carved into hillsides or camouflaged against Ethiopian bombing. In 1984, six of 
their classmates were killed in a bombing raid.<p>

As part of the mother-tongue teaching policy, the Education Ministry is 
writing the curriculum in the Saho, Kunama, Afar, Nara and Bilen languages - 
which is resulting in the languages being written down for the first time, 
using Romanisation.<p>

"We cannot find anyone, though, for the Hadendowa (Beja) language," says 
Kebede.<p>

As with the protesting Saho-speaking parents, some Hadendowa speakers advocate 
the use of Arabic for political and religious reasons. But Kebede says: "it is 
not practical for the children, who do not know it." <p>

Kebede says that one of the difficulties in convincing parents of the 
importance of mother-tongue teaching is that whereas during the liberation 
struggle EPLF fighters lived among the people, now government is more remote 
and less directly involved with people. <p>

Elementary education for rural children is, therefore, seen as being of great 
importance - not simply as providing some literacy and numeracy, but mainly as 
a way of delivering basic knowledge on hygiene, nutrition and health.<p>

Elementary enrolment has risen by 49 per cent since liberation, but 31 per 
cent of all students drop out or repeat classes. <p>

"We don't expect these rates to improve for some time, because living 
standards are so low," says Kebede. "In some communities girls are married 
before puberty, and children everywhere are needed to work. But we may consider 
giving food to counter poverty, and perhaps legislate against early marriages."

<H3>Cultural Dimensions of Development Policy Management: Editorial

</H3>



<P>

by <I>Stanley Please</I> 

<P>

Full text of an article from <I>DPMN Bulletin, 2(2) August 1994:

pages 2-3</I> </CENTER><HR>



<P>

&quot;Civilisations on the rise&quot; asserted the <I>Economist

</I>in a recent article, &quot;like to explain their economic

success not through some dreary shift in comparative advantage

or the pattern of technological change but by pointing to a set

of virtues unique to their culture. With the countries of East

Asia having scored one economic triumph after another for the

past two decades - and, by most guesses, set to do so for at least

another decade to come - some Asians&quot; continues the article,

'have begun proclaiming the superiority of 'Asian values' over

those of the West&quot;.

<P>

But how important are cultural values in determining the effectiveness

of development policy management.

<P>

All the contributors to this Bulletin argue that they are very

important indeed. Moreover one contributor, Daniel Etounga-Manguelle,

is convinced that they are at the heart of the failure of Africa

to develop institutions at both the micro and macro levels that

would be conducive to high rates of economic growth and poverty

alleviation.

<P>

Part of the reason for this unanimity lies in the concept and

definition of culture adopted by the contributors. This definition

goes well beyond a reference to artistic, literary, and architectural

creativity, education, and so on.

<P>

But how encompassing should the term be? Thierry Verhelst maintains

that the definition should, in effect, be an all-embracing one

although he warns about adopting too extreme an attitude. This

warning derives from his seeing culture in dynamic terms with

communities adapting their heritage to both internal and external

influences, in order to meet the &quot;challenges of their natural

and social environment&quot;. Thus culture is both determined

by and is a determinant of, individual and social behaviour.

<P>

To those who see the major weakness in African economic policy

since independence as deriving less from African culture and more

from the political power of those who gain from distorted policies

- the urban and non-agricultural sectors, the military, the employees

of inefficient state enterprises, and recipients of 'rent' incomes

from control and licensing systems - Verhelst's response is that

power relationships in political life are themselves a product

of society's culture.

<P>

But while the study of culture as a dynamic phenomenon might,

in one sense, explain everything about the success or failure

of a society to develop effective capacities for economic policy

management, in another sense it seems to explain very little in

terms of specifics. Certainly Verhelst gives no indication of

how cultural characteristics should or could be modified in order

to increase management capacity.

<P>

This shortcoming, however, is addressed head-on by Etounga-Manguelle.

He is confident that Africa is the 'sick child' of the developing

world because it has failed to recognise the weaknesses of some

of the practices and attitudes inherent in its cultural heritage.

It is these, he believes, &quot;which lie at the heart of the

institutional weaknesses of organisations in Africa&quot;. They

are &quot;fossilised standards and values&quot; which are imprisoning

Africa in an economic dilemma. While he accepts the Verhelst definition

and concept of culture, his emphasis is on the need to make culture

a tool for the improvement of economic management capacity at

both macro and micro levels.

<P>

Rejecting externally imposed changes such as &quot;structural

adjustment programmes&quot; imposed by the Bretton Woods institutions

as unsustainable, he asserts the need for internally designed

&quot;cultural adjustment programmes&quot;. Once again, as with

Verhelst, he maintains that programmes must be rooted in the cultural

history of society. But there must be a greater willingness to

reject or to modify those elements in this history which are impeding

African development.

<P>

But Etounga-Manguelle is not only a man of words. He is also a

man of action. He reports on programmes which his pan-African

organisation SADEG has already set in motion to contribute to

the 'cultural adjustment' which is required of Africans and of

African managers in order to improve the efficiency of their organisations.

He believes that experience is already demonstrating that 'cultural

adjustment' is not only necessary but eminently possible in Africa.

<P>

Julius Jeppe is equally convinced that the institutions and processes

of development policy management in South Africa will be affected

in major ways by the changeover in political power. These will

change to reflect the new dominance of Afrocentric culture with

its own distinctive characteristics compared with the Eurocentric

culture which has dominated in the past.

<P>

Already he sees signs of this change in the process by which the

ANC's Reconstruction and Development Policy document was formulated

as well as in its content, and also in many of the provisions

of the new South African Constitution. Both documents put emphasis

on the important roles of traditional communities and traditional

patterns of political power and processes. In these, consensus-building

is emphasised and the conflict and competitive characteristics

of western cultures are rejected.

<P>

Jeppe does not speculate what these changes imply for the future

quality of development policy management in South Africa. He is,

however, convinced that the impact will be pervasive on issues

such as land tenure, the development of an entrepreneurial and

risk-taking class and culture, and other critical elements in

the determination of economic policy and therefore of South Africa's

economic performance.

<P>

The term 'cultural dimensions of development policy management'

almost automatically focusses attention on the issues as they

arise in developing countries. Marinette Oomen emphasises the

error in this blinkered focus. The error is particularly important

in countries which are heavily dependent on flows of external

aid and technical assistance - most obviously African countries.

<P>

For these countries the cultural characteristics of donor countries

must be included in the concept. The aid relationship is not in

practice a partnership of equals. Both the content and style of

the relationship is donor-dominated.

<P>

More significantly, however, Oomen focusses on the narrower but

still very important issue of the culture which has developed

in the aid community -- in official aid agencies and NGO's and

in the agencies of donor and the recipient countries. Her analysis

and reflections are based in particular on a case study of Dutch

project aid in Mali.

<P>

Her paper makes uncomfortable reading with its suggestion of &quot;hidden

agendas&quot;, its concern over documents at all stages of the

project cycle being prepared by the Dutch and written in Dutch,

and its identification of documents which are supposed to define

project objectives, project achievements, and target groups, but

which seem more designed to mislead than to enlighten.

<P>

While she remains positive towards aid in general and Dutch aid

in particular, she believes all the talk about 'sustainability'

of projects and about beneficiaries 'owning' their projects and

programmes, will remain talk unless the weaknesses in the culture

of development assistance are modified along the lines of the

suggestions which emerge from her case study.

<P>

So where does this provocative discussion of cultural dimensions

of development policy management leave us? Should development

economists be pensioned-off and replaced in governments and in

aid agencies by students of culture -- presumably sociologists,

lawyers, anthropologists, political scientists, and historians?

<P>

Certainly, economists tend to view people around the world as

more alike than different; that they respond as individuals and

as groups in similar ways to market opportunities and to incentives

in terms of what they produce and purchase. Of course, 'similarity'

of responses does not mean 'identity' of responses. There is still

plenty of room for peoples' cultural characteristics and institutions

to play a role. But when it comes to policy-making, economists

believe - rightly or wrongly - that they focus on the most critical

and universal variables that determine individual, group and country

economic behaviour.

<P>

Moreover, for all the emphasis that contributors place on the

need for dynamism in a country's cultural characteristics if it

is to avoid economic stagnation and even decline, economists are

typically concerned that 'sensible' changes in policies and programmes

to generate growth and poverty reduction, will be resisted on

the grounds that the changes are not consistent with a country's

culture. This danger, as already noted, is of particular concern

where culture is defined to include powerful political interests

groups which have built up around distorted policies.

<P>

But these are questions which emerge from reflecting on the contributions

in the Bulletin in relation to policy management at the macro

level. At the micro level it is undoubtedly important that projects

and programmes are designed with the relevant cultural factors

playing a strong role. The litany of failed projects (e.g. the

'Wapenhans Report' on World Bank projects) which have often failed

due to the failure to note local cultural characteristics, is

just too long to be ignored.

<P>

Even at the micro level, however, reservations can be held about

too strong an attachment to the view that development must be

rooted in the culture of societies. Economic development necessarily

involves changing individual and group behaviour. With all respect

to Etounga-Manguelle's efforts and optimism, historically it has

at least to be noted that the dynamism which development required

has often, if not typically, come from non-indigenous and often

socially ostracised groups who do not have their 'roots' in the

country; the Jewish people in Europe, the Quakers and other non-conformists

in Great Britain, the Chinese in many east-Asian countries, the

Lebanese and Asians in various countries in Africa. In the United

States nobody had 'roots' in a traditional society except those

who were forcibly placed in reservations and were not permitted

to participate in the economic development process.

<P>

Verhelst and others can insist that: &quot;There can be no development

without roots&quot;. But it is equally valid to argue that &quot;there

can be no development if roots are too strong and inflexible&quot;

-- a proposition with which I do not believe any of the contributors,

including both Verhelst and Etounga-Manguelle, would disagree.

<center><h1>SANDS OF TIME ARE RUNNING OUT FOR GAMBIAN BEACHES</h1></center>

<i>The Gambia is shrinking, one grain of sand at a time. Gemini News Service 
reports how the hungry Atlantic Ocean and a recent building boom have combined 
to threaten the country's coastline, drinking water and important tourist trade.<p>


<b>By Rosemary Long,</b> a British freelance journalist who lives in 
The Gambia.</b><p>
<hr>




The Gambia, among the tiniest countries in Africa, gets smaller every day. 
Even the bones of its ancestors are literally being swallowed up by the sea.
A desperate attempt has begun to shore up the vital stretch of coastline that 
runs from one side of The Gambia's only stretch of dual carriageway to its 
island capital of Banjul.
The focal point, 500 metres long, is centred on the Muslim graveyard which for 
years has been crumbling into the sea - sending the remains of loved ones, in 
some cases, tumbling into the teeming Atlantic waves. <p>

Local people, exhorted by the Imams, gathered an impressive D250,000 towards a 
reclamation effort for which the total cost will be D2.5 million. On the launch 
day prayers were said at the beautiful but blemished site, and sea eagles, 
terns and gulls cried out like the souls of the dead.
Massive boulders in steel boxes will be lowered along the graveside coastline. 
But that leaves another 30  kilometres of The Gambia's coastline still at risk 
making it - as one observer said - a case of sticking a finger in a dyke while 
floods pour through on either side.
A United Nations Environmental Programme report considers The Gambia one of 
the world's 10 most vulnerable countries for a rise in sea levels.<p>

A scientific analysis of the situation shows that this could mean anything 
from a three per cent loss of land (if sea level rises 50 cm) to a loss of 
seven per cent of land (with a sea level rise of 150 cm) over the next 15 years.
Swamp rice cultivation areas, herbaceous steppes and grass savanna would 
suffer most - with up to 60 per cent land losses. There would also be a 
dramatic decrease in swamp cultivation, increased saltwater intrusion, a 
"drowning" of mangrove forests and extra sedimentation on the river bed.
Environmentalist Geir Tyldum anticipates that Banjul - already two metres 
below sea level - could be largely under water by the year 2000. Salt water 
intrusion could affect crops and cattle. Supplies of fresh drinking water in 
heavily-populated areas could be at risk.
The Gambia barely covers 10,000 square kilometres of land and the  population 
in the coastal urban areas is soaring.<p>


Population expert Mary Fowlis Yamuah reveals that Kombo St Mary, the division 
which includes much of the residential, tourist, business and commerce areas 
had fewer than 4,000 people in 1973. By 1993 the figure was more than 228,000. 
Nearby Western Division has increased its population by more than 70 per cent 
in 10 years.<p>

The ground under their feet is in danger of being eaten away. The Palm Grove 
Hotel had its bar washed away a few years ago. Radio Syd, one of the country's 
two commercial radio stations, and a local Boy Scouts office have both suffered 
damage. Beaches along the prime tourist area of Bakau grow narrower every year. 
Where there were wide stretches of sand are now craggy outcroppings.
A fisheries project in Bakau now includes a solid concrete slab wall to stop a 
neighbouring mission house and clinic from tumbling down on top of the 
fishery's new freezing and processing plants. Local women complain of water 
flooding the smoking houses where fish is cured for sale.
"Sometimes we are ankle-deep in water and cannot smoke our fish," said one 
woman.
Further south is the top tourist beach flanking the main hotels and sweeping 
spectacularly down to nearby fishing villages. There, too, the sand is being 
swallowed.<p>

The predator is not just the ever-hungry Atlantic Ocean. Sand-mining has been 
adding to the despoliation of the shoreline. In the past five years it has 
increased dramatically, with a rapid rise in the use of concrete to build 
houses and a series of big government projects.
A beach which once sloped almost imperceptibly towards the water from the 
largest hotels and valuable Bijilo Forest Park, now slopes sharply - with new 
drops at every spring tide.
The mining was moved from the prime hotel areas down to the picturesque area 
between Bijilo and Brufut villages, where dark grey mud has replaced large 
tracts of golden sand.<p>

The previous government of Sir Dawda Jawara endlessly promised to "look at" 
the situation, and for a while, limited the number of truckloads to 50 per day.
Since the military government of Yahya Jammeh took over last July the 
situation has deteriorated, with no apparent attempt to limit the destruction.
Now some 200 truckloads are said to be taken daily, with drivers thundering 
through peaceful village and bush areas at the dead of night in order to avoid 
paying the council tax on their mining, which applies only during working hours.
Tourists and columnists have often written to the local papers about how their 
pleasant beach walks are hampered by roaring, smoking lorries.
Plans are now said to be afoot to move the sand-mining to Kartong, a 
gloriously unspoiled area in the most southern of the country adjacent to the 
Senegalese border, but some conservationists have called for it to be kept as 
an area of natural beauty.<p>

The UN and the Ministry of Agriculture and Natural Resources are studying the 
situation, considering alternative building materials and recommending more 
tree-planting to hold the land.  <p>

<H3>Institutional and Managerial Requirements at the National

Level<BR> for Effective Regional Cooperation: Editorial</H3>



<P>

by <I>Stanley Please</I> 

<P>

Full text of an article from <I>DPMN Bulletin, 2(1) April 1994:

page 2</I> </CENTER><HR>



<P>

Development policy management as a subject of study has been established

over the past decade to address the question of <I>how</I> policies

are formulated and implemented as opposed to the question of <I>what

</I>policies should be pursued. The subject of regional cooperation

and integration in Africa certainly cries out for study in this

context.

<P>

There is now little controversy about the desirability of greater

regional cooperation and integration as an objective of policy.

Even the World Bank has moved from an attitude of scepticism,

or even of hostility, to one of support. Yet the most persistent

and enthusiastic proponents of greater cooperation as both a political

goal and as a means for stimulating economic growth, are despondent

over the achievements since independence. So the critical question

becomes not <I>what </I>to achieve but <I>how </I>to achieve the

objective.

<P>

The broad message which emerges from the contributions to this

issue of the Bulletin is that <I>top-down </I>decisions emerging

from regional institutions will represent little more than the

posturing of politicians and the pious hopes of regional bureaucrats

unless national institutions and administrative processes are

adapted to ensure that regional policies and programmes are integrated

into national decision-making -- i.e. unless it also becomes a

<I>bottom-up </I>process.

<P>

But the contributors do not add to the tale of woe on regional

cooperation. On the contrary, limited and qualified success stories

are reported on from Southern Africa (Goodison and Nee), from

West Africa (Deme), and from the Cross Border Initiative in Eastern

and Southern Africa and the Indian Ocean (Mansoor). All these

have required the effective involvement of <I>bottom-up </I>actors

-- national ministries, public agencies, the private sector. This

is also the lesson which is provided by non-African experience,

represented in this Bulletin by Stronck's account of Luxembourg's

experience as a member of European regional bodies.

<P>

However, beyond their importance to the discussion of regional

cooperation and integration on which the contributions speak for

themselves, these contributions also raise wider issues relating

to the content and methodology of development policy management

as a subject of study. Two issues are of particular importance.

<P>

First is the point made strongly by Senghor that institutional

development as part of development policy management, must be

seen as a 'process'. It has to be recognised that governments

only have a limited political capacity in any period of time to

address major policy issues, that administrative structures and

processes can only be changed progressively over time, and that

society more generally has only a limited capacity or willingness

to adapt to changes in the policy and institutional environment

in which firms, farmers, workers, consumers, and others have to

live and operate. Thus because everything cannot be done at once,

the critical policy issue is the 'sequencing' of actions.

<P>

The emphasis on sequencing in the study of institutional development

parallels what has taken place in the study of economic policy

reform. This now concentrates less on the objectives and content

of reform programmes. No longer is there much questioning of the

importance of disciplined macro financial policies, of markets

and prices of an active private sector and a more efficient public

sector, of programmes to help the poor and to develop human resources.

We are all structural adjusters now!

<P>

Instead the emphasis of scholars and policy-makers is on the speed

and sequencing of reform measures. Can expenditure on human resource

services be modified before the production underpinnings of the

economy have been reformed and stimulated? Should uneconomic public

enterprises be wound up or sold off before the conditions are

in place for private sector enterprises being established. And

a host of other questions of sequencing.

<P>

Senghor's paper invites the question of whether the subject of

public administration has generated any comparable conceptual

framework upon which the emerging subject of development policy

management can be built. Or has it tended to concentrate on 'ideal'

or 'optimal' institutional structures and administrative processes

at the expense of the process through which these objectives can

be achieved?

<P>

The second conceptual issue which is important for the advance

of development policy management as a separate subject within

the social sciences is the need for tentative hypotheses to be

derived from historical and descriptive studies and for these

hypotheses in their turn to be tested against further studies

of experience. For instance: 

<UL>

<LI>No changes in institutional arrangements will effectively

advance regional cooperation without the participation of civil

society. 

</UL>



<P>



<UL>

<LI>In the pervasive African situation of crisis-management of

economic policy, no institutional or policy changes to achieve

the longer term objectives of regional cooperation are possible

in the absence of donor willingness to bear the short-run costs

and to supplement local administrative capacity.

</UL>



<P>



<UL>

<LI>Any major new and qualitatively significant addition to government

objectives (e.g. regional cooperation, environmental objectives,

role of women) cannot be immediately absorbed as part of the existing

policy-making and implementation bureaucracy, but requires a separate

and high profile addition to this bureaucracy.

</UL>



<P>



<P>

Maybe these and other similar hypotheses and questions should

be the subject of further and differently focussed papers. However

it must be said in all frankness, that unless the experiences

of scholars and practitioners can be brought to test hypotheses

and to raise new hypotheses, then the emerging subject of development

policy management will be in danger of failing to generate any

credibility as a scientific discipline. The subject does not have

to become prescriptive -- and certainly not arrogantly prescriptive

as is so widely true of economics. But it must move beyond description

and beyond treating each case as a unique problem-solving exercise.

<B>Italy's development aid reached the level of other industrial countries only in the 1980s. It serves as

an instrument of foreign policy, suffers from a hardly efficient

bureaucracy and is tied strongly to procurement. Italy's

former colonies in the Horn of Africa are given priority in

regional distribution.</B>

<P>

Italy's development policy was very limited until 1979. Its ODA

share of GNP in that year was only 0.08 per cent. There was almost

no bilateral cooperation. In 1978, multilateral cooperation reached

a highwater mark of 94 per cent of ODA. Private transfers far

outweighed ODA inputs. And in 1979, the multilateral sector, in

which mostly private export credits predominated, accounted for

more than 81 per cent of Italy's total disbursements to the developing

countries. In the 1950s and 1960s, the only bilateral cooperation

with systematic approaches was with Somalia.

<P>

<B>Extent of aid</B>

<P>

Starting from last place in a 1979 comparison of the industrial

countries' aid (DAC statistics), Italy had by 1986 achieved in

several steps an ODA-GNP share of 0.40 per cent, and thus exceeded

the DAC average. In 1989, in the context of the G7 leading industrial

countries' aid, Italy posted an 0.42 per cent ODA-GNP share to

take third place after France and Canada and ahead of Germany.

In 1990 and 1991, however, Italy's aid dropped sharply to ODA-GNP

shares of 0.31 per cent and 0.30 per cent respectively. The latter

percentage was also recorded in 1993. In general, Italy has since

1986 made efforts to position its development aid disbursements

in the middle of the G7 countries, while by OECD comparison it

has come only in 15th place.

<P>

Tables 1 and 2 make clear the growth in Italy's cooperation with

the developing countries since the mid1980s. Budget appropriations

have increased continually since then prom 3,629 billion Lire

in 1985 to 5,210 billion Lire in 1992, a plus of 43 per cent).

It was not until 1993 that appropriations dropped sharply by 47

per cent to only 2,775 billion Lire. While forward commitments

were immediately slashed by 40 per cent, the disbursement volume

covering those of the previous years was still maintained at a

relatively stable level (minus 11 per cent to 4,155 billion Lire).

<P>

Noticeable in the tables are the in part strong fluctuations which

point to certain weaknesses. The multilateral payments increased

from US$ 317 million in 1985 to US$ 1,424 million in 1989, dropped

distinctly in 1990/91, then rose again. Italy's 1993 Budget, which

made sharp inroads into development cooperation funds, led in

particular to a disastrous cutback in bilateral commitments. They

were slashed from 1,504 billion Lire to 339 billion Lire, and

resulted in a clear reduction of Italy's bilateral cooperation

with the paesi <I>in via di sviluppo </I>(lit.: countries on the

way to development).

<P>

<B>Legal bases and organizational structures</B>

<P>

Italy's Law No.49 of 1987, which still applies, created the base

for modern development cooperation according to international

standards.

<P>

The law's most important standards include the guidelines on the

<I>Fondo rotativo </I>(Fund for credit allocation) and the <I>Fondo

di cooperazione, </I>the central financing fund of Italy's development

policy (allocation of subsidies). According to these terms of

reference, the country's development policy is a <i>parte integrante</i>

(integral part) of its foreign policy, serves the realization

of human rights, and observes the principles of the UN as well

as the EU's Lom&eacute; Agreement. The development cooperation

goals include satisfying basic needs, as well as food security,

which are to be achieved by drawing up multi sector programmes

with a time frame of several years.

<P>

Besides studies, planning and integrated development projects,

Italy's development cooperation consists of all forms of FC, training

and qualification of staff, and cooperation with NGOs. The law

also identified possible sectors of cooperation: agriculture,

education, trade, appropriate technologies, and information. The

<I>interventi straordinari </I>(extraordinary measures) provided

for cover above all aid missions in regions of need, i.e. food

supplies to famine areas and the provision of basic infrastructure

in rural areas.

<P>

<I>The Direzione generale per la cooperazione allo sviluppo,

DGCS </I>(the Head Office in the MAE, the foreign office) is responsible

for the practical implementation of development cooperation. It

has a certain financial autonomy as it has its own auditing office,

and non tied budget funds of one fiscal year can be carried forward

to the next. 

<P>

The Ministry of Finance also has development policy competences,

as it is responsible for looking after relations with international

banks and development funds.

<P>

<B>Regional focal points</B>

<P>

In 1992, the CICS gave a total of 20 countries tries the status of

<I>prima priorit&agrave;, </I>which meant they were to receive

a total of up to 75 per cent of available funds. They were  Angola,

Ethiopia, Mozambique, Somalia and Tanzania in Black Africa; Algeria,

Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia in North Africa; China and the Philippines

in Asia; and Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia and Peru in Latin

America.

<P>

A second category of countries (<I>seconda priorit&agrave;</i>), which

with Italy cooperates in key areas, is made up of Turkey, Djibouti,

Kenya, Senegal, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Jordan, Yemen, India, Pakistan,

Vietnam, Brazil, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Jamaica, Guatemala, Nicaragua,

the Dominican Republic, Uruguay and Venezuela.

<P>

Italy continues to concentrate strongly on selected LDCs with

which it has traditional, good, historic and cultural links (<i>vincoli

storici</i>). Above all, this means Eritrea, Ethiopia and Somalia

in the Horn of Africa. But over the years the intensifying of

cooperation with Latin American countries (&quot;young democracies&quot;

in Argentina and Chile) and, on account of security interests,

the Mediterranean region, has gained in importance.

<P>

Table 3 shows the geographical distribution of Italy s disbursements

(subsidies and credits) in recent years. While payments to African

and Latin American countries dropped, and cooperation with European

and Mediterranean region countries remained relatively stable

at a low and high level respectively, development cooperation

with countries in the Asian-Pacific region was expanded strongly.

The latter are above all China, Indonesia, Pakistan and the Philippines.

<P>

<B>Sectoral focal points</B>

<P>

The sectoral distribution of Italian development cooperation is

made in a very differentiated way, depending on the financing

mechanisms used. While agriculture and, correspondingly, food

production in the developing countries is the most important sector

for subsidies (<i>Fondo di cooperazione</I>), energy is the priority

sector for credit allocation (<i>Fondo di rotazione</i>). In the

agricultural sector, the concept of <I>sviluppo rurale integrale

 </I>(integrated rural development) plays a leading role. In the

energy sector, the focal point is the development of energy plans

aimed at the optimal use of existing regional and local resources.

<P>

Other priority sectors include industrial projects to support

infrastructure, and education and public health. The education

sector was given a <I>priorit&agrave; a taglio orrizonta</I>

(horizontal priority) early on. For Italy saw the available potential

of human capital as a basis for the development of the respective

country. Cooperation with the universities in the developing countries

thereby plays an important role. The most significant example

of that was the establishment of the National University in Somalia

in 1969.

<P>

Environmental protection and participation of women in development

cooperation are among the more recent fields of Italian development

policy. The former was also assigned a horizontal priority, with

concentration on agriculture, infrastructure and industry.

<P>

Right from the start, another important area of Italian sectoral

development assistance was food security and disaster aid. The

<I>Fondo aiuti italiani</I> (FAI) was created by Law No. 73 of

March 1985 and was initially to function for only 18 months. It's

a special instrument for <I>interventi straordinari </I>in a limited

number of countries (above all in Africa). Its goal is to implement

integrated programmes for self sufficiency in agricultural produce

(<i>agroalimentare</i>), and improve hygiene and sanitation conditions

in the public health sector. Criticism of Italy's development

policy was sparked by its tied aid and duplication of administrative

structures. Reintegration into normal development cooperation

work did not take place until Law 49/87 was passed. In 1993, Italy

spent almost 200 billion Lire on food production and disaster

aid. The key areas were in Africa (Somalia and Eritrea) and South-East

Europe (Bosnia and Croatia).

<p>



<B>Peculiarities of allocation policy</B>

<P>

A reason for the unsatisfactory development of the bilateral cooperation

instrument lies in the insufficient building up of the so called

<I>Unit&agrave; tecniche centrale </I>(UTC) in the MAE. It is

true that under Law 49/87 the unit was a main object of the reform

carried out at that time and was to be the implementation level

within the DGCS. But it was not operational until the beginning

of the 1990s. The patronage system hindered the filling of the

120 planned positions (The newspaper <I>La Repubblica</i>, April

16, 1988). The Head Office also had to award the supervision and

monitoring of TC which, according to Law 49/87 (Art.12 and 13),

were actually the task of the UTC in the ministry and on site,

to the private company <I>Societ&agrave; italiana di monitoraggio

(SiM) </I>.

<P>

When it comes to tying bilateral ODA to procurement, Italy is

among the leaders on the DAC league table. It's been first or

second since 1985. In 1989, the tied element of Italy's bilateral

ODA was 58.4 per cent. The tying is determined by the CICS. It

rules that goods and services may be bought in other developing

countries (South-South trade) or other industrial countries (possible

advantages due to absence of transport costs), only when they

are not available in Italy (CICS decision of September 8, 1987).

<P>

Italy's multilateral aid stands out for its high share of payments

to the European Union, which often account for more than one third

of its total multilateral disbursements. Among the international

banks and funds, a clear preference for the International Development

Association can be noted. The IDA share accounts for an average

of about one fifth of the multilateral inputs, posting in 1989

a top value of 35.7 per cent. A more important aspect of multilateral

aid is the continual increase in payments to other UN organizations

(about one sixth of total disbursements), and other international

development banks (about one eighth). With these mostly voluntary

multilateral contributions, Italy has developed into a kind of

leader that is more and more frequently called in to carry out

coordination functions in international development policy.

<P>

In Italy, this form of cooperation is highly regarded, and because

of its particular importance has been adopted in developmental

terminology as <I>multibilateral development aid</I>. The multibilateral

development policy, whose basic structure is to be seen as multilateral

in realization and implementation (through an international development

aid agency), and bilateral in alignment (benefiting one developing

country), features a coupling and mixing of several developmental

processes.

<P>

The multibilateral cooperation arose through Italian offers to

multilateral organizations and the latter's requests for co financing.

That boosted the organizations' liquidity and capacities for development

cooperation. For the Italian side, the voluntary financial inputs

enable it to assert not only its own sectoral and geographical

priorities, but also to tie aid strongly to procurement.

<P>

In assessing this form of development cooperation, it must be

noted that some positive aspects can be seen. In a comprehensive

study, Sergio Marchiso proved that the crisis of international

organizations engaged in multilateral cooperation had compelled

them to seek new sources of finance. But this doesn't mean their

autonomy is encroached upon, because it's a matter of additional,

voluntary inputs of the donor countries. Another plus point is

that many projects and programmes which a country could not perhaps

have implemented alone can be realized by co financing.

<P>

However, a critical argument must focus first of all on the motivation

for this particular form of development cooperation. The starting

point was the possibility, also in multilateral terms, of &quot;controlling&quot;

financial contributions in a certain way, and thereby ensuring

that national economic interests as well as developmental considerations

were taken into account. In this respect, a conflict of interests

is not inevitable, but certainly entirely possible. Moreover,

and Italy uses these opportunities intensively, bilateral cooperation

enables aid to be tied to procurement.

<P>

<B>More recent developments</B>

<P>

Since the passing of Law 49/87 which created the legislative base

for modern development cooperation, a number of measures have

addressed inefficiencies in Italy's development policy. On the

one hand, the latter are due to deplorably low staffing (in 1993

the Head Office of development cooperation in the MAE had a staff

of about 550). And on the other, there is heavy criticism of a

lack of economic expertise in assessing the profitability of individual

projects and drawing up country programmes. More than half of

all administrative proceedings must still be handled by external

experts.

<P>

A report in 1993 by a special commission headed by the then Foreign

Minister, Emilio Colombo, used harsh words in criticizing the

deficiencies in Italy's development cooperation. The body slammed

the lack of country programmes, misuse of funds for extraordinary

measures, insufficient use of the competitive tender system, the

shortage of administrative staff, insufficient monitoring and

evaluation mechanisms, and inadequate decision making structures

due to insufficient competences and responsibilities. Corrective

measures being taken in the meantime are focusing on improving

technical assessment within the DGCS, gradually adapting the tender

procedure to that of the EU, and new end-of-project evaluation processes.

<P>

At the end of 1993 the organizational structure was radically

changed. Law 537/93 scrapped the CICS, and its competences were

transferred to the Inter ministerial Committee for Economic Planning

(CIPE) and the MAE. That was a far reaching move to dismantle duplicate

administrative structures.

<P>

<H4>1. L'&eacute;volution des motivations politiques de l'Europe

&agrave; l'&eacute;gard des pays en d&eacute;veloppement</H4>

<P>

La politique communautaire de coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement

trouve ses origines dans l'association des Pays et Territoires

d'Outre-Mer &agrave; la Communaut&eacute; d&egrave;s 1957, &agrave;

l'issue d'un compromis entre les Etats membres favorables &agrave;

une approche mondiale du d&eacute;veloppement, et les Etats membres

favorables &agrave; une relation Europe-Afrique privil&eacute;gi&eacute;e.



<P>

L'association a &eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;ue comme une approche

globale, couvrant &agrave; la fois le r&eacute;gime commercial

et l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement. 

<P>

Apr&egrave;s les cinq premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es du r&eacute;gime

d'association pr&eacute;vu par le Trait&eacute;, de nombreux pays

avaient acc&eacute;d&eacute; &agrave; l'ind&eacute;pendance, et

les motivations de la coop&eacute;ration n'avaient pas fondamentalement

chang&eacute;. Les pays europ&eacute;ens, dans un esprit de solidarit&eacute;

et soucieux d'assumer leurs responsabilit&eacute;s, pr&eacute;occup&eacute;s

aussi de pr&eacute;server leurs int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts &eacute;conomiques

et g&eacute;o-politiques dans le contexte de la guerre froide,

et les jeunes Etats ind&eacute;pendants, d&eacute;sireux de continuer

&agrave; b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

commerciales et des financements de projets de d&eacute;veloppement,

ont d&egrave;s lors d&eacute;cid&eacute; de poursuivre leurs relations

de coop&eacute;ration dans le cadre des deux conventions successives

de Yaound&eacute; (1963-69 et 1969-74), qui s'inscrivaient dans

la continuit&eacute; directe de l'association. Au cours de cette

p&eacute;riode euro-africaine 1957-1974, l'aide europ&eacute;enne

s'est essentiellement concentr&eacute;e sur l'Afrique noire francophone.

<P>

Au milieu des ann&eacute;es soixante-dix, le contexte international,

le souhait de plusieurs Etats membres de d&eacute;velopper une

politique mondiale de coop&eacute;ration, ainsi que l'adh&eacute;sion

du Royaume-Uni &agrave; la Communaut&eacute;, sont autant d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments

qui ont induit une profonde r&eacute;orientation de la politique

communautaire de coop&eacute;ration. Les pr&eacute;occupations

europ&eacute;ennes li&eacute;es au premier choc p&eacute;trolier,

&agrave; savoir la peur de manquer de mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res

et le souci de pr&eacute;server des march&eacute;s ext&eacute;rieurs

privil&eacute;gi&eacute;s, se sont ajout&eacute;es aux int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts

g&eacute;o-strat&eacute;giques et au sentiment de responsabilit&eacute;

d&eacute;coulant du pass&eacute; colonial qui pr&eacute;valait

encore largement, pour motiver le premier accord de partenariat

entre la Communaut&eacute; et les pays ACP.

<P>

C'est ainsi que la premi&egrave;re convention de Lom&eacute; sign&eacute;e

en 1975 a &eacute;t&eacute; ouverte aux pays africains du Commonwealth,

et &agrave; quelques pays des Cara&iuml;bes et du Pacifique, ainsi

qu'&agrave; d'autres pays d'Afrique sub-saharienne d&eacute;sireux

de se joindre &agrave; cette premi&egrave;re n&eacute;gociation

de groupe &agrave; groupe, qui, au total, a concern&eacute; quarante-six

pays ACP.

<P>

Dans le m&ecirc;me temps, l'Europe s'engageait dans une politique

de coop&eacute;ration avec d'autres r&eacute;gions du monde. Les

premiers accords de coop&eacute;ration avec des pays tiers de

la r&eacute;gion m&eacute;diterran&eacute;enne comportant un volet

commercial et une coop&eacute;ration financi&egrave;re et technique

ont &eacute;t&eacute; conclus &agrave; partir de 1975, et une

politique d'aide aux pays en d&eacute;veloppement d'Am&eacute;rique

latine et d'Asie a d&eacute;but&eacute;, qui s'est progressivement

d&eacute;velopp&eacute;e et structur&eacute;e au cours des ann&eacute;es

quatre-vingt et quatre vingt dix.

<P>

L'importance croissante de l'aide alimentaire b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiant

largement &agrave; des pays situ&eacute;s dans d'autres r&eacute;gions

que l'Afrique noire, a &eacute;galement refl&eacute;t&eacute;

le processus de mondialisation de la politique communautaire de

coop&eacute;ration &agrave; partir des ann&eacute;es soixante-dix.

<P>

<H4>2. Depuis 1975, des adaptations successives dans un cadre demeur&eacute;

inchang&eacute;</H4>

<P>

La premi&egrave;re convention de Lom&eacute; a constitu&eacute;

&agrave; l'&eacute;poque, un mod&egrave;le unique de coop&eacute;ration

internationale. Le principe du partenariat a &eacute;t&eacute;

au coeur des Conventions qui ont li&eacute; l'UE et les pays ACP

depuis 1975. Il traduit une conception de la coop&eacute;ration

bas&eacute;e sur des engagements mutuels en vue de la r&eacute;alisation

d'objectifs communs. Des principes tels que la n&eacute;gociation

globale (de groupe &agrave; groupe, et portant sur plusieurs volets

de coop&eacute;ration), le dialogue avec chaque Etat ACP dans

le cadre d'institutions paritaires, la contractualit&eacute; et

la pr&eacute;visibilit&eacute; des ressources d'aide disponibles,

sont devenus le fondement de la politique europ&eacute;enne de

coop&eacute;ration dans le cadre des accords de Lom&eacute;.

<P>

Les conventions successives ont permis aux partenaires d'adapter

les objectifs et les instruments de la coop&eacute;ration, sans

pour autant jamais remettre en cause ni le cadre global ni la

strat&eacute;gie poursuivie. Ces adaptations ont n&eacute;anmoins

permis de tirer concr&egrave;tement et progressivement les le&ccedil;ons

des succ&egrave;s et des &eacute;checs du pass&eacute;, et de

traduire, en partie du moins, l'&eacute;volution intervenue dans

la philosophie du d&eacute;veloppement. La politique de coop&eacute;ration

dans le cadre de Lom&eacute; a ainsi progressivement &eacute;t&eacute;

r&eacute;orient&eacute;e pour tenir compte: 

<P>

<UL>

<LI>de la conception du r&ocirc;le de l'Etat, autrefois consid&eacute;r&eacute;

comme le seul capable de mobiliser les ressources en capital n&eacute;cessaires

au d&eacute;veloppement &eacute;conomique, et d&eacute;sormais

centr&eacute; sur l'&eacute;tablissement et le maintien d'un cadre

l&eacute;gal et administratif qui garantisse les droits et les

libert&eacute;s fondamentales, qui soit capable d'assurer les

services sociaux essentiels et qui soit favorable au d&eacute;veloppement

de l'initiative priv&eacute;e. La nature de la convention n'a

cependant pas &eacute;t&eacute; remise en cause, l'Etat demeurant

pratiquement le seul partenaire dans la relation de coop&eacute;ration,

hormis des co-financements avec les ONG depuis 1976 et un nombre

limit&eacute; d'actions de coop&eacute;ration d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e

initi&eacute;es sous Lom&eacute; IV;

<P>

 <LI>du passage d'une conception de l'industrialisation bas&eacute;e

sur la substitution &agrave; l'importation, &agrave; une conception

ax&eacute;e sur le d&eacute;veloppement de l'exportation comme

moteur de la croissance.

</UL>

<P>

L'accent a de plus en plus &eacute;t&eacute; mis sur le dialogue

sur les politiques, introduit &agrave; la suite du &quot;M&eacute;morandum

Pisani&quot;, pour favoriser le passage d'une aide essentiellement

accord&eacute;e sous la forme de financement de projets, &agrave;

un appui technique et financier aux politiques sectorielles.

<P>

Parmi les innovations qui ont conf&eacute;r&eacute; &agrave; la

convention de Lom&eacute; un caract&egrave;re de pionnier, l'introduction

d'instruments comme les m&eacute;canismes de compensation des

pertes de recettes d'exportation dans les ann&eacute;es 1970 et

plus r&eacute;cemment, en 1990, une approche n&eacute;goci&eacute;e

sur l'ajustement structurel, ont, ind&eacute;pendemment de leur

pertinence pour l'avenir, constitu&eacute; la traduction op&eacute;rationnelle

de la pens&eacute;e du moment sur le d&eacute;veloppement. Parall&egrave;lement

&agrave; la fin du conflit Est/ Ouest, la Convention a aussi &eacute;t&eacute;

l'un des premiers accords de coop&eacute;ration comportant une

dimension politique explicite par l'introduction d'une clause

relative au respect des droits de l'homme, &eacute;tendue depuis

1995 &agrave; l'application des principes d&eacute;mocratiques,

&agrave; la consolidation de l'Etat de droit et &agrave; la bonne

gestion des affaires publiques.

<P>

Les am&eacute;nagements de la conditionnalit&eacute; sous Lom&eacute;

IV r&eacute;vis&eacute;e et le principe d'une programmation en

deux tranches qui limite le caract&egrave;re automatique des allocations

d'aide programmable, refl&egrave;tent &eacute;galement un changement

important dans la conception de la politique communautaire de

coop&eacute;ration. 

<P>

<H4>3. La n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de revoir le cadre g&eacute;n&eacute;ral</H4>

<P>

A l'approche du 21&egrave;me si&egrave;cle, la politique de coop&eacute;ration

de l'UE vis-&agrave;-vis des pays ACP devra &ecirc;tre reformul&eacute;e

sur des bases nouvelles, non seulement pour tenir compte de l'&eacute;volution

des conditions &eacute;conomiques et politiques du d&eacute;veloppement

et du d&eacute;veloppement rapide intervenant dans d'autres r&eacute;gions

du monde, mais aussi parce que les motivations europ&eacute;ennes

ont fondamentalement chang&eacute;. La p&eacute;riode coloniale

et post-coloniale est r&eacute;volue et un environnement international

politiquement plus ouvert permet d'&eacute;tablir de mani&egrave;re

moins ambigu&euml; les responsabilit&eacute;s de chaque partenaire.

C'est dans cette perspective qu'un regard critique sur la coop&eacute;ration

pass&eacute;e peut utilement orienter la r&eacute;flexion sur

le futur.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="ombr"><HR>B. Ombres et lumi&egrave;res de la coop&eacute;ration dans

le cadre de la Convention de Lom&eacute;</A></H3>

<P>

<H4>1. Un bilan global mitig&eacute;</H4>

<P>

Bien que la coop&eacute;ration repr&eacute;sente un apport important

pour un grand nombre de pays ACP, il est difficile d'en appr&eacute;cier

l'impact et l'efficacit&eacute; en termes d'am&eacute;lioration

des conditions &eacute;conomiques et sociales dans un pays. L'&eacute;volution

de ces conditions d&eacute;pend en effet d'un large &eacute;ventail

de facteurs exog&egrave;nes et endog&egrave;nes, &agrave; commencer

par la conduite des politiques &eacute;conomiques et sociales

par le pays lui-m&ecirc;me, que l'aide peut influencer mais &agrave;

laquelle elle ne peut durablement se substituer. 

<P>

Certaines analyses sugg&egrave;rent que l'aide allou&eacute;e

par l'ensemble des donateurs aux pays ACP a probablement eu un

impact positif mais faible sur la croissance, sur l'investissement

et sur l'am&eacute;lioration des indicateurs de sant&eacute;,

et que cet impact a &eacute;t&eacute; sensiblement variable d'un

pays &agrave; l'autre en fonction de la situation initiale et

des conditions de politique &eacute;conomique. L'aide a notamment

&eacute;t&eacute; nettement plus efficace dans les pays qui &eacute;taient

les moins favoris&eacute;s au d&eacute;part en termes de capital

et de ressources humaines, et dans les pays ayant engag&eacute;

des politiques de stabilisation et des programmes d'ajustement

structurel.

<P>

La coop&eacute;ration communautaire repr&eacute;sente une part

importante dans l'ensemble des appuis dont ont b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute;

les pays ACP depuis les ann&eacute;es soixante. La Communaut&eacute;

est aujourd'hui l'un des trois principaux fournisseurs d'aide

aux pays ACP, et accorde &agrave; ces pays le syst&egrave;me commercial

le plus pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel. Ind&eacute;niablement, la

Convention de Lom&eacute; a repr&eacute;sent&eacute; un cadre

unique de coop&eacute;ration entre deux groupes de pays. Ses principaux

avantages r&eacute;sident dans le fait qu'elle a constitu&eacute;

un v&eacute;ritable laboratoire de la coop&eacute;ration au d&eacute;veloppement,

qu'elle a permis de d&eacute;finir, dans un cadre n&eacute;goci&eacute;,

un ensemble de principes et d'objectifs partag&eacute;s, et qu'elle

a mobilis&eacute; des ressources financi&egrave;res importantes

et presqu'enti&egrave;rement concessionnelles sans lesquelles

de nombreuses r&eacute;alisations concr&egrave;tes n'auraient

pu voir le jour. Le caract&egrave;re pr&eacute;visible de la coop&eacute;ration

europ&eacute;enne, s'inscrivant dans une relation de partenariat

&agrave; long terme, &eacute;tait de nature &agrave; encourager

les gouvernements des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires &agrave;

aborder des transformations de longue dur&eacute;e.

<P>

A la lumi&egrave;re de vingt ann&eacute;es d'exp&eacute;rience,

la Convention apparait cependant comme un cadre ambitieux mais

pas toujours r&eacute;aliste, reposant sur l'hypoth&egrave;se

de capacit&eacute;s institutionnelles et politiques dans les pays

ACP qui ne se sont pas v&eacute;rifi&eacute;es. Ainsi le respect

de la souverainet&eacute; nationale, qui a initialement conduit

&agrave; pousser tr&egrave;s loin la confiance dans les gouvernements

b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, tend de plus en plus &agrave; &eacute;voluer

vers une logique guid&eacute;e par le souci d'efficacit&eacute;.

Le caract&egrave;re automatique de l'octroi d'une grande partie

des ressources financi&egrave;res a affaibli la port&eacute;e

politique de l'aide communautaire: il n'a pas encourag&eacute;

un v&eacute;ritable dialogue sur l'utilisation des ressources.

La conditionnalit&eacute; telle qu'elle est appliqu&eacute;e actuellement

et la politique de substitution qu'ont d'ailleurs tendance &agrave;

pratiquer tous les bailleurs de fonds, paraissent difficilement

compatibles avec l'engagement politique r&eacute;el que l'on attend

de la part des gouvernements des pays ACP, qui leur permettrait

de s'approprier effectivement les r&eacute;formes et les strat&eacute;gies

sectorielles, et d'en &ecirc;tre politiquement responsables devant

une opinion publique de plus en plus demandeuse de transparence

et de participation.

<P>

L'appr&eacute;ciation de l'exp&eacute;rience de la coop&eacute;ration

communautaire peut s'articuler autour de quelques questions fondamentales:

quelles ont &eacute;t&eacute; les principales difficult&eacute;s

auxquelles s'est heurt&eacute; le principe du partenariat? quelle

a &eacute;t&eacute; l'efficacit&eacute; de la coop&eacute;ration

financi&egrave;re et technique et quels sont les pays qui en ont

le plus b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute;? quel a &eacute;t&eacute;

l'impact des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales?

<P>

Les r&eacute;ponses &agrave; ces questions ne sont ni imm&eacute;diates,

ni univoques. Elles concernent &agrave; la fois des aspects politiques,

&eacute;conomiques et de gestion pratique de la coop&eacute;ration.

<P>

<H4>2. L'exp&eacute;rience du partenariat</H4>

<P>

Le principe du partenariat inscrit dans la convention de Lom&eacute;

a perdu de sa substance et ne s'est que partiellement concr&eacute;tis&eacute;.

Il a eu tendance &agrave; se limiter aux aspects institutionnels

de l'accord de coop&eacute;ration, et &agrave; une gestion commune

des ressources d'aide. 

<P>

En termes politiques, la d&eacute;pendance &agrave; l'&eacute;gard

de l'aide, les exigences du court terme et la gestion des situations

de crise ont progressivement domin&eacute; la relation entre les

deux partenaires. 

<P>

Au plan du dialogue sur les orientations de politiques &eacute;conomiques

et sectorielles, le partenariat s'est av&eacute;r&eacute; difficile

&agrave; r&eacute;aliser avec des pays pr&eacute;sentant de faibles

capacit&eacute;s institutionnelles et des syst&egrave;mes de gestion

publique souvent peu efficaces. La pratique de la conditionnalit&eacute;

a justifi&eacute; un retrait de responsabilit&eacute; de la part

des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, dans la mesure o&ugrave;

les conditions impos&eacute;es, li&eacute;es aux crit&egrave;res

appliqu&eacute;s par les institutions de Bretton Woods, ont pu

&ecirc;tre trop sp&eacute;cifiques, trop nombreuses ou trop formalistes.

Dans le souci d'am&eacute;liorer l'efficacit&eacute; des actions

de coop&eacute;ration, la Communaut&eacute; a eu tendance &agrave;

se substituer au partenaire d&eacute;faillant, en adoptant une

approche plus interventionniste difficilement compatible avec

la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;, pourtant reconnue, de favoriser l'appropriation

des processus de d&eacute;veloppement par les pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.

Dans le contexte d'une ouverture politique et d'une lib&eacute;ralisation

&eacute;conomique progressives, les acteurs non gouvernementaux,

repr&eacute;sentants du secteur priv&eacute; et d'autres segments

de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, ont, quant &agrave; eux, manifest&eacute;

leur int&eacute;r&ecirc;t croissant &agrave; participer de mani&egrave;re

directe &agrave; une relation de coop&eacute;ration dont ils se

sont, &agrave; l'exception des ONG, sentis exclus. 

<P>

Au plan de la pratique de la coop&eacute;ration, certaines rigidit&eacute;s

li&eacute;es &agrave; la structure des instruments et aux proc&eacute;dures

de la gestion commune des ressources, ont limit&eacute; la capacit&eacute;

d'assurer que les actions de coop&eacute;ration traduisent effectivement

les priorit&eacute;s des politiques. 

<P>

<H4>3. L'&eacute;valuation des politiques de coop&eacute;ration</H4>

<P>

Depuis 1990, faisant suite aux dispositions adopt&eacute;es par

le Conseil sur l'&eacute;valuation des instruments et programmes

d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE, une s&eacute;rie d'&eacute;tudes

d'&eacute;valuation ont &eacute;t&eacute; engag&eacute;es, concernant

des projets, des secteurs d'intervention, des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires

ou portant sur des instruments d&eacute;termin&eacute;s. Ces &eacute;valuations,

qui concernent l'ensemble des politiques de coop&eacute;ration

communautaires et pas seulement la coop&eacute;ration avec les

ACP, ont permis d'identifier des mesures concr&egrave;tes pour

am&eacute;liorer l'efficacit&eacute; et l'impact de l'aide communautaire

et de corriger un certain nombre de faiblesses.

<TR><TD>

<B>Note:</B> ces crit&egrave;res correspondent globalement aux crit&egrave;res d&eacute;finis par le    

Comit&eacute; d'Aide au D&eacute;veloppement de l'OCDE, lors de l'&eacute;laboration des         

&quot;Principes pour une aide efficace&quot;. La particularit&eacute; de l'approche de la    

Commission est de mettre l'accent sur les &eacute;l&eacute;ments du contexte, son         

&eacute;volution dans le temps et ses cons&eacute;quences pour le d&eacute;roulement du          

programme d'aide. Le crit&egrave;re de pertinence par exemple tient compte des     

politiques du gouvernement, des interventions des autres donateurs, etc.    

L'efficacit&eacute; se mesure non seulement en fonction des r&eacute;sultats escompt&eacute;s    

et de la situation des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, mais aussi en fonction des &eacute;ventuels  

r&eacute;sultats impr&eacute;vus. L'efficience n'est pas seulement une question           

d'analyse co&ucirc;ts/b&eacute;n&eacute;fices mais est aussi fonction du cadre d'organisation,  

de gestion et de suivi. Enfin, le crit&egrave;re d'impact ne se limite pas aux     

aspects quantitatifs mais inclut aussi des aspects qualitatifs.             

<P>

pris en compte les &eacute;l&eacute;ments du contexte physique et politique, au niveau    

g&eacute;n&eacute;ral (politiques macro-&eacute;conomiques et sectorielles) et plus sp&eacute;cifique   

(diagnostic du probl&egrave;me, b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires et acteurs du projet). Les           

politiques (explicites et implicites) de l'ensemble des intervenants        

(gouvernements, l'UE, les autres bailleurs de fonds et les groupes

budg&eacute;taires mis en oeuvre; (ii) une analyse du cadre d'organisation         

g&eacute;n&eacute;rale et sp&eacute;cifique du projet (programmation des activit&eacute;s, calendrier,  

gestion financi&egrave;re, assistance technique, etc); (iii) une appr&eacute;ciation des  

m&eacute;thodes d'intervention (degr&eacute; d'implication des b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, importance

</TABLE>

</CENTER>

<P>

L'&eacute;valuation globale de l'ensemble des programmes et instruments

de la politique d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement de l'UE, d&eacute;cid&eacute;e

par le Conseil en juin 1995, est encore en cours. Il est cependant

d'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; possible de d&eacute;gager un certain

nombre d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments d'appr&eacute;ciation &agrave;

partir des &eacute;tudes sectorielles ou g&eacute;ographiques

disponibles.

<P>

Parmi les conclusions des &eacute;valuations, il convient de distinguer

entre ce qui rel&egrave;ve des am&eacute;liorations et adaptations

susceptibles d'intervenir dans le cadre actuel, et ce qui remet

en cause ce cadre ou ses principes fondamentaux, traduisant ainsi

les faiblesses de la convention de Lom&eacute; en tant qu'instrument

de coop&eacute;ration. Seuls les aspects de la seconde cat&eacute;gorie

sont pertinents dans la discussion ouverte par le Livre Vert.

<P>

L'une des conclusions communes &agrave; la plupart des &eacute;valuations

est que le <B>contexte institutionnel et de politique &eacute;conomique</B>

dans le pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire a souvent constitu&eacute;

une contrainte majeure, r&eacute;duisant l'impact des interventions

de coop&eacute;ration. M&ecirc;me si un grand nombre de projets

financ&eacute;s par l'UE se r&eacute;v&egrave;lent pertinents

et efficaces, comme c'est le cas pour la plupart des projets d'infrastructures

ainsi que pour les interventions dans les secteurs sociaux, ils

ne conduisent pas automatiquement &agrave; une am&eacute;lioration

des indicateurs de d&eacute;veloppement au niveau national. En

l'absence de politiques incitatives, d'institutions sectorielles

performantes et de financements suffisants pour les frais de fonctionnement

et d'entretien, la viabilit&eacute; des r&eacute;sultats de l'aide

est fragile. Ce constat, qui concerne tous les bailleurs de fonds,

s'est traduit par une tendance de l'aide internationale &agrave;

se concentrer sur les pays d&eacute;montrant une capacit&eacute;

&agrave; l'utiliser de la mani&egrave;re la plus efficace, c'est

&agrave; dire actuellement dans les pays sous ajustement structurel.

<P>

La <B>r&eacute;partition g&eacute;ographique</B> de l'aide communautaire,

comme celle des autres bailleurs de fonds, refl&egrave;te cette

pr&eacute;occupation quant &agrave; l'utilisation des ressources:

celles-ci sont &eacute;cart&eacute;es des pays o&ugrave; les conditions

politiques ne r&eacute;pondent pas aux exigences minimales, et

l'aide b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie davantage aux pays sous ajustement

structurel. En m&ecirc;me temps, un crit&egrave;re fond&eacute;

sur l'&eacute;valuation des besoins relatifs est appliqu&eacute;

pour la r&eacute;partition des ressources programmables: en plus

d'une priorit&eacute; g&eacute;n&eacute;rale aux PMA, ces ressources

sont affect&eacute;es en priorit&eacute; aux pays les plus pauvres

(en fonction d'indicateurs du revenu par t&ecirc;te, de l'esp&eacute;rance

de vie et du taux d'analphab&eacute;tisme), aux pays insulaires

ou aux pays enclav&eacute;s. Mais l'image globale de la r&eacute;partition

de l'aide communautaire par pays ne traduit que partiellement

ces priorit&eacute;s. En effet, le mode de calcul des dotations

de certains instruments tels que Stabex et Sysmin, auxquels correspondent

des crit&egrave;res d'affectation sp&eacute;cifiques, perturbe

le ciblage global de l'aide.

<P>

Un autre aspect &agrave; relever est, dans certains cas, un manque

de pertinence et d'efficacit&eacute; par manque de consensus sur

des priorit&eacute;s politiques. Les Etats ACP n'ont souvent pas

&eacute;t&eacute; en mesure de d&eacute;finir des <B>politiques

sectorielles</B> coh&eacute;rentes, et l'aide europ&eacute;enne

a eu tendance &agrave; s'appuyer de mani&egrave;re excessive sur

les experts charg&eacute;s de l'assistance technique pour fixer

les modalit&eacute;s de mise en oeuvre de ses interventions. En

outre dans certains domaines, comme l'environnement, les pr&eacute;occupations

et les priorit&eacute;s peuvent &ecirc;tre tr&egrave;s diff&eacute;rentes

entre les pays ACP et les pays de l'UE. Dans d'autres secteurs,

les politiques sectorielles ont souvent &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;finies

selon les approches &eacute;labor&eacute;es par les bailleurs

de fonds, notamment la Banque Mondiale. Par contre dans certains

secteurs comme la sant&eacute;, qui a re&ccedil;u une fraction

croissante de l'aide europ&eacute;enne au cours des conventions

successives, la Communaut&eacute; a assum&eacute; un leadership

plus important; par un appui institutionnel et technique, l'aide

europ&eacute;enne met l'accent sur le d&eacute;veloppement de

syst&egrave;mes de sant&eacute; au niveau national, centr&eacute;s

sur les soins de sant&eacute; primaire et sur l'acc&egrave;s aux

m&eacute;dicaments essentiels. 

<P>

L'UE a aussi montr&eacute; sa capacit&eacute; &agrave; imprimer

des changements d'orientation importants, comme en t&eacute;moigne

par exemple la <B>r&eacute;forme de l'aide alimentaire</B> r&eacute;cemment

adopt&eacute;e. La r&eacute;forme, motiv&eacute;e &agrave; la

fois par la gravit&eacute; croissante des probl&egrave;mes de

s&eacute;curit&eacute; alimentaire en Afrique sub-saharienne et

par le constat de la faible efficacit&eacute; de l'instrument

utilis&eacute; et de ses effets secondaires n&eacute;gatifs, vise

&agrave; passer d'une logique d'assistance &agrave; une logique

de d&eacute;veloppement, en appuyant les politiques de s&eacute;curit&eacute;

alimentaire dans un certain nombre de pays prioritaires.

<P>

Par rapport &agrave; certains objectifs nouveaux, comme le <B>d&eacute;veloppement

du secteur priv&eacute;</B> qui a &eacute;t&eacute; renforc&eacute;

dans la quatri&egrave;me Convention de Lom&eacute;, l'aide communautaire

n'est pas encore suffisamment strat&eacute;gique, dans la mesure

o&ugrave; elle s'appuie sur un ensemble d'instruments et d'interventions

dont la coh&eacute;rence et la compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; sont

difficiles &agrave; assurer. Les actions visant &agrave; encourager

l'investissement et la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; au niveau des

entreprises par des mesures d'appui sp&eacute;cifiques demeurent

insuffisantes et trop peu int&eacute;gr&eacute;es aux interventions

visant &agrave; contribuer &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration de l'environnement

institutionnel et de la politique &eacute;conomique. Dans certains

domaines, comme l'appui &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration r&eacute;gionale

et au d&eacute;veloppement des &eacute;changes r&eacute;gionaux,

ou encore les programmes visant &agrave; encourager les &eacute;changes

entre entreprises, l'appui de la Communaut&eacute; s'av&egrave;re

plus particuli&egrave;rement pertinent et efficace. 

<P>

<H4>4. L'&eacute;valuation des instruments de coop&eacute;ration

financi&egrave;re et technique</H4>

<P>

L'efficience et l'impact de la coop&eacute;ration communautaire

se trouvent souvent r&eacute;duits par la difficult&eacute; d'assurer

une bonne coh&eacute;rence entre les diff&eacute;rents instruments,

qui interagissent dans des domaines souvent proches, tout en r&eacute;pondant

&agrave; des crit&egrave;res sp&eacute;cifiques. Certaines initiatives

communautaires r&eacute;centes, induites par les r&eacute;sultats

des &eacute;valuations, visent cependant &agrave; limiter ces

inconv&eacute;nients. Ainsi la r&eacute;forme de l'aide alimentaire

devrait notamment permettre de meilleures synergies avec les interventions

du FED en mettant l'accent sur une politique de s&eacute;curit&eacute;

alimentaire s'int&eacute;grant dans le cadre plus large de la

lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;.

<P>

<H4>(a) L'aide-projets</H4>

<P>

L'aide-projets, dont l'importance relative dans l'ensemble des

engagements financiers diminue sensiblement, a un impact et une

efficacit&eacute; tr&egrave;s variables d'un secteur &agrave;

l'autre. L'&eacute;valuation de 335 projets engag&eacute;s au

cours des ann&eacute;es 1980 a par exemple conclu &agrave; un

taux d'efficacit&eacute; de 70% pour le secteur des transports

et de moins de 30% pour l'agriculture et le d&eacute;veloppement

rural. N&eacute;anmoins un certain nombre de faiblesses imputables

&agrave; la nature m&ecirc;me de l'instrument peuvent &ecirc;tre

identifi&eacute;es:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>tout d'abord l'aide-projets tend &agrave; sous-estimer l'importance

du cadre macro-&eacute;conomique pour assurer un impact satisfaisant

en termes d'am&eacute;lioration des conditions de vie ainsi que

pour assurer la viabilit&eacute; des r&eacute;alisations;

<P>

<LI>ensuite l'aide-projets s'av&egrave;re peu pertinente et d&egrave;s

lors peu efficace quand elle ne s'ins&egrave;re pas dans une politique

sectorielle bien d&eacute;termin&eacute;e. Dans certains cas,

ce type d'interventions, en masquant les contraintes r&eacute;elles,

contribue d'ailleurs &agrave; retarder les r&eacute;formes n&eacute;cessaires;

<P>

<LI>par ailleurs le faible niveau d'appropriation des projets de

d&eacute;veloppement par les gouvernements et/ou les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires,

notamment dans la mesure o&ugrave; les mesures d'accompagnement

s'av&egrave;rent insuffisantes, contribue &eacute;galement &agrave;

r&eacute;duire leur efficacit&eacute;;

<P>

<LI>enfin comme pour les autres formes d'intervention, un degr&eacute;

de coordination insuffisant entre les donateurs r&eacute;duit

sensiblement l'efficacit&eacute; de l'ensemble des projets de

coop&eacute;ration.

</UL>

<P>

<H4>(b) L'appui &agrave; l'ajustement structurel</H4>

<P>

La Communaut&eacute; est devenue un acteur important sur ce terrain,

fournissant dans les pays concern&eacute;s, entre 10 et 30% des

montants totaux de l'aide &agrave; l'ajustement, et ce exclusivement

sous forme de dons, contrairement &agrave; la plupart des autres

intervenants.

<P>

Les &eacute;valuations soulignent la pertinence de cet instrument,

qui permet &agrave; la Communaut&eacute; de fournir un soutien

efficace aux programmes de stabilisation, et &agrave; travers

lequel elle poursuit des objectifs plus larges que la plupart

des programmes traditionnels agr&eacute;&eacute;s par les gouvernements

avec les institutions de Bretton Woods: outre la stabilisation

macro-&eacute;conomique et les conditions du d&eacute;veloppement

du secteur priv&eacute;, la priorit&eacute; accord&eacute;e &agrave;

certains secteurs prioritaires en particulier la sant&eacute;

et l'&eacute;ducation, est clairement signifi&eacute;e par le

ciblage des fonds de contrepartie. 

<P>

Il existe cependant une marge pour am&eacute;liorer l'impact de

cet instrument, qui est potentiellement l'un des plus efficaces,

essentiellement sous les aspects suivants:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>un approfondissement du dialogue sur les politiques. Une coordination

accrue au sein de l'UE augmenterait sensiblement la port&eacute;e

de ce dialogue;

<P>

<LI>une coh&eacute;rence accrue entre l'appui &agrave; l'ajustement

structurel ou sectoriel et l'utilisation des autres instruments

qui devraient &ecirc;tre mieux int&eacute;gr&eacute;s dans le

cadre strat&eacute;gique global n&eacute;goci&eacute;;

<P>

<LI>un appui &agrave; la programmation et &agrave; la gestion des

budgets publics dans les pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires;

<P>

<LI>une clarification du contenu des conditionnalit&eacute;s, une

am&eacute;lioration des modalit&eacute;s de contr&ocirc;le et

de leur port&eacute;e pratique en cas de non-respect. 

</UL>

m&eacute;canismes de compensation Stabex et Sysmin</H4>

<P>

Bien que la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'accorder un soutien particulier

&agrave; la restructuration de certains secteurs ne soit pas n&eacute;cessairement

remise en cause, un ensemble de facteurs conf&egrave;rent &agrave;

ces deux instruments un caract&egrave;re devenu mal adapt&eacute;

au contexte actuel:

<P>

<UL>

<LI>les pr&eacute;occupations qui ont pr&eacute;sid&eacute; au lancement

de cette forme d'aide ont fortement &eacute;volu&eacute;, notamment

quant au r&ocirc;le de l'Etat dans la d&eacute;termination des

prix au producteur de mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res;

<P>

<LI>les crit&egrave;res d'&eacute;ligibilit&eacute;, fonction des

fluctuations des recettes d'exportation, et le caract&egrave;re

initialement automatique des paiements, qui peut contribuer &agrave;

diff&eacute;rer les r&eacute;formes n&eacute;cessaires, ont &eacute;t&eacute;

largement remis en cause; 

<P>

<LI>l'utilisation des fonds Sysmin et Stabex s'av&egrave;re plus

efficace dans le cadre d'un processus de r&eacute;forme macro-&eacute;conomique

et sectorielle, &agrave; des fins de diversification. Leur utilisation

croissante pour promouvoir des r&eacute;formes dans les secteurs

subissant des baisses de recettes, rapprochent ces instruments

de la facilit&eacute; d'appui &agrave; l'ajustement structurel.

</UL>

<P>

L'instauration des COM (Cadres d'obligations mutuelles) sous Lom&eacute;

IV a repr&eacute;sent&eacute; une am&eacute;lioration sensible,

dans la mesure o&ugrave; l'utilisation la plus efficace des ressources

est syst&eacute;matiquement recherch&eacute;e. Toutefois la lenteur

des d&eacute;boursements constitue un handicap important, auquel

il faut s'efforcer de rem&eacute;dier.

<P>

<H4>6. L'impact des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales</H4>

<P>

Trois principes fondamentaux sous-tendent le syst&egrave;me des

pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales de Lom&eacute;:

<UL>

<LI>i ) <B>la stabilit&eacute;</B>: les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences s'&eacute;tendent

sur de longues p&eacute;riodes: la quatri&egrave;me Convention

de Lom&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; conclue pour dix ans

(1990-2000);

<LI>ii) <B>le caract&egrave;re contractuel</B>: les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

ont &eacute;t&eacute; convenues d'un commun accord, elles ne peuvent pas &ecirc;tre modifi&eacute;es unilat&eacute;ralement

par l'UE;

<LI>iii) <B>la non-r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;</B>: les pays ACP

ne sont pas oblig&eacute;s d'&eacute;tendre les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

r&eacute;ciproques aux exportations de l'UE.

</UL>

<P>

La stabilit&eacute; et le caract&egrave;re contractuel constituent

des &eacute;l&eacute;ments essentiels des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

commerciales de Lom&eacute;, car ils assurent aux exportations

des pays ACP vers les march&eacute;s de l'UE un degr&eacute; de

s&eacute;curit&eacute; d'acc&egrave;s in&eacute;gal&eacute; par

d'autres accords pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiels non-r&eacute;ciproques

existants, tels que les syst&egrave;mes SPG, et r&eacute;duisent

ainsi, pour les op&eacute;rateurs &eacute;conomiques, les risques

inh&eacute;rents aux investissements dans des activit&eacute;s

ax&eacute;es sur l'exportation. 

<P>

Les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales de Lom&eacute; continuent

de repr&eacute;senter une valeur importante pour le groupe ACP,

dans la mesure o&ugrave; elles accroissent la rentabilit&eacute;

des ventes des exportateurs ACP sur le march&eacute; de l'UE.

Au-del&agrave; de l'acc&egrave;s g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;

enti&egrave;rement en franchise de droits pour les produits manufactur&eacute;s

et transform&eacute;s, et en particulier de l'exemption de l 'application

des disciplines de l 'AMF accord&eacute;e aux pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

octroy&eacute;es pour les textiles et les v&ecirc;tements, les

diff&eacute;rents pays ACP ont b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute;

des prix g&eacute;n&eacute;reux et de I'acc&egrave;s garanti pour

des quantit&eacute;s sp&eacute;cifiques dans le cadre des protocoles

de Lom&eacute; sur les produits de base (bananes, sucre, viande

bovine et rhum) ainsi que de r&egrave;gles d'origine relativement

lib&eacute;rales. Les revenus assur&eacute;s par les protocoles

repr&eacute;sentent une partie importante des revenus des pays

&eacute;ligibles.

<P>

Toutefois, la valeur des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences cornmerciales

de Lom&eacute; a diminu&eacute; et continuera &agrave; s'&eacute;roder,

en raison de la lib&eacute;ralisation multilat&eacute;rale d&eacute;coulant

de la mise en oeuvre des accords du cycle de l'Uruguay, des accords

de pr&eacute;-adh&eacute;sion avec les PECO et de l'apparition

d 'accords de commerce r&eacute;gionaux au sein de 1'UE.

<P>

En outre, pour ce qui est de <B>l'impact</B> des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

commerciales de Lom&eacute;, celles-ci n'ont en r&egrave;gle g&eacute;n&eacute;rale

pas &eacute;t&eacute; suffisantes pour promouvoir la croissance

et la diversification des exportations. Un simple coup d'oeil

aux statistiques (voir tableaux) semble confirmer ce jugement.

Les performances des pays ACP en mati&egrave;re d 'exportations

et pour attirer les investissements &eacute;trangers directs

se sont d&eacute;t&eacute;rior&eacute;es au cours de la p&eacute;riode

pendant laquelle ils b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaient le plus de ces

pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences. 

<P>

Au cours des Conventions de Lom&eacute;, les pays

ACP n'ont pas r&eacute;ussi &agrave; augmenter ni m&ecirc;me

&agrave; maintenir leur <B>part de march&eacute;</B> dans

l'UE, alors que des exportateurs ne jouissant pas de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

sont arriv&eacute;s &agrave; augmenter leur part de march&eacute;.

Le march&eacute; de I'UE est rest&eacute; relativement important

pour les pays ACP qui d&eacute;pendent encore de I 'Union

pour environ 40% de leurs recettes d'exportation. La d&eacute;pendance

commerciale vis&agrave;vis de l 'Europe varie selon les r&eacute;gions

ACP et est plus &eacute;lev&eacute;e pour l'Afrique (46%)

que pour les Cara&iuml;bes et le Pacifique (respectivement

18% et >23%).

<P>

Par rapport au groupe des PMA, les ACP ont &eacute;galement

enregistr&eacute; une performance commerciale globale plus modeste

au cours des dix derni&egrave;res ann&eacute;es. Les ACP ne sont

pas non plus parvenus &agrave; <B>diversifier leurs exportations</B>

de mani&egrave;re significative et la plupart d'entre eux se concentrent

toujours sur quelques produits primaires. Les <B>investissements

&eacute;trangers directs</B> dans les pays ACP africains ont doub!&eacute;

en termes de pourcentage du PIB entre le milieu des ann&eacute;es

quatrevingts et le d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es quatrevingtdix

pour atteindre 1,2%. Toutefois, par rapport &agrave; d'autres

pays en d&eacute;veloppement, la part des investissements &eacute;trangers

directs en Afrique a chut&eacute; de 6% &agrave; 4% de tous les

investissements &eacute;trangers directs dans tous les PMA (&agrave;

l'exclusion de la Chine). En outre la plupart des investissements

&eacute;trangers directs en Afrique sont concentr&eacute;s sur

les pays producteurs de p&eacute;trole. 

<P>

Cependant, il existe des r&eacute;ussites individuelles en

mati&egrave;re de croissance et de diversification des exportations.

Un certain nombre d 'exportations ayant b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute;

d'une marge pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentielle relativement importante

en termes de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences tarifaires ou d 'exemption

de quotas se sont d&eacute;velopp&eacute;es. Quelques pays, en

particulier ceux qui utilisent au maximum les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences,

ont pu attirer des investissements &eacute;trangers directs importants.

Les pays ACP qui ont r&eacute;ussi &agrave; diversifier leurs

exportations en faveur de produits non traditionnels ou

ont b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; des protocoles, tels que Maurice,

le Botswana, la C&ocirc;te d'lvoire, la Jama&iuml;que et le Zimbabwe,

ont tir&eacute; profit des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences de Lom&eacute;

<P>

Les faibles performances globales en mati&egrave;re d'exportations

et de croissance des pays ACP en d&eacute;pit de l'ampleur

et de la profondeur des pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences de Lom&eacute;,

s'expliquent par une multitude de raisons. L 'absence de facteurs

essentiels tels que 1'infrastructure, I 'esprit d'entreprise,

les faibles niveaux de capitaux physiques et humains, les faibles

niveaux d'&eacute;pargne et d'investissement, des secteurs financiers

non-d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s, ont limit&eacute;, du c&ocirc;t&eacute;

des fournisseurs, les profits qu'auraient pu g&eacute;n&eacute;rer

les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences. La d&eacute;pendance &eacute;lev&eacute;e

par rapport &agrave; un certain nombre de produits de base sujets

&agrave; des fluctuations de prix importantes et une d&eacute;gradation

substantielle des termes des &eacute;changes sont &eacute;galement

des facteurs importants d'explication. 

<P>

En outre, il est maintenant commun&eacute;ment admis qu'audel&agrave;

de la stabilit&eacute; politique, qui est une condition pr&eacute;alable

fondamentale de la croissance, et des dotations initiales,

des politiques saines jouent un r&ocirc;le primordial pour

influencer les exportations et la croissance. La stabilit&eacute;

macro&eacute;conomique, des taux de change r&eacute;alistes et

stables, des institutions saines et une bonne gestion ainsi que

des politiques efficaces d'affectation des ressources, notamment

des r&eacute;gimes d'importation et d'imposition stables et

cr&eacute;dibles ainsi que des protections commerciales limit&eacute;es

qui permettent une transmission transparente des signaux des prix

mondiaux aur producteurs nationaux, sont des facteurs d&eacute;terminants

pour la comp&eacute;titivit&eacute; et donc pour les performances

&agrave; I 'exportation. Ces facteurs du c&ocirc;t&eacute; de

l'offre sont maintenant consid&eacute;r&eacute;s comme beaucoup

plus importants que les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales

pour assurer des taux &eacute;lev&eacute;s d'exportation et

de croissance &eacute;conomique. 

<P>

En tant que groupe, les ACP, et notamment les pays d'Afrique

subsaharienne, ne sont pas arriv&eacute;s &agrave; remplir

ces conditions pr&eacute;alables pour r&eacute;aliser une croissance

conditionn&eacute;e par les exportations. Ces pays, faibles en

raison de maigres dotations initiales, ont &eacute;galement &eacute;chou&eacute;

en ce qui concerne les politiques adopt&eacute;es, ou, s'ils

ont adopt&eacute; les bonnes politiques, ils ne les ont pas

mises en oeuvre avec suffisamment de conviction et ont

souvent fait marche arri&egrave;re. En cons&eacute;quence, les

politiques &eacute;conomiques des pays d'Afrique subsaharienne,

et en fin de compte les r&eacute;formes politiques, ont &eacute;t&eacute;

victimes d'une tr&egrave;s faible <B>cr&eacute;dibilit&eacute;</B>

aux yeux des op&eacute;rateurs &eacute;conomiques, tant nationaux

qu'&eacute;trangers. Cette situation a sap&eacute; non seulement

la r&eacute;ponse du c&ocirc;t&eacute; de l'offre aux pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

commerciales, mais &eacute;galement &agrave; toute r&eacute;forme

politique prospective. 

<P>

Enfin, les batailles juridiques men&eacute;es par l'UE et les

ACP au sein du GATT apr&egrave;s la mise en place du march&eacute;

unique pour les bananes ont pouss&eacute; en 1994 la Communaut&eacute;

europ&eacute;enne &agrave; demander une &quot;d&eacute;rogation&quot;

pour l'ensemble commercial de la Convention de Lom&eacute; apr&egrave;s

qu'un panel (non adopt&eacute; par le Conseil du GATT)

ait estim&eacute; la Convention de Lom&eacute; incompatible

avec le GATT en raison de la nonr&eacute;ciprocit&eacute; (qui

ne permet pas de consid&eacute;rer la Convention comme un

accord de libre&eacute;change) et de la discrimination vis&agrave;vis

d'autres PMA, ce qui signifie qu'elle n'est pas couverte par

la clause d'habilitation autorisant les syst&egrave;mes de pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences

g&eacute;n&eacute;ralis&eacute;es. 

<P>

Le fait que la d&eacute;rogation ne soit valable que jusqu'&agrave;

la fin de la Convention actuelle, qu'elle doive etre r&eacute;examin&eacute;e

tous les ans et que les questions li&eacute;es au r&eacute;gime

commerciaI concernant les bananes appliqu&eacute; par l'UE n'aient

pas encore &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;gl&eacute;es, a sap&eacute;

les principes sous-tendant les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales

de Lom&eacute;, en particulier ceux de la non-r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;

et de la stabilit&eacute;. La s&eacute;curit&eacute; li&eacute;e

&agrave; ces pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences en a &eacute;t&eacute;

r&eacute;duite d'autant.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="implic"><HR>C. Implications pour le partenariat futur</A></H3>

<P>

La principale conclusion que l'on peut tirer de ce regard critique

sur le pass&eacute; est que l'obligation de r&eacute;sultats d&eacute;termine

de plus en plus la conduite de la politique communautaire de coop&eacute;ration

au d&eacute;veloppement. Des r&eacute;orientations importantes

sont en cours dans de nombreux domaines, qui tiennent compte des

conclusions des &eacute;valuations en vue d'accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&eacute;

et l'impact de l'action communautaire. La critique selon laquelle

la coop&eacute;ration communautaire serait moins efficace que

d'autres apparait d&eacute;nu&eacute;e de tout fondement, aucune

&eacute;tude comparative et objective ne permettant d'&eacute;tablir

ce type d'appr&eacute;ciation. Tous les bailleurs de fonds sont

confront&eacute;s &agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de r&eacute;&eacute;valuer

r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement leur action, et de rechercher les

moyens d'am&eacute;liorer l'impact de leurs programmes. L'&eacute;valuation

des principales contraintes qui ont pes&eacute; sur l'efficacit&eacute;

de la coop&eacute;ration UE-ACP dans le cadre de la convention

de Lom&eacute;, devrait conduire &agrave; d&eacute;finir les conditions

d'une politique qui aurait de meilleures chances de succ&egrave;s.

Dans ce d&eacute;bat, les questions suivantes devront notamment

&ecirc;tre abord&eacute;es:

<P>

<UL>

<LI><U>les fondements du partenariat futur</U>. Les difficult&eacute;s

rencontr&eacute;es dans la r&eacute;alisation concr&egrave;te

du principe de partenariat ont lourdement pes&eacute; sur l'efficacit&eacute;

globale de la Convention de Lom&eacute;. Dans ce contexte, l'UE

a eu tendance &agrave; adopter des approches plus unilat&eacute;rales

et plus interventionnistes, peu propices &agrave; l'appropriation

des politiques de d&eacute;veloppement par les pays ACP et &agrave;

la reconnaissance des responsabilit&eacute;s propres &agrave;

chaque partenaire. Cette tendance &agrave; la substitution, qui

peut se justifier dans une phase transitoire d&eacute;termin&eacute;e,

ne constitue ni un gage d'efficacit&eacute;, ni &agrave; terme

une solution viable. L'interruption de ce cercle vicieux passe

par une revalorisation fondamentale du principe de partenariat,

qui appara&icirc;t davantage comme un objectif &agrave; atteindre

que comme un principe de d&eacute;part. Une telle transformation

ne pourra que reposer sur de nouvelles bases politiques et sur

un dialogue plus effectif, s'appuyant sur la volont&eacute; des

gouvernements des ACP de s'engager r&eacute;ellement dans un processus

de r&eacute;formes. Elle n&eacute;cessitera aussi une plus grande

flexibilit&eacute; dans la mise en oeuvre de la politique de coop&eacute;ration;

<P>

<LI><U>les priorit&eacute;s de l'Union et les crit&egrave;res d'affectation

des ressources</U>. Si l'analyse de la r&eacute;partition des

ressources par pays au cours des d&eacute;cennies pass&eacute;es

ne traduit pas de priorit&eacute;s claires, c'est essentiellement

en raison de la superposition de crit&egrave;res sp&eacute;cifiques

attach&eacute;s aux diff&eacute;rents instruments. Lors de la

r&eacute;vision de la convention de Lom&eacute; IV &agrave; mi-parcours,

l'Union a indiqu&eacute; sa volont&eacute; de respecter deux priorit&eacute;s,

mettant &agrave; la fois l'accent sur les pays les pauvres, conform&eacute;ment

aux dispositions du Trait&eacute;, tout en veillant &agrave; assurer

les conditions d'une utilisation plus efficace des ressources.

Ces principes et leurs modalit&eacute;s pratiques d'application

devront &ecirc;tre discut&eacute;s de mani&egrave;re approfondie

dans le cadre du futur partenariat;

<P>

<LI><U>la conditionnalit&eacute; et la s&eacute;lectivit&eacute;

de l'aide</U>. Une autre question li&eacute;e &agrave; celle des

crit&egrave;res d'affectation des ressources communautaires, concerne

la conditionnalit&eacute; des programmes d'aide. La conditionnalit&eacute;

renforce le poids du crit&egrave;re de &quot;performance&quot;

dans l'allocation des ressources, et une approche globale coh&eacute;rente

de ces questions devra &ecirc;tre d&eacute;finie. Une certaine

flexibilit&eacute; devrait sans doute &ecirc;tre envisag&eacute;e

dans la pratique de la conditionnalit&eacute;, afin de laisser

plus d'initiative au pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire tout en affirmant

ses responsabilit&eacute;s. Les r&eacute;ponses &agrave; ces questions

influenceront, en finale, le degr&eacute; de s&eacute;lectivit&eacute;

de l'aide communautaire;

<P>

<LI><U>le probl&egrave;me du d&eacute;veloppement des capacit&eacute;s</U>.

Les &eacute;valuations ont conclu &agrave; la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

d'identifier syst&eacute;matiquement les contraintes institutionnelles

ou de politiques &eacute;conomiques dans les pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires

qui influencent les perspectives de r&eacute;ussite d'une action

de coop&eacute;ration, et d'examiner les moyens n&eacute;cessaires

pour les surmonter. A partir de ce constat, l'Union doit se demander

si l'am&eacute;lioration du cadre institutionnel et de la capacit&eacute;

de concevoir, de mettre en oeuvre et de soutenir dans le temps

les politiques &eacute;conomiques et sectorielles dans les pays

ACP, pourrait acqu&eacute;rir une plus grande priorit&eacute;

dans sa politique de coop&eacute;ration. La n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

de r&eacute;tablir une capacit&eacute; de planification et d'analyse

prospective dans les pays ACP doit &ecirc;tre examin&eacute;e.

Cette question doit &ecirc;tre abord&eacute;e dans sa dimension

institutionnelle propre mais aussi dans sa dimension politique;

<P>

<LI><U>un nouveau volet commercial</U>.

Alors que les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences commerciales pr&eacute;vues

dans la Convention de Lom&eacute; ont une valeur importante,

non seulement en termes de concessions concr&egrave;tes, mais

&eacute;galement en ce qui concerne les.principes de base (non-r&eacute;ciprocit&eacute;,

stabilit&eacute;, caract&egrave;re contractuel), sous-tendant

le partenariat commercial entre les deux parties, pour ce

qui est de leur impact, on consid&egrave;re g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement

qu'elles n'ont pas &eacute;t&eacute; suffisantes pour promouvoir

la croissance et la diver:sification. 

<P>

Un certain nombre de tendances et de caract&eacute;ristiques

du nouveau contexte mondial, telles que la lib&eacute;ralisation

multilat&eacute;rale et r&eacute;gionale, et notamment la n&eacute;cessit&eacute;

de respecter les r&egrave;gles de l'OMC, devrant &ecirc;tre

prises en compte. 

<P>

En tout &eacute;tat de cause, l'accent devra aussi davantage &ecirc;tre

mis sur les aspects structurels du d&eacute;veloppement du commerce,

sur les conditions d'une diversification de la production et la

mise en place d'un cadre favorable au d&eacute;veloppement du

secteur exportateur. Les pr&eacute;f&eacute;rences ne suffisent

pas en soi pour promouvoir la croissance et la diversification;

mais elles fournissent des opportunit&eacute;s qui peuvent inciter

les entreprises et les acteurs &eacute;conomiques &agrave; d&eacute;velopper

des fili&egrave;res de production dans un cadre strat&eacute;gique

donn&eacute;. Une approche plus globale de la coop&eacute;ration

commerciale, li&eacute;e aux interventions d'appui &agrave; l'ajustement

structurel et &agrave; l'appui au secteur priv&eacute;, et prenant

en compte la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; pour les pays ACP de mettre

en place les conditions politiques et institutionnelles favorables

&agrave; l'investissement &eacute;tranger, devrait permettre d'am&eacute;liorer

leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; tirer parti d'un r&eacute;gime pr&eacute;f&eacute;rentiel,

et, au-del&agrave;, &agrave; diversifier leurs relations &eacute;conomiques

ext&eacute;rieures;

<P>

<LI><U>la remise en cause des instruments et de la nature des aides</U>.

La superposition de diff&eacute;rents instruments r&eacute;pondant

&agrave; des logiques diff&eacute;rentes p&egrave;se sur l'efficacit&eacute;

globale de l'action communautaire. Le passage &agrave; une approche

th&eacute;matique et un recentrage de l'appui communautaire sur

des politiques sectorielles et des r&eacute;formes n&eacute;goci&eacute;es

devraient permettre d'accro&icirc;tre son efficacit&eacute; et

son impact sur les conditions &eacute;conomiques et sociales dans

les pays ACP. L'aide-projets ne devrait &ecirc;tre maintenue que

dans des conditions de cadrage institutionnel et de politiques

bien pr&eacute;cises, pour lever des contraintes sp&eacute;cifiques

clairement identifi&eacute;es, et dans la mesure o&ugrave; elle

peut comporter un transfert de savoir-faire. Le r&ocirc;le de

l'aide-projets serait alors de mieux cibler et d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;rer

les processus de r&eacute;formes convenues au niveau g&eacute;n&eacute;ral

ou sectoriel; 

<P>

<LI><U>la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de coordination</U>. Toutes les

&eacute;valuations conduisent &agrave; cette conclusion: une meilleure

coordination entre les donateurs permettrait, en particulier dans

le cadre du dialogue sur les politiques, d'accro&icirc;tre l'impact

de nombreuses actions de coop&eacute;ration.

The answer is no, not yet anyway.  As there seems to be some confusion, we thought you might be interested to hear just how much money does go to charity from the lottery.<p>Lottery money is divided between the winners, the government (12% tax take), Camelot who are the organisers, and five 'Good Causes'.  These five good causes are Arts, Sports, Heritage, The Millenium Fund and Charities. In fact, 'charities' is not entirely accurate since this category includes any group doing philanthropic or benevolent work, whether or not they are registered as a charity.<p>From your £1 ticket, an average of 28p goes to the five good causes. Of this, only 5.6p actually goes to the charities sector.  It is not yet clear how much of this take will go to charities doing work overseas but it is unlikely to be more than 10%. So charities like WOMANKIND will have to compete for their share of the halfpence of every pound of Lottery money allocated to the overseas charities sector.  The lottery board is not even looking at applications for overseas work yet so we do not expect they will start making grants until well into 1996.<p>Charities are being hurt by the public's belief that their lottery money is going to charity. A recent survey showed that just under 60% of people thought that buying lottery tickets was a good way to help charities and that charities got at least 20p from each £1 ticket, which is clearly not the case. As a result people are contributing less to charities.<p>The National Council of Voluntary Organisations' recent research showed a fall in those donating to charity from 81% (February) to 61% (March) and a 4% fall in the value of the donation.  They project an alarming loss of £161 million in charitable income over the first 12 months of the National Lottery.<p>So when you are thinking about making a donation to support our very special work, please remember WOMANKIND does not receive anything from the National Lottery and we are unlikely to do so for quite some time to come!<p><b><a href="index.html">Contents Page</a></b><p><hr><p>©Copyright:1996 Womankind Worldwide<hr></body></html>

<h1>What the Papers Say:<br>
UK Press Coverage:</h1>

<center>
	<b>Oxfam challenges high street on exploitation</b><br>
	'Oxfam is introducing a new concept of 'serious shopping' today. Everyone is being asked to ensure that their latest little extravagance 	or essential was not made with the sweat and blood of exploited workers around the world.' - <b>The Independent</b> May 20 1996<p>


	<b>Shops pressed on Third World firms</b><br>
	'Oxfam's Clothes Code campaign, launched today, urges retailers to ensure that staff in Third World factories are not exploited through excessive hours, intimidation or breadline wages.' - <b>The Guardian</b> Monday May 20 1996<p>


	<b>Oxfam targets rag trade</b><br>
	'Oxfam wants retailers to take responsibility for the actions of subcontractors. The code includes a 48-hour  working week, no employment for children under 14 and no forced labour.' <b>The Times</b> Monday May 20 1996<p>


	<b>Oxfam in High Street crusade to curb world's 	sweatshops</b><br>
	'As you agonise over whether you should fork out a small fortune on a new summer dress or suit, it might be well to remember who made it.
	This is the message from Oxfam today as it launches a new campaign aimed at improving life for the millions of clothes workers world-wide who work in appalling conditions.' - <b>The Standard</b> Monday May 20 1996<p>


	<b>Oxfam calls on firms to adopt labour codes</b><br>
	'Oxfam has received a mixed response retailers after issuing a call for businesses to sign up to a code of practice on third-world labour standards. C&A and Sears have reacted positively, but Oxfam is still looking for encouraging signs from Next and the Burton Group.' - <b>People Management</b> June 13 1996<p>


	<b>£45 buys this pretty summer dress. The woman who made it earned £1 an hour. In Hong Kong or Bangladesh? No, in the East End of London. </b><br>
	' Sweating in the summer heat, cramped between bales of cloth, racks of patterns and finished designs, machinist Asiye Altun, 32, scores notches into a jackets central panel...Asiye works a 60-hour week. She is paid £100 in cash.
	Ruth Mayne, a quality adviser at Oxfam, says that 'governments and companies are engaged in a race to the bottom to cut labour costs in order to compete. Global economic integration is causing downward pressure on labour standards in the North as well as in the South and minimum standards need to be set.' - <b>The Observer</b> June 23 1996</center><p>


<b>Global Press Coverage:</b><p>
<center>

<b>	OXFAM launches move to improve conditions of garment workers</b><br>
	'Women working in the garment factories badly need their jobs to fight poverty  and countries like Bangladesh badly need the foreign exchange earnings that the industry can provide, an OXFAM release said in Dhaka on Sunday.
	But most of the garment factories world-wide by women's labour at the cheapest possible rate. Working long hours in appalling conditions the women workers get the smallest possible share of the huge amount of money that changes hands at different phases of the garment trade.' - <b>The Bangladesh Observer</b> May 20 1996<p>


	<b>OXFAM launches 'cloths code'</b><br>
	'Though OXFAM's new campaign is global in nature, it has relevance in the Indian context given the huge garment export industry here. 'The purpose of our initiative', according to Ashvin Dayal, OXFAM's public policy analyst in India, 'is not to undermine exports or boycott retailers...instead, through facilitating a dialogue with retailers we hope to encourage improvements in working conditions and wages which will ultimately promote sustainable and equitable export growth.' - <b>The Patriot</b> New Delhi May 27, 1996</center><p>


<b>Note: This is only a selection of the newspaper coverage that Oxfam's Clothes Code campaign has received during the last month and a half.  The campaign has been profiled in over 20 newspaper articles; has been featured on eight television programmes, including the BBC Breakfast News; and has been discussed on 18 radio programmes, including BBC Radio 1 'Newsbeat', and Voice of America.</b><p>

<P>

<b>

Cosmopolitanism and a large and prosperous middle class are a

leftover from the Netherlands' colonial past. They also assure

its development cooperation top ranking for quantity and quality.

The strong position of development cooperation enables coordination

with the policies of other ministries. And higher education institutions

and NGOs play any important role.</b>

<P>

The Netherlands has a special place among the OECD donor countries,

not only in its conception of itself, but also from the view point

of developing countries. It is a former major (and controversial)

colonial power, an integral part of the NATO military alliance,

and a committed EU member. For all that, together with Canada

and Scandinavia it is one of the &quot;likeminded countries&quot;

that are the vanguard of deveopment policy. This special status

is explained by the small country's centurieslong role as a worldwide

trade and colonial power. The success of its overseas activities

and flourishing foreign trade created a large, prosperous middle

class that is still its determining social force. At the same

time, the largescale migration to the Dutch colonies brought about

an intellectual climate of cosmopolitanism. And that was later

stamped by the traumatic experiences of decolonisation and the

occupation of the Netherlands during the Second World War. The

economic difficulties of recent years have so far had only a slight

effect on the Netherlands' development cooperation. Political

parties? commerce and industry, and social groups continue unreservedly

to award development policy high ranking in the spectrum of the

country's policies. The following reasons are given for that:

<ul>

<li>compensation for the colonial past;

<li>the influence of Calvinism and its fundamental principle

of combining riches and success with &quot;good deeds&quot;;

<li>general acceptance of the role of the state as the authority

of social balance at home as well as in relation to the Third

World.</ul>

<P>

However, the rightwing liberals' surprise victory in the provincial

elections of March 1995 won, among other things, with the use

of xenophobic slogans, signals a possible unravelling of this

national consensus. The reorientation of foreign policy to primarily

economic policy goals that is now under way and the reduction

of the development cooperation budget in favour of military peacekeeping

missions also point in this direction.

<P>

<B>Development administration structure complicated, but functional</B>

<P>

The responsibilities for the Netherlands' development cooperation

are assigned in a very unusual way. Political responsibility is

carried by the Minister for Development Cooperation, who has Cabinet

rank but no ministry of his own. For the planning, control and

in part the implementation of development cooperation he calls

on the DirectorateGeneral for International Cooperation

(DGIS), one of the three departments of the Ministry for Foreign

Affairs. On the whole, this complicated structure has so far functioned

well. In particular, by this means development cooperation is

smoothly integrated in Netherlands embassies in recipient countries.

But interministerial disputes over domains have arisen in individual

cases. For example, when in 1992 the Netherlands Development Minister

called on Indonesia to observe human rights, and Indonesia rejected

this interference, the Netherlands Foreign Minister was placed

in a difficult situation. The development policy specialist Jan

Pronk, who was Development Minister from 1973 to 1977, has held

the portfolio again since the end of 1989.

<P>

The Finance Minister largely acts alone in shaping relations with

the IMF and the World Bank, and is responsible for export credit

guarantees. The Economics Minister is competent for GATT/WTO and

UNCTAD and collaborates on mixed financing projects. But he does

not, as in some other donor countries, represent the interests

of industry. The Agriculture Minister, on the other hand, represents

mainly the interests of agroproducers and has his own attaches

in Netherlands embassies.

<P>

The relatively high status of development cooperation in the Netherlands

is shown by the fact that a coordination committee (COCOS) chaired

by the head of the DGIS meets monthly, and a Cabinet subcommittee

on development cooperation (ROS) presided over by the Prime Minister

convenes three times year.

<P>

The Netherlands has no special implementation organizations. About

100 members of embassies, assisted by 50 regionally located sector

experts, handle mainly development cooperation tasks. Other important

insitutions are:

<ul>

<li>the Netherlands Development Organization (SNV),

which has been largely independent of the DGIS since the beginning

of 1991. Besides seconding development aid workers, it carries

out implementation tasks with a volume of about 30 million guilders

a year;

<li>the wellknown Centre for the Promotion of Exports

from Developing Countries (CBI), which other donors

regard as a model;

<li>the Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO),

roughly equivalent to the German Finance Company for Investments in Developing Countries (DEG);

<li>the four NGO umbrella orgnizations: ICCO (Protestant),

CEBEMO (Catholic), NOVIB (ideologically independent), and HIVOS

(Social Democratic/humanistic), for cofinancing and implementations

tasks;

<li>the Netherlands Organization forlnternational Cooperation

in Higher Education (NUFFIC), with competence for the initial

and advanced training of developing country nationals and implementation

of university and college projects; and

<li>the National Information Committee for Development Cooperation

(NCO), which continues to receive official funds for the promotion

of Third World groups and for development policy education work

despite occasional fierce arguments with the development cooperation

administration.

</ul><P>

<B>Linking development cooperation to net national income</B>

<P>

The Netherlands achieved the UN target of 0.7 per cent of GNP

for official development assistance (ODA) back in 1975. Since

then it has always been among the top group of the DAC donor countries.

In the 1980s, its ODA-GNP ratio ranged between 0.9 per cent and

1.1 per cent.

<P>

There has been parliamentary consensus since 1973 that total government

spending on development cooperation, that is, not only ODA according

to OECD/DAC criteria, should be 1.5 per cent of net national income

(NNI). This benchmark has largely hindered reduction of development

cooperation in the wake of budget cuts. But it also limits the

growth of development cooperation and hampers initiatives or the

setting up of new programmes. Besides that, the development cooperation

budget encompasses what are essentially non-ODA components. These

include, for example, the debt service for development cooperation

financing obtained on the capital market, the costs of caring

for refugees from Third World countries, and, recently, aid for

Eastern Europe and the CIS states. This led to the 1.5 per cent

criterion being questioned in principle in November 1992 during

a parliamentary debate on the 1993 budget.

<P>

The Netherlands does not differentiate between Technical and Financial

Cooperation. Since 1990 aid has been disbursed exclusively as

grants.

<P>

<B>Regional concentration</B>

<P>

Following a parliamentary debate on the fragmentation of development

cooperation, the number of recipient countries was reduced to

about 45 in the South and 10 Eastern European and CIS states.

The division into three country categories remained. These are:

<ul>

<li>&quot;programme countries&quot;  India, Pakistan and Bangladesh,

with annual disbursements fixed in agreement with the recipients);

<li>&quot;regional countries&quot;  funds can be distributed

among seven defined regions according to need and the quality

of national policies. The regions are the Mekong, Nile/Red Sea,

Sahel/West Africa, East Africa, Central America, Andes and Surinam;

<li>&quot;sector countries&quot;  where international organizations

and NGOs take over the implementation of bilateral rural development

measures.</ul>

<P>

This regional distribution, however, has recently been overlaid

by four new categories: normal cooperation countries; treaty countries

that have signed a sustainable development agreement (Benin, Bhutan,

Costa Rica); conflict and rehabilitation cases (Angola, Eritrea,

Cambodia, Sudan, Somalia, Palestine); and finally transition countries

(Eastern Europe, the CIS, South Africa, Namibia). Indonesia ended

its development cooperation relations with the Netherlands in

1992.

<P>

On the whole, a relatively stable regional, and a balanced sectoral,

distribution of development cooperation can be noted.

<P>

<B>Strong multilateral commitment</B>

<P>

Like the Scandinavian countries, the Netherlands gives more support

to multilateral organizations than do the big OECD donors. The

aim here is to broaden the group of favoured recipient countries

and influence the policy of the respective organization, especially

in alleviating poverty. Due to the way the Netherlands apportions

its contributions, and its voting power, it is easier for it to

do this under the rules of the UN system than through the finance

institutions. However, its critical assessment of the efficiency

of certain UN special organizations has recently led it to make

selective cuts in disbursements to them, while increasing its

commitments to the World Bank group and the regional banks and

their funds.

<P>

<B>Developmental concept is changing</B>

<P>

The Netherlands has neither a concept for development cooperation

in the sense of the German &quot;fundamental&quot; principles

nor a law covering it. Nevertheless, it has a clear and differentiated

conceptional guideline in the shape of the detailed introduction

and explanation of the summary of government spending on development

cooperation which is presented to Parliament every year. This

document includes the expert opinions of the <I>National Advisory

Council for Development Cooperation </I>(NAR), evaluation findings,

and specific policy papers which have attracted attention during

the course of the year. In this respect, the &quot;budget memoranda&quot;

are like a development cooperation concept that is reassessed

every year.

<P>

To be sure, there have seldom been radical changes in concepts.

In 1990, Development Minister Pronk tabled in Parliament the White

Paper &quot;A World of Difference&quot;, which expressly placed

sustainable poverty alleviation in the centre of development aid.

<P>

Moreover, four main crosssector tasks were defined and secured

in personnel terms. These are environmental protection, promotion

of women, developmentrelated research, and promotion of the urban

poor. These also serve as benchmarks for bilateral development

cooperation measures.

<P>

Pronk tabled another White Paper in 1993 titled &quot;A World

in Dispute&quot; in which he explained the new allocation categories

and country criteria mentioned above. He also renewed his approach

of the cross-ministry linking of development policy with other

policy areas.

<P>

<B>NGO participation</B>

<P>

What is also noteworthy in terms of concepts is the Netherlands'

system of financing NGO projects exclusively through the four

NGO umbrella organizations. Along with that is the successful

integration and participation in development cooperation of all

relevant social groups, including academics and scientists, via

the NAR. Its expert opinions are attentively noted by politicians

and the public.

<P>



<B>The development policy of the former German Democratic Republic

(GDR), or East Germany, was not constituted as an independent

entity. It was an integrated part of the country's foreign

policy, trade and cultural relations. Its trademark was supporting

decolonization processes and engaging in the southern dimension

of the East-West conflict. In the 1980s, the GDR's development

aid got into an increasingly difficult tightrope act of balancing

between foreign policy demands and economic policy constraints.</B>

<P>

Solidarity with the developing countries was a fundamental principle

of GDR foreign policy and a constitutional imperative. These rested

on the Marxist-Leninist perception of national liberation movements

as one of the three mainstreams of the worldwide revolutionary

movement. With such a political-ideological starting point, and

based on equal rights, non-discrimination and mutual advantage,

the GDR's development policy was to serve &quot;the consolidation

of political independence, the all round development of the national

economy and the social progress of the new states&quot;. The GDR's

understanding of the Third World's development problems was that

they could be resolved only by far-reaching social changes and

concomitant liberation from colonial and neocolonial dependence.

Towards that goal, the GDR provided considerable military aid

alongside its civil development assistance inputs. But that can't

be a subject of this analysis. For longer than in the West, the

GDR clung to development concepts oriented on industrialization.

A striving for international recognition and hopes of extending

the influence of &quot;world socialism&quot; stimulated the GDR's

development policy commitment. Self interest in foreign trade also

played a role, and became increasingly dominant. Eurocentrism

in foreign policy and its strained economic situation led the

GDR in the 1980s to giving its development policy lower status.

This process was advanced by disillusionment over the failures of socialist

development models in the Third World.

<P>

A GDR Council of Ministers decision in 1988 emphasized that development

aid &quot;is to be so provided that its effective employment is

in harmony with the macroeconomic interests of the GDR, its foreign

policy goals and the solidary support of the developing countries&quot;.

In practice, this demand on the developing countries to shape

a new and just form of economic relations was increasingly called

into question.

<P>

But at the end of the 1980s elements of new thinking also emerged

in which  independent of ideological dogma  global development

problems were made agenda points. A long term concept for Africa

of the foreign ministry in 1989 (before the fall of the Berlin

Wall) described the solution of global problems by cross system

cooperation as the most important task.

<P>

<B>Organisation structure</B>

<P>

In the GDR, development cooperation encompassed economic and scientific technological

support, including inputs of trade subsidies and humanitarian

aid.

<P>

The organization of the cooperation suffered from a lack of developmental

criteria, framework conditions, targets and monitoring. These

were only partly compensated for by system related, centralistic

management and monitoring. Central decisions on development policy

were taken either by the Politburo or the Secretariat of the Central

Committee (ZK) of the Social Unity Party (SED). Back in 1964,

the latter had laid down precise annual plans for the assistance

of social organizations and the monitoring of them. From 1977,

a commission chaired by the ZK Secretary for Economics, G&uuml;nter

Mittag, known as the &quot;Mittag Commission&quot;, had a decisive

influence on cooperation with the developing countries. Special

representatives of the party leadership and the government armed

with far reaching powers coordinated the cooperation with key countries.

It was only in 1988 that a determination (&quot;order&quot;) of

the State Planning Commission (SPK) fixed the coordination of

developmental measures at state level.

<P>

In the state area, the respective ministries had competence for

their corresponding fields of development cooperation. From 1960,

the development aid of social organizations was coordinated by

the &quot;Solidarity Committee&quot;, which  although officially

independent  was subordinated to the ZK of the SED. It was also

directed by the foreign ministry, and increasingly carried out

developmental tasks (in the 1980s, partly the financing of previously

state inputs in the education area). Of the numerous social organizations

that above all were active in the field of education and training,

the trade unions, which had the greatest donation revenues, and

the FDJ youth organization are worth a special mention.

<P>

With the exceptions mentioned below, there was no solidarity movement

in the sense of grass roots organizations in the GDR who would

take their own initiatives. Solidarity work in the social area,

including some considerable financial and material inputs, took

place within the parties, mass organizations, occupational and

specialist associations, factories and institutions. The money

for the work came from collections within factories and organizations,

but also from public fund raising campaigns. Grass roots groups

worked independently, partly under difficult conditions, in the

context or environment of the churches, e.g. the INKOTA network.

The churches themselves also carried out developmental work. Their

focal points were humanitarian and disaster aid. The Protestant

&quot;Brot f&uuml;r die Welt&quot; and the Roman Catholic &quot;Misereor&quot;

aid organizations are to be mentioned here. During the GDR's last

decade, the church organizations were also implementing their

first development projects in the Third World, e.g. the Gossner

Mission in Zambia.

<P>

Solidarity in the GPR also fulfilled a domestic political function.

The struggle of the liberation movements, the developing countries'

striving for greater political and economic independence were

propagated as successes of the worldwide revolutionary movement,

as proof of the truth of the state's own doctrine. In particular,

the struggle against colonialism and racism and the war in Vietnam

triggered a marked response among the East German people. This

was also expressed in a readiness to become personally involved

by making donations.

<P>

But here the state hindrance of self initiative, grass roots oriented

development cooperation unfortunately blocked an important GDR

developmental potential.

<P>

<B>Content design and profile</B>

<P>

The GDR identified as development cooperation cost-free assistance

and preferential prices, as well as government and special credits.

Free assistance included the supply of aid materials and goods,

vocational basic and advanced training, university and technical

college training, the secondment of experts, health care, government

grants and voluntary contributions to United Nations aid agencies.

<P>

Financial subsidies as the grant element of Financial Cooperation

were made apart from some exceptions  in nonconvertible currency,

often as supply of goods. Credits were granted mostly in nonconvertible

currency (the GDR mark, the transfer rouble), and were often tied

to the supply of GDR goods. Credit conditions were decided from

case to case at the political level and were oriented on the OECD's

ODA conditions for government development cooperation inputs.

Long term government credits (813 years, 2.53%) were mostly tied

to large scale projects. Besides short and medium term trade credits,

capital aid was donated in the context of the solidarity inputs.

In the late 1980s, preferential prices were also listed as aid.

These were extended to several GDR-friendly countries (Cuba and

Nicaragua above all) for selected raw materials, and were much

higher than world market prices.

<P>

In Technical Cooperation, basic and advanced training began in

1951 with a group of Nigerian students in the GDR. In 1962, there

were already almost 1,400 students from developing countries in

East Germany. In 1989, 6,800 were receiving university or technical

college training, of whom 2,500 came from LDC countries. In addition,

there were almost 5,000 scholarship holders in vocational training,

of whom more than 1,000 were from LDCs. Long term training dominated

in the GDR, and even the training programmes for skilled workers

lasted three years. In concept, the training was often oriented

on fields in which the GDR was pursuing specific interests in

investment projects or in trade. From the end of the 1970s, a

great number of workers from above all Vietnam, Mozambique, Cuba

and Angola worked under contract in the GDR. Originally construed

as training oriented, this foreign worker programme served as a

growing solution to the GDR's labour shortage problems and the

balancing of economic relations with the partner countries. Thereby

the hard currency revenues linked with this employment of foreign

workers were quite significant for the sending countries.

<P>

Initial and advanced training aid (including scholarships) was

mostly provided free. Economic constraints led from 1982 to the

GDR also offering the developing countries training inputs and

experts on a commercial basis in the context of a so called export

of intangibles. The step had only moderate success.

<P>

The assignment of experts was also mostly free. There was a special

programme for the provision of consultants and experts for African

countries as early as 1960. Chronic labour shortages and the security

regulations covering the selection of specialists hampered the

recruitment of experts for &quot;nonsocialist foreign countries&quot;

and made the fulfillment of contractual obligations a permanent

problem. Evaluations following the political change in the GDR

in the autumn of 1989 acknowledged that GDR scientific technical

cooperation projects had the right approaches, and that the experts

involved were committed and highly qualified. But there was criticism

that the projects were stamped too much by a &quot;GDR presence&quot;,

they fitted only with difficulty into local structures, the experts

were more active in the working process than as advisers, and

training of the partner was neglected.

<P>

The use of FDJ Friendship Brigades with the focus on vocational

training was efficient. A total of 16 vocational training centres

was set up, including Angola, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Tanzania and

Zimbabwe. Despite criticism about their sustainability, these

projects were in general given a positive assessment. From their

first deployment in Mali and Algeria in 1964, a total of 64 brigades

were active in 26 developing countries, involving at times about

300 young East Germans. In 1989, there were still 19 projects

in 11 countries. Of those, seven were given positive evaluations

following German unification, and these projects were actually

continued.

<P>

Joint economic committees covering 15 key countries, and mixed

commissions dealing with 30 others were to secure the complex

economic relations and also development cooperation. Specific

forms of cooperation such as preferential prices, barter trade

or the employment of foreign workers were due to the economic

problems of the GDR and its partners. These included a chronic

shortage of hard foreign currency and in part non-competitive products.

Out of similar difficulties, the two sides found suitable forms

of cooperation. Typical of these were projects implemented on

a compensation basis in which investments were repaid out of the

production of the project.

<P>

<B>Sectoral and regional distribution</B>

<P>

 The sectoral focal points of GDR development aid were partly key developmental areas. Agriculture, basic and advanced

training, vocational training, the public

health system, crafts and trades, infrastructure, sport and journalism. Technical,

mathematical and natural sciences dominated the basic and advanced training at

university and technical college levels with

definite developmental relevance.

<P>

Although the GDR carried out development cooperation with more than 100

countries, it was determined by political-ideological yardsticks and concentrated

on socialist countries and so called &quot;states

of socialist development&quot;. In 1988, 95 per

cent of the cooperation was accounted for

 by 11 countries and three liberation move

ments. These were Cuba, Vietnam, Mongolia, Laos, Cambodia, Angola, Mozambique, Ethiopia, South Yemen, Nicaragua,

Afghanistan and the ANC (South Africa),

SWAPO (Namibia) and the PLO. In the

pecking order of the key countries, Cuba

was way out front followed by Nicaragua,

Vietnam, Mozambique and Ethiopia.

<P>

The GDR's development cooperation was largely bilateral. The multilateral

share remained small. The Council for Mutual Economic Aid (Comecon)

did not develop any developmental components worth mentioning.

<P>

<B>Extent of the cooperation</B>

<P>

The dissimilarity of the concepts and structures of the GDR's

development policy with western standards, a lack of transparency,

the doubtfulness of some statistics, and also the different pricing

impede assessment of the country's development aid performance.

It was not until 1976 that the SED Politburo gave a green light for the first publishing

of selected, summarizing information on development cooperation.

In 1982, the Mittag Commission determined that the GDR's aid inputs

were to be registered more precisely and completely. The calculation

of the input value was to be based on UN criteria for ODA. A corresponding

summary for the Politburo in September 1982 posted aid levels

in 1981 totaling 1,529.7 million East German marks, equaling

0.78 per cent of national income.

<P>

When on April 4, 1989 the Politburo dealt for the last time with

the annual overview of the GDR's development cooperation, it showed

for 1988 inputs totaling 2,353.9 million marks. That sum was

put at 0.68 per cent of GNP.

<P>

For reasons already mentioned, it is difficult to compare the

GDR inputs with international yardsticks. Taking western parameters

into account (which, for instance, do not include preferential

prices), the OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) put

the annual level of GDR aid at only about $ 200 million. But it

also agreed there were fundamental problems in comparing the GDR

inputs with those of western industrial nations.

<P>

In the Technical Cooperation field, training and education took

first place. Thereby the following inputs were made during the

period 19701989:

<P>

<ul>

<li>university and technical college training - 25,000 students;

<P>

<li>training of specialists and managers - 95,000 persons;

<P>

<li>assignment of GDR experts - 26,000 persons.</UL>

<P>

In 1989, the number of foreign workers in the GDR in the context

of the &quot;guest worker&quot; programme totaled 86,650. Other

specific forms of GDR assistance, besides disaster aid and humanitarian

support, encompassed the free medical treatment of victims of

wars of liberation and civil conflicts (a total of about 10,000

treatments), and the acceptance of children for in school and subsequent

vocational training. The largest of the latter such projects,

for 900 children in Mozambique from 1982 to1988, was the subject

of controversy.

<P>

The GDR's development policy must be assessed in its historical

context and measured by the yardsticks of its concept and aspiration.

The GDR gave a limited number of politically determined partner

countries (including LDCs) and liberation movements partly effective

aid, above all with training inputs, goods supplies, preferential

prices and the assignment of experts. By utilizing its centralistic

structures, such development aid was often concentrated, efficient in terms

of time, and thereby employed politically effectively. Measured

by criteria of developmental efficiency and sustainability, deficits

are plain to see. For example, costly training inputs in the GDR

instead of sur place training, insufficient training of local experts

during the assignment of GDR specialists, problems due to a shortage

of foreign currency, etc. The GDR's development policy contributed

to strengthening the &quot;socialist camp&quot; and its allies,

but was also meant to help solve its own problems such as securing

raw materials supplies without having to spend foreign currency,

selling its own products and balancing its foreign trade.

<P>

The GDR gained prestige above all in the 1960s and 1970s by its

support of the liberation movements, by fast and also effective

aid in critical phases, and also by its promotion of particularly

politically or economically relevant projects, and in the basic

and advanced training field. The concentration of support on key

countries contributed to its efficiency and political spill over

effect. In the 1980s there was a real danger that the GDR would

lose this standing. The policy that was increasingly determined

by economic Self interest began to destroy the aura of altruism

around the GDR aid. The GDR's demands for a new international

economic order could now have hardly been asserted when its own

attitude towards Third World countries was examined.

<P>

<B>Epilogue</B>

<P>

With the political change in East Germany in 1989/1990, many development

policy structures broke away. The already mentioned grass roots

organizations close to the churches were instrumental in the reorganization

of NGO development cooperation. Following restructuring and renewal,

the &quot;Solidarity Committee&quot; has also continued its work

as the &quot;International Solidarity Service&quot;. New organizations

have come into being. The development policy Round Table played

an important role during the transition phase. The founding of

the &quot;North - South Bridges&quot; Foundation has secured the

use of former GDR developmental funds for NGOs in Eastern Germany.

All of this is now a part of the joint developmental efforts in

the enlarged Federal Republic of Germany.

<h3>PROGRAMME UPDATE 20</h3>
<i>The material that follows has been provided by</i> <a href="oxfam.html">Oxfam</a>
<hr>
<h2> ZAIRE - GOMA</h2>
<h3>Key developments</h3>
<p>
<ul><li>The UNHCR registration exercise has continued and
     Phase 2 involving cutting of wrist bands has now been
     completed in most camps.  Limited food distribution
     took place in all the camps due to the registration
     exercise.
<p>
<li>UNHCR continue with their policy of facilitation of
     voluntary repatriation. Information centres are still
     operating in the camps.  UNHCR have agreed to pay œ8.6
     million for 1,500 Zairean troops to protect more than
     a million refugees (1,000 in Goma and 500 in Bukavu)
     as part of a 'Zairean contingency for Security in the
     Camps.'  A special 30-50 member UNHCR liaison
     committee made up of international military 'experts'
     will work with the Zairean High Command on all aspects
     of the planning and implementation of the agreement. 
     Security posts will be set up in each refugee camp and
     the UN will fund all operational costs.
<p>
<li>The latest information on the situation with the two
     volcanoes in the region remains unsure but the
     situation continues to pose a very real threat..
<p>
<li>Work has started on the Bunagana route providing an
     alternative route from Uganda into Goma and will be
     completed by the end of February.  The first convoy
     from that direction is expected this week. 
</ul><p>
<h3>Oxfam's response</h3>
<p>
<ul><li>The water distribution system in Kahindo camp has been
     closed for short periods during the day to allow tanks
     to refill.  Investigations are being carried out to
     find out why the tanks have been running empty -
     whether it is due to increased consumption or reduced
     flow from the source.
<p>
<li>Oxfam is considering its own contingency plans in
     light of the predicted volcanic eruption as well as
     participating in an information campaign for local
     leaders and the Zairean population.  A grant for
     œ73,000 has been approved to provide emergency water
     equipment for 200,000 people.
<p>
<li>Oxfam is to set up contingency stocks of non-food
     items in the Masisi area where we have been working
     since 1993 with victims of civil war to be distributed
     to up to 50,000 displaced people.  
</ul><p>
<h4>TOTAL NO. OF REFUGEES IN GOMA</h4>

    Ces calculs sont int&eacute;gr&eacute;s pour r&eacute;aliser des simulations de bout en bout permettant l'&eacute;valuation de la qualit&eacute; d'image de l'ensemble de la cha&icirc;ne : instrument, satellite, traitements au sol (MERIS) . La grande quantit&eacute; et la vari&eacute;t&eacute; des param&egrave;tres de simulation conduisent &agrave; l'utilisation d'outils sophistiqu&eacute;s de gestion de bases de donn&eacute;es  et d'interfaces utilisateurs graphiques.

    <STRONG>SECTEUR TERRIEN</STRONG>
    <P>
      Un d&eacute;bouch&eacute; important pour les activit&eacute;s de simulation est la r&eacute;alisation des cha&icirc;nes  op&eacute;rationnelles de traitement au sol. Les simulateurs d&eacute;crits ci-dessus faisant office de prototype et d'outil d'aide &agrave; la mise au point, ces cha&icirc;nes de traitement sont ensuite sp&eacute;cifi&eacute;es et r&eacute;alis&eacute;es (instruments MERIS, MIMR pour le compte de  l'Agence Spatiale Europ&eacute;enne).

      Une cha&icirc;ne de traitement au sol comporte :
    <ul>
      <li> l'exploitation automatis&eacute;e des donn&eacute;es provenant de l'instrument ; traitements op&eacute;rationnels, support &agrave; l'&eacute;talonnage et aux traitements exp&eacute;rimentaux ;
      <li> Gestion de l'archivage : donn&eacute;es brutes, produits finis ;
      <li> Gestion des services aux utilisateurs : catalogage, diffusion des produits
    </ul>

    La r&eacute;alisation de ces simulateurs et cha&icirc;nes de traitement sol est principalement ax&eacute;e sur l'oc&eacute;anographie spatiale :
    <ul>
      <li> Couleur de l'eau (MERIS, POLDER)
      <li> Temp&eacute;rature de l'eau, interface atmosph&egrave;re-oc&eacute;an (MIMR).
    </ul>
  </P>
    <BR><BR>
    <STRONG>EXPLOITATION</STRONG>
    <P>
      Le troisi&egrave;me volet de l'activit&eacute; spatiale concerne la phase d'exploitation de donn&eacute;es de t&eacute;l&eacute;d&eacute;tection :
    <ul>
      <li> D&eacute;finition d'architecture logicielle pour l'interpr&eacute;tation d'images a&eacute;riennes
      <li> D&eacute;tection automatique des contours sur cartographie
      <li> D&eacute;veloppement de syst&egrave;mes experts en oc&eacute;anographie spatiale (incluant fusion de donn&eacute;es, param&eacute;trisation des formes, statistique du comportement, syst&egrave;me de classification) ; 
      <li> Algorithmique et traitement du signal : outil d'aide &agrave; la reconnaissance de signatures ;
      <li> Identification de param&egrave;tres physiques signifiants et s&eacute;lection des bases de donn&eacute;es y donnant acc&egrave;s.
    </ul>

<p>
Presently there is considerable discussion both in scientific and industrial circles as  how best to limit anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide due to its role in global atmospheric greenhouse warming. A wide range of technologies are being investigated that increase the efficiency of electrical production, decrease the energy needed to power electrical components, limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions etc. etc.
</p>
<p>
Under the aegis of National activites, as well as The International Energy Agency  (IEA) Greenhouse Gas Programme,  research  is also being conducted into a broad range of mitigation options and future R&D requirements, including policy and  market implications. A large number of political and industrial considerations  will have to be taken into account if a formulation of global priorities are eventually to be agreed. Whether events will lead to the need for such a formulation is clearly not possible to forecast at present,  it will probably depend on political, social and industrial conditions that might occur if global climatic change were to be demonstrated in an clear and unequivocal manner, and a serious attempt to decrease carbon dioxide emissions were considered necessary.
</p>
<p>
One series of options that have attracted considerable attention are those of separation and disposal of carbon dioxide. Among others these  range from the use of  aquifers, storage combined with enhanced oil recovery, pumping into empty gas reservoirs, and ocean disposal. In the recent IEA international Conference on Greenhouse Gases Mitigation Options (London, August 1995) this latter option was considered a scientifically elegant CO2 mitigation option for the deep ocean in that it accelerates the natural process of transfer of carbon dioxide to the ocean. It was clearly stated, however, that a full understanding of the complex chemical, biological and oceanographic factors has to be acquired before proposing such an option.
</p>
<p>
Under such conditions what is the potential role of industry, given that the lead times to develop new products is long and costly, and where funding for research is increasingly competitive?  One answer is to contribute to these scientific discussions with ideas that could be perhaps eventually implemented  industrially, and which help maintain and strengthen links between industry and science in the area of Global Change.
</p>
<p>
An example of this type of activity is the work that ACRI has been undertaking concerning the use of solid carbon dioxide penetrators for the disposal of this atmospheric gas in deep ocean sedimentary formations. This idea has been proposed as an industrial patent by the Joint Research Centre, Ispra, Italy. ACRI in collaboration with Ecole Nationale Superieure de Techniques Avancees, Paris, France, has developed a preliminary conceptual design of an industrial disposal system. Some of the more fundamental science considerations have been investigated by the Joint Research Centre, Commission of the European Communities and the Italian aero-space firm Aermacchi. The results of these studies were presented at the recent IEA Greenhouse Gas Conference in London, UK.
</p>
<p>
It needs to be clearly stated that under present international legislation (United Nation Convention on the Law Of the Sea UNCLOS, London Dumping Convention etc.) such a disposal option would not be presently permitted. Further, any proposed use of deep sub-seabed geological formations is one that would need a global social consensus which would be unlikely without unequivocal demonstration as to its long term safety and overall benefit to society.
</p>
<p>
However, it needs to be underlined that from a purely technical point of view the proposed solution should, if proven feasible and safe, effectively isolate the carbon dioxide from the overlying ocean waters using the natural barrier properties of the surrounding stable soft clay or carbonate rich sediments. Thus the risk of the eventual return of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through upwelling of ocean waters can be effectively excluded. Disposal would thus be permanent. A further advantage could be the creation of a waste disposal industry using this type of technology and financed on the polluter-payer principle. The technology appears to be easily within present day carbon dioxide industrial engineering capabilities. Whether in view of the volumes of waste material potentially involved such a solution would be economically viable is clearly at present difficult to assess.
</p>
<p>
As an example of an industrial-scientific contribution to international considerations on possible  mitigation options, the present preliminary studies aim at focusing  discussions on the long-term storage capabilities of deep marine geological formations. Whether this or any other option is eventually considered acceptable or not depends on open discussion by all sectors of society of the advantages and weaknesses of all the alternatives. 
</p>
<p>
A detailed description of the penetrator option and a conceptual design of an industrial disposal system, as well as the justification for the industrial JRC patent application  are shown below.

	    <B>ACRI</B> functions under a unified management structure, with
	    operations located in Sophia Antipolis (France). It employs a matrix
	    organization, that is, a combination of functional or line sections,
	    and of a project team.

	    <P>

	      ACRI has a wide experience in remote sensing system requirements,
	      analysis and ground segment design, mission analysis and requirements.

	    <P>

	      ACRI has also a wide experience in a variety of space problems such as
	      overall mission performances, orbital properties generator, spacecraft
	      axes steering control, signal characteristics to be detected on top of
	      the atmosphere, geometrical and radiometric instrument features and
	      distortion, and on ground processing algorithms needed to retrieve
	      accurate Earth and environmental signal and geophysical parameters.

	    <P>

	      In particular, ACRI has been continuously involved in mission analysis
	      tasks such as identification of optimal and attitude parameters for
	      Earth observation; optimisation of instrument mission performance:
	      coverage, signal dynamics characterisation on top of the atmosphere,
	      sampling geometry and signal quality, pointing accuracy and on board
	      calibration procedure. For instance, ACRI has performed the mission
	      analysis and requirements for MERIS, MIMR, MIPAS,
	      GOMOS,... instruments during the POEM-1/ENVISAT-1 Pre-Phase-A, Phase-A
	      and Phase-B. All the scientific and technical reports have been issued
	      to the ESA Scientific Advisory Groups (SAGs) members.

	    <P>

	      Furthermore, ACRI is well acquainted with the Earth observation
	      science community. As such ACRI has co-operation agreements with
	      laboratories in France (such as Service d'A&eacute;ronomie: J-L. Bertaux,
	      Institut Laplace: G. Megie, Laboratoire de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie
	      Dynamique:
	      N.A. Scott, P. Flament, Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie Marine:
	      A. Morel, Laboratoire d'Optique Atmosph&eacute;rique: 
	      D.Tanr&eacute;,....., Ecole
	      des Mines de Paris: L. Wald) and European laboratories such as Finnish
	      Meteorological Institute: G. Leppelmeier, Free University of Berlin:
	      J. Fischer, GKSS: H. Grassl, Plymouth Marine Laboratory: J. Aiken, UK
	      Meteorological Office: P.  Curtis, Institut d'A&eacute;ronomie Spatiale de
	      Bruxelles: P. Simon...

	    <P>

	      ACRI is leading the project "Integration of remote sensing, in-situ
	      observations and numerical modelling applied to the northeast
	      Atlantic" in the frame of the "Human capital and mobility" initiative
	      of the CEC. ACRI is participating in the OCEAN project of the CEC
	      Joint Research Centre.  ACRI experience can be summarised in six types
	      of activities:

	    <UL>
	      <LI>i. User requirements: ACRI is currently in charge for
		the EUMETSAT Ground Segment support of the coordination with the users
		community. ACRI is involved with JRC in pilot projects, part of the
		Centre for Earth Observation (CEO) project, in charge of the
		collection of user requirements from experimental community on coastal
		zones;

	      <LI>ii. Mission Analysis: ACRI has been continuously involved in
		mission analysis tasks such as identification of optimal orbit and
		attitude parameters for Earth observation (yaw steering, ESA study);
		optimisation of instrument mission and performance: coverage, signal
		dynamics characterisation, sampling geometry and signal quality,
		pointing accuracy,... for instruments studied during the POEM-1 phase
		B: MERIS, MIMR, MIPAS;

	      <LI>iii. Ground processing: ACRI has performed the
		definition study for engineering and scientific data products of MERIS
		and MIMR instruments in the frame of POEM Ground Segment Phase B study
		(ESA contract led by Logica, MDA). To satisfy the global requirements,
		the MERIS and MIMR instrument operation will be permanent. All
		corresponding data should be acquired, processed following various
		levels, and disseminated in due time to user point of contact.


		<P>

		  ACRI is currently in charge of the complete definition of the
		  data processing chain of the GOMOS and MERIS instruments; the
		  definition covers all necessary processing steps from the raw data to
		  the generation of the geophysical products. (e.g. the MERIS Ocean
		  Colour products such as chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll
		  fluorescence, type and Optical depth of marine aerosols or the GOMOS
		  ozone or aerosols vertical profiles among others).

		<P>

		  It includes the MERIS and GOMOS overall ground processing
		  architecture, detailed design, development plan, products and
		  algorithms definition specifications. The documentation follows ESA
		  Software Engineering Standards and Product Assurance Quality.
		<P>

	      <LI>
		iv. Guidance and Control:
		<P>ACRI has performed studies on MIPAS
		  instrument pointing requirements in order to aim at a stable
		  tangential altitude. ACRI has also performed, with the Laboratoire
		  d'Automatique de Nantes, a study on Guidance Navigation and Control
		  for moderate lift/drag Re-entry, applied to aero-assisted orbit
		  transfer (ESA Contract March 1991).  v. Navigation: ACRI has modelised
		  6 D.O.F. trajectories applied to as various subjects as a spacecraft
		  attitude, ship precise positioning (French Navy contract), re-entry in
		  the atmosphere .  vi. System Software: ACRI has developed general
		  purpose software in the fluid dynamics and combustion (ANSWER), ground
		  water (PORFLOW), surface and marine waters (TIDAL), atmosphere (RADM),
		  guidance and control (ANACOM), and Earth Observation (EOSS)
		  fields. This activity includes software sells, users training and
		  maintenance.
		<P>
		  ACRI has specified the software requirements for the future
		  MIMR end to end system simulator during the Phase-B of the MIMR study
		  (ALENIA Contract, 1991-2);
		  ACRI has performed under contract with DORNIER :
		  MERIS mission performances and end to end system simulator
		  (including on ground processing until level 2) development .
		  GOMOS mission performances and end to end system simulator
		  (including on ground processing until level 2) development.

	    </UL>

	    <I> A common concept is being developed for remote sensing
	      instrument simulators. The objectives generally recognised are to
	      assess end-to-end performance of the remote sensing process in order
	      to:
	      verify instrument and ground processing performance against
	      the mission objectives
	      provide feedback to the instrument design and tuning
	      provide a reference and support tool for the validation of the
	      mission ground segment in development, delivery and in-orbit operation
	      phases The simulator includes mathematical models for 1) signal (raw
	      data) generated from various Earth, atmosphere, etc. targets emitting
	      signal including environmental conditions (sun illumination, satellite
	      orbit motion, satellite axes steering control, target environment,
	      signal propagation...).  2) instrument hardware and electronic chain
	      simulator (MTF) generating instrument outputs from given reference
	      inputs signal (incident flux at the top of the atmosphere).  3) ground
	      processing simulator generating from raw data the data product
	      processed and calibrated on ground. These processes require to inverse
	      the geometric, radiometric and instrument transfer function using
	      dedicated deconvolution methods.  The mathematical models are
	      supported by a common infrastructure of data management and user
	      interface, tools supporting simulation results analysis such as image
	      quality assessment.  </I>

<LI> Emission height = 0.0 m
<LI> Equivalent diameter = 21.4 m
<LI> Temperature = 302 K
</UL>

The freeway traffic is simulated thanks to a set of discrete sources located all along the several lanes. In this study, 392 equivalent sources have been used.<P>

At each source, 0.32 g/s of pollutant is injected in the computational domain for the South and North lanes of the A86 freeway and 0.63 g/s is injected for the South and North lanes of the A4 freeway.<P>

The numerical simulations have been performed in a first step by taking into account the pollution induced by the freeway alone (see figures 1 and 3) and in a second step by adding the pollution due to the A4 freeway tunnels. The increase of NO2 concentration due to these tunnels is visible in the figure 2. Several wind speeds and direction and several atmospheric stabilities have been used to estimate their impact upon the NO2 concentration around the exits of the A4 tunnels.<P>

<H1> Seiche in PORT TUDY <P>
(GROIX ISLAND)
</H1>

<HR>
</CENTER>

<big>
The water surface of "PORT TUDY" (the Groix Island harbour situated few kilometers south of Britain in France) is sometimes subject to oscillations induced by a long period oscillation water wave, also called a seiche. The seiche is set between the continent and the island and has a period of five minutes. The wave amplitude may be greater than one meter, so that strong currents may be generated inside the harbour.<P>

Modulus of velocity (considered constant on the depth) inside the harbour are reported on the picture below. It is possible to follow the corresponding animation for a complete period of the seiche.

      <H1>Guidance and Control for Moderate Lift/Drag Reentry</H1>
      <img src="/gifs/bar_marbre_noir2.gif"><BR><BR>

      <BIG>
	The purpose of this study consists in analysing guidance and control
	methods for space vehicles during the atmospheric phases of change of
	orbit. The analysis will be based on the definition of a moderate
	Lift/Drag ratio vehicle carrying out AOTV (aero-assisted orbit
	transfer vehicle) type missions. An orbit change from a high circular
	geostationary orbit to a low circular orbit having an altitude of 400
	km and an inclination of 28.5 deg will be analysed.

      <P>

	The main objective of entry into the atmosphere during AOTV manoeuvre
	is to dissipate the substantial initial orbital energy. This energy
	loss is effected by reducing the speed of the spacecraft through the
	action of aerodynamic forces that will act on it during the
	atmospheric phase.

	In an orbital-change type mission, the global objective is to reach a
	low circular recovery orbit characterised by a given orbital
	energy. The atmospheric phase must therefore be adjusted so that the
	vehicle is in an energy state that corresponds to the final desired
	orbit.

      <P>

	Through the use of flexible guidance and control methods, this
	objective is reached by commanding to the spacecraft the attitude it
	must adopt when it meets the atmosphere, so as to control the
	aerodynamic forces that will reduce its energy.

      <P>

	The <B>transition</B> from a high circular geostationary orbit to a low
	circular orbit for vehicles of the AOTV type is divided into several
	phases:

      <OL>

	<LI>i) application of a de-orbiting pulse DVd 

	<LI>ii) atmospheric phase: the guidance and control laws make use of
	  the aerodynamic forces to reduce the energy of the spacecraft.

	<LI>iii) application of a pulse DV1 on exit from the atmosphere: a
	  boost of energy is applied to the spacecraft so that it may exactly
	  reach the desired apogee.

	<LI>iv) application of an impulse DV11 which circularises the
	  trajectory on the desired low orbit.

      </OL>

	<B>Figure 1 :</B> Transition from a high circular geostationary
	orbit to a low circular orbit for AOTV
      </CENTER>

      <P>
	An algorithm of Near Optimal Guidance (NOG) has been studied, based on
	considerations of NLP (Non Linear Programming) and of cost
	function. This tool, which enables reference trajectories to be
	created. This law of NOG will be considered as a self-adaptable
	guidance technique, such as following guidance techniques : trajectory
	tracking, sliding modes, predictor corrector, and asymptotic
	expansions. Apart from the predictor corrector and the NOG, the other
	guidance laws require a reference trajectory, and can be applied in
	terms of energy, altitude, or other physical entity, such as, for
	example, density or drag.

      <P>

	The main objective of the guidance laws is to fulfil the mission in
	terms of the apogee by controlling the aerodynamic forces acting in
	the orbital plane: this mission will be quantified by the impulse DV1
	to be applied to the spacecraft at atmosphere exit. The mission is
	successful when DV1 = 0.

      <P>

	Disturbances occurring during flight, relating to uncertainties of
	modeling and to ambient conditions, such as winds, atmospheric density
	variations, and uncertainties on vehicle data, together with
	uncertainty on the state-vector of the spacecraft will impair success
	of the mission insofar as the guidance laws will no longer satisfy DV1
	=0.

      <P>



	<CENTER>

	  <IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="gnc.gif" ALT="GNC Drawing">

      <P>

	<B>Figure 2 :</B> The vertical guidance logic is based on the
	control of the aerodynamic forces in the orbital plane.
      </CENTER>

      <P>
	It is therefore imperative to define an interval [ -DV1 acc ; DV1 acc
	] acceptable in terms of the mission, such that the value of DV1 acc
	may be considered as being close to zero, knowing that the orders of
	magnitude for DVd (de-orbiting pulse) and DV11 (circularisation pulse)
	are 1500 and 100 m/s in the case of an orbit change from a high
	geostationary-type orbit towards a low circular orbit.

      <P>

	DV1 acc = 20 m/s is a criterion of mission-success compatible with the
	value of DVd, and represents only 1/5 of the value of the
	circularisation pulse DV11.

      <P>

	The second objective of the guidance laws is to make the final orbit
	coincide with the initial one, that is to say that the inclination of
	the orbit and the longitude of the ascending node of the final orbit
	are identical with those of the initial orbit. This double condition
	may be reduced to a single condition, that of making zero the value of
	the wedge angle h that represents the angle between the initial and
	final orbital planes. Lateral guidance must be capable of ensuring
	this by controlling the forces acting in a direction perpendicular to
	the orbital plane.

      <P>

	For h = 0.1 deg, the positional error at the end of the atmospheric
	phase is of the order of 11 km. This value is to be compared with the
	uncertainties of knowing the position, which on board navigation can
	only furnish at best with a 5 km margin.

      <P>

	Thus, for h less than 0.1 deg, the position error is of the same order
	of magnitude as the uncertainties on knowledge of the position, and,
	in this case, the final orbit will be considered identical with the
	initial orbit. The maximum heating rate HRmax along the trajectory
	does not involve closed-loop control by the algorithm during the
	atmospheric phase. It thus enables the heating induced by the guidance
	to be taken into account, but not used in the feedback loop.

      <P>

	The two criteria DV1 and h that permit evaluation of the guidance laws
	are linked with the trajectory of the mass-centre of the
	spacecraft. The evolution of the mass-centre depends on the
	aerodynamic attitude which is determined by the desired angle of
	attack a, sideslip angle b, and bank angle s. The angle of attack is
	kept constant for AFE, and determines the lift/drag ratio. The
	sideslip angle is kept at 0 so as not to create any lateral
	forces. The lift and drag aerodynamic forces are thus contained in the
	symmetry plane of the spacecraft.

      <P>

	The bank angle is derived from the guidance laws, it positions the
	space-craft's vertical axis with reference to the earth's vertical
	axis, and ensures the mission during the atmospheric phase : DV1 = 0
	and h = 0.

      <P>

	The objective of control laws is to ensure that the attitude of the
	spacecraft agrees with the attitude dictated by the guidance laws: a =
	a0, b = b0 and s = sguidance. A trade-off analysis will be performed
	between the different adaptive control techniques : gain scheduling
	(GS), self tuning regulators (STR), and model reference adaptive
	system (MRAS).

      <P>

	Control of the spacecraft attitude is obtained by the application of
	torques with respect to the axes of the spacecraft frame. These
	torques are supplied by the thrusters, whose mode of operation is of
	the ON or OFF type. A modulator transforms the continuous torque
	coming from control into a pulse train for each thruster. The fuel
	consumption linked to the activity of the thrusters is estimated and
	will be considered as a criterion allowing qualification of the
	control laws for a given guidance law.

      <P>

	As a main output of the study, a simulation software has been
	developed so as to assess the performances of various guidance and
	control laws.

	The Medium Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MERIS) belongs to a new
	generation of ocean colour sensors ; leading to an improved bio
	/geophysical characterisation of oceans and coastal zones, it also
	provides information in atmospheric and land applications.

      <P>

	MERIS is a push-broom instrument and measures the reflected radiation
	from the Earth's surface and from clouds through the atmosphere in the
	visible and near infrared range during daytime. The 1150 km wide swath
	is divided into 5 segments covered by 5 identical cameras having
	corresponding field of views with a slight overlap between adjacent
	cameras. The cameras view the Earth through 5 polarisation scrambling
	windows and five mirror elements. Each camera images the Earth on the
	entrance slit of a spectrometer. The area of the Earth seen
	instantaneously forms an across track stripe. This stripe is imaged on
	a CCD-line. The spectrum of each element in the Earth image is
	dispersed on a corresponding CCD column. The spatial resolution along
	track is determined by successive read-outs of the CCD-array. Full
	spatial resolution data, i.e. 300 m at nadir, will be transmitted over
	coastal zones and land surfaces. Reduced spatial resolution data
	i.e. 1200 m at nadir, will be transmitted continuously. These data
	will be processed in flight and on ground to provide spectral images
	of the Earth corrected for atmospheric influence. After correction,
	the main geo-physical parameters which can be derived from MERIS
	measurements are :

      <P>

      <UL>

	<LI>ocean colour parameters in open waters and coastal waters :
	  chlorophyll, gelbstoffe, other pigments, suspended solid matter ;

	<LI>simple qualitative parameters : presence of clouds, emerged land ;

	<LI>atmosphere parameters : Aerosol optical thickness, &Aring;ngstr&ouml;m
	  exponent ; Cloud albedo, optical thickness, top pressure ; Water
	  vapour column contents.

      </UL>


      To meet the very stringent specifications, atmospheric effects and
      radiometric and geometric distortions induced by the image acquisition
      process must be corrected for. While the atmospheric correction is
      carried out during data processing on ground, instrument
      characteristics are partly rectified in flight during calibration. In
      this mode correction parameters such as offset and gain are generated
      to improve the digitised signal values by computation on board.

      <P>

	A typical set of MERIS spectral bands, as reviewed by the ESA advisory
	group at the workshop of Villefranche in 1991, is given in table
	I, together with their envisaged application. The centre
	frequencies and the bandwidths are programmable in flight, by
	telecommand. The main performance parameters of MERIS are presented in
	table II.

      <H1>MERSS : The MERIS System Simulator</H1>

      The MERIS system simulator provides support for end-to-end performance
      evaluation of the MERIS instrument and on-ground processing.
      It does so by :
      <OL>

	<LI>managing a set of targets ;

	<LI>simulating the image formation process within the instrument ;

	<LI>performing the ground segment software functions which
	  contribute to image production.

      </OL>

      Performance evaluation is based on qualitative and quantitative
      evaluation of the difference between the original target parameters
      set, and the results of processing by instrument and ground segment
      sub-models, as shown the follozing figure.

      <CENTER>
	<B>Figure :</B> Performance Evaluation levels
      </CENTER>

      <P>

	The modular structure of the simulator allows to do such comparisons
	at several different stages of the image production process.
	This is intended to help evaluate the contribution of each stage :
	satellite, instrument, on-ground processing, to the overall system
	performance. 

      <P>

	Intermediate results, in particular internal parameters of the 
	instrument sub-model, are produced as intermediate results to
	help trouble-shooting.

      <P>
	
	The selected targets provide a sub-set of the possible scenes 
	viewed by MERIS, which is meaning fulfrom the point of view 
	of performance evaluation by referring to the evaluation conditions ;
	from the point of view of instrument calibration and testing
	on ground and in flight.

      <P>

	The complete imaging process is simulated and includes the flight 
	of the instrument above the Earth, the pointing perturbations due 
	to the Platform, the collection of light by the sensors and the 
	electrical processing on board, and the digital data processing 
	on board and on ground.

      <P>

	Several modes of simulation are provided in order to support :

      <OL>

	<LI>realistic simulation of the MERIS instrument operations : 
	  imaging, calibration ;

	<LI>investigation of local as well as global effects.

      </OL>

      <BIG>
	The GOMOS instrument has been designed to measure trace gas
	concentrations and other atmospheric parameters in the altitude range
	between 20 and 100 km. In addition to the main goal of monitoring
	ozone long term trends, the GOMOS near-IR spectrometers will measure
	O2 and H2O, from which density and temperature profiles can be
	obtained, which are of interest in atmospheric modelling, but will
	also improve the quality of the ozone retrieval. At the same time two
	fast photometer channels will produce information about atmospheric
	fluctuations, again of interest both for basic atmospheric modelling,
	but above all useful in the reduction of the ozone-related data.

      <p align=center>
	<img alt=GOMOS Satellit src="/gifs/GOMOS2.gif"><br><br>
	<b>Figure 1 </b>: GOMOS<BR>
      </P>
      <P>

	About 25 stars brighter than MV=2 can routinely be observed, at
	different longitudes from each orbit. With typically 14 orbits/day
	the GOMOS instrument will thus produce as much data as a global
	network of 360 ground stations. Depending on the mode and goals
	of observation, some 100-200 stars are candidates for GOMOS
	occultation observation.  

      <P>

	Because of interference from scattered sunlight, fewer stars can be
	observed in bright limb occultation than in dark limb.  In dark limb
	occultation the limiting considerations are quality of spectral
	information and the ability of the tracking system to maintain lock.
	Hotter stars give better spectral signal-to-noise ratio, and thus are
	better for ozone measurements.  At the same time, for a fixed
	brightness, such stars have fewer photons in the range used by the
	star tracker. Given the starting time of an occultation and the time
	required to move the input mirror from the end point of one
	occultation to the beginning of the next, it is not possible in
	practice to observe all possible stars in one occultation.  Therefore,
	selection is necessary.

      <P>

	This is accomplished by establishing selection criteria, such as 
	brightness, next available star, maximum intensity in a particular
	wavelength region, etc., which allow a list generator to create
	scenario of observations for one orbit. The instrument optical
	design is based on a single telescope concept : the telescope
	simultaneously feeds a Ultra violet-Visible medium resolution
	spectrometer, a near-infrared high resolution spectrometer,
	a fast photometer equipped with two spectral channels, and a
	CCD-based star tracker. The latter provides the tracking accuracy
	required to maintain the star image at the centre of the
	spectrometers entrance slit during the occultation observation.

      <P>

	The steering front assembly is made of one flat mirror mounted
	on a 2-stage mechanism. The first stage is an open loop orientator, 
	used to move the instrument line of sight from one star for which 
	the occultation is completed to the next star to be occulted. 
	The orientator is then blocked for the duration of the occultation. 
	The second phase is the tracking device, based on a closed control 
	loop using the star tracker data. It is operated during the 
	occultation phase, in a reduced window (7  in azimuth and 4 
	in elevation), and provides the fine centring of the star image
	within the spectrometers entrance slit. 

      <P>

	The thermally controlled optical bench and the telescope are mounted 
	on a fixed part on the instrument interface plate, used also to 
	support several electronic units for data handling, command and 
	control, and power distribution. An opto-mechanical cover is put 
	around both optical and steering front assemblies to provide the 
	adequate straylight and thermal baffling.

      <P>

	The scientific data are suitably filtered, digitised and multiplexed 
	into a single data stream of constant rate at the platform interface.
	The instrument operates largely autonomously and only requires once
	every 36 hours uploading of the instrument pointing and observation
	program.

      <P>

	The instrument measurement characteristics are listed in tables I.

	Finally, two features characterise the GOMOS instrument allowing to 
	reach its expected performance :

      <UL>
	<LI>The instrument is self-calibrating by measuring the star spectrum
	  outside and through the atmosphere.
	<LI>The stellar and background spectra are simultaneously recorded, 
	  allowing to correct for background or straylight as well as dark
	  current contributions.

      <H1>GOMOS System Simulator</H1>

      The GOMOS system simulator provides support for end-to-end performance
      evaluation of the GOMOS instrument and on-ground processing.
      It does so by :
      <OL>

	<LI>managing a set of targets ;

	<LI>simulating the star and background spectrum formation process, as
	  well as the scintillation and depointing of the star image, within
	  the instrument ;

	<LI>performing the ground segment software functions which contribute
	  to product generation.

      </OL>

      Performance evaluation is based on qualitative and quantitative
      evaluation of the difference between the original target parameters
      set, and the results of processing by instrument and ground segment
      sub-models, as shown in following figure.
      

      Figure Performance Evaluation levels

      The modular structure of the simulator allows to perform such
      comparisons at several different stages of the data processing. This
      is intended to help evaluate the contribution of each stage :
      satellite, instrument, on-ground processing, to the overall system
      performance.

      <P>

	Intermediate results, in particular internal parameters of the
	instrument sub-model, are available as intermediate results to help
	trouble-shooting.

      <P>

	The selected targets provide a wide choice of stars and atmosphere
	configuration which may be observed by GOMOS, which is meaningful 
      <UL>

	<LI>from the point of view of performance evaluation ;

	<LI>from the point of view of instrument calibration and testing on
	  ground and in flight.

      </UL>

      The complete imaging process is simulated and includes the apparent
      movement of the star, the limb conditions where the star is viewed,
      the pointing perturbations resulting from the GOMOS pointing
      sub-system interaction with the external world, the collection of
      light by the sensors and the electrical processing on board, and the
      digital data processing on board and on ground.

      <P>

	Several modes of simulation are provided in order to support :
      <OL>

	<LI>realistic simulation of the various GOMOS instrument operations :
	  occultation, calibration

	<LI>investigation of local as well as global effects

	<LI>investigation of mission strategies by allowing to build and test
	  observation scenarios

      </OL>

      The GOMOS System Simulator is a software application capable of
      running in stand-alone mode and to manage interfaces to the external
      world. It runs and manages its data on a single host computer. Its
      user interface allows to prepare, operate simulations of the GOMOS
      system in various configurations, and to process and analyse the
      simulation results. Its data management allows to exchange data and
      results with other components of the GOMOS system environment
      (e.g. ground processing).

      <P>

	The GOMOS simulator does not operate in real time. Instead, the
	continuous processes which it models are broken into discrete,
	elementary operations. The simulation time is modelled by a set of
	counters, each linked to a pre-set time scale : spacecraft orbital
	movement, star image formation, CCD sensor cycle, etc.

	The main function of the simulator is to compute images, representing
	the Earth scene scanned by the remote sensing instrument, as well as
	the image acquired by the instrument.

      <P>

	The system simulated includes: the Earth target, the satellite motion,
	the instrument, and the on-ground data processing. This
	process figures a chain of signal processing, where each step
	corresponds to a type of image. In the simulator, there are in general
	two images of each type. One corresponds to the simulated "truth", one
	to the remotely sensed image.

      <P>

	The ocean colour remote sensing simulator will include all steps up to
	and including geometrical corrections. Level 2 processing is not
	included in the simulator, which nevertheless provides all facilities
	to run an atmosphere correction and geo-physical processing on its
	outputs.

      <P>

	A complete image simulation requires a large amount of processing
	resources. The simulator shall be organised so that a user can fully
	prepare a simulation execution by setting the simulation parameters,
	then run the simulation with very little interaction (including
	"batch" modes). At the end of the computations several images and data
	are available for analysis. So the input "truth" image can be compared
	to the output image of the same level.

      <P>

	By running several simulations with variations of a sub-set of input
	parameters, one can directly investigate the impact of a parameter on
	the global system performance.

      <P>

	Input parameters allow to control the behaviour of all the numerical
	models included in the simulator. Some parameters are organised in
	bi-dimensional images, fed at the input of the simulation process,
	such as for instance the water constituents concentrations
	(chlorophyll, yellow substance...).

      <P>

	Other parameters are scalar, vectors or matrices and represent a
	physical or logical value, constant for a given simulation. Every
	simulation will allow the modification of all input parameters.

<BIG>

SIMAC (which stands for SIMulateur d'Am&eacute;nagements C&ocirc;tiers) is a simulator for wave propagation from the open sea to the coastal structures (natural or artificial). It is based on the coupling of two algorithms that allow to take into account all the physical phenomena affecting the wave propagation in shallow water and near the coastal structures.<P>

First, the wave propagation from the open sea to the neighbouring of the area to study (typically an harbour and/or a beach)) is simulated. This first computation gives the characteristics of the incident wave at the entrance of the second simulated area. A fine calculation is then performed in this second domain which takes into account the partiel reflexion on physical boundaries, the diffraction and the refraction.<P>

The first algorithm may use the classical ray tracing computation (refraction only). If it is necessary to include diffraction in the simulation, the combined refraction-diffraction problem may be solved by two manners: <P>

The resolution of the parabolic form of the Berkhoff's equation by using a finite difference approach.<P>

The setting-up of finite element method and a splitting of the domain by submodels. This last method is more accurate especially for complicated bathymetry.<P>

In the port or near the shore, the Berkhoff's equation is also solved with finite elements. The final result is the wave field at any point at the domain.

	PORFLOW is a comprehensive computer program for simulation of transient or steady state flow, heat, salinity and mass transport in multi-phase, variably saturated, porous or fractured media with dynamic phase change.<P>

	The geometry may be 2D or 3D, Cartesian or cylindrical, the porous/fractured media may be anisotropic and heterogeneous, arbitrary sources of sinks (injection or pumping wells) may be present and, chemical reactions or radioactive decay may take place. It accommodates alternate fluid and media property relations and boundary conditions.<P>

	It is a highly modular program which has been applied to a wide range of practical problems in petrochemical, hydrological, geological, nuclear and chemical industry applications. Typical petrochemical industry application include ground water pollution and resource management, disposal and management of hazardous wastes, environmental impact of hot or cold pipes buried in geologic media, thawing/freezing of permafrost in terrestrial or marine environment, flow in porous beds, formation of geologic basins, and a range of reservoir engineering problems.<P>

	The user interface is through the conversational FREEFORM language which provides for simple English-like command syntax. The result can be graphically displayed by the acrPLOT, post-processor, which can generate charts for flow vectors, contours, grids, 3D surface plots and X-Y plots at any cross section.<P>

	The software TIDAL is a tool for the simulation of coastal hydrodynamics
	and water quality for large areas as bays, estuaries, lakes and nearshore 
	area.<P>

	It allows to take into account several physical phenomena such as
	currents, tides, winds, gravity and Coriolis forces, friction bottom,
	heat transfer and chemical reactions. Flooding and draining may also
	be considered. The computation is made for stationnary or
	time-dependent phenomena for any geometry of the site (including
	islands). Modelisation of inlets and/or outlets is performed when

<BIG>
RADM is a Random-Walk model for simulation of dispersion processes in turbulent fluids. In particular it has been successfully used for air pollution studies.<P>

It employs a stochastic approach to solve the governing transport equations for motion of an inert or reactive species. It allows for arbitrary fluid and particle velocity to be surimposed on a random (or turbulent) motion of particles. The particles may undergo chemical reaction, radioactive decay, settling and drag. Arbitrary complex terrain, arbitrary wind fields and inversion conditions are accommodated. Single or multiple fixed, mobile or area sources may be present.<P>

Its primary applications are in the pollution air though any dispersion process may be simulated. Typical petrochemical applications include those of air pollution from refinery stacks and effluents discharges.<P>

The user interface is through the conversational FREEFORM language which provides for simple English-like command syntax. The result can be graphically displayed by the acrPLOT post-processor, which can generate charts for flow vectors, contours, isovalue rasters, grids, 3D surface plots and X-Y plots at any cross section.<P><P>

<H2>Why a satellite data acquisition System ?</H2>

<BIG>

METEOSAT, NOAA, etc... are extremely satisfying satellites as far as following up the European and African continents and the ocans are concerned.
<P>


Knowing the weather and the climate (cloud movement, weather forecast, rain index, rising forecast, sea surface temperature, cloud analysis...), accessing good quality images, especially those from METEOSAT, represent a tremendous tool for a great number of laboratories and industries, as well as for agriculture. 

<P>

A large identified users community has expressed the need for information 
tools operating on environment. Applications are numerous, for example :

<UL>
<LI> Coastal protection
<LI> Climate and meteorology
<LI> Observation, security
<LI> Tourism and leisure
<LI> Fishing and aquaculture
<LI> Sea traffic
<LI> Agriculture and stock breeding
</UL>		

<P>

Earth observation datas are directly usable, in real time, by the <b>WEFAXSAT</b> system.	

<H2>FONCTIONNALITIES </H2>

All datas go through several stages so as to be usable. 

<b>WEFAXSAT</b> : the acquisition and processing system developed and commercialised by GM-IMAGES, changes a computer into a satellite reception station.
<P>


The system includes a 1 meter diameter dish, an analogic reception station a digitisation and image processing board and of course,  WEFAXSAT software.

<P>


This reception set allows the picking-up of WEFAX format METEOSAT, GOES, 
GMS type geostationary satellites as well as APT format for polar satellites 
like NOAA and METEOR. 


<H2> WEFAXSAT SOFTWARE PACKAGE </H2>


WEFAXSAT software package offers advanced WEFAX image processing 
functions together with a WEFAX reception station providing meteorological 
satellite digital images, which are received, stored, processed or even 
animated.
<p>
You can see below two METEOSAT animations.
<br> ( You need a mpeg viewer on your system to run animations )
<ul>
<li> <a href="/mpeg/meteo.mpg"> METEOSAT 1</a> (150K)
<li> <a href="/mpeg/meteo2.mpg"> METEOSAT 2</a> (70K)
</ul>

<p>
<b>WEFAWSAT system description </b>

<UL>

<LI> Pull down menu type user interface, entirely manageable with the mouse

<LI> Geographical zone and spectral band of acquisition controlled by the user. Self-automatic controlled entirely, with a possibility of manual control


<LI> Dissemination hours of METEOSAT  channels 1 and 2 recorded in a text file form (interactive updating)

<LI>  Last 75 images may be stored on the hard disk, that is to say 15 for each of the following zones : COX (CO2 et CO3), CXD (de C1D ˆ C9D), DX (de D1 ˆ D9), TOTAL (CTOT, DTOT) and WEFAX

<LI> Management and maintenance of the recorded images and a possibility of compacting them through various methods

<LI> Possibility of acquiring without storing, and of displaying continuously the images

<LI> Interactive creation of color (or shads of grey) animation loops with image choice, speed variator.

<LI> 256 color display with graphic resolution choice (480x640, 600 x800 and 768x1024)

<LI> 3 levels of zoom directly accessible through mouse interaction 

<LI> Interactive contrast arrangement controlled by the user

<LI> Oscilloscope function allowing a detailed analysis of the signal on a recorded image

<LI> Color output on various types of printers

<LI> Possible interface  with other types of image formats such as TITUS, ARTIST, PCX, BMP.

</UL>


<H2>WEFAXSAT SYSTEM CONFIGURATION </H2>

In  order to use WEFAXSAT system you should have an IBM-PC compatible 
with 4 Mo mem. computer.
<P>

WEFAXSAT also accepts a Microsoft - or compatible - mouse. GM-IMAGES 
declines any responsability as to the use of non compatible hardware with 
WEFAXSAT software.

<P>


The various WEFAXSAT modules will operate more or less quickly 
depending on the processor and on the access specifications of the hard 
disk.

<B>EUROPEAN EARTH OBSERVATION SYSTEM</B>
<P>

<B>CENTRE FOR EARTH OBSERVATION</B>
<P>

<P>
<big>
Description of the CEO Concept<P>
<P>

Pathfinder Study on Coastal Zone
<P>
<HR>
<P>

The European Commission and the European Space Agency (ESA), together with
member states, have decided to unite their expertise in order to set up a
project for the observation of the Earth called EEOS (European Earth
Observation System). This project, started in November 1992, consists
essentially of :
<P>
<DL>
<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif"> The identification of the multiple sources of earth observation data in
Europe ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif"> The assessment of the requirements of users of earth observation products and services ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif"> The promotion of these sources of information and services ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif"> The improvement of access and exchange.

</DL>
<P>

More precisely, the programme's missions are related to <B>earth observation
data, products and services</B> as follows :
<P>

To promote their knowledge and distribution from different origins (on-site
measurements, remote sensing, models, ...) ;
<P>

To facilitate their use and to ensure their accessibility and availability
;
<P>

To provide a European interface with other international systems of Earth
Observation such as the American system EOSDIS (Earth Observation System Data
and Information System) and the Japanese EOIS (Earth Observation Information
System).
<P>
<P>

The European Union's contribution to this project consists in the setting up of
a structure called CEO (Centre for Earth Observation) which will ensure an
interface between the users and the data, the subsequent products and
associated services.
<P>

<P>

<IMG ALIGN=TOP ALT=" " SRC="gifs/youdale1.gif">

<P>
<P>

The principal objective of the CEO is to provide services oriented towards (and
by) the user. This action should be in conjunction with the existing
infrastructures (such as networks) and existing initiatives (such as other
programmes) so as to promote the observation of the Earth in Europe.
<P>

The CEO's success will depend on the association of four key elements :
potential users, the provision of services, an electronic network and an
exchange service called EWSE (European Wide Service Exchange).
<P>
<P>

In order to obtain these objectives the CEO's principal actions will be :
<DL>
<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To encourage a better communication between the users ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To stimulate the creation of high level products ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To contribute to a better standardisation of data and related products
so as to promote and ensure quality ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To promote the concept and utilisation of decentralised archives,
data banks and associated services for the observation of the earth
whatever their origins ;

<DT><DD>  <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
To improve the visibility of Earth observation services and expertise.

</DL><P>

The essential idea is that the CEO will in time be managed by people concerned
by Earth observation activities. The Commission will encourage the setting up
and the operation of the system (until the end of 1998).
<P>
<P>

At the moment the CEO is a concept and it is necessary that people concerned by
Earth observation make their wishes and suggestions known in order to define
and make optimal use of this system.
<P>
<P>

The project of the CEO consists of four phases. The first made possible the
actual concept of the CEO. We are, at the moment, in the second phase
(pathfinder study) whose principal objective is to identify what exists at
present for finding out the needs of the users. Its goal is to produce enough
information to enable the next phase to be undertaken, that is to say the
conception of the final system and its take-off (until 1998). The operational
phase will start in 1999 and will be run by the users of the system.
<P>
<P>

In order to limit the size of this work of identification, the Commission
thought it preferable to address user requirements in two ways :
<P>

<DL>
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
to look at a sample of application areas in some detail (i.e. marine
altimetry, agriculture and forestry, global change, urban development and
lastly coastal zones)
<DD>

<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/rec_rouge.gif">
to look at an overview of the requirements of Institutes in Europe. This was
divided into four geographical groups based on the status and scope of existing
industry and programmes as follows :
<DD>

<DL>
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/yellowball.gif">group 1 :

<DD> Germany, France, Italy
and United Kingdom ;
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/yellowball.gif">group 2 :
<DD> Belgium, Denmark, Luxembourg and The
Netherlands ;
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/yellowball.gif">group 3 :
<DD> Spain, Greece, Ireland and Portugal ;
<DT> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/yellowball.gif">group 4 :
<DD> Austria, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden.

</DL>
</DL>
<P>

The international network Eurocoast, the
<A HREF="contacts/MEDIAS.html">MEDIAS-FRANCE</A> corporation,
<A HREF="contacts/GKSS.html">GKSS</A> (Germany),
and <A HREF="contacts/MARNET.html">MARNET</A> (Greece)
represent the consortium led by
<A HREF="contacts/ACRI.html">ACRI</A> (France)
which has been selected by the European Commission for the part related to the
identification of users requirements in the coastal zone.
<P>
<P>

In order to do this we are, at the moment, having an information campaign and
conducting enquiries of users and suppliers. These enquiries are carried out by
direct discussions with those involved with coastal zones, and by the sending
out of a questionnaire to a representative sample of the community.
<P>
<P>

The choice of this representative sample is bound to be limited, and it is
possible that certain organisations who would like to have said something about
this subject have not been consulted. If you know anybody in this case or if
you need further information concerning the CEO : do not please hesitate to
contact us (you will find the list of person to contact at the beginning of the
questionnaire).
<P>
<P>

We hope that the attached questionnaire will give to numerous users the
opportunity to clearly expose their needs and wishes in order to contribute
directly with a maximum of efficiency to the planned coastal zone part of the
CEO and to make it as adapted to the requirements of the community as
possible.
<P>
<P>

We are aware that our community is often solicited by questionnaires and
enquiries, and we are most grateful for the reception you would be prepared to
give to this one.
<P>
<P>

<H1>Help Page</H1>

This page gives you the most important information of the way to
use the server. It comports mainly 3 parts:

<DL>
<DT> <DD> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/redball.gif">
an introduction to <A HREF="#INTROWEB">WWW concept</A> and definition.

<DT> <DD> <IMG ALIGN=BOTTOM SRC="/gifs/redball.gif">

<IMG ALIGN=MIDDLE SRC="/gifs/note.gif">
<I>If you want to have a print version of this page, just choose on your
client the print facility and choose Postscript output to have a near
wysiwyg output.

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="INTROWEB">Introduction to WWW</H2>

Introducing the WWW in few lines is too difficult. So, as in the rest of
the server, we will just make a brief description and then give links to
various documents and servers describing perfectly this notion.
<P>
The main characteristic is the possibility to inter-connect thousands of
servers with different protocols like <I>ftp</I>, <I>gopher</I> or
<I>wais</I>. The other
important characteristic is the hypertext notion. Every element of the
display could be a link to an other document elsewhere in the world.
<P>
This kind of architecture gives lot of flexibility and allows to obtain
information for lots of domains. Meanwhile, this same thing makes sometimes
the search difficult to find a particular information on the network and
on the multiplicity of servers available thru Internet.

<BIG>
The proposed scientific and technical network aims to integrate the scientific
activities of the different participating institutes in the field of remote 
sensing, oceanography and numerical modelling. The proposed activities 
are built upon the expertise and competence already available within the 
institutes and should contribute to the following generic aims :
<UL>
<LI>
develop ant to expend where possible, algorithms that relate variable 
available from remote sensing, ocean platforms and other observations 
to processes occurring in the water column as for example heat flux, primary 
productivity and trace gas fluxes.
<LI>
to generate, archive and analyse multiannual time series of remote sensing,
 in-situ and meteorological data for a basic evaluation of time scales, 
variability and trends. 
<LI>
to select and develop models of the upper layer of the ocean to assimilate 
remote sensing and other data for process studies and for future contributions
to global models.
</UL>
More specifically, the proposed scientific network has been created on the 
existing expertise and ongoing activities of the involved institutes.
This includes the following main topics :remote sensing,experimental studies,
modelling.

<b><u>Rationale of the meeting</u></b>
<br>
<br>
<u>This progress meeting was an initiative of the network coordinator.  It
aimed at:</u>
<br><br>
<ol>
<li>Introducing the new members of the network (PECO programme);
<br>	
<li>Gathering for the first time all post-doc involved in the network (some of
them joined the network only recntly);
<br>	
<li>Establishing concrete exchanges and delays.
</ol>
<br>
After an oral presentation given by each participants of their activity in the frame of the network, and of expectations from the network, detailed discussions were conducted on the way to partition intra-network contributions. It led to fruitful discussions and concrete agreements.  To set clearly the output of these discussions, each participant wrote a short text describing:
<br>
<ol>
<li>The main activity they will conduct within the network;
<br>	
<li>The contribution they expect from other partners;
<br>	
<li>The contribution they can provide to other network projects.
</ol>
<br>
<b><u>Contributions and data exchanges</u></b>
<br><br>
<b><i>Margarita Esteban</i></b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Region of interest:</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Canary Islands near field at 28deg.N
<br>	
<li>Canary Islands far field at 20-35deg.N, 23deg.W (east coast)
</ul>
<b>Main activity:</b>
<br><br>
Simulating island processes such as Lee effects, eddy (formation/structure/dissipation) and upwelling.  The 1'-bathymetry data file from Ecole des Mines will be used.
<br>
<br>
<b>Interest in obtaining useful elements from collabotions within the network:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Satellite images of SST and ocean color showing these island effects and any such other peculiar (interesting) features of this region.  These data are expected from JRC and ACRI.
<br>	
<li>Boundary conditions (flux) as a forcing parameter in the model.These informations are expected from Shirshov Institute of Oceanology.
<br>	
<li><i>In situ</i> measurements from cruises conducted in this region, providing temperature and chlorophyll concentration as a function of depth. Such data are expected from Institut f&uuml;r Ostseeforschung and ACRI.
<br>	
<li>Statistical analyses of digitized satellite images and results from numerical simulations.  These analysis should be performed by the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (Romania).
</ol>
<br>
Collaboration is expected through comparison of numerical simulations with both <i>in situ</i> and satellite data (including detection of features through a statistical approach).
<br><br>

<b>Available to the other partners:</b>
<br><br>
At Clima Maritimo, CD's with data banks such as Iseler &amp; Hasse climatological data and NOAA atmospheric data are available.
<br><br>

<b><i>Dr. Vera DJEPA-PETROVA</i></b>
<br><br>

<b>Main activities:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Physical modelling of propagation of radiation through atmosphere in the spectral intervals of satellite data.
<br>	
<li>Algorithms and software for deriving atmospheric and sea state parameters from satellite data.
<br>	
<li>Satellite data processing and analyses of particular sea state and atmospheric phenomena.
<br>	
<li>Application of remotely sensed measurements for oceanoography, sea state, atmospheric and climate research.
</ol><br>

<b>Contribution to the Network:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>Models, algorithms and software development (if they are not available) for deriving sea surface physical parameters (sea surface temperature, etc) by satellite data (AVHRR, etc).
<br>	
<li>Processing and analyses of satellite data in order to estimate and examine sea state phenomena.
<br>	
<li>Models development for atmospheric correction of the remotely sensed data provided by future satellite systems, considering there spectral intervals, viewing angles and resolution.
<br>	
<li>Modelling and data processing in order to examine the most informative spectral intervals for estimation of biological, chemical and physical properties of the sea state, considering the current and future satellite systems.
</ol><br><br>

<b><i>Dr. Angelo Rubino</i></b>
<br><br>

<b>Main activity:</b>
<br><br>
In the frame of the northeastern Atlantic upwelling system, an often observed phenomenon (CTD measurement) provides the bases for the contribution in the project.  In semi-enclosed coastal areas, anomalous T-S characteristics were observed: from the surface to the bottom both salinity and temperature show in fact a considerable increase.  The explanation for such a behaviour is that abrupt, very intense evaporation events homogenize the water column at the coast, leading to the formation of a bottom to surface layer, which is subject to geostrophic adjustment.  It evolves in a bottom arrested current which mixes with the ambient water and tranfers to the bottom the acquired properties.

The proof of the existence of the quoted phenomenon lies in the measurements conducted by Institut f&uuml;r Ostseeforschung.  In this context, the availability of the <i>in situ</i> data set is a fundamental requisite.  It will provide at first a model verification and validation, and moreover these data could be used by the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (Romania) to detect significant statistical time and space variability.  On the other hand, it is probable that such surface to bottom density anomalies have been detected by remote sensing means, both in SAR and in surface temperature, and in color imagery (in fact, for the last point, the presence of a bottom arrested current should lead to a decrease in the phytoplankton content in the water column).  ACRI and Bulgarian Space Research Institute could carry a inspection of the available remote sensing imageries to detect the phenomenon. A quantification of the forcing playing a role in the phenomenon (wind and heat fluxes) could represent another aspect of the collaboration with the partners which are more involved in data acquisition and analysis.

<b>Activity conducted in the frame of the network subject to collaborations:</b>
<br><br>
One of the most important component in models describing the flux of carbon from atmosphere to ocean sediments is phytoplankton primary production, i.e. the rate of net  carbon fixation.   Primary production represents the input way of inorganic carbon into the ocean organic carbon pool.  During the last 7 years, efforts have been deployed by oceanographers, in the frame of the Joint Ocean Global Flux Study (JGOFS), to develop primary production models applicable at global  scale using remotely sensed variables, namely sea suface chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration.  Such a model has been developed by Morel (1991), and validated and applied at global  scale (e.g. Berthon and Morel 1992, Antoine and Morel <i>in press</i>).  Although this model proved to perform well (measured and prediction values agree within a factor of  3 while primary production varies over 4 orders of magnitude), improvements are still needed.
<br><br>
The examination of the different ways allowing significant improvements of this model led us  to identify the depth of the upper mixed layer (Zml) as the most important source of original information to be added to the model.  Combined with the depth of the euphotic zone  (depth at  which irradiance is 1% that  at surface; Ze), it should provide a better parameterization of depth variations in chlorophyll <i>a</i> concentration.  Morevover, predictions of photosynthetic parameters may be for the first time possible.
<br><br>
To be used in the primary production model of Morel (1991), Zml  must be available at a spatial and temporal resolution similar to that of ocean color data.  A technique based on remotely sensed sea surface temperature and wind speed allowing estimation of Zml has recently been proposed by Yan et al. (1991).  Alternatively, Zml could be provided by a large-scale circulation model.
<br>
<br>
<b>Possible contribution from the other partners:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>In providing SST and wind speed images (Bulgarian Space Research Institute).
<br>	
<li>In providing a comparison between Zml predictions from Yan's and Shirshov Institute large-scale circulation models.
</ol>
<br>
<b>Contribution to other projects:</b>
<br>
<ol>
<li>In providing ocean color images (CZCS) for the Northeast Atlantic ocean.
<br>	
<li>In providing in situ data for validation of small- and large-scale circulation models.
</ol>
<br>
<b><u>Actions</u></b>
<br>
<br>

<b>Next progress meeting:</b>
<br>
It was agreed to hold the next HCM/PECO progress meeting at Clima Maritimo (Madrid) begining of June.  To facilitate programming of flight schedules, the meeting must be held close a weekend.  Invitations must be quickly sent by Clima Maritimo to PECO partners for visa formalities.  Finally, it was proposed to hold a 2-day meeting.
<br>
<br>

<b>Progress in collaborations:</b>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Concerning PECO partners, the delay before the next meeting should allow them to study more deeply the different projects conducted by the network.  Thereby, they should be in a better position to propose more concrete contributions during the next progress meeting.  This meeting will also allow to gather all network members and, therfore, to organize visits in the different laboratories to facilitate completion of specific tasks (e.g. a possible long stay of Vera DJEPA-PETROVA at JRC to process remote sensing data should be discussed).
<br>	
<li>In order to obtain useful remote sensing and in situ data from the other partners, Dr. Angelo RUBINO will provide to the other partners the exact location and time period over which data should be provided.
<br>	
<li>An inventory of CZCS scenes covering the Northeast Atlantic, already obtainable by ACRI, will be provided by Dr. Marcel BABIN.
</ul>
<br>

<b>Administration of funds:</b>
<br><br>
Thorough discussions took place on how to manage in the most efficient way PECO funds.  From these discussions, it appeared to be a delicate task and that it would be the best to manage funds through ACRI.  To succeed in this way, official documents should be provided by institutions participating in the PECO programme.  These documents should indicate clearly that they allow ACRI to manage these funds.  Also,  the institutions will have to provide every year a status of expences covered by PECO and laid out by ACRI, in local currency.

<H1>RESULTS OVERVIEW</H1>

<img src="/gifs/bar_marbre_noir2.gif"><br><br>
<P> <H1>Introduction</H1>
<big>

The overall objectives stated in the initial proposal are: <P>

<UL>

<LI>to generate, archive and analyse multiannual time series of remote
sensing, in situ and meteorological data for a basic evaluation of
time scales, variability and trends;

<LI>to develop algorithms that relate variables available from remote
sensing, ocean platforms and other observations to processes occurring
in the water column as for example heat flux, primary productivity and
trace gaz fluxes;

<LI>to select and develop models of the upper layer of the ocean to
assimilate remote sensing and other data for process studies and for
future contributions to global models.

</UL>

<P>

The following is a short description of the progress of the work to
date within each of these objectives, where the network activity is
emphasised.

<P>

<H1>1- Archives and time series analyses</H1>

In order to provide a general access to a common database, ACRI-Sophia
Antipolis proposed a technical solution based on the World-Wide Web
(WWW) concept. A major advantage with the WWW is that it allows to
share data distributed in different computers (at different
locations).  The user can access the different data without knowledge
about location of softwares used to manage the data base.  In the
frame of the current project, three WWW servers were installed; at
ARMINES - Sophia Antipolis, ACRI and Intitut f&uuml;r Meereskunde (IM)
- Hamburg .  These servers are connected to already existing servers
at JRC - Ispra and Clima Maritimo (CM) - Madrid.  To facilitate
exchanges between the different servers, the ACRI server has the
specific role of co-ordination to provide information of general
interest.  <P>

This experimental system can be connected via WWW client at
<A HREF="http://www.acri.fr/">http://www.acri.fr/</A>.

<P> To allow the set up of data archives, the first task undertaken
during 1994 concerned the determination of a common frame for data
file storage, which accounts for the various temporal and spatial
scales typical of the data sources involved in this project,
i. e. various satellite sensors, in situ techniques and computational
products.  This task was essentially undertaken by ARMINES who
proposed a common bathymetry digital map including shorelines.  They
also installed a data server with softwares for satellite data
processing and a GIS package (Geographical Information System),
accessible to other members of the network by electronic links.  The
<A HREF="select_ref.html">bathymetry digital map was created
for the area under study in this network, i.e. between 18 and 26&iexcl;N,
and 8 and 20&iexcl;W</A>.

<P>

Up to now this data frame has been fed (1) by CM who provided the
bathymetry and coastline information, (2) by Institut f&uuml;r
Ostseeforschung (IO) -Warnem&uuml;nde who provided in situ
oceanographic data and (3) by JRC who provided <A
HREF="select_avhrr.html">remotely sensed temperature data</A>
(AVHRR).  Finally, the WWW server operated at CM makes fully available
long term series obtained from wave buoys and tidal gauges deployed in
the vicinity of Canary Islands.

<P>

Consistently with the initial proposal, in 1994, two oceanographic
cruises (R. V. Hudson and Humbolt) were conducted by IO off
Mauritania, during which a large amount of physical, chemical and
biological data were obtained.  These are available for the network.

<P> <H1>2- Algorithm development</H1>

During 1994, algorithm development within the network has followed
essentially two lines.  Firstly, JRC processed
<A HREF="select_czcs.html">satellite data for estimation of
phytoplankton biomass</A>, in order to assess the impact of primary
production on <A HREF="dms.html">DMS</A> production and generation of clouds in the Northwest
African upwelling.  This study was also based on meteorological and in
situ data, as well as on multi-annual time series of satellite
observations to investigate long-term regional and temporal variations
of selected surface parameters.  The resulting DMS model can be used
directly on JRC WWW server.  ARMINES, which is involved in long-term
projects on the detection of clouds in satellite imagery and retrieval
of their characteristics, obtained more accurate and efficient
processing of the Meteosat satellite data using the data provided by
IO (in situ) and JRC (AVHRR).  Maps of shortwave radiation have been
produced and made available to the network in October 1994.  Maps of
longwave radiation are being produced.  They will also be available to
the network.  A study is planned in which a comparison between results
obtained by JRC and ARMINES will be performed.

<P> Secondly, the first results from the "two layer, nonlinear,
hydrostatic shallow water equation model" have been obtained at IM for
an idealistic scenario: on flat bottom and smooth slopes.  The model
seems to reproduce in a quite satisfactory way the geostrophic
adjustment processes.  These results will be validated over the shelf
area of the Northwest African coasts from
<A HREF="select_bathy.html">remote sensing measurements
(JRC) and in situ observations (IO), and using the bathymetry fields
provided by ARMINES</A>.

	
<H1>3- Global models development</H1>

<P>

The third objective of current project concerns the development of
global models.  Its achievement represents the main goal for 1995.

<H2>Main activity:</H2>

<P> In the frame of the north-eastern Atlantic upwelling system, an
often observed phenomenon (CTD measurement) provides the bases for the
contribution in the project.  In semi-enclosed coastal areas,
anomalous T-S characteristics were observed: from the surface to the
bottom both salinity and temperature show in fact a considerable
increase.  The explanation for such a behaviour is that abrupt, very
intense evaporation events homogenise the water column at the coast,
leading to the formation of a bottom to surface layer, which is
subject to geostrophic adjustment.  It evolves in a bottom arrested
current which mixes with the ambient water and transfers to the bottom
the acquired properties.

<P>

In order to simulate such a phenomenon, a two layer, nonlinear,
hydrostatic shallow water numerical model was developed, which can
describe the evolution of localised layers and the outcropping of a
deep layer.  To achieve this, a set of movable boundary conditions has
been applied, so that the bottom arrested current can find its way on
the ocean floor.  The layers allow for material mixing by means of an
driving parametrization.  The first results show the capability of the
model to reproduce geostrophical ajustment processes.

<P>

<H2>Possible contributions from the other participants:</H2>

requisite.  It will provide at first a model verification and
validation, and moreover these data could be used by the National
Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology (Romania) to detect significant
statistical time and space variability.  On the other hand, it is
probable that such surface to bottom density anomalies have been
detected by remote sensing means, both in SAR and in surface
temperature, and in colour imagery (in fact, for the last point, the
presence of a bottom arrested current should lead to a decrease in the
phytoplankton content in the water column).  ACRI and Bulgarian Space
Research Institute could carry a inspection of the available remote
sensing imageries to detect the phenomenon.  A quantification of the
forcing playing a role in the phenomenon (wind and heat fluxes) could
represent another aspect of the collaboration with the partners which

One of the most important component in models describing the flux of
carbon from atmosphere to ocean sediments is phytoplankton primary
production, i.e. the rate of net carbon fixation. Primary production
represents the input way of inorganic carbon into the ocean organic
carbon pool.  During the last 7 years, efforts have been deployed by
oceanographers, in the frame of the Joint Ocean Global Flux Study
(JGOFS), to develop primary production models applicable at global
scale using remotely sensed variables, namely sea surface chlorophyll
a concentration.  <P> Such a model has been developed by Morel (1991),
and validated and applied at global scale (e.g. Berthon and Morel
1992, Antoine and Morel in press).  Although this model proved to
perform well (measured and prediction values agree within a factor of
3 while primary production varies over 4 orders of magnitude),
improvements are still needed.

<P>

The examination of the different ways allowing significant
improvements of this model led us to identify the depth of the upper
mixed layer (Z<SUB>ml</SUB>) as the most important source of original
information to be added to the model.  Combined with the depth of the
euphotic zone (depth at which irradiance is 1% that at surface;
Z<SUB>e</SUB>), it should provide a better parameterization of depth
variations in chlorophyll a concentration.  Moreover, predictions of
photosynthetic parameters may be for the first time possible.  This
hypothesis can be better <A HREF="select_insitu.html">illustrated
by looking at in situ data recently obtained within the region being
under study by this network</A>.  To test this hypothesis, a huge in
situ data set is being constructed.  It gathers data currently
available within the frame of the Joint Ocean Global Flux Study
(JGOFS).  Up to no, data were gathered from the following JGOFS

<P> To be used in the primary production model of Morel (1991),
Z<SUB>ml</SUB> must be available at a spatial and temporal resolution
similar to that of ocean colour data.  A technique based on remotely

<font size=+1><strong>1. Problem to be resolved,</font></strong>
<p>
<ul><ul>
To alleviate the increasing atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, the principle greenhouse gas contributing to possible global warming, Marchetti  (Climate Change 1, 59-68, 1977) proposed that carbon dioxide might be separated from flue gases of coal fired power stations, which presently account for some 30% of global anthropogenic emissions, and injected into the oceans.</p>
<p>
The work of Marchetti and subsequent studies suggested the need to inject the gas at great depths or in sinking currents to avoid rapid outgassing to the atmosphere. More recent investigations by Haugen and Drange (Nature, Vol 357, 318-320, 1992) have indicated that even shallow injection could be envisaged by relying on the increase in water density that would result from carbon dioxide dissolution in seawater to transport the dissolved gas to greater depths. These authors propose that if carbon dioxide is injected near the shore (at depths in the range of 200-400m), gravity currents will carry the dense carbon dioxide waters along the bottom slope towards deep water.</p>
<p>
Both the disposal scenarios proposed depend on the injection of carbon dioxide at the required depth, either directly into the sea as a liquid-gas mixture,  or by pumping artificially enriched seawater containing the carbon dioxide at elevated pressures. The use of such techniques would clearly depend on the development of a highly efficient means of separating the gas on the industrial scale and demonstrating the economics of such a disposal method. Haugen and Drange argue that shallow injection in coastal regions will be less expensive in terms of energy and capital costs than deep-ocean disposal.</p>
<p>
The choice of the marine environment as a disposal medium is based on the observation that the ocean waters and sediments play an important role in the global carbon cycle and are known to be  major sink and source of natural carbon. The role of sedimentation ensures that  the marine environment is an overall sink through carbonate sequestration. However, although seawater itself contains large quantities of carbon dioxide as carbonate and bicarbonate ions and as dissolved carbon dioxide gas, the system is in dynamic exchange with  atmospheric carbon dioxide and depending on temperature and salinity can act as a sink or a source for this gas. 
<p>
It is exactly this point that makes the disposal of carbon dioxide by dissolution in either shallow or deep waters uncertain from a technical point of view, irrespective of any question of potential biological impacts, economics or social acceptability of such a disposal method. Although the capacity of  ocean waters is very large to dilute and dissolve carbon dioxide and natural processes (biological and chemical) will tend to sequester  it as sedimentary material over long time (geological) scales, short term physical and biological oceanographic processes (decades to hundreds of years) such as changes in deep water formation or primary production  may be capable of returning it to the atmosphere very rapidly. 
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>2. Prior solutions</font></center></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
A number of chemical scrubbing processes are used to remove major contaminants produced from coal combustion such as fly ash solids, sulphur compounds and other materials, which are then either treated or dumped at waste disposal sites on land. At present atmospheric dilution is the only method used for the waste gaseous carbon dioxide. International research, under the aegis of the <a href="http://www.ieagreen.org.uk/">IEA Greenhouse Gas Programme</a>, is being directed to assess the environmental feasibility of using the oceans (as well as a certain number of terrestrial options) as a disposal medium directly, as described above.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>3. Solution proposed</font></center></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
Solid carbon dioxide free fall penetrator. In order to get round  waste disposal based, as at present, on atmospheric dilution  or  the uncertainty related to ocean dispersion by dilution as discussed above, the use of a solid carbon dioxide free fall penetrator is proposed to permanently dispose of separated anthropogenic carbon dioxide.
<p>
A solution for permanently sequestering carbon dioxide may be proposed on the basis of the observation of the occurrence of carbonate and silicate rich sediments which are ubiquitous in the sedimentary formations of the  ocean, and which form a natural stable sink of carbon once they have been laid down. Deep ocean areas such as trenches (depths > 6-8km) and abyssal plains (depths > 3-4km) are among the most inaccessible areas on Earth and unlikely to be disrupted even by rapid climatic changes.
<p>
The technique makes use of the fact that carbon dioxide can be obtained as a solid at atmospheric pressure by cooling to  -78.5 degrees centigrade. The overall specific gravity is approximately one and a half times (1.56) that of seawater and would thus fall through the water column if produced as a solid (Nakashiki et al. CRIEPI report EU91003, pp 19, 1991). Such pieces would not enter into any underlying sediments and would slowly dissolve on the sea floor with the risk of the waters eventually returning to the surface. However, if the solid was shaped as a torpedo and then left to fall through the water column it would penetrate  soft sediments. In selected deep ocean carbonate rich sediments (at depths ranging from 1-4 km) pore water movement can be shown to be negligible thus effectively permanently isolating the carbon dioxide from the overlying ocean waters. At the in-situ pressures and temperatures (approx. 100-400 atmospheres, 2C) the carbon dioxide would eventually form a stable clathrate type compound with the pore water of clay or carbonate sediments and be permanently sequestered by the surrounding geological media.
<p>
A number of detailed studies have been undertaken investigating penetrometer design (Freeman et al, Nature, Vol 310, 130-133, 1984, Murray and Visintini, IEEE Journal of Oceanic Engineering, Vol OE-10, 38-49, 1985). The reference cited above shows the large range of parameters that need to be considered. A prototype submarine vehicle intended to measure data at the deep ocean sea- bottom was constructed by Murray and Jamet using a slow penetrator technique. A European patent was granted on the 24.4.1990 (Definitive Number 0362991) and has further demonstrated the extent of possible applications of this technology.
<p>
It needs to be clearly stated that under present International leglislation (United Nations Convention on the Law of The Sea[UNCLOS], London Dumping Convention) such a disposal option would not be permited. Furthur, any proposed use of deep sub-seabed geological formations is one that would need a global social consensus which would be unlikely without unequivical demonstration as to its long term safety. Whether in view of the volumes of waste material potentially involved such a solution would be economically viable is clearly at present difficult to assess. It will depend on political and industrial conditions that might occur if global climatic change were to be demonstrated in an clear and unequivocal manner and serious attempts to decrease carbon dioxide emissions were considered necessary.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>4. What are the advantages of these solutions?</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
From a purely technical point of view the proposed solution should, if proven feasible and safe, effectively isolate the carbon dioxide from the overlying ocean waters using the natural barrier properties of the surrounding stable soft clay or carbonate rich sediments. Thus the risk of the eventual return of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere through upwelling of ocean waters can be effectively excluded. Disposal would thus be permanent. A further advantage could be the creation of a waste disposal industry using this type of technology and financed on the polluter-payer principle. The technology appears to be easily within present day engineering capabilities.

<strong><font size=+1>ABSTRACT</strong></font> <p>
<ul><ul>
To circumvent  the uncertainty related to presently studied ocean disposal options based on  pumping of liquid carbon dioxide or hydrate slurry injection at depth, with the associated risk of short  term physical and biological oceanographic processes returning an important fraction of it to the atmosphere, a disposal technique using the natural geochemical storage properties of deep marine (carbonate or alumino-silicate rich) sedimentary formations is suggested.
<p>
The technique proposed would depend on the fact that carbon dioxide can be obtained as a solid by cooling to  -78.50 C . The overall density is approximately one and a half times ~ 1.56 kg.dm-3 that of seawater. If the solid was shaped as a torpedo and then left to fall through the water column it would penetrate quite deeply into soft underlying sediments. This conclusion is based on  in-situ investigations using penetrators that were studied as a disposal option for other solid wastes.
<p>
This concept should, therefore, provide permanent storage as the emplaced carbon dioxide will be chemically sequestered by the sediments (via the formation of an intermediate clathrate).  Other than secure segregation of the emplaced CO<font size=-2>2</font>, the penetrator option has a further major advantage in that there should be no long-term effects to biological systems: penetrator disposal is deep within sedimentary formations which have zero or very low biological activity.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>1. INTRODUCTION</strong></font><ul><ul>
<p>
The use of the deep oceans had been proposed as early as 1977 <a href="#ref1">[1]</a>, as a possible disposal medium for carbon dioxide.  Subsequent investigations [2-3] underlined the need to dispose of the gas at great depths and to use sinking currents to avoid rapid outgassing to the atmosphere. More recent studies <a href="#ref4">[4]</a> have indicated that even shallow injection could be envisaged, by relying on the increase in water density that would result from carbon dioxide dissolution in seawater, to transport the dissolved gas to greater depths. However, although seawater itself contains large quantities of carbon dioxide as carbonate and bicarbonate ions and as dissolved carbon dioxide gas, the system is in dynamic exchange with  atmospheric carbon dioxide and depending on temperature and salinity can act as a sink or a source for this gas. Thus ocean techniques proposed so far will only tend to displace the problem into the relatively near future <a href="#ref5">[5]</a> without ensuring  permanent disposal.
<p>
A solution for permanently sequestering anthropogenic carbon dioxide may, however, be proposed on the basis of the observation of the occurrence of carbonate rich sediments which are ubiquitous in sedimentary formations of the  ocean at depths above the carbonate compensation depth  at around 4 km. They form a natural stable repository and are a result of environmental processes which have affected oceanic and thus atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations over geological time. Alternatively use could be made of the soft alumino-silicate clay type sediments at the same or greater depths which would also act as an effective barrier to carbon release. 
<p>
The technique proposed would depend on the fact that carbon dioxide can be obtained as a solid by cooling to  -78.50 C. The overall specific gravity is approximately one and a half times ~ 1.56 that of seawater. Tests have shown <a href="#ref6">[6]</a> that if produced as a solid,  carbon dioxide blocks would  fall through the water column, although, such pieces would not enter into the underlying sediments and would slowly dissolve on the sea floor. However, if the solid was shaped as a torpedo and then left to fall through the water column it would penetrate  soft sediments. This conclusion is based on studies using penetrator technology that were investigated as a disposal option <a href="#ref7">[7]</a>. A conceptual engineering design for an industrial disposal system has been described for this option  <a href="#ref8">[8]</a>.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>2. DESIGN CHARACTERISTICS OF PENETRATORS</strong></font><ul><ul>

<p>
Preliminary design characteristics of  penetrators, free-fall velocity, embedment depth, and hole closure, have been described in some detail [9-10]. The results will be only briefly summarised here and the reader is referred to the above sources for fuller information. The attainable free-fall velocity or  terminal velocity of a penetrator is determined by equilibrium of buoyant and hydrodynamic drag. A large range of parameters  including overall weight, density, engineering form, sediment shear strength etc. need to be considered <a href="#ref11">[11]</a>. <a href=diox1-figure01.html> Figure 1 </a> shows predicted free-fall velocities attainable by a series of penetrators having a length to diameter ratio of 10:1 and weights from 5-1000 tons, and for a range of  densities for solid carbon dioxide when produced industrially, 1.1 - 1.5 kg.dm-3 <a href="#ref9">[9]</a>. Clearly tests would be necessary to determine the optimum quantities. However, experiments have been undertaken in the abyssal Atlantic Ocean using similarly designed streamlined projectiles <a href="#ref12">[12]</a> and have shown firstly, that sediment penetration depths greater than 30m can be obtained for torpedoes made out of steel, weighing as little as 2000 kg, and secondly that the in-situ results validated the simple hydrodynamic model used.
<p>

[ <a href=diox1-figure01.html> FIGURE 1 </a> ]
<img src="space80.gif">
[ <a href=diox1-figure02.html> FIGURE 2 </a> ]
</center>
<p>
A number of investigations have also been carried out to estimate the behaviour and attainable embedment depth of penetrators [13-15], as well the question of subsequent hole closure. <a href=diox1-figure02.html> Figure 2 </a>  shows the effects of penetrator weight and density on emplacement depth. It is clear from these results that an increase in density is a more efficient way to increase penetration than by augmenting overall weight. It also appears that there is a lower limiting weight to this penetrator technique to ensure complete tail embedment. It can be seen that pure CO<font size=-2>2</font> penetrators (having a specific gravity of 1.56 km.dm-3) of around 100 tons can (tail) embed themselves to significant depths  (~ 10m) in soft deep ocean sediment formations. Clearly the parameters "penetrator density and sediment shear strength" are critical factors for the final emplacement depth attained.
<p>
Theoretical investigations on hole closure <a href="#ref16">[16]</a> suggest that an open pathway to the sediment surface is unlikely, and  that during the embedment process the penetrator creates large sediment deformations in its passage leading to an inflow of surface sediments due to the suction forces generated by the water that is drawn into the entry path. This causes the sediments to close behind the penetrator. No cavitation can occur due to the high ambient pressures at the depths being considered. 
<p>
These studies are supported by the results of in-situ experiments which have been  carried out in the Mediterranean Sea using small steel penetrators weighing between 2-3 tons. The data obtained from geotechnical testing and overcoring of a number of penetrator impact points provided  evidence that the entry paths created by penetrators were indeed closed and filled with remoulded sediments with about the same density as the surrounding undisturbed sediments <a href="#ref17">[17]</a>.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>3. PHYSICO-CHEMICAL BEHAVIOUR OF SOLID CARBON DIOXIDE</strong></font><ul><ul>
<p>
If one considers the phase diagram of carbon dioxide and water system (<a href=diox1-figure03.html> Fig 3 </a>), the physico-chemical behaviour of the solid carbon dioxide during its rapid descent through the water column and subsequent deep emplacement and sequestration in the underlying sedimentary formation can be assessed. 
<p>
<center>
<a href="diox1-figure03.html"><img src="figure03.gif.tn" ALT="Fig3"></a><br>
[ <a href=diox1-figure03.html> FIGURE 3 </a> ]
</center>
<p>
Assuming that reaction times are fast, it can be postulated that equilibrium states are more or less reached instantaneously for the water column, but will depend on kinetic and thermodynamic properties in the sediments where chemical interactions with the surrounding environment will be the critical parameter in determining its fate. Two major processes can be identified that will depend upon the physico-chemical properties of carbon dioxide, these are thermal dissolution during penetrator free-fall through the water column, and subsequent clathrate formation after burial in the underlying  geological formation.
<p>
<u>Thermal dissolution in the water column.</u> The penetrator is assumed to be industrially produced at a temperature between -800C to -100C and is travelling in  relatively warmer water (~ 50C), the temperature difference will produce a heat flux from the water to the penetrator inducing a possible loss of penetrator mass <a href="#ref18">[18]</a>. The mechanism involved is forced convection across a turbulent boundary layer and conventional procedures can be used for an approximate prediction. From the diagram it can be seen that the behaviour of the solid carbon dioxide, after launch, will be as follows:
<br>
	a)<i> Sublimation regime</i>:from the sea surface to a pressure of 5.2 bars (triple point) corresponding to a depth of 52m, the CO<font size=-2>2</font> will sublimate and the boundary layer on the penetrator surface will be a two-phase flow (gas, liquid). Such conditions will only occur for a few seconds after penetrator launch.
<br>	
	b)<i> Liquefaction-evaporation (mixed) regime</i>: from 5.2 to approximately 40 bars (critical point), corresponding to depths ranging from 52-400m, CO<font size=-2>2</font> at the surface of the penetrator will initially melt at a rate depending on the actual ocean temperature profile. The liquid carbon dioxide will then evaporate (if the local temperature near the penetrator surface is high enough), or later on while being mixed with seawater and progressively warmed up. Evaporation may occur during flow along the penetrator length or later in its wake; the boundary layer on the surface of the penetrator will progressively change from a two-phase flow to a single phase, two-species flow (liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and dissolved aqueous CO<font size=-2>2</font>). At present any subsequent ion species formation within the water column have not been taken into account.
<br>
            c)<i> Pure melting regime</i>: at pressures greater than the critical point (~ 40 bars, 400m) carbon dioxide will simply melt and cold liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will progressively mix with seawater during its further descent through the water column and subsequently with pore water after embedment in the underlying sedimentary formation. 
<br>
            d)<i> Chemical sedimentary interaction</i>: the behaviour of the carbon dioxide once it has been successfully emplaced in a deep ocean geological formation will clearly depend on its interaction with the host formation under the prevailing in-situ conditions of temperature, pressure and geochemical environment.
<p>
Preliminary calculations have been carried out on thermal dissolution in the water column <a href="#ref18">[18]</a> taking into account the different regimes described above. For penetrators initially weighing 10, 100 and 1000 tons (vol. ~ 6.41, 64.1, 641 m3, dimensions ~ 9. 5m x 0.95m, 20.0m x 2.0m and 43m x 4.3m) <a href=diox1-figure04.html> figure 4 </a> shows  estimates of the loss of CO<font size=-2>2</font> during free-fall, for various storage sites at depths down to 4000 m.  It can immediately be seen that for small penetrators (10 t) the loss, as a percentage of the initial mass, even at disposal sites of only 1 km. depth are high, in the region of 40%. However, for a 100 t penetrator the loss is considerably less and estimated to be in the range of 17%. In the case of a 1000 t penetrator the loss is around 7%; for these large penetrators even for sites as deep as 3-4 km losses are only in the region of 25%. 
<p>
The results show that mass loss is roughly proportional to velocity, and as time to depth is inversely proportional to velocity, the mass loss per unit of surface to a given depth is roughly independent of penetrator size. The increase of mass loss with penetrator size is thus only proportional to the increase of surface area, and independent of free-fall velocity.

<p>
It is believed, however, that these losses could be  reduced close to zero by using frozen seawater as an insulating material. The option proposed is to coat the penetrator by a shell of solid ice. Such a coating would effectively shield the penetrator from the surrounding water, since water-ice has a surface temperature around 0 C and thus would markedly reduce heat flux from the seawater. <a href=diox1-figure05.html> Figure 5 </a> shows the predicted minimum ice coating required to shield the carbon dioxide from the water for disposal sites from 1-4 km. Ice thickness vary from 4-12 cm for this range of depths. Any ice remaining at the end of the sediment penetration phase could also provide a further source of water for the subsequent transformation of carbon dioxide into clathrate. 
<p>
Clearly other material (plastic foam etc.) could also be investigated for insolation if this were to be required for the industrial production of large penetrators. 
<p>
<u>Carbon dioxide sequestration within deep ocean sediments</u>. Two generic types of pelagic environments could be particularly suitable for permanent storage, calcareous rich oozes and soft alumino-silicate  clays. In both types of environment the initial sequence of events will be probably similar. After emplacement (say at 4000m), a strong thermal gradient will be establish between the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> penetrator (-80 to -100°C) and the surrounding environment (2°C). Initially the penetrator will freeze the pore water in the surrounding sediments, and its temperature will increase because of latent heat of ice freezing. As the temperature of the penetrator reaches ~ -50oC (phase change temperature at the in-situ pressure of 400 atm) the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will go to a liquid state as:
<p>
CO<font size=-2>2</font> (s) = CO<font size=-2>2</font>(l)
<p>
After completion of this phase change the temperature will start to increase again. During this thermal transient, diffusion transport will mobilise aqueous components towards the cold zone. This will counteract the movement of reactive solutes away from the carbon dioxide along the chemical gradient. Reaction with surrounding pore water will start to take place with the formation of a carbon dioxide clathrate. This compound is a solid under conditions of temperature and pressure at such a site (<a href=diox1-figure03.html> fig. 3 </a>):
<p>
CO<font size=-2>2</font> (l) + 5.75 H<font size=-2>2</font>O (l) = CO<font size=-2>2</font>-Clathrate (s) 
<p>
	a) <i>Calcareous rich oozes</i>: after the formation of a clathrate, in the case of soft carbonate sediments, there will be an ensuing  formation of carbonate ions (however over very long time periods) due to the interaction between the clathrate and the surrounding calcium carbonate: 
<p>
CO<font size=-2>2</font>-Clathrate (s) + CaCO<font size=-2>3</font> (s) = Ca2+(aq) + 2CO<font size=-2>3</font>2- + 2H+ + 4.75 H<font size=-2>2</font>O(l) 
<p>
The formation of dissolved carbonate ions will subsequently (again over very long time periods) be neutralised by excess anions in the sedimentary environment and re-precipitation of calcium carbonate will follow. These reactions will occur in carbonate rich sedimentary formations that have been set down above the carbonate compensation layer at around 4000 m. 
<p>
In the sea of Japan geothermally heated fluids containing very high concentrations of carbon dioxide at depths greater than 1500 m <a href="#ref19">[19]</a> have been discovered. These have been observed to precipitate on cooling once the temperature is less than 10°C, thus confirming solid clathrate as the equilibrium state of carbon dioxide in the NaCl-CO<font size=-2>2</font>-H<font size=-2>2</font>O ternary system. 
<p>
	b) <i>Alumino-silicate soft clays</i>: an alternative storage environment is that of a sediment rich in calcium and magnesium silicates <a href="#ref20">[20]</a>, such sediments exist at both lesser and greater depths than the carbonate compensation layer. In this case sequestration will occur through precipitation as solid carbonate following a  reaction of the type:
<p>
3MgCa(SiO<font size=-2>3</font>)<font size=-2>2</font> + 3CO<font size=-2>2</font> +H<font size=-2>2</font>O = H<font size=-2>4</font>Mg<font size=-2>3</font>SiO<font size=-2>9</font> + 3CaCO<font size=-2>3</font> + 4SiO<font size=-2>2</font>
<p>
In this case there may be competition for the carbon dioxide between the silicates and water for the formation of calcium carbonate or clathrates. Although the limited data available tend to indicate a favourably stable environment for both types of sediment,  much more work clearly needs to be undertaken on the physico-chemical and kinetic interaction and evolution between hydrates and the different geochemical environments.
<p>
</ul></ul><font size=+1><strong>4. CONCLUSIONS</strong></font><ul><ul>
<p>
Preliminary theoretical studies appear to show that permanent storage of CO<font size=-2>2</font> is possible using the natural geochemical properties of selected deep ocean sediments. Such a storage option would circumvent the problem of the eventual return of this gas to the atmosphere. Further evidence for the stable nature of clathrates can be drawn from existence of a natural analogue of CO<font size=-2>2</font> hydrate, methane hydrate<a href="#ref21">[21]</a>. This hydrate is believed to be responsible for the bottom-following (or bottom simulating) reflector observed in many ocean areas from marine seismic reflection investigations. This reflector is thought to represent the lower face of sediment stiffened by interstitial methane clathrates <a href="#ref22">[22]</a>. By analogy, it appears reasonable to postulate that a zone of sediment indurated and stifferened by CO<font size=-2>2</font>-hydrate would form above the final resting point of the penetrator. This would supress both advection and diffusion, leading to the effective isolation of the CO<font size=-2>2</font> for periods of millions of years.
<p>
A final point to consider is that such a disposal option should have negligible biological impact on pelagic fauna as there is no acidic dissolution of CO<font size=-2>2</font> at the sediment-water interface, thus inducing no alteration to local levels of seawater pH which could cause damage to local populations. Microbial activity at the foreseen burial depths (>10-15m) is expected to be very low and will probably only be linked to residual organic carbon deposition <a href="#ref23">[23]</a>.

<strong>ABSTRACT</strong><p>
<ul><ul>
A disposal technique for carbon dioxide, consisting of burying solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> penetrators into the deep seabed has been proposed. The expected weight of these penetrators can be as large as 1000 tons with lengths between 20 to 40m and  diameters of 4-5m. In order to produce and dispose of such large penetrators, an engineering approach has to be developed to investigate the feasibility of the process from the sources (industrial and thermal electrical production sites) to the sink (deep marine geological formation). A 5 Mt/year  CO<font size=-2>2</font> disposal capacity, has been selected for the study. This corresponds to a 500 MW(e) coal fired power plant assumed to be in the vicinity of a coastal port. The selected penetrators are 540 tons weight, approximately 30m high and 4m diameter. Two concepts have been investigated. The first consists in producing  penetrators at a land based factory and then shipping them to a disposal site in specially designed ships having the capacity of carrying 148 penetrators. The second assumes that liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>  can be collected from a port facility, transported by a liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> container ship to a mobile marine penetrator production and launching platform. The cost of these solutions have not been evaluated in the present work.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>1. INTRODUCTION</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
Disposal of CO<font size=-2>2</font> in  deep ocean geological formations potentially appears to be an attractive alternative to a number of disposal concepts recently investigated . Among the options <a href="#ref1">[1]</a> which have been studied are a) transport of gaseous or liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> by pipeline (GLP) from a land producing plant for ocean disposal at  depth  b) dumping  of non streamlined solid (NSS) CO<font size=-2>2</font> blocks from a ship. In the case of the GLP option, a rapid return of an important fraction of the the injected volumes to the ocean surface will occur because of the density difference between the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and ocean water. The NSS disposal option will be hindered by: i) the fact that a large portion of the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will return to the liquid or vapour phase during the slow free-fall of the solid blocks to the sea bottom, ii) the blocks will not penetrate the seabed sediments, and iii) the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will dissolve in the deep bottom waters.
<p>
In a possible solution to these problems, <a href="#ref2">[2-3]</a> it has been  proposed to further develop the solid disposal option by streamlining the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> blocks in order to  shorten the free fall flight time and to reach a much higher terminal velocity before impact with the sea floor [4-5]. As a consequence, depending on their terminal velocity and the mechanical properties of the sediments, the hydrodynamically shaped blocks (called penetrators from here on) will embed themselves within the underlying geological formation. This has been shown using penetrators that were studied as a disposal option for other solid wastes <a href="#ref6">[6]</a>. For the present analysis a depth of 10-15m is considered sufficient to constitute an effective barrier between the solid and the deep ocean water. It has been demonstrated, both theoretically and experimentally <a href="#ref7">[7-8]</a>, that because of the high impact velocities of penetrators, the sediment deformation created by the passage of the device will self-seal and the remoulded sediment column retain similar characteristics to its original properties. This is due to the fact that the low pressure environment acting  in the penetrators wake will cause surface material to collapse behind the incoming vehicle. Thus, an open pathway ( potential by-pass) between the buried penetrator and the deep ocean water is unlikely. Under these circumstances the solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will physically and chemically  interact with the sediments before reacting with the ocean water. The retention times will, therefore, be significantly increased as compared to the GPL and the NSS solutions.
<p>
It is speculated that the added cost required for producing hydrodynamically shaped penetrators is probably small as compared to the costs of  producing  solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> from the exhaust stack of power generating or other industrial plants, and subsequent fabrication and disposal of NSS blocks. In order to better assess the impact of the streamlined versus the non streamlined solutions, a conceptual engineering design of two alternative disposal options has been undertaken. The first consists in producing the penetrators in a land based factory and shipping them to the disposal site in a specially designed ship  having the capacity of carrying 148 penetrators (~ 80,000 t). The other option assumes a land-based source of liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>, and subsequent transport of the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> by container ship to a mobile production platform containing penetrator fabrication and launching facilities etc.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>2. CONCEPTUAL DESIGN OF SYSTEM: THE PENETRATORS</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
Penetrators will need to be constructed rather rapidly in order to comply with the CO<font size=-2>2</font> disposal requirements of a 500 MW(e) coal fired power plant producing about 540 ton carbon dioxide per hour. Thus on an hourly basis the disposal of such a quantity can be satisfied by a single penetrator or several smaller ones. For a 540 tons penetrator, a tail penetration of >10-15 m can be achieved in soft sediments <a href="#ref3">[3]</a> if the industrially produced CO<font size=-2>2</font> density is of at least 1400 kg/m3, after a free fall of about 1500 m. For the purposes of  discussion such a penetration depth is considered satisfactory for the present disposal scenario. Thus the lower weight limit for a penetrator satisfying a minimum tail emplacement of say ~5m will be about 100t. Solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> penetrators of such a large size can be fabricated either from compacting expanded snow produced from gas or from directly freezing liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>. The second solution is thermodynamically more efficient [1] and technologically easier and has been selected for the purpose of the present evaluation. Penetrators of 540 t will have an estimated diameter and length of ~ 4m and ~30 m respectively.
<p>
It is assumed that a source of liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of -78.50C is available at the penetrators production site. Thus in order to fabricate a penetrator a mould is used  consisting of a double wall reinforced metal structure (Fig.1). The unit is designed to withstand  loads developed by both the weight and  thermal stresses of the production process. The outside wall of the mould is isolated in order to diminish heat losses and is reinforced by concentric steel ribs. Incorporated into the inner wall of the mould is a heat exchanger in which cooling fluid circulates. However, since the diameter of the penetrator is so large, the time required to completely transform the liquid into solid by the advancing ice front will be excessively long, thus requiring  too many on-going penetrator production units. In order to accelerate the process, a non recoverable (throw away) aluminium tubular heat exchanger is introduced into the mould at a relatively short distance from the inside wall. The void volume of the mould is then filled with liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and cooled by the main and auxiliary heat exchangers.
<p>

<a href="diox2-figure01.html"><img src="figure08.gif.tn" ALT="Fig1"></a><br>
<a href="diox2-figure01.html">Figure 1. Refrigerated mould for penetrator fabrication (land or platform based production)</a>
</center>
<p>
The function of the auxiliary heat exchanger is not only to accelerate the formation of a thick ice wall but also to serve as a mechanical reinforcement. The auxiliary heat exchanger tubes will be, prior to launch, filled with pressurised liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> in order to increase their contribution to the structural rigidity of the penetrators. Because production time has to be minimised, only 0,8 m of the outside penetrator diameter will be frozen; the inside core of 2.4 m diameter (representing about 36% of the total volume) will remain in the liquid state. Thus, in order to reach the appropriate density for adequate emplacement, the penetrators have to be ballasted. This is achieved by the addition of an iron nose cone (density 7700 kg/m3) whose weight will be less than 5% of the total penetrator mass. 
<p>
In order to handle the completed penetrators, the solid iron nose cone will be connected by a steel cable to a top plate and clamp. Because the cable is in the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> it will be possible to post-stress the penetrator by an appropriate bolt system in order to increase its strength. The tail section (metallic) is made up of fins attached to a thin conic after-structure shaped hydrodynamically to provide flight stability. 
<p>
The mould is fabricated in two halves and can be open by separating them laterally. The  nose cone,  auxiliary spiral internal heat exchanger,  handling cable and conic tail piece and fins are inserted into the open mould. The lower extremity of the collapsed spiral heat exchanger and handling cable are fixed to the nose cone, the top end being attached to an independent winch situated on the top structure of the penetrators fabrication area. 
<p>
Once the mould is closed the internal spiral heat exchanger is drawn to the top of the penetrator by pulling the internal cable and clamped tight. Filling with CO<font size=-2>2</font> will be carried out through ports along the penetrator mould wall. Because of volume shrinkage, as a result of increasing density during freezing, additional liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> will have to be added through the top of the mould during the freezing process.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>3. PENETRATOR PRODUCTION PLANT</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
The penetrator production plant design will be somewhat different depending whether it is  land based or incorporated in a marine platform. It is assumed in both cases that the coal fired power plant is near the shore and has port facilities either to load  liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> (in the case of a sea platform) or the finished penetrators (in the case of a land based production plant).The penetrator production plant will, in both cases, consist of a number of dedicated areas: 
<p>
* Power generation plant, liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> delivery and storage, liquid-to-solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> production unit, fuel delivery and storage,  fabrication area containing  penetrator moulds, penetrator storage (for land based production only), penetrator transfer system to ship (for land based production only), <br>    
* Central control area, communication and logistics (helicopters, ships, etc.), maintenance etc., <br>
* Storage areas for penetrator parts:  nose cones, spiral heat exchangers, cables, tail sections, <br>
* Assembly zone:  nose, heat exchanger, cable and tail section construction. <br>
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>4. DEDICATED PENETRATOR DISPOSAL SHIP</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
In the case of the land based production plant, the delivery of the penetrators to the deep disposal sea area is performed by a dedicated ship incorporating the following features: loading, storage and refrigeration facilities, and launch handling system. In order to dispose of carbon dioxide at the same rate as its production from a 500 MW(e) power generating unit (i.e. ~540 tons per hour) a penetrator transport and disposal ship should have a rotation schedule of six days. The total number of penetrators to be transported will be one hundred and forty-eight. The penetrators will be stored in individual reusable refrigerated containers. 
<p>
It is possible to imagine different arrangement for the storage in the ship :
* Horizontally, parallel to the length on three decks ; <br>
* Horizontally, perpendicular to the symmetrical plane of the ship, and also on three decks ; <br>
*Vertically, by introducing reusable refrigerated penetrator containers into individual compartments which themselves contribute to the ship structure.
<p>
Solutions using horizontal arrangement, however, appear to have a number difficulties (mainly technological ones) related to :
i.  Complex handling of very heavy packages during both loading and launching phases, <br>
ii. Recovery and storage of empty containers after launching.

<a href="diox2-figure02.html">Figure 2  Design features of dedicated penetrator disposal ship</a>
</center>
<p>
Thus, concentrating on vertical storage and launching  solutions (which seem to present fewer difficulties), the design of the ship would be as follows (Fig. 2). The central storage area of the ship is partitioned in 148 refrigerated elements (1) of square section (5,5x5,5 meters) and 30 meters high. The ship displacement is estimated to be about 120,000 tons and will be provided with a double hull (4,5 and 6). The penetrators packed in individual insulated refrigerated containers in the production plant, are loaded by crane into each of the compartments in the ship's hold for storage during transport to the disposal site.

The disposal of penetrators will be carried out by the means of two moon-pools (2 and 4) served by two cranes (7), respectively moving at the aft and the fore of the ship in order to maintain the initial trim and heel of the vessel during the launching phase. During readiness for launching a penetrators is extracted from its  refrigeration container  by one of the overhead cranes (Fig.2). The penetrator  will be supported and guided by a fixed transverse sliding channel (8) and  a longitudinal frame (9) moving together with the crane, in order to assure stability of the vehicle. The crane will position the penetrator over the moon pool, lower it to is launch depth and release it.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>5. SEA PLATFORM</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
The sea platform architecture (Fig.3) will be structured around a central circular moon pool for the disposal of the penetrators. The central pool is surrounded by an annular production area provided with sliding doors and roofs. There is a rotating gantry crane astride the central pool and annular production area, supported on a circular external track. The crane will : i) pick up the completed penetrators, ii) bring them to the centre of the moon pool, iii) lower them rapidly below the water level and iv) release them.

<a href="diox2-figure03.html">Figure 3  Plan view of penetrator production and disposal platform</a>
</center>
<p>
The outside wall of the annular production area communicates with a lower annular circulation area necessary to bring the assembled nose cone, spiral heat exchanger and cable, as well as the tail section for each penetrator into the fabrication area. Around the lower circulation area there are  storage zones for the nose cones, spiral heat exchangers, cables and tail sections. Also the assembly and  refrigeration-production areas occupy part of this outer annulus. Satellite structures for energy production, maintenance, control, and housing of personnel will be connected by covered walkways to the central production and launching area. A helicopter pad is incorporated in the platform.
The main platform will be connected to four logistic-service platforms devoted to the docking of  transport ships for liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>, fuel, penetrator components and personnel. Liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and fuel will be stored into the platform buoyancy structures (Fig.4). Those for the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> must be pressurised to about 5MPa assuming the water temperature at about 100 m depth is  160C or less. The platform is manoeuvrable using underwater thrusters and employs a Global Positioning System (GPS) for penetrator disposal emplacement. The overall weight of the structure is estimated to be ~ 450,000 tons.

<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>6. ENERGY REQUIREMENTS</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
The power consumption for producing solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> from liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> is 86 kW/t (which corresponds to 317 kW/t C described in ref. [1])  In order to produce one 540t penetrator per hour, comprising 64% of solid CO<font size=-2>2</font> and 36% of liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font>,  the installed power should be ~ 30 MW. This is the largest single energy requirement for the production system.  In the case of an off-shore platform  power is also needed for the thruster units for the self positioning of the platform and is estimated to be some 10 MW.  Power will also be required for pumping the fluids into the platform reservoirs (200 kW), for pumping the liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> from the storage buoyancy reservoirs and distributing it throughout the production plant (50 kW). Power  for the auxiliary equipment and living quarters (200 kW) must also be considered although adding only a very limited amount of energy.
<p>
The on-board power plant should be thus designed to provide about 50 MW. Thus energy production for penetrator fabrication will itself be responsible for the emission of about 54 ton CO<font size=-2>2</font> per hour, that is to say approximately two and a half penetrators per day to be disposed as a results of local energy requirements. The effective treatment capacity of the site will be thus reduced to the equivalent of 4.5 Mt CO<font size=-2>2</font>/year.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>7. CARBON DIOXIDE TRANSPORT</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
This preliminary  study has considered for the moment only two options for the transport of carbon dioxide from a coastal site to a disposal area. The first, as liquid carbon dioxide transported in a refrigerated pressurised ship to serve an off-shore penetrator production platform. The second, as solid penetrators individually cooled at atmospheric pressure in a specially designed container-disposal vessel. A further option that has been investigated <a href="#ref9">[9]</a> is that of pumping through pipelines. In this case the CO<font size=-2>2</font> must be compressed to a pressure at which it is either a liquid or a dense phase fluid. Although marine pipelines at 500m depth have been studied <a href="#ref10">[10]</a> the ability to lay them at depths of 1000m or more is still to be demonstrated. However, as deep water technology develops, as it has done over the last two decades, such a option may become operationally and economically viable. 
<p>
For transport over ocean distances shipping remains the only method. One possible long-term alternative to specially designed pressurised low temperature ships could be to consider a dual cycle system combining hydrogen (clean energy) and carbon dioxide. On the basis of a generic formation reaction shown below,  methanol can be formed (Giacomazzi personal communication) and used as hydrogen transport vector. 
<p>
3 H<font size=-2>2</font>  +  CO<font size=-2>2</font>   =  CH<font size=-2>3</font>OH  +  H<font size=-2>2</font>O	
<p>
Exporting methanol from the site of production (large hydro-electric resources for the production of hydrogen), say from Canada, to Europe or Japan, could be carried out in normal bulk-liquid transport ships at atmospheric temperature and pressure.
<p>
On arrival in Europe and Japan the methanol could be pumped from the ship to the penetrator production platform (on the edge of the continental shelf) and catalytically reformed <a href="#ref11">[11]</a> to produce hydrogen and carbon dioxide (using further catalytic oxidation). Once separated hydrogen could be pumped as a gas by pipeline to an on-shore storage facility and the carbon dioxide solidified (the energy being provided by using a fraction of the transported hydrogen) and transformed into penetrators for disposal as described earlier.
Such an option appears interesting as it could perhaps contribute to resolving the problem of inter-continental transport of liquid hydrogen (~ -2530C, 13 atmospheres) as an energy source and at the same time contribute to carbon dioxide elimination. Clearly much more analysis is required to quantify the constraints of such an option.
<p>
</ul></ul><strong><font size=+1>8. CONCLUSIONS</font></strong><ul><ul>
<p>
As compared to the disposal from a ship of non streamlined solid (NSS) CO<font size=-2>2</font> blocks produced at an inland plant, the penetrator option offers major advantages without introducing un-resolvable difficulties for production, handling and disposal and without increasing significantly the power requirements either for land or sea production. Among the advantages of the penetrator option are :
<p>
       i)   losses of CO<font size=-2>2</font>  via thermal dissolution during free fall are sharply reduced, <br>
      ii) large tail embedments (>10m) can be achieved with streamlined bodies produced by moulding, <br>
      iii) very long retention times can be achieved by natural sedimentary geochemical sequestration, <br>
      iv)  core of the penetrators can remain as liquid CO<font size=-2>2</font> (lower energy consumption). <br>
<p>
Production and disposal of the penetrators require :
<p>
       a)  a sophisticated production facility (on land or at sea), <br>
       b) a specialised transport and disposal ship (for the option of  on-land production of penetrators), <br>
       c) a custom designed production and disposal platform, including  important shipping logistics support for CO<font size=-2>2</font> and fuel delivery (for the at-sea penetrator production option). <br>
<p>
Further development of the proposed conceptual designs are necessary to evaluate the fixed and operating costs of the penetrator fabrication plants (on land and at sea) and to optimise the system operation. Alternative CO<font size=-2>2</font> transport methods (pipelines, methanol) should also be considered as they could have implications on overall costs if the technology would be proven to be viable.
<p>
Finally, the complexity and shear size of the operations required to permanently dispose of a significant part of CO<font size=-2>2</font>  emissions from industrial production processes on a planetary scale, for any of the solutions proposed (sea or land production), are clearly considerable. However, the technical difficulties involved do not seem insurmountable compared to the classical problems faced by the offshore gas and petroleum industry. 
<p>
It is nevertheless, clearly necessary to confirm the various assumptions made on the physical, chemical and thermodynamic processes taking  place from the moment of launch of the penetrators to their final emplacement, as well as  their long-term behaviour in  deep marine sedimentary formations. It is thus important to develop theoretical and experimental research (including the investigation of prototype penetrators launched from disused ships) activities to validate (or otherwise) the feasibility of the concept. In this way one would not be caught unprepared if, in the future, the problem of atmospheric pollution by carbon dioxide became critical.

	    <B>ACRI</B> functions under a unified management structure, with
	    operations located in Sophia Antipolis (France). It employs a matrix
	    organization, that is, a combination of functional or line sections,
	    and of a project team.

	    <P>

	      ACRI has a wide experience in remote sensing system requirements,
	      analysis and ground segment design, mission analysis and requirements.

	    <P>

	      ACRI has also a wide experience in a variety of space problems such as
	      overall mission performances, orbital properties generator, spacecraft
	      axes steering control, signal characteristics to be detected on top of
	      the atmosphere, geometrical and radiometric instrument features and
	      distortion, and on ground processing algorithms needed to retrieve
	      accurate Earth and environmental signal and geophysical parameters.

	    <P>

	      In particular, ACRI has been continuously involved in mission analysis
	      tasks such as identification of optimal and attitude parameters for
	      Earth observation; optimisation of instrument mission performance:
	      coverage, signal dynamics characterisation on top of the atmosphere,
	      sampling geometry and signal quality, pointing accuracy and on board
	      calibration procedure. For instance, ACRI has performed the mission
	      analysis and requirements for MERIS, MIMR, MIPAS,
	      GOMOS,... instruments during the POEM-1/ENVISAT-1 Pre-Phase-A, Phase-A
	      and Phase-B. All the scientific and technical reports have been issued
	      to the ESA Scientific Advisory Groups (SAGs) members.

	    <P>

	      Furthermore, ACRI is well acquainted with the Earth observation
	      science community. As such ACRI has co-operation agreements with
	      laboratories in France (such as Service d'A&eacute;ronomie: J-L. Bertaux,
	      Institut Laplace: G. Megie, Laboratoire de M&eacute;t&eacute;orologie
	      Dynamique:
	      N.A. Scott, P. Flament, Laboratoire de Physique et Chimie Marine:
	      A. Morel, Laboratoire d'Optique Atmosph&eacute;rique: 
	      D.Tanr&eacute;,....., Ecole
	      des Mines de Paris: L. Wald) and European laboratories such as Finnish
	      Meteorological Institute: G. Leppelmeier, Free University of Berlin:
	      J. Fischer, GKSS: H. Grassl, Plymouth Marine Laboratory: J. Aiken, UK
	      Meteorological Office: P.  Curtis, Institut d'A&eacute;ronomie Spatiale de
	      Bruxelles: P. Simon...

	    <P>

	      ACRI is leading the project "Integration of remote sensing, in-situ
	      observations and numerical modelling applied to the northeast
	      Atlantic" in the frame of the "Human capital and mobility" initiative
	      of the CEC. ACRI is participating in the OCEAN project of the CEC
	      Joint Research Centre.  ACRI experience can be summarised in six types
	      of activities:

	    <UL>
	      <LI>i. User requirements: ACRI is currently in charge for
		the EUMETSAT Ground Segment support of the coordination with the users
		community. ACRI is involved with JRC in pilot projects, part of the
		Centre for Earth Observation (CEO) project, in charge of the
		collection of user requirements from experimental community on coastal
		zones;

	      <LI>ii. Mission Analysis: ACRI has been continuously involved in
		mission analysis tasks such as identification of optimal orbit and
		attitude parameters for Earth observation (yaw steering, ESA study);
		optimisation of instrument mission and performance: coverage, signal
		dynamics characterisation, sampling geometry and signal quality,
		pointing accuracy,... for instruments studied during the POEM-1 phase
		B: MERIS, MIMR, MIPAS;

	      <LI>iii. Ground processing: ACRI has performed the
		definition study for engineering and scientific data products of MERIS
		and MIMR instruments in the frame of POEM Ground Segment Phase B study
		(ESA contract led by Logica, MDA). To satisfy the global requirements,
		the MERIS and MIMR instrument operation will be permanent. All
		corresponding data should be acquired, processed following various
		levels, and disseminated in due time to user point of contact.


		<P>

		  ACRI is currently in charge of the complete definition of the
		  data processing chain of the GOMOS and MERIS instruments; the
		  definition covers all necessary processing steps from the raw data to
		  the generation of the geophysical products. (e.g. the MERIS Ocean
		  Colour products such as chlorophyll concentration, chlorophyll
		  fluorescence, type and Optical depth of marine aerosols or the GOMOS
		  ozone or aerosols vertical profiles among others).

		<P>

		  It includes the MERIS and GOMOS overall ground processing
		  architecture, detailed design, development plan, products and
		  algorithms definition specifications. The documentation follows ESA
		  Software Engineering Standards and Product Assurance Quality.
		<P>

	      <LI>
		iv. Guidance and Control:
		<P>ACRI has performed studies on MIPAS
		  instrument pointing requirements in order to aim at a stable
		  tangential altitude. ACRI has also performed, with the Laboratoire
		  d'Automatique de Nantes, a study on Guidance Navigation and Control
		  for moderate lift/drag Re-entry, applied to aero-assisted orbit
		  transfer (ESA Contract March 1991).  v. Navigation: ACRI has modelised
		  6 D.O.F. trajectories applied to as various subjects as a spacecraft
		  attitude, ship precise positioning (French Navy contract), re-entry in
		  the atmosphere .  vi. System Software: ACRI has developed general
		  purpose software in the fluid dynamics and combustion (ANSWER), ground
		  water (PORFLOW), surface and marine waters (TIDAL), atmosphere (RADM),
		  guidance and control (ANACOM), and Earth Observation (EOSS)
		  fields. This activity includes software sells, users training and
		  maintenance.
		<P>
		  ACRI has specified the software requirements for the future
		  MIMR end to end system simulator during the Phase-B of the MIMR study
		  (ALENIA Contract, 1991-2);
		  ACRI has performed under contract with DORNIER :
		  MERIS mission performances and end to end system simulator
		  (including on ground processing until level 2) development .
		  GOMOS mission performances and end to end system simulator
		  (including on ground processing until level 2) development.

	    </UL>

	    <I> A common concept is being developed for remote sensing
	      instrument simulators. The objectives generally recognised are to
	      assess end-to-end performance of the remote sensing process in order
	      to:
	      verify instrument and ground processing performance against
	      the mission objectives
	      provide feedback to the instrument design and tuning
	      provide a reference and support tool for the validation of the
	      mission ground segment in development, delivery and in-orbit operation
	      phases The simulator includes mathematical models for 1) signal (raw
	      data) generated from various Earth, atmosphere, etc. targets emitting
	      signal including environmental conditions (sun illumination, satellite
	      orbit motion, satellite axes steering control, target environment,
	      signal propagation...).  2) instrument hardware and electronic chain
	      simulator (MTF) generating instrument outputs from given reference
	      inputs signal (incident flux at the top of the atmosphere).  3) ground
	      processing simulator generating from raw data the data product
	      processed and calibrated on ground. These processes require to inverse
	      the geometric, radiometric and instrument transfer function using
	      dedicated deconvolution methods.  The mathematical models are
	      supported by a common infrastructure of data management and user
	      interface, tools supporting simulation results analysis such as image
	      quality assessment.  </I>

	Identification de structures hydrologiques de moyenne echelle
	ayant une signature en surface observable par satellite.
<P>	
	Detection de structure marines sur des images AVHRR et CZCS.
        L'etude porte sur la region du Golfe de Gasgogne. Une archive
	d'images AVHRR sur une periode de 15 ans a ete exploitee.
<P>
	Dans le cadre du projet OCEAN (Ocean Colour European Archive Network)
	des images CZCS ont ete utilisees.
<P>
	Le systeme permet la rectification geometrique et radiometrique
	des images (AVHRR et CZCS), un masquage des nuages,
        la detection des structures et leur cataloguage.
