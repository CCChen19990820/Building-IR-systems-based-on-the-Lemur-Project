But I don't understand howIntel gets hurt unless it stops delivering the best price/performance microprocessors.The more network connectivity the more we need MIPS. Andy Grove is rightthat DSPs are just a complex way of getting more MIPS. Just because bandwidthreduces some of the need for compression doesn't mean bandwidth reducesdemand for cycles.<BR><BR>In any case Gilder is very stimulating even when I disagree with him, andmost of the time I agree with him.<BR><HR><B><TT>Nicholas Negroponte - Director,<BR>MIT Media Laboratory, Boston, MA</TT></B> <H3>Debunking Bandwidth:</H3>When our world is fibered, the planet is like a desktop. Earth is but abackplane for a single computer. True. But as mere humans, the bandwidthwe're really interested in is the one that exists between us and computers,be they the size of a cuff link or a country. That bandwidth is often onewe want to be smaller, not bigger. Most of us, most of the time, want lessbits, not more bits. Sure we want gigabits, but only for a few millionthsof a second at a time.<BR><BR>Remember the early days of computing when stacks of fanfolded output weredropped on an executive's desk? People caught on quickly; that was data,not information. Today, for some reason, we have forgotten some simple conceptsabout what constitutes meaning and understanding and where they come from.You. So while it is real easy to ship vast amounts of data and high-resolutionimages back and forth between computers and while it is suddenly possibleto ignore geographic constraints, let's not forget that in many cases &quot;lessis more&quot; when it comes to bandwidth.<BR><BR>Narrow channels force us to be smarter. Yes, bandwidth will be free, butso will computing. The future will not be driven by either MIPS or BPS,but information and entertainment content. Andy Grove does not need to worryabout John Malone or Bill Gates. He has to worry about Michael Ovitz.<BR><BR><HR><PRE><B>Mark Stahlman - President,New Media Associates,  New York, NY</B></PRE><H3>Bandwidth to Burn: Now What Do We Do?</H3>Gilder has made a case for vastly expanded bandwidth overwhelming the influenceof the steady march of computing power. [But] what new need will drive businessesto translate the inventions Gilder describes into significant new mediaopportunities?<BR><BR>Apparently, it's the need for video-on-demand. [But] if this were a plausiblemass market, the streets of New York would be filled with bicycle messengersdelivering Tom Cruise with bags of Chinese food. No, during the next fiveto 10 years, bandwidth will certainly be consumed in much greater quantities--butfor completely different reasons. We will dramatically extend ourselvesand our social relationships with video-telephones. We will consume substantialbandwidth by substituting bandwidth for gasoline--through telecommuting.We will network to multimedia databases (such as the current Internet-basedWorld Wide Web) and dramatically expand our range of social contacts--acrossborders, cultures and tribes.<BR><BR>Unfortunately for Gilder's bandwidth braggarts, these enormous markets willbe built using a telecommunications technology which began deployment over10 years ago--ISDN--and in which none of them has any important financialstake today. Unglamorous, ungainly, even downright ugly, ISDN (integratedservices digital network) will be supplied by old-time telephone companies(not cable companies) and it will be driven by the steady progress of personalcomputers--themselves now a 15- to 20- year-old industry. As has been widelynoted, we tend to overestimate (sometimes dramatically) the near-term impactof new technologies and underestimate the long-range effects.<BR><BR>In this age, new technology hype has become an epidemic. Reality itself,as it turns out, is far more interesting.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael Slater - President,MicroDesign Resources,and Editorial Director,Microprocessor Report,  Sebastopol, CA</B></PRE>Increasing bandwidth will provide computers with more information to process,and this will increase, not decrease, the computational requirements. Havinghigh bandwidth makes it possible for the interface nodes to be less intelligent,but this is not necessarily desirable. Furthermore, the time frame mustbe considered; high-bandwidth WAN (wide area network) connections are notgoing to be widely available for years, and in the meantime, computationalpower will continue to be critical as a way to mitigate bandwidth limitations.<BR><BR>No matter how much bandwidth is available, it is still very desirable tohave high-performance computational ability in desktop systems. Renderingof three-dimensional images from mathematical representations, for example,is something that has widespread application not only in games, but in otherconsumer applications (like home and garden design programs). Orders ofmagnitude more performance will result in direct improvements in such applications,and bandwidth is no substitute here.<BR><BR>Finally, with regard to the inclusion of signal-processing capabilitiesin general-purpose microprocessors, I disagree with Gilder's conclusionthat this will not occur. Minor extensions to general-purpose architectures,such as the ability to perform four 8-bit additions in parallel using thesame hardware that normally performs a single 32-bit addition, will providea significant boost for applications such as video decompression. The costof adding these features is small, and the benefit is great. Sun and HPhave already made such additions to their processors, and I expect Inteland other x86 vendors will do so in the future. Dedicated DSPs will alwaysbe able to provide higher performance, but the incremental cost/performanceof adding functions to the host CPU is superior.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Michael E. Treacy - President,Treacy &amp; Co.,  Cambridge, MA{Treacy is co-author of The Discipline of Market Leaders}</B></PRE>[Gilder's] view is rounded on the narrow philosophy of technological determinism.It is a peculiar and persistent form of myopia based on the wobbly assertionthat the best technology will win in the marketplace. He who rides the besttechnological wave will ascend to glory. Oh, if it were only so! If technologydetermined success, there would be no Microsoft today. By any reasonablestandards, MS-DOS, the foundation of Mr. Gate's empire, was an average technologywhen it was brought to market more than a decade ago. But Microsoft hadall the other elements that created a compelling value proposition for itscustomer.<BR><BR>Value is what customers want. Intel has got what it takes and has been avalue leader for many years. Andy Grove has already begun to direct Intel'sdevelopment portfolio toward communications opportunities. He has read thesignals and made the call, just as he did several years ago when he vacatedthe memory-chip business, in advance of grinding competition and shrinkingmargins. With constant vigilance and change, Intel's success can continuefor years to come.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Howard Anderson - Managing Director,The Yankee Group,and General Partner,Battery Ventures,  Boston, MA</B></PRE>George Gilder's analysis of the changes in the computing and communicationstradeoff is brilliant, concise, analytical--and flawed. His portrait ofthe rapid changes in communications and relative disadvantage of the old-linecomputer industry (Intel, etc.) does not overestimate the movement. It underestimateshow the next 10 years will be the decade of Bandwidth on Demand. Considerthis: <UL><LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of bandwidth will drop faster than the costof computing. <LI>From 1995-2005, the cost of switching will drop faster than the costof bandwidth. </UL>Historical examples: The cost of a T1 line (1.54 megabits) coast to coastin 1985 was $ 40,000/month. Today? Under $ 2,000/month, a drop of 95%.<BR><BR>Assume the following: by 2000, computing is free, and bandwidth is free.Now--design the future!<BR><BR>The amount of money spent on ATM Research and Development (Source: YankeeGroup ATM Planning Service): <UL><LI>1993:$ 335 million <LI>1994:$ 550 million <LI>1995:$ 950 million </UL>So Gilder is right on about the impact of ATM. In fact, Fore Systems, whereour sister company Battery Ventures is the second-largest outside stockholder,carries a market capitalization of $ 900 million--on a $ 60 million salesbase demonstrating that the ATM value is well known within the industry.<BR><BR>This past year, the Yankee Group trained 5,000 end-users on the use of ATMtechnology and the most frequently asked question was, &quot;How in theworld am I going to use all that bandwidth?&quot; But it was only 10 yearsago that users thought they would fall off the end of the earth if theywent faster than 2.4 kilobits!<BR><BR>Which leads to some immutable laws about networks, which Gilder alludesto: <UL><LI>Networks always grow. <LI>Networks always become more complex. <LI>Networks find applications that double the bandwidth needed every threeyears. <LI>The cost of bandwidth is artificially high. </UL>Andy Grove is right: &quot;Only the paranoid survive.&quot;<BR><HR><PRE><B>G. A. Keyworth, IIThe Progress and Freedom Foundation,Washington, D.C.</B></PRE>George Gilder's article goes yet another step in establishing him as theforefront signal-to-noise processor&quot; of information technology. Yet,I confess to being somewhat confused by it.<BR><BR>My dilemma resides in what I will call the &quot;30-30 rule&quot;--thatwe humans can take in information at only about 30 megahertz through oureyes or, even slower, at 30 kilohertz through our ears. The kind of bandwidththat Gilder projects are important to machine-to-machine communications,i.e., to networks, but it is the computer (in some form, whether PC, PDA,digital-phone or digital-TV) that will continue to determine the &quot;match&quot;between bandwidth and the inherent limitation of the 30-30 rule.<BR><BR>Bandwidth is important, because it will make the connection a richer one,but the fact remains that we humans lack broadband input channel to accessall that bandwidth directly. And it is the computer that must bridge thatgap, keeping it in the driver's seat as we enter the realm of ubiquitous,connected computing.<BR><BR>Gilder's article makes an additional point, and one that falls too oftenon deaf ears in Washington. That is that bandwidth scarcity, the basis formuch of our telecommunications regulation, is an outdated concept. Onlymajor revamping of the government's role in telecommunications will permitthe natural competition between computing and communications to play out.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Eric Schmidt - Chief Technical Officer,Sun Microsystems,  Mountain View, CA</B></PRE>Gilder's article does a wonderful job showing the potential impact of thebandwidth revolution. Let me give you two examples of approaches in computersystems to exploit enormous bandwidth increases:<BR><BR>The speed of light is not doubling every 18 months. There is a revolutionin system design for small, fast machines just as significant as the onefor broadband networks in your article. What we call today &quot;large servers&quot;will in fact have to become physically very small. We are now approaching&quot;design for light speed&quot; in computer systems, and we have to keepour handy ruler, measured in nanoseconds, ready for each new board design.Light travels about four inches in a nanosecond in today's wires, so that,in a 500-megahertz (two nanosecond) computer design, we have less than eightinches of room for our signals to travel in a synchronous processor design(as most are). This means that the fastest computers in our future willalso have to be the smallest!<BR><BR>The backplanes of these machines have to be physically very short. The limitof a single backplane makes it hard to keep up with the improvements inprocessor speeds, using traditional backplane designs.<BR><BR>Switching becomes a core strategy for computer systems. Two approaches thatmerge switching and architecture are now popular. One, called DistributedShared Memory, uses a switching network to link cache-coherent memoriestogether. In DSM computers, the power of shared memory designs can be extendedover very high- speed switched memory networks. The other, called clustering,has been around for at least 15 years, and uses a switching network to linkcomputer systems. In this approach, applications are modified to share commondisks, peripherals and software.<BR><BR>Small size and switching are the future of high-performance computing. Bothare based on networking as their core. As the switched networks get fasterthese architectures will come to dominate computing. The fastest improvingtechnology, in this case networking, always drives the architecture. Thehollowing out of the computer occurs when high-performance computers trulyspan networks. ATM asynchronous transfer model, now in its infancy, is thelikely network for us to bet on.<BR><HR><PRE><B>Steven Dorfman - President,Hughes Telecommunications and Space Co.GM Hughes,  Los Angeles, CA</B></PRE>In &quot;Ethersphere&quot; (Oct. 10) Gilder offers the view that high- poweredgeostationary satellites--the mainstay, high-capacity platforms of our past,current and future service offerings--are already antiques, and soon willbe displaced entirely by thousands of low earth orbiting satellites. Thatthese highly touted systems are nonexistent, unlaunched and unproven [andrequire major technical breakthroughs] are details that conveniently escapeGilder's scathing assault on geostationary systems.<BR><BR>Gilder should recognize that new technology products are designed and broughtto market based on a host of considerations in addition to pure technicalfeasibility. Tradeoffs are--must be--made. But to Gilder, &quot;tradeoff&quot;would appear to be synonymous with &quot;sellout.&quot;<BR><BR>In the corporate world, this is business naivet&Ccedil;. In deciding whatform Hughes's new Spaceway and DirecTV services, for example, should take,our goal was to deploy systems that: maximized technology insertion, therebyminimizing risk; provided a low-cost service for which there was demonstratedconsumer demand; and faced minimal regulatory, technology-development, orfinancing delays, thereby expediting service introduction.<BR><BR>A Ka-band GEO system, evolved from U.S. defense communication satelliteapplications, Spaceway is the logical extension of Hughes's universe of120,000 very small aperture terminal antennas worldwide, used for privatenetwork, two-way voice, data and video. Our me-satellite regional approachprovides global coverage at a cost of $ 3 billion. Because service can berolled out incrementally, revenues can be generated before full system deployment.(By contrast, virtually all 840 Teledesic satellites must be operational--ata $ 9 billion system cost--before service can begin.)<BR><BR>Our comparatively low investment cost and highly efficient spot beam architecture,whereby we cost-effectively target our capacity to the world's most populatedregions, yield significant savings and low user costs. . .critical becausedeveloping nations with limited communications infrastructure are a keymarket.<BR><BR>For voice, we expect that developing regions without access to low-costterrestrial voice service will embrace Spaceway despite the fractional timedelay--at least until terrestrial infrastructure is available. This is asignificant, revenue- generating window of opportunity for us. As for dataapplications, our VSAT experience has shown that custom developed protocolsprovide totally acceptable throughput efficiency and seamless interactivity.In short, we believe &quot;the delay issue&quot; has been overstated. Thereis a different delay issue, however, that cannot be overstated. Gilder is,I believe, overly optimistic about how soon Teledesic's technology willbe ready--and hence, how soon service revenues can be generated.<BR><BR>I believe Spaceway is the best technological solution for this market atthis time. But if tomorrow the technology and market are in place so thatthe LEO system makes sense, rest assured that Hughes will introduce an innovativeLEO product of Our own.<BR><BR>Gilder attaches far too little import and value (in the form of operatingprofits) to today's technology. Nowhere is this more clear than in his assessmentof satellite direct-to-home television programming. Gilder calls DBS &quot;one-size-fits-allprogramming,&quot; stressing its lack of sufficient consumer choice andabsence of Interactivity. But in holding out for a fiber solution, Gilderis making a poor business decision.<BR><BR>Today, Hughes's two DirecTV GEO satellites are filled with 150 program channels.We are adding 3,000 subscribers a day, and will break even (three million)by mid-1996. With 10 million subscribers projected by 2000, DirecTV willbe a $ 3 billion a year business, with $ 1 billion in operating profit.<BR><BR>Waiting for the future, Gilder, carries a price tag most CEOs can't afford,and are not prepared to pay. <PRE><HR></PRE><H2><CENTER>GEORGE GILDER REPLIES:</CENTER></H2>I want to thank my correspondents for their alternately poetic, ironic,trenchant and pithy responses. So many of them, though, share the notionthat I predicted dire straits for Intel that I must assume a lack d clarityin my treatment of the issue. I predicted that new and larger opportunitieswould arise in the field of communications processors and systems that centralprocessing units would bear a declining share of total processing not thatthey would in themselves decline in any absolute sense. Indeed, CPUs shouldcontinue to improve their cost-effectiveness apace with Moore's Law, plusan increment for architectural advances in parallelism. Such advances, however,will fail to keep pace with the onrushing expansion of bandwidth, as furtherdetailed by Howard Anderson's intriguing letter. Bandwidth gains will befed on the demand side, as Mark Stahlman incisively observes, more by theneeds of teleconferencing and telecommuting than by the need for one-wayvideo-on-demand.<BR><BR>Thus I agree with Bill Gates that Intel can continue to thrive as long asit continues to produce the most cost-effective microprocessors. I did raisethe possibility, foreshadowed by Microunity's new semiconductor lab process,that Intel's existing technology might face rivals that could produce moreMIPs or gigabits per second per watt. Power efficiency will be a crucialindex in a time of seething CPUs and increasing demands for power- savingdesigns from producers of mobile appliances, such as the digital cellularcommunicators which will be the most common PCs of the next decade.<BR><BR>Focusing on gigabits per second as a prime spec, these devices may welleclipse CPUs in raw processing pace and find a wide range of applicationsin digital radio, real-time compression and decompression, pattern recognition,echo- cancellation and other digital signal processing uses. The demandsof these applications have already impelled an array of processing and architecturaladvances at Microunity, Texas Instruments and elsewhere in the pullulatingfield of DSP. Unconstrained by proprietary legacies and immense installedbases, perhaps other manufacturers will also find ways to excel the Moore'sLaw pace of Intel's majestic progress down the learning curve of three-voltCMOS technology.<BR><BR>Jay Keyworth and Nicholas Negroponte both eloquently point to the centralparadox of the information age. While production systems of the industrialage use scarce resources, such as land, labor, and capital, to create abundance,production systems of the information age use abundant resources, such asbits and bandwidth, to create knowledge scarce enough to fit the bandwidthof humans. This distillation function--delivering correct and useful datato human beings with their Keyworth window of roughly 30 kilohertz cochleaand 30 megahertz retinas--requires processing speeds orders of magnitudeabove the human rates, just to sample, quantize and codify the flow. Toscan, select, recognize, correct, decompress, echo-cancel, visualize orotherwise manipulate the data entails still further accelerations of processingpower.<BR><BR>Communications processors may well emerge as most efficient for many ofthese tasks. The idea that all such functions will be sucked into the CPUhas a long history, but motherboards and their buses remain as crowded asever. I suspect that the bandwidth explosion will offer many opportunitiesfor processors specializing in communications.<BR><BR>Steven Dorfman of Hughes, I predict, will do better both for his companyand his two-way communications from space by moving quickly rather thanslowly to low earth orbits. I fully share his admiration for the point-tomultipoint-powers of DBS and I have long cited them as a prime reason forthe obsolescence of cable TV regulations based on the assumption of monopoly.Indeed, I predict far more than 10 million users by 2000 if Hughes and itssuppliers can meet the demand. But satellite and cable TV vendors will prosperbest by providing two-way channels for the 110 million personal computersin the land. I expect that these channels--particularly CATV, not ISDN--willprovide the dominant access channel for computers over the next decade.<BR><BR>Above all, I hope that whoever Andy Grove fears most, it is not MichaelOvitz. Grove goes Hollywood and we'll all be in trouble.<BR><HR><BR><P><CENTER><A HREF="frbsindx.html"><IMG SRC="gilderow.gif" WIDTH="160" HEIGHT="49" NATURALSIZEFLAG="0" ALIGN=middle>Return to list of Gilder's<I>Forbes ASAP</I> articles</A></CENTER></BODY></HTML>

<H3><CENTER>&quot;We'll have infinite bandwidth in a decade's time.&quot;<BR>

<BR>
<HR><BR>
Andrew Grove, Titan of Intel, is widely known for his belief, born in the
vortex of the Hungarian Revolution and honed in the trenches of Silicon
Valley, that &quot;only the paranoid survive.&quot; If so, the Intel chief
may soon need to resharpen the edges of fear that have driven his company
to the top. Looming on the horizons of the global computer industry that
Grove now shapes and spearheads is a gathering crest of change that threatens
to reduce the microprocessor's supremacy and reestablish the information
economy on new foundations. Imparting a personal edge to the challenge are
the restless energies of Microsoft's Bill Gates and Tele-Communications
Inc.'s John Malone, providing catalytic capital and leadership for the new
tides of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Grove's response is seemingly persuasive. &quot;We have state-of-the-art
silicon technology, state-of-the art microprocessor design skills and we
have mass production volumes.&quot; These huge assets endow Intel as a global
engine of growth with 55% margins and more than 80% market share in the
single most important product in the world economy. Why indeed should Grove
worry?<BR>
<BR>
One word only may challenge him and with him much of the existing computer
establishment. Let us paraphrase a 1988 speech by John Moussouris, chairman
and chief executive of the amazing Silicon Valley startup MicroUnity, which
gains a portentous heft from being financed heavily by Gates and Malone:
If the leading sage of computer design, in his last deathbed gasp, wanted
to impart in one word all of his accumulated wisdom about the coming era
to a prodigal son rushing home to inherit the business, that one word would
be &quot;bandwidth.&quot; Andy Grove knows it well. Early this year he memorably
declaimed: &quot;If you are amazed by the fast drop in the cost of computing
power over the last decade, just wait till you see what is happening to
the cost of bandwidth.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Eric Schmidt, chief technical officer of Sun Microsystems, is one of the
few men who have measured this coming tide and mastered some of its crucial
implications. His key insight is that the onrush of bandwidth abundance
overthrows Moore's Law as the driving force of computer progress. Until
now progress in the computer industry has ridden the revelation in 1979
by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the density of transistors on chips,
and thus the price-performance of computers, doubles every 18 months. Soon,
however, Schmidt ordains, bandwidth will be king.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth is communications power--the capacity of an information channel
to transmit bits without error in the presence of noise. In fiber optics,
in wireless communications, in new dumb switches, in digital signal processors,
bandwidth will expand from five to 100 times as fast as the rise of microprocessor
speeds. With the rapid spread of national networks of fiber and cable, the
dribble of kilobits (thousands of bits) from twisted-pair telephone lines
is about to become a firehose of gigabits (billions of bits). But the PC
is not ready. Attach the firehose to the parallel port of your personal
computer and the stream of bits becomes a blast of data smithereens.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Tsunami of Gigabits<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The bandwidth bottleneck of telephone wires has long allowed the computer
world to live in a strange and artificial isolation. In the computer world,
Moore's Law has reigned. At its awesome exponential pace, computer price-performance
would increase some one hundredfold every 10 years. This means that for
the price of a current 100 mips (millions of instructions per second) Pentium
machine, you could buy a computer in 2004 running 10 billion instructions
per second. Since today the fastest bit streams routinely linked to computers
run 100 times slower, at 10 megabits per second on an Ethernet, 10 bips
seems adequate as a 10-year target. All seems fine in computer land, where
users rarely wonder what happens after the wire reaches the wall.<BR>
<BR>
In the face of the 10 times faster increase in bandwidth, however, Moore's
Law seems almost paltry. The rise in bandwidth does not follow the smooth
incremental ascent that the heroic exertions, inventions and investments
of Andy Grove and his followers have maintained in microchips. bandwidth
bumps and grinds and then volcanically erupts. The communications equivalent
of those 10 bips that would take 10 years to reach according to the existing
trend would be 10-gigabit-per-second connections to their corporate customers
next year.<BR>
<BR>
During the very period of apparent bandwidth doldrums during the 1980s,
phone companies installed some 10 million kilometers of optical fiber. So
far only an infinitesimal portion of its potential bandwidth has been delivered
to customers. Moussouris estimates that the bandwidth of fiber has been
exploited one million times less fully than the bandwidth of coax or twisted
pair copper.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the tide is now gathering toward a crest. This year, MCI offers
its corporate customers access to a fiber connection at 2.4 gigabits per
second. Next year that link will run at 10 gigabits per second for the same
price. Two years after that it is scheduled to rise to 40 gigabits per second.
Meanwhile, at Martlesham Heath in the United Kingdom, home of British Telecom's
research laboratories, Peter Cochrane announced in early September that
he could send some 700 separate wavelength streams in parallel down a single
fiber-optic thread the width of a human hair. Peter Scovell of Northern
Telecom's Bell Northern Research facility declares that by using &quot;solitons&quot;--an
exotic method of keeping the bits intact at high speeds through a kind of
surface tension counterbalancing dispersion in the fiber--it will be possible
to carry 2.4 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second) on each wave length
stream. That would add up to more than 1,700 gigahertz on every fiber thread.<BR>
<BR>
Blocking such bandwidths until recently was what is called in the optics
trade the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot; The light signals had to be
converted to electronic pulses every 35 kilometers in order to be amplified
and regenerated. Thus fiber optics could not function any faster than these
electronic amplifiers did, or between two and 10 gigahertz. In the late
1980s, however, a team led by David Payne of the University of Southampton
pioneered the concept of doping a fiber with the rare earth element erbium,
to create an all-optical broadband amplifier. Perfected at Bell Labs, NTT
and elsewhere, this device overcomes the electronic bottleneck and allows
communications entirely at the speed of light.<BR>
<BR>
IBM's optical guru Paul Green prophesies that within the next decade or
so it will be possible to send some 10,000 wavelength streams down a single
fiber thread. Long prophesied by fiber optics pioneer Will Hicks, these
developments remain mostly in the esoteric domains of optical laboratories.
But IBM recently installed its first all-optical product--its MuxMaster--for
a customer running 20 wavelengths on a fiber connecting offices in New York
to a backup tape drive in New Jersey. Telephone companies from Italy to
Canada are now deploying erbium-doped amplifiers. Long the frenzied pursuit
of telecom laboratories from Japan to Dallas and government bodies from
ARPA to NTT (now turning private), all-optical networks have become the
object of entrepreneurial startups, such as Ciena and Erbium Networks.<BR>
<BR>
Returning from the ethers of innovation to existing broadband technology
connecting to people's homes, Craig Tanner of CableLabs in Louisville, Colo.,
maintains that a typical cable coax line can accommodate two-way streams
of data totaling eight gigabits per second. In Cambridge and other eastern
Massachusetts cities, Continental Cablevision is now taking the first steps
toward delivering some of this bandwidth for Andy Grove's PC users. Today,
using Digital Equipment's LANCity broadband two-way cable modems, David
Fellows, Continental's chief technical officer, can offer 10 megabits per
second Ethernet capability 70 miles from your office. That increases the
current 9.6 kilobits per second speeds of most telephone modems by a factor
of 1,000.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term contributor to the tides of bandwidth is a
new communications technology called asynchronous transfer mode. ATM is
to telecommunications what containerization is to transport. It puts everything
into same-sized boxes that can be readily handled by automated equipment.
Just as containerization revolutionized the transport business, ATM is revolutionizing
communications. In the case of ATM, the boxes are called cells and each
one is 53 bytes long, including a five-byte address. The telephone industry
chose 53 bytes as the largest possible container that could deliver real-time
voice communications. But the computer industry embraced it because it allows
fully silicon switching and routing. Free of complex software, small packets
of a uniform 53 bytes can be switched at enormous speeds through an ATM
network and dispatched to the end users on a fixed schedule that can accommodate
voice, video and data, all at once.<BR>
<BR>
Available at rates of 155 megabits per second and moving this year to 622
megabits and 2.4 gigabits, ATM switches from Fujitsu, IBM, AT&amp;T, Fore
Systems, Cisco Systems, SynOptics Communications and every other major manufacturer
of hubs and routers will swamp the ports of personal computers over the
next five years.<BR>
<BR>
Why should all this bandwidth arouse the competitive fire of Andy Grove?
The new explosions of bandwidth enable interactive multimedia and video,
riding on radio frequencies, into every household--through the air from
satellites and terrestrial wireless systems, through fiberoptic threads
and cable TV and even phone-company coax.<BR>
<BR>
If the personal computer cannot handle these streams, John Malone's set-top
boxes, Sega or Nintendo game machines or Bill Gates's new communications
technology will. A communications technology that can manage multimedia
in full flood can also in time relegate one of Grove's CPUs to service as
a minor peripheral. The huge promise of the PC industry, with its richness
of productivity tools and cultural benefits, could give way to an incoherent
babel of toys, videophones and 3D games.<BR>
<BR>
Redeeming the new era for the general-purpose PC entails overcoming the
technical culture and mindset of bandwidth scarcity. In today's world of
bandwidth scarcity, arrays of special-purpose microprocessors constantly
use their hard-wired computer cycles to compensate for the narrow bandwidth
of existing channels and to make up for the small capacity of the fast,
expensive memories where the data must be buffered or stored on the way.
This is the world that Intel dominates today--a world of CPUs incapable
of handling full multimedia and radio frequency demands, a world of narrowband
four-kilohertz pipes to the home accessed by modems at 9.6 kilobits per
second and a world of what Moussouris call arrays of &quot;twisty little
processors,&quot; such as MPEG (Motion Picture Experts Group) decoders from
C-Cube and IIT, graphics accelerators from Texas Instruments and an array
of chips from Intel.<BR>
<BR>
By fixing the necessary algorithms in hardware, these devices bypass the
time-consuming tasks of retrieving software instructions and data from memory.
Thus these chips can perform their functions at least 100 times faster than
more general-purpose devices, such as Intel's Pentium, that use software.
But all this speed comes at the cost of rigid specialization. An MPEG-1
processor cannot even decode, MPEG-2. When the technology changes, you have
to replace the chip. Such special-purpose devices now handle the broadband
heavy lifting for video compression and decompression, digital radio processing,
voice and sound synthesis, speech recognition, echo cancellation, graphics
acceleration and other functions too demanding for the central processor.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, contemplate a world of bandwidth abundance. In a world of bandwidth
abundance, specialized, hard-wired processing will be mostly unnecessary.
In the extreme case, images can flow uncompressed through the network and
onto the display. Bandwidth will have obviated thousands of mips of processing.
The microprocessor instead can focus on managing documents on the screen,
popping up needed information from databases, performing simulations or
visualizations and otherwise enriching the conference. The arrival of bandwidth
abundance transforms the computing environment.<BR>
<BR>
Led by Grove's and Intel's bold investments in chip-making capability --
some $ 2.4 billion in 1994 alone--the entire information industry has waxed
fat and happy on the bonanzas of Moore's Law. Now, however, some industry
leaders are gasping for breath. Exkhard Pfeiffer of Compaq has denounced
Intel's avid campaign to shift customers toward the leading-edge processors
such as Pentium, embodying the latest Moore's Law advances. Gordon Moore
himself has recently questioned whether the pace of microchip progress can
continue in the face of wafer factory costs rising toward $ 2 billion for
a typical &quot;fab.&quot; He has pronounced a new Moore's Law: The costs
of a wafer fab double for each new generation of microprocessor.<BR>
<BR>
Sorry, but the new world of the telecosm offers no rest for weary microchip
magnates or future-shocked PC producers. Driven by the new demands of video
and multimedia, the pace of advance will now accelerate sharply rather than
slow down.<BR>
<H4>Feeding the Tiger</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplate the advance of the Tiger, Microsoft's all-software scheme for
video-on-demand based entirely on PCs. Although Tiger has been presented
as merely another way to build a &quot;movie central&quot; for cable headends
or telco central offices, its real promise is not to redeem the existing
centralized structure of video but to allow any PC owner to create a headend
in the kitchen for video-on-demand. Today, such capability would mean buying
a supercomputer plus an array of expensive boards containing special-purpose
processors. Tiger's consummation as a popular product therefore will require
a new regime of semiconductor progress.<BR>
<BR>
Driven by this imperative, a pioneering combine of Gates, Malone and Moussouris
is making an audacious grab for supremacy in the telecosm. Just three miles
from Intel and fueled by ideas from a 1984 defector from an Intel fabrication
team, Moussouris's MicroUnity is a flagrantly ambitious Sunnyvale, Calif.,
startup launched in 1988. Fueled by some $ 15 million from Microsoft and
$ 15 million from TCI, among several other rumored backers, it plans a transformation
of chip-making for the age of the telecosm, optimized for communications
rather than computations.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity's goal is a general-purpose mediaprocessor, software programmable,
that can run at no less than 400 billion bits per second--some hundreds
of times faster than a Pentium--and perform all the functions currently
done in special-purpose multimedia devices. Escaping the tyranny of fixed
hardware standards, the mediaprocessor could receive decompression codes
and other protocols, algorithms and services over the network with the video
to be displayed in real time.<BR>
<H4>The Great Bandwidth Switch</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In launching Tiger and MicroUnity, Gates and Malone are signaling a fundamental
shift in the industry. Ruling the new era will be bandwidth or communications
power, measured in billions of bits per second rather than in the millions
of instructions per second of current computers. The telecosmic shift from
mips to bandwidth, from storage-oriented computing to communications processing,
will change the entire structure of information technology.<BR>
<BR>
In the past, the industry has been driven by increases in computer power
embodied in new generations of microprocessors--from the 8086 to the Pentium
and on to the P-6 and new Reduced Instruction Set screamers such as the
Power PC, Digital Equipment's Alpha and Silicon Graphics new R-1000 (the
latest in the family from Moussouris's previous company Mips Computer, now
owned by Silicon Graphics). External computer networks typically run much
more slowly than internal networks, the backplane buses connecting microprocessors,
memories, keyboards and screens. These buses race along at some 40 megabits
per second, up to Intel's new gigabit-per-second PCI bus. Even when computers
are linked in local area networks in particular buildings at 10 megabit-per-second
Ethernet speeds, they face a communications cliff at LAN's end: the four-kilohertz
wires of the telephone company. Under this regime, the processor is king
and Moore's Law dictates the pace of change.<BR>
<BR>
In the age of the telecosm, however, all these rules collapse. When the
network increasingly runs faster than the processors and buses in the PC,
the computer &quot;hollows out,&quot; in the words of Eric Schmidt. The
network becomes the bus and any set of interconnected processors and memories
can become a computer regardless of their location. In this bandwidth-driven
world, the key chips are communications processors, such as digital signal
processors (DSPs) and MicroUnity's mediaprocessors, which must function
at the pace of the network firehose rather than at the pace of the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
For the last five years, communications processors have indeed been improving
their price/performance tenfold every two years--more than three times as
fast as microprocessors. This kind of difference add up. Soaring DSP capabilities
have already made possible the achievement of many new digital technologies
previously unattainable. Among them are digital video compression, video
teleconferencing, broadband digital radios pioneered by Steinbrecher (see
Forbes ASAP, April 11, 1994), digital echo cancellation and spread-spectrum
cellular systems that allow 100% frequency reuse in every cell. All these
schemes require processing speeds far in excess of the bit rate of the information.<BR>
<BR>
For example, in accord with the prevailing MPEG standards, digital video
compression produces a bit stream running at between 1.5 and six megabits
per second. But in order to produce this signal manageable by a 100 mips
Pentium, a supercomputer or special-purpose machine must process raw video
bit flowing 100 times as fast as the compressed format--uncompressed video
at a pace of 150 to 600 megabits per second. The complex and exacting process
of compressing this onrush of bits--compensating for motion, comparing blocks
of pixels for redundancy, smoothing out the flow of data--entails computer
operations running 1,000 times as fast as the raw video bits. That is, the
video compression algorithm requires a processing speed of between 150 and
600 gigabits per second--hundred of times faster than the Pentium.<BR>
<BR>
Similarly, just to digitize radio signals requires a sampling rate twice
as fast as the radio frequency--at a time when new wireless personal communications
systems are moving to the two gigahertz bands and wireless cable is moving
to 28 gigahertz. A broadband digital radio must handle some large multiple
of the highest frequency it will process. Code division multiple access
(CDMA) cellular systems depend on a spreading code at least 100 times faster
than the bit rate of the message.<BR>
<BR>
In order to feed the Tiger and other such bandwidth-hungry systems, communications
processors will have to continue this breathtaking binge of progress beyond
the bounds of the microcosm. Grove does not believe this possible. He contends
that the surge in DSP will dwindle and converge with Moore's Law, allowing
the central processor to suck in functions currently performed in digital
signal processors and other communications chips. DSP is nice, Grove observes,
&quot;but it is not free--unless, that is, it is performed in the Intel
CPU, obviating the need to buy a DSP chip at all.<BR>
<BR>
But in an era when the network advances faster than the CPU, it is more
likely that communications processors will gradually &quot;suck in&quot;
and &quot;hollow out&quot; the functions of the CPU, rather than the other
way around. Echoing Sun's perennial slogan, Schmidt predicts that the network
will become the computer. In this era, Moore's Law and the law of the microcosm
are no longer the driving force of progress in information technology. Bandwidth
is king.<BR>
<BR>
As the great pioneer of communications theory Claude Shannon wrote in 1948,
bandwidth is a replacement for switching. Since ultimately a microprocessor
is a set of millions of transistor switches inscribed on a chip, bandwidth
can even serve as a substitute for mips. With sufficient communication,
engineers can duplicate any computer network topology they want. As the
network becomes the computer, they thus redefine the optimal architectures
of computing. As an example, take the problem of video-on-demand now being
confronted by every major company in the industry from IBM to Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
In 1992, Microsoft assigned this problem to Craig Mundie, a veteran of Data
General in Massachusetts, who had gone on to found Alliant Computer, one
of the more successful of the massively parallel computer firms. As a supercomputer
man, Mundie initially explored a hardware solution, hiring a team of computer
designers from Supercomputer Systems Inc. SSI was Steve Chen's effort to
follow up on his successes at Cray Research with a machine for IBM. Although
IBM ultimately closed SSI down, Chen commanded some of the best talent in
supercomputers. Mundie hired George Spix and a team from SSI.<BR>
<H4>Looking to Software</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the surface, video-on-demand seems a super-computer task. It entails
taking tens of thousands of streams of digital images, smoothing them into
real-time flows, and switching them to the customers requesting them. Essentially
huge hierarchies of storage devices, including fast silicon memories, connected
through a specialized switching fabric to arrays of fast processors, supercomputers
seem perfectly adapted to video-on-demand, which as Bill Gates explains,
is &quot;essentially a switching problem.&quot; This is the solution chosen
by Oracle Systems, using its nCube supercomputer, and by Silicon Graphics,
employing its PowerChallenge server.<BR>
<BR>
According to Mundie, the SSI team developed an impressive video server design.
But they soon discovered they were in the wrong company. As Gates told Forbes
ASAP, &quot;Microsoft looks for a software solution to all problems. IBM
looks for a mainframe hardware solution. Larry Ellison owned a supercomputer
company so he looked for that solution. Fortunately for us, software solutions
are the most scaleable, flexible, fault-tolerant and low cost.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Enter Rick Rashid, a professor from Carnegie Mellon and designer of the
Mach kernel adopted by Next, IBM and the Open Software Foundation and incorporated
in part in Microsoft's Windows NT operating system. Rashid joined Microsoft
in September 1991 and began to focus on video-on-demand in 1992. Like most
other people confronting this challenge, he first assumed that the huge
bit streams involved would require specialized hardware--RAID (redundant
arrays of inexpensive disk) storage, fast buffer memories and supercomputer-style
switches. Soon, however, he came to the conclusion that progress in the
personal computer industry would enable an entirely software solution.<BR>
<BR>
For example, the memory problem illustrates a tradeoff between bandwidth
and processing speed. Expensive hierarchies of RAID drives and semiconductor
buffer memories managed by complex controller logic can speed the bit streams
to the switch at the necessary pace. But Rashid and Mundie saw that bandwidth
offered a cheaper solution. Through clever software, you could &quot;stripe&quot;
the film bits across large arrays of conventional disk drives and gain speed
through bandwidth. Rather than using one fast memory, plus fast processors,
and hard-wired fault tolerance to send the movie reliably to a customer,
you spread the images across arrays of cheap, slow disk drives--Seagate
Barracudas--which, working in parallel, offer bandwidth and redundancy limited
only the number of devices. Having dispensed with the idea of contriving
expensive hardware solutions for the memory problem, Rashid recognized that
with Windows NT he commanded an operating system with real-time scheduling
guarantees that laid the foundation for a software solution. On it, he could
proceed to build Tiger as a continuous digital stream operating system.<BR>
<BR>
Liberated from special-purpose hardware, the team could revel in all the
advantages of using off-the-shelf personal computer components. Mundie explains:
&quot;The personal computer industry commands intrinsic volume and a multi-supplier
structure that takes anything in its path and drives its costs to ground.&quot;
A burly entrepreneur of massively parallel supercomputers, Mundie became
a fervent convert to the manifest destiny of the PC to dominate all other
technologies in the race to multimedia services, grinding all costs and
functions into the ground of microprocessor silicon.<BR>
<BR>
Video-on-demand has been heralded as the salvation of the television industry,
the supercomputer industry, the game industry, the high-end server industry.
It has been seen as Microsoft's move into hardware. Yet nowhere in the Tiger
Laboratory in Building Nine is there any device made by any TV company,
supercomputer firm, workstation company, or Microsoft itself. On one side
of the room are 12 monitors. On the other side are 12 Compaq computers piled
on top of each other, said to be simulating set-top boxes. Next to these
are a pile of Seagate Barracuda disk drives, each capable of holding the
nine gigabytes of video in three high-resolution compressed movies. Next
to them are another pile of Compaq computers functioning as video servers.<BR>
<BR>
All this gear works together to extend Microsoft's long mastery of the science
of leverage, getting most of the world to drive costs to ground--or grind
cost into silicon--while the grim reapers of Redmond collect tolls on the
software. Exploiting another of Sun Microsystems co-founder Bill Joy's famous
laws--&quot;The smartest people in every field are never in your own company&quot;--Gates
has contrived to induce most of the personal computer industry, from Bangalore
to Taiwan, to work for Microsoft without joining the payroll.<BR>
<BR>
In the new world of bandwidth abundance, however, it is no longer sufficient
to leverage the PC industry alone. Gates is now reaching out to leverage
the telephone and network equipment manufacturing industries as well. Transforming
all this PC hardware into a &quot;Tiger&quot; that can consume the TV industry
is an ATM switch. In the Tiger application, once one ATM switch has correctly
sequenced the movie bits streaming from the tower of Seagate disks, another
ATM switch in a metropolitan public network will dispatch the now ordered
code to the appropriate display. Microsoft's Tiger and its client &quot;cubs&quot;
all march in asynchronous transfer mode.<BR>
<H4>The Masters of Leverage</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Why is this a brilliant coup? It positions Microsoft to harvest the fruits
of the single most massive and far-reaching project in all electronics today.
Some 600 companies are now active in the ATM forum, with collective investments
approaching $ 10 billion and rising every year. Not only are ATM switches
produced by a competitive swarm of companies resembling the PC industry,
ATM also turns networks of small computers into scaleable supercomputers.
It combines with fiber-optic links to provide a far simpler, more modular
and more scaleable solution than the complex copper backplane buses that
perform the same functions in large computers. ATM and fiber prevail by
using bandwidth as a substitute for complex protocols and computations.<BR>
<BR>
Microsoft Technical Director Nathan Myhrvold points to the Silicon Graphics
PowerChallenge superserver as a contrast. &quot;They have a bus that can
handle 2.4 gigabytes per second and which is electrically balanced to take
a bunch of add-in cards (for processor and memory).&quot; The complexities
of this solution yield an expensive machine, costing more than $ 100,000,
with specialized DRAM boards, for example, that cost 10 times as much per
megabyte as DRAM in a PC.<BR>
<BR>
This problem is not specific to Silicon Graphics. All supercomputers with
multiple microprocessors linked with fast buses face the same remorseless
economics and complexities. By contrast, the $ 30,000 Fore systems ATM switch
being used in Tiger prototypes--together with the PCI buses in the PCs on
the network--supply the same 2.4 gigabytes per second of bandwidth that
the PowerChallenge does. And, as Myhrvold points out, &quot;ATM prices are
dropping like a stone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The Microsoft sage explains: ATM switches linked by fiber optic lines are
far more efficient at high bandwidth than copper buses on a backplane. ATM
allows &quot;fault tolerance and other issues to be handled in software
by treating machines (or disks, or even the ATM switch itself) as being
replaceable and redundant, with hot spares standing by.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
As Gates told ASAP, video-on-demand is essentially a switching problem.
You can create an expensive, proprietary, and unscaleable switch using copper
lines and complex protocols on the backplane of a supercomputer, or you
can use the bandwidth of fiber optics and ATM as a substitute for these
complexities. You can put the ATM switches wherever you need them to create
a system optimized for any application, allowing any group of PCs using
Windows NT and PCI buses to function as video clients or servers as desired.
As Microsoft leverages the world, it won't object if the world chooses to
lift NT into the forefront of operating systems in unit sales.<BR>
<BR>
Mundie and his assistant Redd Becker earnestly explain the virtues of this
scheme and demonstrate its robustness and fault tolerance by disabling several
of the disk drives, cubs and servers without perceptibly affecting the 12
images on the screen. They offer it as a system to function as a movie central
server resembling the Oracle nCube system adopted by Bell Atlantic, or the
Silicon Graphics system used by Time Warner in its heralded Orlando project.
But the Tiger is fundamentally different from these systems in that it is
completely scaleable and reconfigurable, functioning with full VCR interactivity
for a single citizen or for a city. It epitomizes the future of computing
in the age of ATM, a system that will soon operate at up to 2.4 gigabits
per second. Two point four gigabits per second is more than twice as fast
as the Intel PCI bus that links the internal components of a Pentium-based
personal computer.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, ATM technology can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and an external Barracuda, between a video client and a video
server. To the CPU, a local area network or even a wide area network running
ATM can function as a motherboard backplane. With NT and Tiger software,
PCs will be able to tap databases and libraries across the world as readily
as they can reach their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives. Presented as an
application-specific system for multimedia or movie distribution in real
time, it is in fact a new operating system for client-server computing in
the new age of image processing.<BR>
<BR>
Gordon Bell, now on Microsoft's technical advisory board, sums up the future
of computing in an ATM world: &quot;We can imagine a network with a range
of PC-sized nodes costing between $ 500 and $ 5,000 that provide person-to-person
communication, television and when used together (including in parallel),
an arbitrarily large computer. Clearly, because of standards, ubiquity of
service and software market size, this architecture will drive out most
other computer structures such as massively parallel computers, low-priced
workstations and all but a few special-purpose processors. This doomsday
for hardware manufacturers will arrive before the next two generations of
computer hardware play out at the end of the decade. But it will be ideal
for users.&quot; And for Microsoft.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of equipment that feeds the Tiger, however, what Bell
calls &quot;doomsday for hardware manufacturers: may well be as profitable
as the current rage of &quot;Doom,&quot; the new computer game infectiously
spreading from the Internet into computer stores. The new Tiger model provides
huge opportunities for manufacturers of new ATM switches on every scale,
for PCs equipped with fast video buses such as PCI, for vendors of network
hardware and software, and perhaps most of all for the producers of the
new communications processors.<BR>
<BR>
For all the elegance of the Tiger system, however, Gates understands that
it cannot achieve its goals within the constraints of Moore's Law in the
semiconductor industry. The vision of &quot;any high school dropout buying
PCs and entering the interactive TV business&quot; cannot prevail if it
takes a supercomputer to compress the images and an array of special-purpose
processors to decode, decrypt and decompress them. Facing an ATM streams
of 622 megabits per second--perhaps uncompressed video, 3-D or multimedia
images--Eric Schmidt points out, a 100 mips Pentium machine would have to
process 1.47 million 53-byte cells a second. That means well under 100 instruction
cycles to read, store, display and analyze a packet. Since most computers
use many cycles for hidden background tasks, the Pentium could not begin
to do the job. Gate's adoption of Tiger, his alliance with TCI, his investments
in Teledesic, Metricom, and MicroUnity, all bring home face-to-face with
the limits of current computer technology in confronting the telecosm. With
MicroUnity, however, he may have arrived at a solution just in time.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity seems like a throwback to the early years of Silicon Valley,
when all things seemed possible--when Robert Widlar could invent a new product
for National Semiconductor on the beach in Puerto Vallarta, and develop
a new process to build it with David Talbert and his wife Dolores over beers
on a bench at the Wagon Wheel. It was an era when scores of semiconductor
companies were racing down the learning curve to enhance the speed and functions
of electronic devices. Most of all, the MicroUnity project is a climactic
episode in the long saga of the industry's struggle between two strategies
for accelerating the switching speeds in computers.<BR>
<H4>A New Moore's Law?</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Intel Chairman Gordon Moore recently promulgated a new Moore's Law, supposedly
deflecting the course of the old Moore's Law, which ordains that chip densities
double every 18 months. The new law is that the costs of a chip factory
double with each generation of microprocessor. Moore speculated that these
capital burdens might deter or suppress the necessary investment to continue
the pace of advance in the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Gerhard (&quot;Gerry&quot;) Parker, Intel's chief technical officer, however,
presents contrary evidence. The cost for each new structure may be approximately
doubling as Moore says. But the cost per transistor--and thus the cost per
computer function--continues to drop by a factor of between three and four
every three years. Not only does the number of transistors on a chip rise
by a factor of four, but the number of chips sold doubles with every generation
of microprocessor, as the personal computer market doubles every three years.
Thus there will be some eight times more transistors sold by Intel from
a Pentium fab that from a 486 fab. At merely twice the cost, the new fab
seems a bargain.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, Intel gets paid not for transistors but for computer functions.
To realize the benefits of the new fabs, therefore, Intel must deliver new
computer functions that successfully adapt to the era of bandwidth abundance.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it is worth noting that measured in telecosmic terms of useful
terabits per second of bandwidth, a MicroUnity fab ultimately costing some
$ 150 million might generate more added value than a $ 2 billion megafab
of Intel.<BR>
<H4>Return to Low and Slow</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Since as a general rule, the more the power, the faster the switch, you
can get speed by using high-powered or exotic individual components. It
is an approach that worked well for years at Cray, IBM, NEC and other supercomputer
vendors. Wire together superfast switches and you will get a superfast machine.<BR>
<BR>
The other choice for speed is to use low-powered, slow switches. You make
them so small and jam them so close together, the signals get to their destinations
nearly as fast as the high-powered signals. This approach works well in
the microprocessor industry and in the human brain.<BR>
<BR>
Despite occasional deviations at Cray and IBM, low and slow has been the
secret of all success in semiconductors from the outset. Inventor William
Shockley substituted slow, low-powered transistors for faster, high-powered
vacuum tubes. Gordon Teal at Texas Instruments replaced fast germanium with
slower silicon. Jean Hoerni at Fairchild spurned the fast track of mountainous
Mesa transistors to adopt a flat &quot;planar&quot; technology in which
devices were implanted below the surface of the chip. Jack Kilby and Robert
Noyce then substituted slow resistors and capacitors as well as slow transistors
on integrated circuits for faster, high-powered devices on modules and printed
circuit boards. Federico Faggin made possible the microprocessor by replacing
fast metal gates on transistors with slow gates made of polysilicon. Frank
Wanlass and others replaced faster NMOS and PMOS technologies with the 1,000
times slower and 10 times lower-power Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductors
(CMOS) that now rule the industry.<BR>
<BR>
Low and slow finds its roots in the very physics of solid state, separating
the microcosm from the macrocosm. Chips consist of complex patterns of wires
and switches. In the macrocosm of electromechanics, wires were simple, fast,
cool, reliable and virtually free; switches were vacuum tubes, complex,
fragile, hot and expensive. In the macrocosm, the rule was economize on
switches, squander on wires. But in the microcosm, all these rules of electromechanics
collapsed.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, switches are almost free--a few millionths of a cent.
Wires are the problem. However fast they may be, longer wires laid down
on the chip and more wires connected to it translated directly into greater
resistance and capacitance and more needed power and resulting heat. These
problems become exponentially more acute as wire diameters drop. On the
other hand, the shorter the wires the purer the signal and the smaller the
resistance, capacitance and heat.<BR>
<BR>
This fact of physics is the heart of microelectronics. As electron movements
approach their mean free path-- he distance they can travel &quot;ballistically&quot;
without bouncing off the internal atomic structure of the silicon--they
get faster, cheaper and cooler.<BR>
<BR>
At the quantum level, noise plummets and bandwidth explodes. Tunneling electrons,
the fastest of all, emit virtually no heat at all. It was a new quantum
paradox; the smaller the space the more the room, the narrower the switches
the broader the bandwidth, the faster the transport the lower the noise.
As transistors are jammed more closely together, the power delay product--the
crucial index of semiconductor performance combining switching delays with
heat emission--improves as the square of the number of transistors on a
single chip.<BR>
<BR>
Since the breakthrough to CMOS in the early 1980s, however, the industry
has been slipping away from the low and slow regime. Falling for the electromechanical
temptation, they are substituting fast metals for slow polysilicon. For
better performance, companies are increasingly turning to gallium arsenide
and silicon germanium technologies. Semiconductor engineers are increasingly
crowding the surface of CMOS with as many as four layers of fast aluminum
wires, with tungsten now in fashion among the speed freaks of the industry
. The planar chips that built Silicon Valley have given way to high sierras
of metal, interlarded with uneven spreads of silicon dioxide and other insulators.
Meanwhile, the power used on each chip is rising rapidly, since the increasing
number of transistors and layers of metal nullify a belated move to three-volt
operation from the five volts adopted with Transistor Transistor Logic in
1971. And as the industry loses touch with its early inspiration of low
and slow, the costs of wafer fabrication continue to rise--to an extent
that even demoralizes Gordon Moore.<BR>

In radically transforming the methods of semiconductor fabrication, John
Moussouris and James (&quot;Al&quot;) Matthews, MicroUnity's director of
technology, seem to many observers to be embarking on a reckless and self-defeating
course. But MicroUnity is betting on the redemptive paradoxes of the microcosm.
Returning to low and slow, Moussouris and Matthews promise to increase peak
clock speeds by a factor of five in the next two years and chip performance
by factors of several hundred, launching communications chips in 1995 that
function at 1.2 gigahertz and perform as many as 400 gigabits per second.<BR>
<H4>Matthews and Mead</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In pursuing this renewal of wafer fabrication at MicroUnity, Matthews has
applied for some 70 patents and won about 20 to date. A veteran of Hewlett-Packard's
bipolar process labs who moved to Intel in the early 1980s and spearheaded
Intel's switch to CMOS for the 386 microprocessor, Matthews has also worked
as an engineer at HP-Avantek's gallium arsenide fabs for microwave chips.
Commanding experience in diverse fab cultures, Matthews thus escapes the
cognitive trap of seeing the established regime as a given, rather than
a choice.<BR>
<BR>
At Aventek, Matthews plunged toward the microcosm and prepared the way for
his MicroUnity process after reading an early paper by Carver Mead, the
inventor of the gallium arsenide MESFET transistor. Mead had prophesied
that the behavior of these transistors would deteriorate drastically if
the feature sizes were pushed below two-tenths of a micron at particular
doping levels (technically impossible at the time). In the mid-1980s, though,
Matthews noticed that these feature sizes were then feasible. Testing the
Mead thesis, he was startled to discover that far from deteriorating below
the Mead threshold, these transistors instead showed &quot;startlingly anomalous
levels of good behavior,&quot; marked by high gain and plummeting noise.<BR>
<BR>
Based on this discovery, he created a low-noise, gigahertz-frequency amplifier
for satellite dishes being sold in the European market. Matthew's process
reduced the cost so drastically that Sony officials were said to be contemplating
claims of dumping. Avantek was charging a few dollars for microwave frequency
chips that cost Sony perhaps some hundreds of dollars to make.<BR>
<BR>
Having discovered the &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot; of gallium arsenide
devices pushed beyond the theoretical limits, Matthews at MicroUnity decided
to experiment with bipolar devices. Bipolar devices are usually used at
high power levels with so-called emitter coupled logic to achieve high speeds
in supercomputers and other advanced machines. Inspired by his breakthrough
with gallium arsenide, Matthews believed that biopolar performance also
might be radically different at extremely low power--under half a volt and
at gate lengths approaching the so-called Debye limit, near one-tenth of
a micron.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, Matthews was startled by &quot;anomalous good behavior&quot;
as processes approached the quantum mechanical threshold. It turned out
that at high frequencies biopolar transistors use far less power even the
CMOS transistors, famous for their low-power characteristics. At these radio-frequency
speeds, however, he discovered that the transistors could not operate with
aluminum wires insulated by oxide. Therefore, he introduced a technique
he had used with fast bipolar and gallium arsenide devices: gold wires insulated
by air. Replacing oxide insulators with &quot;air bridges&quot; drastically
reduces the capacitance of the wires and allows the transistor to operate
at speeds impossible with conventional device structures.<BR>
<BR>
With these adventures in the microcosm behind him, Matthews was ready to
develop a new process and technology for MicroUnity. Based on combining
the best features of biopolar and CMOS at radially small geometries, the
new technology uses bipolar logic functioning at gigahertz clock speeds,
with CMOS retained chiefly for memory cells and with gold air bridges for
the metalization layers. Perhaps it is a portent that the gold wires across
the top of the chip repeat the most controversial feature of Jack Kilby's
original integrated circuit. (Matthews is also seeking patents for methods
of using optical communications on the top of a silicon chip).<BR>
<BR>
In essence, Matthews is returning to low and slow. He is shearing off the
sierras of metal and oxides and restoring the planar surfaces of Jean Hoerni.
Because the surface is flat to a tolerance of one-tenth of a micron, photolithography
gear can function at higher resolution despite a narrow depth of field.
Elimination of the aluminum sierras also removes a major source of parasitic
currents and transistors and allows smaller polysilicon devices to be implanted
closer together. A major gain from these innovations is a drastic move to
lower power transistors. Rather than using the usual three volts or five
volts, the MicroUnity devices operate at 0.3 volts to 0.5 volts (300 to
500 millivolts). In the microcosm, smaller devices closer together at lower
power is the secret of speed.<BR>
<BR>
Although MicroUnity will not divulge the details of future products, ASAP
calculates on the basis of information from other sources that the MicroUnity
chip can hold more than 10 million transistors in a space half the size
of a Pentium with three million transistors. With lower power transistors
set closer together, the MicroUnity chip can operate with a clock rate as
much as 10 times faster than most current microprocessors and at an overall
data rate more than 100 times faster. Low and slow results in blazing speed.<BR>
<BR>
For ordinary microprocessor applications, an ultrafast clock is superfluous.
Since ordinary memory technology is falling ever farther behind processor
speeds, fast clocks mean complex arrangements of cache on cache of fast
static RAM and specialized video memory chips. By using the MicroUnity technology
at the relatively slow clock rates of a Pentium, MicroUnity might be able
to produce Pentiums that use from five to 10 times less power--enabling
new generations of portable equipment.<BR>
<BR>
MicroUnity, however, is not building a CPU but a communications processor.
In the communications world, the fast clock rate gives the &quot;mediaprocessor&quot;
the ability to couple to broadband pipes using high radio frequencies. Most
crucially, the mediaprocessor can connect to the radio frequency transmissions
over cable coax.<BR>
<BR>
Along with Bill Gates, one of the leading enthusiasts of MicroUnity is John
Malone, who for the last year has been celebrating its potential to create
a &quot;Cray on a tray&quot; for his set-top boxes and cable modems. For
the rest of this decade, most Americans will be able to connect to broadband
networks only over cable coax. Thus the link of TCI to MicroUnity and to
Tiger offers the best promise of an information infrastructure over the
next five years, affording a potential increase in bandwidth of 250,000-fold
over the current four-kilohertz telephone wires.<BR>
<BR>
The Regional Bell Operating Companies and the cable companies agree that
cable coax is the optimal broadband conduit to homes and that fiber optics
is the best technology for connecting central switches or headends to neighborhoods.
Looping through communities, with a short drop at each home--rather than
running a separate wire from the central office to every household--hybrid
fiber-coax networks, according to a Pacific Bell study can reduce the cost
of setup and maintenance of connections by some 75% and cut back the need
for wire by a factor of 600.<BR>
<BR>
In order to bring broadband video to homes, companies must collaborate with
the cable TV industry. Collaborating with TCI, Microsoft once again has
chosen the correct technology to leverage. With Digital Equipment, Zenith
and Intel all engaged in alliances for the creation of cable modems--and
several other companies announcing cable modem projects--Gates may well
be leading the pack in transforming his company from a computer company
into a communications concern, from the microcosm into the telecosm.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
All the bandwidth in the world, however, will get you nowhere if your transceiver
cannot process it. By returning to the inspiration of the original Silicon
Valley, MicroUnity offers a promising route to the communications infrastructure
of the next century, overthrowing Moore's Law and issuing the first fundamental
challenge to Moore's company. As Al Matthews puts it: &quot;Bob Noyce [the
late Intel founder with Gordon Moore] is my hero. But there is a new generation
at hand in Silicon Valley today, and this generation is doing things that
Bob Noyce never dreamed of.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Moussouris promises to deliver 10,000 mediaprocessors for set-top boxes
in 1995. As everyone agrees, this is a high-risk project (although Bill
Gates favorably compares MicroUnity's risk to his other gamble, Teledesic).
Even if it takes years for MicroUnity to reach its telecosmic millennium,
the advance of communications processors continues to accelerate. Already
available today, for example, is Texas Instruments' MVP system--the first
full-fledged mediaprocessor on one chip. It will function at a mere 30 to
50 megahertz but performs between two and three billion signal processing
steps per second or roughly between 1,000 and 1,500 DSP mips. Rather than
revving up the clock to gigahertz frenzies, TI gained its performance through
a Multiple Instruction, Multiple Data approach associated with the massively
parallel supercomputer industry. The MVP combines four 64-bit digital signal
processors with a 32-bit RISC CPU, a floating point unit, two video controllers,
64 kilobytes of static RAM cache and a 64-bit direct memory access controller--all
on one sliver of silicon, costing some $ 232 per thousand mips in 1995,
when Pentiums will give you a hundred mips for perhaps twice as much.<BR>
<BR>
This does not favor the notion that microprocessors will soon &quot;suck
in&quot; DSPs. DSP mips and computer mips are different animals. As DSP
guru Will Strauss points out, &quot;As a rule of thumb, a microprocessor
mips rating must be divided by about five to get a DSP mips rating.&quot;
To equal an MVP for DSP operations, a microprocessor would have to achieve
some 5,000 mips.<BR>
<BR>
Designed with the aid of teleconferencing company VTEL and Sony, the MVP
chip can simultaneously encode or decode video using any favored compression
scheme, process audio, faxes or input from a scanner and perform speech
recognition or other pattern-matching algorithms. While Intel and Hewlett-Packard
have been winning most of the headlines for their new RISC processing alliance,
the key development in the microprocessor domain is the emergence of this
new class of one-chip multimedia communications systems.<BR>
<BR>
One thing is certain. Over the next decade, computer speeds will rise about
a hundredfold, while bandwidth increases a thousandfold or more. Under these
circumstances, the winners will be the companies that learn to use bandwidth
as a substitute for computer processing and switching. The winners will
be the companies that most truly embrace the Sun slogan: &quot;The network
is the computer.&quot; As Schmidt predicts, over the next few years &quot;the
value-added of the network will so exceed the value-added of the CPU that
your future computer will be rated not in mips but in gigabits per second.
Bragging rights will go not to the person with the fastest CPU but to the
person with the fastest network--and associated database lookup, browsing
and information retrieval engines.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm will eclipse the law of the microcosm as the driving
force of progress. Springing from the exponential improvement in the power
delay product as transistors are made smaller, the law of the microcosm
holds that if you take any number (N) transistors and put them on a single
sliver of silicon you will get N squared performance and value. Conceived
by Robert Metcalfe, inventor of the Ethernet, the law of the telecosm holds
that if you take any number (n) computers and link them in networks, you
get n squared performance and value. Thus the telecosm builds on and compounds
the microcosmic law. The power of Tiger, MicroUnity and TCI comes from fusing
the two laws into a gathering tide of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
With network technology advancing 10 times as fast as central processors,
the network and its nodes will become increasingly central while CPUs become
increasingly peripheral. Faced with a CPU bottleneck, multimedia systems
will simply bypass the CPU on broadband pipes. Circumventing Amdahl's Law,
system designers will adapt their architectures to exploit the high bandwidth
components, such as mediaprocessors, ATM switches and fiber links. In time
the microprocessor will become a vestigial link to the legacy systems such
as word processing and spreadsheets that once defined the machine. All of
this means that while the last two decades have been the epoch of the computer
industry, the next two decades will belong to the suppliers of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The chief beneficiaries of all this invention, however, will be the people
of the world, ascending to new pinnacles of prosperity in an Information
Age. Although many observers fear that these new tools will chiefly aid
the existing rich--or the educated and smart--these technologies have already
brought prosperity to a billion Asians, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia
and China, previously mired in penury.<BR>
<BR>
Communications bandwidth is not only the secret of electronic progress.
It is also the heart of economic growth, stretching the webs of interconnection
that extend the reach of markets and the realms of opportunity. Lavishing
the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly productive
tools and unleashing creativity with increasingly fertile and targeted capital,
the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope to the masses of people
whom the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>

&quot;They'll Be Crowding The Skies.&quot;
</B></PRE>
THUS STEVEN DORFMAN, president of telecommunications and space operations
for GM Hughes_the colossus of the satellite industry_warned the world of
a new peril in the skies. Planning to launch 840 satellites in low earth
orbits, at an altitude of some 435 miles, were a gang of cellular phone
jocks and computer hackers from Seattle going under the name of Teledesic.
Led by Craig McCaw and Bill Gates, they were barging onto his turf and threatening
to ruin the neighborhood.<BR>
<BR>
You get the image of the heavens darkening and a new Ice Age looming as
more and more of this low-orbit junk_including a total of some 1,200 satellites
from Motorola's Iridium, Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar and Teledesic, among
other LEO projects_accumulates in the skies. Ultimately, from this point
of view, you might imagine the clutter of LEOs eclipsing the geostationary
orbit itself, the so-called Clarke belt, some 21,000 miles farther out.
Named after science-fiction guru Arthur C. Clarke, the geostationary orbit
is the girdle and firmament of the Hughes empire.<BR>
<BR>
In an article in Wireless magazine in 1945, Clarke first predicted that
satellites in orbit 22,282 miles (35,860 kilometers) above the equator,
where the period of revolution is 24 hours, could maintain a constant elevation
and angle from any point on Earth. In such a fixed orbit, a device could
remain for decades, receiving signals from a transmitter on the earth and
radiating them back across continents.<BR>
<BR>
The Clarke orbit also posed a problem, however_the reverse square law for
signal power. Signals in space attenuate in proportion to the square of
the distance they travel. This means that communications with satellites
22,000 miles away typically require large antenna dishes (as much as 10
meters wide) or megawatts of focused beam power.<BR>
<BR>
Now, however, a new satellite industry is emerging, based on gains in computer
and microchip technology. These advances allow the use of compact handsets
with small smart antennas that can track low earth orbit satellites sweeping
across the skies at a speed of 25,000 kilometers an hour at a variety of
altitudes between 500 and 1,400 kilometers above the earth. Roughly 60 times
nearer than geostationary satellites, LEOs find the inverse square law working
in their favor, allowing them to offer far more capacity, cheaper and smaller
antennas, or some combination of both. Breaking out of the Clarke orbit,
these systems vastly expand the total available room for space-based communications
gear.<BR>
<BR>
It is indeed possible to &quot;crowd&quot; the Clarke belt_a relatively
narrow swath at a single altitude directly above the equator. But even this
swath does not become physically congested; collisions are no problem. The
Clarke belt becomes crowded because the ability of antennas on the ground
to discriminate among satellites is limited by the size of the antenna.
Spaceway and Teledesic both plan to use the Ka band of frequencies, between
17 gigahertz and 30 gigahertz, or billions of cycles per second. In this
band, reasonably sized antennas 66 centimeters wide can distinguish between
geostationary satellites two degrees apart. That's some 800 miles in the
Clarke belt. Thus no physical crowding. But it means that there are only
a total of 180 Clarke slots for Ka band devices, including undesirable space
over oceans.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs, however, can be launched anywhere between the earth's atmosphere and
a layer of intense radiation called the Van Allen Belt. The very concept
of crowding becomes absurd in this 900 kilometer span of elevations for
moving orbits that can be 500 meters apart or less. Thus the 21 proposed
orbital planes of Teledesic occupy a total of 10 kilometers of altitude.
At this rate, 70 or more Teledesic systems, comprising some 65,000 satellites,
could comfortably fit in low earth orbits.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, it was clear that the LEOs, one way or another, were crowding
Hughes. Hughes commands satellite systems or projects that compete with
every one of the LEOs. Hughes responded to the threat of Teledesic by announcing
the expansion of its Spaceway satellite system, then planned for North America
alone, to cover the entire globe. Then, invoking the absolute priority currently
granted geostationary systems, Hughes asked the Federal Communications Commission
to block Teledesic entirely by assigning Spaceway the full five gigahertz
of spectrum internationally available in the Ka band.<BR>
<BR>
On May 27, Dorfman summoned the upstarts, Craig McCaw and Teledesic President
Russell Daggatt, to Hughes headquarters in Los Angeles for a talk. Busy
with Microsoft_the Redmond, Wash., company that in 1993 temporarily surpassed
the market value of General Motors_Teledesic partner Bill Gates did not
make the trip. But as the epitome of the personal computer industry, his
presence haunted the scene.<BR>
<BR>
Together with Spaceway chief Kevin McGrath, Dorfman set out to convince
the Seattle venturers to give up their foolhardy scheme and instead join
with Hughes in the nine satellites of Spaceway. Not only could Spaceway's
nine satellites cover the entire globe with the same services that Teledesic's
840 satellites would provide, Spaceway could be expanded incrementally as
demand emerged. Just loft another Hughes satellite. Indeed, Spaceway's ultimate
system envisaged 17 satellites. With &quot;every component proprietary to
Hughes,&quot; as Dorfman said, the satellites only cost some $ 150 million
apiece. By contrast, most of the $ 9 billion Teledesic system would have
to be launched before global services could begin.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, the new LEOs marked as decisive a break in the history of space-based
communications as the PC represented in the history of computing. Moreover,
Teledesic would be the only LEO fully focused on serving computers_the first
truly &quot;global Internet,&quot; as McCaw's vice president Tom Alberg
depicted it. It brings space communications at last into the age of ubiquitous
microchip intelligence, and it brings the law of the microcosm into space
communications.<BR>
<BR>
If you enjoyed the New World of Wireless on the ground with its fierce battles
between communications standards, technical geniuses, giant companies, impetuous
entrepreneurs and industrial politicians on three continents_you will relish
the reprise hundreds and even thousands of miles up. Launching Teledesic,
McCaw and Gates were extending bandwidth abundance from earth into space.
Observers, however, often did not like what they heard.

Bad Press For Two Billionaires
</B></PRE>
Every so often, the media is taken by the notion of technology as a morality
tale. In place of a gripping saga of unjustly obscure geniuses enriching
the world by their heroic creativity in the teeth of uncomprehending bureaucrats
and politicians, the media treat technology ventures as a school for scandal.
We have mock exposes of computer hype, monopoly, vaporware, viruses, infoscams,
netporn, securities &quot;fraud&quot; and deviously undocumented software
calls. Pundits gabble endlessly about the gap yawning between the information
rich and the information poor, thus consigning themselves undeniably, amid
many yawns, to the latter category. While American market share climbs near
70% in computers, networks, software and leading-edge semiconductors, analysts
furrow the brows of the Atlantic Monthly with tales of farseeing foreign
teams, spearheaded by visionary government officials, capturing the markets
of American cowboy capitalists. They spiel implausible yams of tough-minded
trade warriors prying open the jaws of Japan for Toys &quot;R&quot; Us,
closing down vicious Korean vendors of low-priced dynamic RAMs, or blasting
through barriers to U.S. telecom gear in the Tokyo-Osaka corridor, saving
the day for Motorola's soon-to-be cobwebbed factories for analog cellular
phones.<BR>
<BR>
One of these sagas began early this year with two Seattle billionaires,
McCaw and Gates, allegedly boarding McCaw's sleek yacht and going on an
ego trip. With McCaw pitching in an early nickel, and the boat, and Gates
hoisting his name as a sail, the two tycoons seemed to sweep away from the
shores of rationality, as the media told it, into a sea of microwaves and
arsenic. Spinning out Teledesic to build an information superhighway in
the sky, they proposed to strew the heavens with 840 satellites, plus 84
spares. All would whirl around the world at a height of 700 kilometers (435
miles), using what they told the FCC would be some 500 million gallium arsenide
microchips to issue frequencies between 20 and 60 gigahertz from some 180,000
phased-array antennas. The entire project seemed suffused with gigahertz
and gigabucks. &quot;We're bandwidth bulls,&quot; says Teledesic President
Daggatt.<BR>
<BR>
In case the hype of the sponsors failed to keep the system radiant and aloft,
fueling it also would be a total of 12,000 batteries fed by thin film solar
collectors stretching out behind the satellite &quot;birds&quot; in some
130 square kilometers of gossamer wings. Working at 4% efficiency, these
cells would collectively generate 10 megawatts of power, enough to light
a small city, but, so the critics said, insufficient to reach Seattle at
microwave frequencies in the rain. (The Teledesic frequencies are readily
absorbed by water in the air). To manage the elaborate mesh of fast-packet
communications among the satellites and ground terminals, the constellation
would bear some 282,000 Mips, or millions of instructions per second, of
radiation-hard microprocessors and a trillion bytes or so of rad-hard RAM.
In effect, Teledesic would be launching into space one of the world's largest
and most expensive massively parallel computer systems.<BR>
<BR>
At a mere $ 9 billion, to be put up by interested investors, Teledesic's
lawyers told the FCC, the price would be a bargain for the U.S. and the
world. (By contrast, current plans call for $ 15 billion just to lay fiber
for interactive TV in California). But former Motorola, now Kodak, chief
George Fisher fresh from pondering numbers for the apparently similar Iridium
projects_suggested that $ 40 billion for Teledesic would be more like it.
(Teledesic had the improbable result of making Iridium's 66-satellite plan,
greeted in 1990 with much of the scorn now lavished on Teledesic, seem modest).
Just rocketing the 840 satellites into orbit was said to entail a successful
launch every week for a year and a half at a time when hoisting satellites
is still a precarious and sometime thing.<BR>
<BR>
Even if Teledesic succeeded in getting the things up, so other scientists
suggested, the satellites would then be impaled on some 7,000 pieces of
space debris in the chosen orbits. In any case, so it was widely reported,
10% would fail every year, some tumbling out of orbit, others joining the
whirl of litter, where they would fly ready to impale the remainder of the
satellites and the remnants of the two billionaires' reputations.<BR>
<BR>
Surely these sages know that by the year 2001, when the systems would be
up and running, the world will be swimming in the bandwidth of &quot;information
superhighways.&quot; Why support this lavish launch of technology for a
communications system that would be dwarfed by capabilities already demonstrated
on the ground?<BR>
<BR>
Summing up a near-consensus of critics, John Pike, director of the Federation
of American Scientists' Space Policy Project, declared to the Wall Street
Journal, &quot;God save us. It's the stupidest thing I've ever heard of!&quot;
Provoking Pike may have been the origins of the multisatellite architecture
in the Star Wars &quot;brilliant pebbles&quot; program. Teledesic's most
amazing achievement to date has been to displace the Strategic Defense Initiative
as Pike's peak example of stupidity.<BR>
<BR>
While McCaw and Gates could be dismissed as tyros in the satellite field,
Hughes is world champion. Since 1963, the company has put 107 communications
satellites into orbit. With 19 in 1994, this year should be its biggest
ever. In 1993, well before the Teledesic announcement, Dorfman announced
the first version of Spaceway_a $ 660 million, two-satellite system offering
voice, data and video services_as a contribution to &quot;information superhighways.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In the midst of all the terrestrial uproar surrounding superhighwaymen Al
Gore, John Malone of TCI, Raymond Smith of Bell Atlantic and scores of other
telco and cable magnates, however, no one paid much attention to Hughes.<BR>
<BR>
Then came Gates and McCaw with Teledesic and claims of 20 million potential
subscribers, two million simultaneous connections, billion-bit-per-second
&quot;gigalinks,&quot; bandwidth on demand and an array of other features,
all advertised at a cost for Spaceway-type services nearly three times lower
per bit per second. Everyone noticed Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
At the end of July, though, Hughes raised the stakes. With successful launches
under way in China, Brazil and French Guiana to provide exclamation points,
Hughes made a new submission to the FCC, extending Spaceway into a nine-satellite
global system costing $ 3.2 billion. McGrath plausibly claimed it could
be in place long before Teledesic and offer nearly all its functionality
at a third of the price.<BR>
<BR>
Already planned to be in place by 1998, however, were several other LEO
projects, led by Motorola's Iridium and Loral-Qualcomm's Globalstar. As
mobile phone projects, these systems could not readily offer service at
T-1 data rates. But their sponsors promised availability for simple E-mail,
faxes and paging.<BR>
<BR>
By mid-1994, Motorola seemed to command the financial momentum. The company
succeeded in raising some $ 800 million in equity investments from companies
around the globe, including Lockheed and Raytheon (which would build the
satellites), Great Wall of China and Khrunichev Enterprises of Russia (which
together would launch a third of them), the Mawarid Group of Saudi Arabia
(which pitched in $ 120 million) and Kyocera, Mitsui and DDI, which together
put up another $ 120 million (Kyocera will build the dual mode handsets
for Japan and DDI will sell and service them). On August 10, an Indian consortium
purchased a 5% stake and a seat on the board for $ 38 million. Motorola
claimed its share of the equity was dropping to 28.5%, well on the way to
the company's final target of 15%. Motorola estimates that much of the additional
$ 2 billion in the plan could come from debt securities and loans.<BR>

Iridium's attractions are impressive. It provides ubiquitous global phone
service at a premium price with little or no dependence on local terrestrial
facilities. In times of disaster or political crisis, or in places with
sparse or unreliable local service, the system can route calls among the
66 satellites in space bypassing all infrastructure on the ground. For an
elite of government officials and corporate figures operating in remote
areas, the availability of Iridium should be worth the money. A bold and
visionary concept when it emerged in 1987 from a team in the company's satellite
systems engineering group, it endows many regions of the earth with voice
and limited data communications for the first time. For example, it actually
focuses on polar domains, such as parts of Siberia, poorly served by other
satellite systems. Kazuo Inamori, the venerable chairman of Kyocera, also
believes that Iridium will be popular in the 60% of territorial Japan not
currently covered by cellular.

&quot;Give Us Spectrum, Let Others Fight&quot;

</B></PRE>
None-the-less, beyond the bold and ingenious concept (Daggatt calls Iridium
&quot;the real pioneer of LEOs&quot;), the system suffers from technical
flaws. Were it not for Globalstar, perhaps these flaws would not have become
evident until alter the 66 birds were aloft. A far simpler and cheaper solution,
Globalstar uses 48 satellites with no links between them. Each functions
as a &quot;bent pipe&quot; transponder, receiving signals from a phone on
the ground and passing them back to any gateway within the satellite's 1,500-mile-wide
footprint, linked to locally available telephone networks. Because Globalstar
uses local phone systems rather than bypassing them, the system has been
able to raise a total of some $ 300 million in support from Alcatel, France
Telecom, Vodafone (serving the United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong),
Airtouch-U S West, Hyundai and DACOM in Korea, Deutsche Aerospace and Alenia.<BR>
<BR>
This amount may seem small beside the billion raised by Iridium. But Globalstar
has capital costs (at $ 1.8 billion) one-half Iridium's, circuit costs one-third
Iridium's, and terminal costs (at $ 750 each) one-fourth Iridium's. With
no intelligence in space, Globalstar relies entirely on the advance of intelligent
phones and portable computer devices on the ground; it is the Ethernet of
satellite architectures. Costing one-half as much as Iridium, it will handle
nearly 20 times more calls.<BR>
<BR>
The advantages of Globalstar stem only partly from its avoidance of complex
intersatellite connections and use of infrastructure already in place on
the ground. More important is its avoidance of exclusive spectrum assignments.
Originating several years before spread-spectrum technology was thoroughly
tested for cellular phones, Iridium employs time division multiple access,
an obsolescent system that requires exclusive command of spectrum but offers
far less capacity than code division multiple access.<BR>
<BR>
Like conventional cellular or radio transmissions that differentiate signals
by time slot or frequency, TDMA sharply restricts the reuse of spectrum
in nearby cells. By contrast, CDMA is a form of spread-spectrum communications
that differentiates signals by a spreading code and allows the use of the
same frequencies all the time, everywhere. Just as you can reduplicate wireline
spectrum merely by laying another fiber, you can now manufacture new spectrum
in the air merely by breaking large cells into smaller ones.<BR>
<BR>
Among some six companies seeking low earth orbit satellite approval from
the FCC in 1993, only Iridium used TDMA, requiring national and international
bodies to pick it as a winner from the outset and assign it exclusive spectrum.
By contrast, in a majority report issued to the FCC on April 6, 1993, CDMA
companies in the U.S., including TRW, Loral-Qualcomm, Celsat and American
Mobile Satellite, could all agree to share spectrum and let the market choose
winners. A Motorola lawyer explained to Space News, &quot;Give us the spectrum
and let the others fight for whatever's left.&quot; In the face of alternatives
with no need for exclusive spectrum allocations, Iridium could fly only
if it offered radically superior performance or capacity. But TDMA dooms
it to generally inferior performance and capacity.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike TDMA systems, which can &quot;see&quot; only one satellite signal
at a time, CDMA handsets have &quot;path&quot; diversity, using &quot;rake
receivers&quot; that can combine a number of weak signals into an intelligible
stream. Iridium and other TDMA systems compensate by using more power. But
no practical amount of power can propel a satellite signal through a tin
roof. And excess power means larger handsets or heavier satellites. Iridium
satellites together use 80% more power than Globalstar's, yet employ antennas
nearly twice as large and offer 18.2 times less capacity per unit area.
<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic also suffers from the use of TDMA. But Teledesic's T-1 capabilities
would compensate with 100,000 times more bandwidth and with a bit error
rate that can accommodate the new fiber standards such as SONET-ATM (synchronous
optical network/asynchronous transfer mode), which send packets without
retransmission. The issue is whether these features can justify the political,
financial, and performance costs of using a modulation scheme_TDMA_that
severely limits spectrum sharing and path diversity.<BR>
<BR>
So what is this, another saga of hubris on the information super-highway_to
go with the Raymond Smith-John Malone follies? Perhaps good new ideas are
harder to come by as company revenues grow into the billions, and Gates
and McCaw disinvest and diversify as fast as they can from their increasingly
cumbrous vessels of wealth. Having recently passed the billion-dollar mark
in his systematic process of disinvestment from Microsoft_he retains $ 8
billion or so_Gates at times seemed embarrassed by his link to this gigantic
project. He told us it was too early to write about Teledesic.<BR>
<BR>
No, the story is in fact more interesting. Impelled by the onrushing rise
in the cost-effectiveness of individual chips compared to multichip systems,
the Law of the Microcosm dictates decentralization of all information architectures.
During the 1980s, this centrifuge struck the mainframe computer establishment
of IBM. During the 1990s, the personal teleputer, summoning and shaping
films and files of images from around the world, will collide with the centralized
establishments of TV broadcasting. At the end of the century, Teledesic
and the other LEOs will usher in the age of decentralization in space.<BR>
<BR>
From this point of view, Gates' participation becomes more readily intelligible.
Gates seems always to follow the microcosm wherever it leads. A vision of
software for decentralized systems of personal computers informs everything
Microsoft does. <BR>
<BR>
In 1994, for example, Microsoft made an investment in Metricom, a wireless
terrestrial system that supplies links of up to 56 kilobits per second to
portable computers or personal digital assistants. Within cells, the devices
can communicate directly with one another; outside the cell, Metricom routes
its calls through an expandable mesh of nodes each the size of a shoebox
and costing less than $ 1,000. Based on spread-spectrum technology, the
system operates at power levels low enough to avoid the need for FCC licenses.
Yet it can be expanded to metropolitan-area dimensions.<BR>
<BR>
In many respects, Teledesic is Metricom in the sky. It is focused on computer
communications. It routes packets by the most convenient path through a
mesh of nodes. It is based on microprocessor technology. (Both Teledesic
and Metricom plan to employ devices from Motorola's 68000 family). As Gates
explains the system: &quot;Some functions are most efficiently performed
by large numbers of small processors working together, rather than a few
large ones.&quot; The entire new generation of low earth orbit satellite
systems relies on this centrifugal force of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
It was not supposed to happen this way. Just as Grosch's Law of the computer
industry implied that computer power rose by the square of the cost, there
was a similar law of the satellite industry that held satellite efficiency
to be proportional to see. In a popular text, &quot;Communications Satellite
Systems,&quot; published in 1978, James Martin cited an AT&T study showing
that just six satellites could carry all the long-distance traffic from
the American continent; no fiber optics would be necessary. &quot;The next
major thrust in the space segment should capitalize on the economies of
scale which today's technology offers,&quot; wrote Martin, urging creation
of &quot;massive hardware&quot; as heavy as several tons and &quot;immensely
powerful satellites with large antennas beaming as much information as we
are capable of using to our rooftops.&quot; Many satellite advocates, led
by Arthur C. Clarke, viewed with impatient scorn the expensive terrestrial
systems that somehow forestalled the manifest destiny of big birds to rule
the world of communications. 
<PRE>
<B>

Bringing The Microcosm To Space
</B></PRE>
In 1994, the big bird dream still flourishes in Spaceway, the international
consortium Inmarsat, and the new launch this summer of direct broadcast
satellite technology by Hughes's DirecTV, Hubbard's USSB, TCI's Primestar,
and Rupert Murdoch's imperial systems in Europe and Asia. Using centralized
satellites in geosynchronous orbits, DBS is the ultimate broadcast medium,
reaching billions of potential customers at the cost of reaching hundreds
of thousands through cable-TV systems. But these geostationary satellite
systems suffer from the same flaws as mainframes: sclerosis by centralization.
At a time when customers want the choice, control, convenience and interactivity
of computers, the big birds offer one-size-fits-all programming at specified
times, with little ability to control the flow or interact with it.<BR>
<BR>
The real showstopper in the long run, though, is a nagging half-second time
delay for Clarke orbit signals. Bad enough for voice, a half-second is near
eternity for computer communications; for the living-room and desktop supercomputers
of 2001, a half-second delay would mean gigabytes of information to be stored
in buffers. While companies across the country, from Intel to Digital Equipment,
are rushing to market with cable modems to allow computer connections to
CATV coax, geosatellites remain mostly computer-hostile. Even with the new
digital cosmetics of DBS, geosynchronous satellites are a last vestige of
centralization in a centrifugal world.<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, Teledesic brings the microcosm to space. Rather than gaming
economies of scale from using a few huge satellites, Teledesic gains economies
of scale by launching as many small birds as possible. Based on Peter Huber's
concept of a geodesic network_a mesh of peers equally spaced apart like
the nodes in a geodesic dome_Teledesic is not a hierarchy but a heterarchy.
Distributing the system responsibilities among 840 autonomous satellites
diminishes the requirements, such as message throughput and power usage,
for each one. Building redundancy into the entire constellation, rather
than within each satellite, yields higher overall reliability, while reducing
the complexity and price of each unit.<BR>
<BR>
As Craig McCaw explains, &quot;At a certain point, redundant systems create
more complexity and weight than they are worth. Rather than having each
satellite a 747 in the sky with triply redundant systems, we have hundreds
of satellites that offer self-redundancy.&quot; Eschewing the Hughes philosophy
of &quot;every component proprietary to Hughes,&quot; Teledesic will manufacture
and launch a large number of satellite peers, using off-the-shelf parts
whenever possible. This approach also provides economies of scale that,
according to a study by brilliant pebbles contractor Martin Marietta, could
lower unit costs by a factor of one hundred or more.<BR>
<BR>
Just as microcosmic technology uses infinitesimal low-powered transistors
and puts them so close together that they work faster than large high-powered
transistors, Teledesic satellites follow the rules of low and slow. Rather
than one big powerful bird spraying signals across continents, Teledesic
offers 840, programmably targetable at small localities. Just 435 miles
out, the delay is measured in milliseconds rather than half-seconds.<BR>
<BR>
The total computing power and wattage of the constellation seems large,
as is needed to sustain a volume of some two million connections at a time,
four times Spaceway's capacity. But with other link features equal, between
1,226 and 3,545 times more power is needed to communicate with a geostationary
satellite than with a LEO.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps most important, unlike Iridium, TRW's Odyssey, and Globalstar, Teledesic
from the outset has targeted the fastest- growing market of the future:
communications for the world's 125 million PCs, now growing some 20% a year.
And Teledesic has correctly chosen the technology needed to extend computer
networks globally_broadband low earth orbit satellites. The real issue is
not the future of Teledesic but the future of Iridium.<BR>
<BR>
In the short run Iridium's voice services cannot compete with Globalstar's
cheaper and more robust CDMA system. But in the long run Iridium could be
trumped by Teledesic. Although Teledesic has no such plans, the incremental
cost of incorporating an &quot;L&quot; band transceiver in Teledesic, to
perform the Iridium functions for voice, would be just 10% of Teledesic's
total outlays, or less than $ 1 billion (compared with the $3.4 billion
initial capital costs of Iridium). But 840 linked satellites could offer
far more cost-effective service than Iridium's 66.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium's dilemma is that the complexities and costs of its ingenious mesh
of intersatellite links and switches can be justified only by offering broadband
computer services. Yet Iridium is a doggedly narrowband system focused on
voice.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium eventually will have to adopt Teledesic's broadband logic and architecture.
To protect its global lead in wireless communications and equipment, Motorola
should join with Teledesic now, rather than later. Working with Lockheed,
Motorola is making impressive gains in satellite-manufacturing technology.
Supplying both handsets and space gear for computer networks, Motorola could
turn its huge investment of time, money and prestige in Iridium into a dramatic
global coup in wireless computer services. As part of a broadband system,
Iridium could still become a superb brand name for Motorola. But persisting
in a narrowband strategy in the name of avoiding Teledesic's larger initial
costs, Motorola's executives will end up inflicting serious strategic costs
on the company.<BR>
<BR>
Most of the famous objections to Teledesic are based on ignorance or misinformation.
Launch anxieties spring chiefly from the GEO experience. LEOs are 60 times
nearer and between a tenth and a third the weight. Teledesic satellites
are designed to be hoisted in groups of eight or more. From Great Wall in
China to Khrunichev in Russia, companies around the world will soon be competing
to supply low-cost launching facilities for the system. Orbital Sciences,
an entrepreneurial dervish near Washington's Dulles Airport with some $
190 million in revenues, has developed a low-cost method for lofting groups
of LEOs from an adapted Lockheed 1011 Tristar.<BR>
<BR>
Other fears are similarly fallacious. Teledesic will work fine in the rain
because the high minimum vertical angle (40 degrees) of its satellite links
from the ground reduces the portion of the path exposed to water to a manageable
level. By contrast, geostationary satellites must operate at eight degrees,
passing the signal through a long span of atmosphere. Made of tough new
composite materials, Teledesic satellites will endure the kind of debris
found in space mostly unscathed. The solar arrays can accept holes without
significantly damaging overall performance. All in all, Teledesic's designers
expect the birds to remain in orbit for an average of ten years. With most
of its key technologies plummeting in price along with the rest of electronic
components, the system may well cost even less and perform better than its
business plan promises or George Fisher speculates.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, widely charged with reckless technological presumption, the designers
of Teledesic in fact seem recklessly cautious in their assumptions about
the rate of microchip progress. For example, their dismissal of CDMA assumes
that the high speed of the spreading code functions_requiring digital signal
processors that race at least 100 times the data rate_pushes cheap T-1 performance
far into the future. Yet in early 1995, Texas Instruments will ship its
multimedia video processor, a marvel that combines four 64-bit DSPs, a 32-bit
RISC CPU, 50 kilobytes of on-chip memory, a floating-point unit and a 64bit
direct memory access controller all on one chip. This device now performs
two billion operations per second and, with an upgrade from 35 megahertz
to 50 megahertz clock rate, soon will perform three billion. The estimated
cost in 1995 is around $ 400, or a stunning $ 133 per bop (current Pentiums
charge three times as much for 100 mips). Five years from now, when Teledesic
gets serious, that kind of one-chip computing power can implement CDMA for
broadband data without any cost penalty. Future generations of CDMA systems
may be able to offer, at a dramatically lower price, the same broadband
services in mobile applications that Teledesic now promises for fixed services
only.<BR>
<BR>
Assuming that Teledesic meets the CDMA challenge, the other fear is that
terrestrial systems will capture enough of the market to render Teledesic
unprofitable. This fear, however, can come true only if governments delay
this supremely beneficial system well into the next century.<BR>
<BR>
Unlike the competition, satellite systems can provide global coverage at
once. Whether for $ 9 billion or $ 90 billion, no terrestrial system will
cover the entire world, or even the entire U.S., within decades of Teledesic.
As soon as it is deployed, it will profoundly change the geography and topography
of the globe. Suddenly the most remote rural redoubt, beach, or mountain
will command computer communications comparable to urban corporations today.
The system can make teleconferencing, telecommuting, telemedicine, and teleschooling
possible anywhere. Gone will be the differences among regions in access
to cultural and information resources. People will be able to live and work
where they want rather than where corporations locate them.<BR>
<BR>
This change transforms the dimensions of the world as decisively as trains,
planes, automobiles, phones and TVs changed them in previous eras. It will
extend &quot;universal service&quot; more dramatically than any new law
can.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, Teledesic can eliminate the need to cross-subsidize rural customers.
Determining the cost of wire-line services are the parameters of population
density and distance from the central office. Rural customers now cost between
10 and 30 times as much to serve with wires as urban customers do. Teledesic
will bring near-broadband capabilities to everyone in the world at the same
price.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, this expansion of the communications frontier will foster
the very economic development that will fuel the demand for the service.
Today, it does not pay to bring telecommunications to poor countries that
might benefit most. Teledesic and other satellite services break the bottleneck
of development. Simultaneously opening the entire world, it enriches every
nation with new capital exceeding the fruits of all the foreign aid programs
of the era.<BR>
<BR>
Teledesic is a venture worthy of McCaw and Gates. In its impact on the world,
it may even rival the Herculean contributions of its sponsors in cellular
and software. The issue is not the technology or the commitment of the principals.
The issue is the readiness of the U.S. government to accommodate this venture.
Before Teledesic can be approved internationally, it will have to attain
a license from the FCC in the U.S. It has taken four years to approve Iridium.
It took 30 years to approve cellular. How long will it take to approve Teledesic?<BR>
<BR>
Currently Teledesic, Iridium and Globalstar face several political obstacles.
The International Telecommunications Union's Radio Regulation 2613 gives
GEOs absolute priority over LEOs. For Spaceway, Hughes is now demanding
an exclusive license for the full five gigahertz available in the Ka-band
worldwide, leaving no room for Teledesic or any other Ka-band LEO. Under
current law, Hughes or other GEO systems could usurp any LEO that was launched.<BR>
<BR>
LEOs are a major American innovation. The U.S. government should take the
lead now in spearheading a change in the regulations to accommodate LEOs.
This is no minor matter. As the dimensions and promise of Teledesic loom
more starkly, the Japanese or Europeans are certain to make similar proposals.
&quot;When they do,&quot; Craig McCaw predicts, &quot;they will immediately
have their government on board. They will be able to go to the ITU right
away. My greatest fear is that we will have the technology all ready, and
foreign companies will beat us out because they can get their governments
in line.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government was on board for Apollo 25 years ago and the U.S. won
the first space race. This space race is just as important, but the government
is treating it as some sleepy-time infrastructure project. In fact, it is
the information superhighway going global and ubiquitous. It is the ultimate
promise of the information age, says McCaw. 
<PRE>
<B>

Sustaining The U.S. Lead In Technology
</B></PRE>
McCaw explains: &quot;It'll mean ecological disaster if China mimics what
we did_building more and more urban towers and filling them up with people
who queue up every day on turnpikes into the city, emitting fumes into the
air, and then building new towers and new highways when you want to move
the company, and then digging up the highways to install new wires.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
McCaw waves toward the window, out at Lake Washington. &quot;Look at that
floating bridge. It took $ 1.5 billion to cross Lake Washington, then it
got busted in a storm. Cross this lake, any lake, any ocean in the world
with broadband wireless. That's the promise of Teledesic. All you do is
to reconfigure the communications in software at zero incremental cost.
No wires for the final connections. It's what we do in Hong Kong and Shanghai,
where everyone uses a cellular phone.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
President Clinton, Vice President Gore and other members of the administration
continually ask what they can do for technology. One thing they can do is
vastly streamline the process for approval of communications projects. At
the moment, Congress is determined to retain bureaucratic dominance over
the most dynamic enterprise and technology in the world economy_what they
like to term the information superhighway. They see it as a possible source
of congressional power, campaign finance, employment and pelf, like the
Baby Bells today or like existing construction projects. Rather than turn
telecom into a vast porkbellied poverty program, however, the administration
should deregulate the field. Communications companies must be permitted
to compete and collaborate wherever the technology leads.<BR>
<BR>
Whether the administration knows it or not, these technologies are its greatest
political asset. The high-tech industries unleashed in the 1980s by venture
capital and junk bonds are now the prime fuel of the economy of the 1990s.
Comprising perhaps 60% of incremental GDP and 48% of exports, the momentous
upsurge of computers and communications is even compensating for the mistakes
of the Bush and Clinton regimes and making plausible Clinton's continuing
claims of economic success. But now Clinton, Gore and FCC Chairman Reed
Hundt must make a choice. If they want to maintain this redemptive U.S.
lead in technology, they must be willing to forge new alliances in Congress
to get the politicians and bureaucrats out of the way of the future. A good
start would be to open the floodgates for the global onrush of low earth
orbit satellites dedicated to computer communications. If they do, they
can help make the world, as McCaw's Alberg puts it, &quot;a truly global
Internet in an ever-expanding ethersphere.&quot; 
<PRE>
<B>
And The Winner Is...
</B></PRE>
Globalstar is the easy winner for current offering of mobile phone services
under a CDMA regime of spectrum sharing. But Teledesic can add phone services
to its broadband computer system. Over time, Teledesic's 840 satellites
will outperform Globalstar's 48. Big question: When will microchip technology
advance enough to allow broadband applications over CDMA? When that happens,
Globalstar has a shot at the grand prize.<BR>
<BR>
Iridium is both too expensive to compete in mobile phones and too narrowband
for data. Today's champ Spaceway is maturing. Big winner for the next decade
is... Teledesic.

<HR><BR>
Big Government and Mass Media always feed on fear of monsters. While politicians
promise to protect the people from the dreaded private sector, leading newspapers
such as the Washington Post and network shows such as &quot;60 Minutes&quot;
chime in with continuing reports on the economy as seen from the shores
of Loch Ness. Peering through the shifting, inscrutable murk of the marketplace,
pundits both private and public can descry beneath every ripple of industrial
change the spectral shape of some circling shark or serpent from which only
a new bureaucracy or liberal constabulary can save us.<BR>
<BR>
There are always many witnesses to the threat. In his campaigns of creative
destruction, any great capitalist provokes enough panic in the establishment
to fuel the beadles who would bring him down. Losing competitors, whether
in oil or software, are always in the vanguard of the monster hunt, which
is therefore usually launched in the name of &quot;competition&quot; and
is designed to stop it in its tracks before anyone wins.<BR>
<BR>
In the industrial era it was the so-called Robber Barons--creators of the
great industries of oil, steel and finance--who greased the growth of government
with their chimerical menace. Radically reducing the prices of their products,
such leaders as Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan expanded the economy to
serve middle- and lower-income customers and laid the foundation for the
American industrial leadership that triumphed in two world wars. But at
the same time, charged with predatory pricing, collusive marketing dumping
and other competitive violations, Rockefeller, Carnegie and Morgan emerged
as the monsters of monopoly who fueled the growth of government through
the first 40 years of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Now, with information technology driving private sector wealth and power,
there is a need for new monsters to fuel new sieges of government and regulatory
growth. This time the monsters bear the names of Milken, Gates and Malone--new
trolls to terrify little children and cause competitors to cozen Washington
and judges to reach for their RICO bludgeons and commissioners to salivate
and shuffle subpoenas and senators to tremble and wreak new tomes of law
and bureaucrats to sow the economy with minefields of abstruse new rules.<BR>
<BR>
Of the three new monsters, big government managed to deliver us first from
Michael Milken, depicted as a Banker Shark. But Milken's vision impregnably
survives in the form of the industries and infrastructures he financed,
chiefly cellular phones, fiber optics and cable television--the forces that
laid the foundation for a new broadband economy.<BR>
<BR>
With Milken laid low by cancer and the courts, Washington needed new monsters
for the 1990s. After serious and continuing contemplation of Bill Gates
as a possible MicroShark hidden amid the mazes of Windows and DOS, Washington
recently has focused on the formidable visage of John Malone.<BR>
<BR>
As the titan of cable and leader of Tele-Communications Inc., better known
as TCI, he was a billion-dollar beneficiary of Milken's bonds. At a time
when governments everywhere covet the huge, new wealth emerging from information
superhighways, Malone has become the favored target of the Loch Ness news
hounds and public-law pinstripes: an Abominable Snowman ranging down from
the Rockies to raid and ruin rival companies, terrorize politicians and
gouge his 21 million customers. Or, in the words of then Senator Albert
Gore, Malone is Darth Vader himself.<BR>
<BR>
This particular monster hunt, however, could not be more ill- timed. There
is no way that this administration can demonize the cable industry and micromanage
telecom without direly damaging all its hopes for an information superhighway
and thus the best prospects for the future of the U.S. economy. Just as
the automobile industry was the real heir to the triumphs of the &quot;robber
barons&quot; in oil, steel and finance, so the computer industry--the core
of U.S. world industrial leadership--will be the chief beneficiary of cable
and telecom ventures in broadband networks.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. now commands global dominance in computer technology. But as Andrew
Grove told Forbes ASAP, &quot;infinite processing power will only get you
so far with limited bandwidth.&quot; The next generation of computer progress
depends upon the efficient use of cable bandwidth to homes and home offices,
which comprise a fist-growing 60 percent of the current market for computers.
Even if computer executives fail to see the threat, the monster hunt against
cable thus jeopardizes the supreme achievement of the American economy over
the last decade--its global lead in computers.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. government constantly reiterates its desire for information superhighways.
The problem is that punctuating the call for broadband nets is an insistent
mantra of &quot;competition&quot; that reverberates through the speeches
of nearly all participants in the debate. As Ward White, vice-president
of government affairs for the U.S. Telephone Association, points out, however,
this mantra of competition &quot;disguises a new scheme of market allocation
run by the regulators.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
In this competition no one can win or make any money. The $ 10 billion in
profits claimed by the Baby Bells still under the Greene thumb are highly
questionable. Most of their copper wires and narrowband switches--rapidly
obsolescing by any objective standard--are being written off over decades.
That means the real costs of the Bells should be much higher than their
announced costs, which do not adequately reflect the fact that their $ 300
billion worth of plant and equipment is rapidly losing market value. As
TCI's sharp and salty young COO, Brendan Clouston, points out, telephone
companies are used to pretending to make money under rate-of-return regulations
when they are really losing it.<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies, by contrast, are used to pretending to lose money when
in fact they are raking it in. A standing joke around the offices of John
Malone's cable empire, which comprises TCI and Liberty Media, asks what
Malone will do if the firm ever reports a large profit. The answer: Fire
the accountant. Indeed, TCI did not report even a cosmetic profit until
the first quarter of 1993. Cable firms were financed with junk bonds and
other debt that allows investors to be paid off with tax- deductible interest
payments rather than double-taxed dividends and capital gains favored by
the telcos.<BR>
<BR>
Michael Milken, the financial father of the cable industry, channeled some
$ 10 billion in high-yield securities to TCI, Time Warner, Turner, Viacom
and other cable firms at a time when they were struggling for survival.
As a result, the cable companies are eight times more leveraged in their
debt-equity ratios than telephone companies are. But driven by the demands
of debt, the cable firms use their capital some two-and-a-half times more
efficiently. Generating $ 20 billion in revenues, one-fourth as much as
the telcos, cable firms use just one-tenth the capital.<BR>
<BR>
The cable companies are leveraged at a rate of between seven- and ten-to-one
on their cash flow. Moreover, some 60 percent of cable company assets are
&quot;good will.&quot; Included in the purchase price of new acquisitions,
&quot;good will&quot; represents the intangible value of cash flows and
synergies expected from new technologies and programming.<BR>
<BR>
Built on vision and debt, such entrepreneurial companies cannot invest without
the possibility of large returns. Attack the cable industry's cash flow
and prospects, and you attack its lifeline. Attack the cable industry's
cash flow and prospects, and you reduce its available investment by a factor
of five or more. Bell Atlantic was originally willing to pay for TCI nearly
12 times its cash flow. 
<PRE><B>

The Real Monster:  Government
</B></PRE>
In this highly leveraged arena government itself is the real monster: an
800-pound gorilla. Where does the 800-pound gorilla sit? Wherever it wants.
Early in April of this year it chose to sit on the cable industry. More
specifically, it plumped down in the middle of Brendan Clouston's desk in
the form of a 700-page FCC document reregulating the cable industry. It
was full of detailed regulations on everything from how fast he must pick
up his phones for customer complaints and what he should charge for each
tier of service and for each component of cable gear, to how large, implicitly,
his return on investment can be (about 11.5 percent). He faced the mandate
to adjust nearly every price and policy in the company within six weeks
and to justify each price by filling out 60 pages of forms. In a menacing
note for the future portending new government plans for redistributionist
pricing, he is required to report the median income in each of his service
areas.<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is not really to blame for this onslaught, since it resisted the
new congressional power grab. In any case, this agency is only part of Clouston's
problem. He also faces an aggressive new spirit at the Federal Trade Commission,
at the Department of Justice and in Congress, which permits him to collaborate
with any company as long as it is not a telephone firm with useful fiber
networks and switching systems in TCI's own regions. Full of rhetoric inviting
every industry from the telcos to the power companies into the cable trade,
many of the legislative proposals, FTC policies and FCC ukases converging
on Clouston's desk seem to be intended to transform cable from a galvanizing
entrepreneurial force in the U.S. economy into a sleepy-time public utility
run by lawyers. At stake is the future of the information superhighway and
thus the future of the U.S. economy. 
<PRE>
<B>

Superhighway Hype is Understated
</B></PRE>
Information superhighways are one of those rare technologies that are actually
far more powerful and promising than the hype surrounding them. The first
fruits of this development are already evident, as the U.S. has led the
world in deploying computer networks. Over the next five years broadband
networks can transform the entire economy, projecting it onto a higher plane
of growth and productivity.<BR>
<BR>
For the last decade the performance of the economy has perplexed the economics
profession. Throughout the 1980s most economists predicted that U.S. interest
rates would soar as a result of world-lagging rates of personal savings.
When interest rates instead dropped, economists pointed to a &quot;dangerous
dependence&quot; on foreign sources of capital such as Japan, which were
investing close to $ 100 billion annually in the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
Today, adverse tax and regulatory policies in the U.S. have entirely reversed
capital flows, with funds now leaving the U.S. for foreign markets at an
annual rate of $ 80 billion. Meanwhile, as Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence
Lindsey has warned, personal savings have plunged to all-time lows. By every
rule of economics, interest rates should soar or growth should collapse.<BR>
<BR>
Yet despite a slight upward drift in recent months, U.S. interest rates
remain low by historic standards, and the U.S. continues to lead the major
powers in economic growth and has extended its lead in productivity. As
Michael Jensen of Harvard Business School has shown, a close analysis of
the figures from U.S. corporations now reveals a historic acceleration of
U.S. productivity growth during the 1980s. According to an analysis by Morgan
Stanley, between 1987 and 1992 U.S. corporations captured some 47.7 percent
of global profits and 37.4 percent of global sales. Continued slumps in
Europe and Japan combined with reviving growth in the U.S. indicate that
U.S. market share is still rising.<BR>
<BR>
This record of supremacy is entirely baffling to the economics profession
and its megaphones in the media. Focusing on the Loch Ness news, they have
spent a decade in lamentations over the prospects of the U.S. economy, reaching
a pitch of funereal keening during the 1992 election campaigns. But to analysts
focused on the ever-growing U.S. lead in technology, these results are no
mystery at all.<BR>
<BR>
U.S. supremacy is focused on information tools and spearheaded by computer
networks. U.S. companies command some two-thirds of the world's profits
in information technology, hardware and software, and entirely dominate
world markets in computer networks. Half the world's 110 million personal
computers are in the U.S., and between 1989 and 1993 the share connected
to networks rose from less than 10 percent to more than 60 percent.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate information industry is finance. During the last decade the
U.S. employed information technology to transform its financial system.
Spearheaded by Milken and a $ 200 billion junk bond market, the U.S. drastically
reduced the role of banks and proliferated an array of more flexible and
specialized financial agencies. While over the last 12 years banks' share
of private credit for non-financial companies dropped from two- thirds to
less than 20 percent, the U.S. surged into global leadership in applying
information technology to the field of financial innovation.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the law of the microcosm shattered the financial system into
silicon smithereens and vastly enhanced its productivity. As the late Warren
Brookes has written, &quot;If every bank is nothing more than an information
system, then by definition every information system has the capacity to
be a bank, and every owner of an information system, from a desktop computer
to a mainframe terminal, can be a banker.&quot; What happened was that thousands
of brokers, mathematicians, financial consultants, insurance salespeople,
credit card merchants and bonds traders took this opportunity to break into
the field of financial entrepreneurship.<BR>
<BR>
As a result, the U.S. set an entirely new world standard for capital efficiency,
generating far more economic growth per dollar of savings than any other
country. As explained two centuries ago by Adam Smith, key to productivity
growth is the refinement of the division of labor, the expansion of specialization,
the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and niches. The key force fostering
specialization in the U.S. is computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade computer networks will expand their bandwidth by factors
of thousands and reconstruct the entire U.S. economy in their image. TV
will expire and transpire into a new cornucopia of choice and empowerment.
Great cities will hollow out as the best and brightest in them retreat to
rural redoubts and reach out to global markets and communities. The most
deprived ghetto child in the most blighted project will gain educational
opportunities exceeding those of today's suburban preppie. Small towns will
become industrial centers in the new information economy. Hollywood and
Wall Street will totter and diffuse to all points of the nation and the
globe. Families will regroup around the evolving silicon hearths of a new
cottage economy. Video culture will transcend its current mass-media doldrums,
playing to lowest-common-denominator shocks and prurient interests, and
will effloresce into a plethora of products suggestive of the book industry.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or down the street or in their local office or corporation.
Instead, they will seek out and command their first choices in employment,
culture, entertainment and religion. They will reach out across the country
and around the world to find the best colleagues for every major project.
Productivity and efficiency will inexorably rise. A culture of first choices
will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward the mediocre,
convenient or crude.<BR>
<BR>
The entire centralizing force of the Industrial Revolution, which brought
capital and labor together in vast pyramidal institutions and reduced workers
to accessories of the machine and the tube, will give way to the explosive
centrifuge of the microcosm and telecosm. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and Machine Age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
The vision of information superhighways revitalizing the American economy
and culture is far more true and compelling than even its advocates comprehend.
People who underestimate the impact of bandwidth will miss the supreme investment
opportunities of the epoch. 
<PRE><B>

Decline and Rise of the Malone Model
</B></PRE>
Dominant in the industry are two essential models for fulfilling the promise
of the superhighway. One scheme, long associated with John Malone and other
cable executives, is the monster model: combining content and conduit in
order to gain monopoly rents.<BR>
<BR>
Because it reaches more than 20 percent of all cable customers, access to
the TCI conduit can heavily influence the success or failure of any content
venture. As Andrew Kessler, partner and multimedia guru at Unterberg Harris
and Forbes ASAP columnist, puts it, &quot;If you want to create a cable
channel, you may have to send it through Malone's bottleneck--a satellite
dish farm outside Denver. I suspect that could cost you some $ 4 million
in cash, or, alternatively, you can give Malone 30 percent of your company.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
This monster model is in essence the way Malone built up Liberty Media and
the content side of TCI, which together own parts of TNT, the Discovery
Channel, American Movie Classics, Black Entertainment TV, Court TV, Encore,
Starz, Family Channel, Home Shopping Network, QVC, Video Jukebox and an
array of regional sports networks. It has been widely reported that AT&T
and financier Herbert Allen are creating a new classic sports network and
will give a chunk of it to Liberty in exchange for access to Malone's conduit.<BR>
<BR>
The other model is that of the common-carrier, upheld both by the telephone
companies and by Internet. In this model you build an open conduit and exercise
virtually no influence on content. Using the phone system or Internet, people
can communicate anything they want as long as they observe the protocols
of the public switched telephone network or of Internet's TCP/IP. Extended
to images, this model suggests a &quot;video dial tone.&quot; You can dial
up any other machine connected to the network and download or upload any
films, files, documents, pictures or multimedia programs that you wish.
Although telephone companies or Internet providers may own content. they
cannot privilege their own programming. Their content has to compete for
customers freely with all other content available on the network.<BR>
<BR>
The notoriety of the Malone model and the resentment it arouses far and
wide explain much of the hostility toward the cable industry and John Malone.
This may even explain the current rage to reregulate the industry. The great
irony today is that Malone and the rest of the cable leaders were in the
process of abandoning the Malone model at the very moment that many telephone
executives seemed to adopt it.<BR>
<BR>
It was Malone, after all, who was willing to sell his content to Bell Atlantic,
and it was Raymond Smith, above all, who insisted on acquiring the assets
of Liberty Media. It was Bell South that was willing to pitch in some $
2 billion to QVC's bidding for Paramount when John Malone left Batty Diller
high and dry. Ameritech, too, was reported to be preparing a pitch for Paramount.<BR>
<BR>
Malone was right in his attempt to sell out at the top to Bell Atlantic.
The idea of combining conduit and content was valid in a regime of bandwidth
scarcity. In a regime of broadband information superhighways, however, content
providers will want to put their programming on everyone's conduits, and
conduit owners will want to carry everyone's content. In a world of bandwidth
abundance Paramount will not want to restrict its films to Bell South's
network any more than Bell South will exclude films from other sources.<BR>
<BR>
The key condition for the success of the open model and the eclipse of the
Malone model, however, is real bandwidth abundance. If the federal government
prohibits the interconnection of conduits, then the Malone model gains a
new lease on life. In a world of bandwidth scarcity the owner of the conduit
not only can but must control access to it. Thus, the owner of the conduit
also shapes the content. It does not matter whether the conduit company
is headed by a scheming monopolist or by Mitch Kapor and the members of
the Electronic Frontier Foundation. Bandwidth scarcity will require the
managers of the network to determine the video programming on it.<BR>
<BR>
In a world of information superhighways, however, the most open networks
will dominate, and the proprietary networks will wither. Malone's understanding
of this fact--that his own model would soon expire in an environment of
bandwidth abundance--motivated his effort to merge with Bell Atlantic.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm inexorably dictates mergers not between content
and conduit, but between conduit and conduit. In particular, today it mandates
the merger of the huge fiber resources of the telephone companies--which
are nine times as extensive as cable industry fiber and are estimated to
rise to 2.7 million lines by next year--with the huge asset of 57 million
broadband links to homes commanded by the cable industry. Obstructing such
mergers in the name of competition, or antitrust, or regulatory caprice,
is wantonly destructive to the future of the economy. 
<PRE>
<B>
The Siren Call From Foreign Shores
</B></PRE>
Most of the gains of the telecosm depend on government willingness to allow
the creation of coherent broadband networks with no prohibitions against
the convergence of cable and telco systems. For a while it appeared that
the Clinton administration was willing to accommodate this development.
Now it appears that it prefers to lead the U.S. government into a private-sector
monster hunt. Rather than releasing America's cable and telco firms to build
this redemptive infrastructure, Washington leaders seem chiefly concerned
with assuring themselves that no one will make any money from it. As a result,
with some $ 1 billion in annual funding from Wall Street, cable and telephone
firms are increasingly moving abroad to fulfill the promise of information
superhighways.<BR>
<BR>
TCI and U.S. West, for example, are serving some quarter- million British
citizens with combined telephone and cable functions over a hybrid network
of coax and fiber. The current regulatory climate dooms the proposed merger
of Southwestern Bell and Cox Cable and their plans to launch information
highways in Phoenix and Atlanta. But these companies continue to expand
their hybrid cable and phone networks In Liverpool and Birmingham in England.
In the U.S. NYNEX has been one of the most sluggish Bells in information
superhighway projects. But from Gibraltar to Bangkok, it is supplying an
array of wireless and wireline services. In the U.K. NYNEX Cablecomm holds
17 cable franchises passing 2.5 million homes and plans some $ 2 billion
in future investments. In the wake of the new regulations Bell Canada International
(BCI) reduced its offer for Jones Intercable by five percent, but the two
companies are barging ahead in East London, Leeds and Aylesbury. Time Warner,
Ameritech and other cable and telephone companies are also rushing to less
regulated realms to lay information infrastructure everywhere from Scotland
to New Zealand.<BR>
<BR>
In the U.S. such collaborations of cable and telephone companies would be
paralyzed by litigation and bureaucracy. It appears increasingly possible
that despite the huge lead created by the U.S. cable industry, which, unique
in the world, has extended broadband access to some 95 percent of American
homes, broadband networks will first be built outside the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
American politicians must face reality. With cable, the U.S. is far and
away the world leader in broadband technology. With cable, the U.S. can
have a national network reaching every American community by the year 2000.
Without cable, however, the U.S. can forget the idea of building a national
system of information superhighways in this decade. Without cable, the global
race is even, and several European and Asian countries command a significant
edge as a result of their integrated cable and telephone firms.<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. panacea of &quot;competition&quot; without winners may work for
commodity markets, which require low levels of incremental investment and
offer returns commensurate with the rate of interest. Governing technological
progress, though, is the very different regime of dynamic competition and
creative destruction.<BR>
<BR>
Impelling most technology investment is the pursuit of transitory positions
of monopoly that may yield massive profits. That's why in the late 1970s
and early 1980s Milken directed some $ 17 billion to the cable TV, fiberoptic
telephony and cellular telephone industries, giving the U.S. a decisive
lead in all these areas. That's why Intel Corp. has been investing $ 2 billion
a year in new wafer fabrication capacity to secure its global edge in microprocessors.
That's why Microsoft invests $ 1 billion a year or more (depending on definitions)
in new software technology to integrate ever-new functions into its dominant
operating systems. And that's why Bell Atlantic contemplated investing what
amounted to some $ 33 billion in John Malone's company, TCI.<BR>
<BR>
Until replaced by a better system, every innovation gives its owner a temporary
monopoly. Otherwise it is not a true innovation. Today, whether anyone likes
it or not, the cable industry has a temporary monopoly on broadband links
to the home. By interconnecting these links to the fiber networks of the
phone companies, the two industries together can create a national information
superhighway some five or 10 years sooner than can Japan or Europe.<BR>
<BR>
Some 79 percent of the costs of a network come in the final connections
to homes: the distribution and drops that the cable industry has installed
over the last 25 years. Joined with the telephone industry's fiber optics--nine
times more extensive than the cable industry's fiber deployment--this hybrid
cable-telco network would represent an authentic innovation and would trigger
a flood of real competition supplying a huge array of powerful new broadband
communications services. According to authoritative estimates cited by Vice-President
Gore and the FCC, these innovations would increase U.S. productivity growth
by 40 percent over the next decade. This immense undertaking would also
yield huge profits for as long as a decade to some of the companies that
master it.<BR>
<BR>
The government might regard these profits as &quot;obscene.&quot; But they
will be indispensable both to pay for the transformation of American media
and to attract the next generation of competitors into the business. These
rivals are already on the way: Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), wireless
cellular &quot;cable&quot; at 28 gigahertz, low-earth-orbiting satellites
such as the Gates-McCaw Teledesic, all-fiber &quot;Internets&quot; and the
array of passive fiber- to-the-home technology summed up as the fibersphere.
Even broadcasters and utilities will enter the field. In a world where the
government micromanages communications in the name of &quot;competition,&quot;
however, all these capital-hungry competitors will languish. 
<PRE><B>

Dynamic Competition or Static Competitors?
</B></PRE>
The dynamics of competition on the information superhighway repeats the
previous dynamics of competition in computers. Preventing the dominance
of successful technologies--sustaining an artificial diversity--is anticompetitive.
If in the early 1980s the Department of Justice had ruled against the Microsoft
and Intel standards, for example, and had required a variety of microprocessor
instruction sets and operating systems, the result would have been less
competition in computers, not more. Perhaps Pick, Quarterdeck, Digital Research
and others would have gained share against Microsoft. But the applications
software business, with its floods of real competition in new programs for
everything from financial management to videogames, would have languished,
along with the parallel markets in hardware peripherals.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that Microsoft faces antitrust pressure at the twilight of its
dominance. Impelled by the new markets for multimedia and handheld communicators,
the industry is on the cusp of an entirely new landscape of competition.
In this new arena Microsoft's present market share and installed base are
barriers to entry for Microsoft rather than for its rivals. If Microsoft
is to prevail in these new areas, it must cannibalize its own systems and
compete on an equal basis with everyone else.<BR>
<BR>
The laws of dynamic competition apply just as forcefully to networks as
to computers. Just as the time arrived when text editing and disk utilities
would be integrated into operating systems--or floating point computations
would be integrated into microprocessors--broadband cable services now must
be integrated into the public switched telephone network (PSTN), not segregated
from it. Despite the &quot;competitive&quot; access dreams of politicians
and regulators, true competition requires that the &quot;two-wire model&quot;
of home communications give way to a broadband, one-wire system.<BR>
<BR>
The best and most cost-effective network practicable today is a combination
of telco fiber and cable coax. Even the telephone industry agrees. U.S.
West, Pacific Telesis and Bellcore all have resolved on the same hybrid
system that TCI, Time Warner and Cablelabs have pioneered. Without mergers
with cable firms, the telcos in essence will try to rebuild cable networks.<BR>
<BR>
Attempting to duplicate the connections to homes built by the cable industry
over the last 25 years, however, the telephone industry would have to spend
some $ 200 billion. It would have to sustain this level of new investment
while maintaining its existing plant and expanding into long-distance and
other services. It would have to summon large incremental capital in the
face of continued competition from the cable industry's taking of many of
the most profitable markets.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos currently declare they are willing to make these investments.
They tell Washington regulators and politicians that all will be fine as
long as they are allowed to own programming and information services and
build equipment. But the message from the markets is clear and to the contrary.
At the very time that telco executives were intoning their bold plans, telephone
and cable share prices were plunging toward new lows. Now Raymond Smith
of Bell Atlantic is announcing a half-billion- dollar reduction in infrastructure
outlays. Southwestern Bell is giving up its plans to buy Cox Cable. Under
a similar &quot;competitive&quot; regime in cellular telephony, even AT&T and
McCaw have found their merger in jeopardy.<BR>
<BR>
Under rate-of-return regulations with prohibition of cross- subsidies from
current cash flow, a &quot;competitive&quot; information superhighway simply
cannot fly. An information superhighway cannot be built under a canopy of
federal tariffs, price controls, mandates and allocated markets. 
<PRE><B>

Highway Imperative:  Cable-PC</B></PRE>
Politicians must recognize that what is at stake is not merely games, entertainment
and a few educational frills but the very future of the U.S. economy. Cable
is central not only to the next generation of television technology but
also to the next generation of computer technology.<BR>
<BR>
Again, many companies offer bold words in business plans for interconnecting
homes with new networks. Indeed, the telcos can provide some intriguing
computer services through their accelerating rollout of Integrated Services
Digital Networks (ISDN), as was so eloquently urged by Mitch Kapor and others.
Internet will continue to expand rapidly its cornucopia of mostly narrowband
offerings. Bill Gates and Craig McCaw may even enlarge the bandwidth available
to homes to a level of 2.4 megabits per second through their elegant and
ambitious Teledesic. Direct broadcast satellite systems and public utilities
and wireless cable operators will all enrich the flow of video to the nation's
homes.<BR>
<BR>
Except in the short ran, though, these systems are not remotely competitive
with cable. Available ISDN, for example, offers less than one-100th the
bandwidth of one digital cable channel and less than one-1,000th the bandwidth
of a cable coax line. The other rivals to cable, from direct broadcast satellite
to Teledesic, are similarly far too little and too late. Even the advanced
28-gigahertz wireless cable projects, for all their promise as supplementary
systems, cannot ultimately compete with the potential two-way bandwidth
of fiber-coax systems in the ground.<BR>
<BR>
All the current plans of the telephone companies and the government leave
the huge U.S. endowment of home computers--the fastest-growing and most
promising segment of the computer industry--stranded in a narrowband world.
Only the cable industry's gigahertz links, passing into some 95 percent
of American homes, can launch the American personal computer industry into
a new level of two-way broadband digital connectivity.<BR>
<BR>
For that reason the future of the American computer industry largely depends
on the future of the cable industry. By linking America's computers to broadband
networks and then to telco fiber systems, cable can be the great enabler
of the next phase of development in America's digital economy.<BR>
<BR>
In laying broadband systems the cable industry has already been forced to
solve many of the key problems of an information superhighway. Although
often depicted as an intrinsically one- way service, cable technology has,
in fact, long provided two-way capabilities.<BR>
<BR>
Every cable coax line, for example, offers potential bandwidth equivalent
to six times the 160 megahertz of spectrum assigned by the FCC for personal
communications services. Cable can accommodate as much as one gigahertz--a
billion cycles per second--of communications power. This is some 250,000
times the capacity of a four-kilohertz telephone line to the home. Just
one six-megahertz cable channel commands 1,500 times the bandwidth of a
telephone line. In every coax connection the first four channels, between
five and 30 megahertz, are reserved not for broadcast but for reverse communications
to the headend. Widely used to transfer video programming among headends
and satellite dishes and other programming sources, these channels alone
already represent a potential information highway for home computers 2,500
times faster than a 9,600-baud modem to a phone line.<BR>
<BR>
Even these possibilities, however, underestimate the potential of cable.
The coax laid by the cable firms must carry analog video material without
interference or distortion. This means cable equipment must track perfectly
all the analog waveforms representing the shape and brightness of the image,
and must detect tiny differences in the frequencies of FM signals bearing
color and sound information. Because any deviation in an analog wave imparts
a defect to the picture, cable TV has had to develop extremely low loss
technologies. Although most current cable systems function at much lower
signal-to-noise ratios, measured logarithmically, a cable TV plant can potentially
function at nearly 50 decibels, or at a signal-to-noise power ratio of almost
100,000-to-one.<BR>
<BR>
Necessary to transmit high-quality analog video, between 10,000- and 100,000-to-1
signal-to-noise ratios are vast overkill for the relatively crude on-off
codes of digital communications, which can function at 17 decibels or less.
Therefore, the one- gigahertz coax lines can carry many more than one bit
per hertz. Craig Tanner, vice-president of advanced TV projects at Cablelabs,
the industry's research arm in Louisville, Colo., estimates that by wiggling
every wave in readable patterns using a modulation scheme called 256 QAM
(quadrature amplitude modulation), cable systems can transmit as many as
seven bits per hertz. This means that the one-gigahertz bandwidth of an
existing cable line might potentially carry between six and eight gigabits
per second, or more than three gigabits per second each way. These potential
links to homes are more capacious than the current telephone fiber lines
that accommodate tens of thousands of phone calls among telco central offices.<BR>
<BR>
This bandwidth represents the real potential of cable coax. For the next
decade much of the cable plant will still be devoted to analog TV broadcasts
or to digital renditions of pay-per-view movies. Time Warner's Orlando project,
however, envisions devoting the top 350 megahertz of its system to two-way
digital communications, including 100 megahertz for the personal communications
services of wireless telephony and 150 megahertz for digital two-way data
flows. At a very conservative estimate of two bits per hertz, Time Warner
projects a total of 300 megabits per second from these digital channels.
At these levels a computer could download a full movie of two-and-a-half
hours in about one minute. 
<PRE>
<B>
Cable's Real Potential is Not TV</B></PRE>
Abandonment of the Malone model by Malone and the rest of the cable industry
ultimately requires that cable TV magnates develop a new grasp of the dynamics
of the microcosm: the exponential growth of computer power and connections.
Accustomed to the role of propagating mass entertainment, cable leaders
have long downplayed the potential market in computer communications.<BR>
<BR>
Gradually growing throughout TCI, Time Warner, Continental Cablevision,
Jones Intercable and other cable firms, however, is a recognition that the
real future of cable is in computers rather than TVs. As David Fellows of
Continental declared in launching his pioneering new Internet access system
in Boston In late February, &quot;The market for computer communications
is huge.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, during the next decade the cable companies are going to discover
that the computer market for their services is far more important than the
television market. The computer industry, hardware and software, is already
some 60 percent larger than the television and movie industries put together
and is growing six times as fast. On-line networked computer services, such
as Prodigy, CompuServe, Delphi and America Online, are collectively growing
at a pace of close to 100 percent per year. When on-line services can exchange
video and audio files as readily as they transfer text today, these computer
networks will be able to outperform any television system. Against all their
expectations and plans, cable executives are going to find themselves a
central part of the computer networking industry.<BR>
<BR>
As Fellows explains, &quot;Cable and computer network topologies go together
perfectly. Both provide shared bandwidth. Ethernet over cable is a natural.&quot;
In both networks all the data flow by every terminal. The receiver tunes
into the desired channel. For computers, cable offers the dumb bandwidth
that is increasingly needed as terminals gain near-supercomputer powers.
In the past networks had to be smart in order to provide needed services
to the dumb terminals on their periphery, whether phones, computers or TVs.
Dumb terminals could tolerate narrowband connections. In the future, however,
all terminals will command supercomputer powers.<BR>
<BR>
When terminals are smart, the intelligence in networks flows to the fringes.
When terminals are smart, networks must be broad and dumb. There is no way
that an intelligent switching fabric can anticipate the constantly evolving
technology emerging from a computer industry in a frenzied process of change.
There is no way that John Malone's satellite farm outside Denver will be
able to satisfy the demands for programming and communications of 100 million
networked teleputers. While the telephone business struggles with the increasing
problems of intelligent central switches with some 25 million lines of software
code, the cable industry is creating dumb networks in tune with the explosive
growth of supersmart machines in every home and office.<BR>
<BR>
The movement of computer networks onto cable need not await the development
of advanced broadband systems such as those planned by Time Warner in Orlando.
Already several companies are supplying moderns that allow computers to
link directly to cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith provided the first system, HomeWorks, operating at a rate of 500
kilobits per second. It is being used by Cox Cable to deliver Prodigy service
in San Diego at a rate 52 times faster than existing 9,600-baud phone modems.
Also using HomeWorks is Jones Intercable for Internet services in Alexandria,
Va., Continental Cablevision and CompuServe in Exeter, N.H., and TCI for
a distance learning test in Provo, Utah.<BR>
<BR>
Zenith is adding a system called ChannelMizer that can offer full Ethernet
capability of 10 megabits per second over a 15-mile radius. Intel, General
Instrument and Hybrid Technologies have announced an asymmetrical system
that runs upstream from the home at 256 kilobits per second and downstream
at 10 megabits per second, the Ethernet rate run in most office networks.<BR>
<BR>
Pioneering in the field for several years has been Digital Equipment Corp.
under the leadership of James Albrycht. Adapting equipment developed by
LANcity, DEC's ChannelWorks offers the functionality needed for true information
highway on-ramps. Extending a two-way Ethernet transparently from the office
to the home by a full 70 miles, the ChannelWorks frequency-agile modem allows
the use of all 83 cable frequency channels. Cable managers can send digital
information over any underused part of the coax bandwidth. Currently deployed
chiefly by telecommuting Digital employees, the system is under evaluation
by a variety of hospitals, libraries, schools and other institutions favored
by Vice-President Gore.<BR>
<BR>
Absolutely crucial to the development of the broadband superhighway, however,
is not only the merger of the two networks but also access to the capital
of the telephone industry. Creation of high-bandwidth cable connections
to homes will be far cheaper than laying new coax. But they still will require
expensive upgrades to existing cable plant.<BR>
<BR>
The telcos already invest more money every year--some $ 24 billion--than
the total revenues of the cable industry. But even the telcos will not be
able to create information superhighways if they also have to duplicate
the broadband connections to homes already offered by the cable industry.
Similarly, the cable industry alone cannot attract sufficient funds to duplicate
the broadband fiber networks already commanded by the telcos, while the
telcos move in to skim off the best pay-per-view movie markets. Particularly
in an adverse regulatory climate neither industry is capable of building
broadband networks. With relatively narrowband networks, the Malone model
necessarily thrives. In the name of fighting monsters the administration
is in fact pursuing what amounts to a monster-protection policy.<BR>
<BR>
If this policy continues, innovation once more will follow its course toward
the least-regulated arenas. Cable and telco firms will install their best
technologies overseas. In the U.S. the computer networking industry will
build the information superhighways. To Gore's bitter regret, only business
and the wealthy will be able to afford access. Until the early decades of
the next century, much of the rest of the nation will be left to the mercies
of the Malone model for video entertainment and other cable programming.
Interactivity will tend to take the form of games and pay-per-view TV.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with the increasing movement of activity from big cities, corporate
headquarters, hospitals, schools and other centralized institutions to homes
and small cities, the demand for broadband computer connections is sure
to soar. Most current congressional legislation that imposes mandates on
businesses relating to everything from health care reform to parental leave
tends to drive work away from corporations to contractual outsources. The
market for &quot;interactive TV&quot; is likely to grow far more slowly
than the market for computer connections over cable.<BR>
<BR>
Both political parties are far behind the public in comprehending these
developments. But the reversal of the earlier forces of conurbation and
centralized industry responds to the most profound laws of new technology.
It is the most important movement in America today. If the administration
continues to strangle new technology with new regulation and red tape, a
new coalition of liberals and conservatives alike will rise up against it
and grasp the future. Al Gore may eventually wish he had never heard of
broadband networks.

Imagine it is 1971 and you are chair of the new Federal Computer Commission.
This commission has been established to regulate the natural monopoly of
computer technology as summed up in the famous Grosch's Law. In 1956 IBM
engineer Herbert Grosch proved that computer power rises by the square of
its cost and thus necessarily gravitates to the most costly machines. According
to a famous IBM projection, the entire world could use some 55 mainframes,
time-sharing from dumb terminals and keypunch machines. The owners of these
machines would rule the world of information in an ascendant information
age. By the Orwellian dawn of 1984, Big Bre'r IBM would establish a new
digital tyranny, with a new elite of the data-rich dominating the data-poor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As head of the computer commission, you launch a bold program to forestall
this grim outcome. Under a congressional mandate to promote competition
for IBM and ensure the principle of universal computer service, you ordain
the creation of some 2,500 mainframe licenses to be auctioned to the highest
bidders (with special licenses reserved for minorities, women and farmers).
To ensure widespread competition across all of America, you establish seven
licenses in each metropolitan Major Trading Area and seven in every rural
Basic Trading Area as defined by Rand McNally. To guarantee universal service,
you mandate the free distribution of keypunch machines to all businesses
and households so that they can access the local computer centers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In establishing this auction in 1971, you had no reason at all to notice
that a tiny company in Mountain View, Calif., called Intel was about to
announce three new technologies together with some hype about &quot;a new
era of integrated electronics.&quot; After all, these technologies--the
microprocessor; erasable, programmable read-only memory (EPROM); and a one-kilobit
dynamic random access memory (DRAM)--were far too primitive to even compare
with IBM's massive machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The likely results of such a Federal Computer Commission policy are not
merely matters of conjecture. France pretty much did it when it distributed
free Minitel terminals to its citizens to provide them access to government
mainframes. While the United States made personal computers nearly ubiquitous
buying perhaps 100 million since the launch of the Minitel in the late 1970s
the French chatted through central databases and ended up with one-quarter
as many computers per capita as this country, and one-tenth the number of
computer networks. Today, PC networks are leading the US economy to world
dominance while Europe founders without a single major computer company,
software firm or semiconductor manufacturer.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IT IS NOW 1994, and Reed Hundt, the new chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, is indeed about to hold an auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than selling exclusive mainframe licenses, the current FCC is going
to sell exclusive ten-year licenses to about 2,500 shards of the radio spectrum.
Meanwhile, a tiny company called Steinbrecher Corp. of Burlington, Mass.,
is introducing the new microprocessor of the radio business.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the world of radio waves ruled by the Federal Communications Commission,
the Steinbrecher MiniCell is even more revolutionary than the microprocessor
was in the world of computing. While Intel put an entire computer on a single
chip, Steinbrecher has put an entire cellular base station--now requiring
some 1,000 square feet and costing $ 1.5 million--in a box the size of a
briefcase that costs $ 100,000 today. Based on a unique invention by Donald
Steinbrecher and on the sweeping advance of computer technology, the MiniCell
represents a far bigger leap forward beyond the current state of the art
than the microprocessor did. What's more, this MiniCell is in fact much
superior to existing cellular base stations. Unlike the 416 hard-wired radio
transceivers (transmitter-receivers) in existing base stations, the MiniCell
contains a single digital broadband radio and is fully programmable. It
can accommodate scores of different kind of cellular handsets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Most important, the MiniCell benefits from the same technology as the microprocessor.
Making possible the creation of this broadband digital radio is the tidal
onrush of Moore's Law. In an antithesis of Grosch's Law, Gordon Moore of
Intel showed that the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology doubles
every 18 months. This insight suggested the Law of the Microcosm-- that
computing power gravitates not to the costliest but to the cheapest machines.
Costing $ 100,000 today, the MiniCell will predictably cost some $10,000
before the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In time, these digital MiniCells will have an impact similar to that of
the PC. They will drive the creation of a cornucopia of new mobile services--from
plain old telephony to wireless video conferencing--based on ubiquitous
client/server networks in the air. Endowing Americans with universal mobile
access to information superhighways, these MiniCells can spearhead another
generation of computer-led growth in the US economy. Eventually, the implications
of Steinbrecher's machines and other major innovations in wireless will
crash In on the legalistic scene of the FCC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And that's only the beginning of the story.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Going on the block In May will be 160 megahertz (millions of cycles per
second) of the radio frequency spectrum, divided into seven sections of
between 10 and 30 megahertz In each of 543 areas of the country, and devoted
to enhanced Personal Communications Services (PCS).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Existing cellular systems operate in a total spectrum space of 50 megahertz
in two frequency bands near the 800 megahertz level. By contrast, PCS will
take four times that space in a frequency band near two gigahertz (billions
of cycles per second). Became higher frequencies allow use of lower-power
radios with smaller antennas and longer-lasting batteries, PCS offers the
possibility of a drastically improved wireless system. Unfortunately, the
major obstacle to the promise of PCS is the auction.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Amid the spectrum fever aroused by the bidding, however, new radio technologies
are emerging that devastate its most basic assumptions. At a time when the
world is about to take to information superhighways In the sky--plied by
low-powered, pollution-free computer phones--the FCC is in danger of building
a legal infrastructure and protectionist program for information smokestacks
and gas guzzlers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even the language used to describe the auction betrays its fallacies. With
real estate imagery, analysts depict spectrum as &quot;beachfront property&quot;
and the auction as a &quot;land rash.&quot; They assume that radio frequencies
are like analog telephone circuit: no two users can occupy the same spot
of spectrum at the same time. Whether large 50-kilowatt broadcast stations
booming Rush Limbaugh's voice across the nation or milliwatt cellular phones
beaming love murmurs to a nearby base station, radio transmitters are assumed
to be infectious, high-powered and blind. If one is on the highway, everyone
else has to clear out. Both the prevailing wisdom and the entrenched technology
dictate that every transmitter be quarantined in its own spectrum slot.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
However, innovations from such companies as Steinbrecher and Qualcomm Inc.
of San Diego overthrow this paradigm. Not only can numerous radios operate
at non-interfering levels in the same frequency band, they can also see
other users' signals and move to avoid them. In baseball jargon, the new
radios can hit 'em where they ain't; in football idiom, they run for daylight.
If appropriately handled, these technologies can render spectrum not scarce
but abundant.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These developments make it retrograde to assign exclusive spectrum rights
to anyone or to foster technologies that require exclusivity. Spectrum no
longer shares any features of beachfront property. A wave would be a better
analogy. 
<PRE><B>
The New Rules Of Waves</B></PRE>
In the early decades of this century, radio was king. Electronics hackers
played in the waves with a variety of ham, citizens band and short-wave
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Experimenting with crystal sets, they innocently entered the domain of solid-state
devices and acquired some of the skills that fueled the electronic revolution
in the United States and the radar revolution that won World War II. The
first point-contact transistor, created by John Bardeen and Walter Brattain
at Bell Labs in 1948, functioned like a crystal radio. The first major solid-state
product was a 1954 Texas Instruments pocket radio with six germanium transistors.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the following decades, the radio became a mass commodity. There are
now some 230 million radios in the United States alone, not even including
more than 16 million cellular phones (which are in fact portable two-way
radios). Radios roll off Asian assembly lines at a rate that might be meaningfully
measured in hertz (cycles per second), and they come in sizes fit for pockets,
belts, watches and ears. But the romance of radio has died and given way
to the romance of computers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today it is PC technology that engages the youthful energies previously
invested in radio technology. The press trumpets a coming convergence between
computers and TVs and games and films. But no one talks much about radios.
For many years, we have been taking radios for granted.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As the foundation of wireless communications, however, radio--no less than
TV or films--will burst into a new technoscape as a result of a convergence
with computers. The hackers of the '50s and '60s are joining forces with
the hackers of the '80s and '90s to create a new industry. Moore's Law is
about to overran the world of radio.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You double anything every 18 months and pretty soon you find yourself with
a monster. During the 1970s and 1980s, Moore's Law overturned the established
order in the computer industry and spawned some 100 million personal computers
that are as powerful as million-dollar mainframes were when the revolution
began. In the current decade, Moore's Law is upending the telephone and
television industries with interactive teleputers that will be able to send,
receive, shape and store interactive full-motion video. And during the next
five years, Moore's Law is going to transform exotic and costly radio equipment
once consigned to the military and outer space into the basic communications
access routes for the new world economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To understand this new world of radio, however, you must forget much of
what you learned about the old world of radio. For example, these new radios
differ radically from the radios of the past in the way they use spectrum,
the way they interfere with one another and the way they are built.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For some 15 years, a hacker of the 1950s named Don Steinbrecher and a small
group of students and associates have been making the world's most powerful
and aerobatic radios. Steinbrecher radio gear can soar to spectrum altitudes
as high as 94 gigahertz to provide radar &quot;eyes&quot; for smart bombs
and pies, plunge down to the cellular band at 800 megahertz to listen in
on phone calls or drop discretely to 30 megahertz--waves that bounce off
the ionosphere--for remote over-the-horizon radar work identifying cocaine
traffickers flying in low from Latin America. At the same time, some of
these radios may soon command enough dynamic ranges of accurate broadband
reception--rumored to be as high as 120 decibels (one trillion-to-one)--to
detect a pin drop at a heavy-metal rock concert without missing a high-fidelity
note or twang.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like every radio transceiver, a Steinbrecher radio must have four key components:
an antenna, a tuner, a modem and a mixer. The antenna part is easy; for
many purposes, your metal shirt hanger will do the trick (backyard wire
fences collect millions of frequencies). But without tuners, modems and
mixers, nothing reaches its final destination--the human ear.<BR>
<BR>
A tuner selects a desired carrier frequency, usually by exploiting the science
of resonant circuits. A modem is a modulator-demodulator. In transmitting
it applies information to the carrier frequency by wiggling the waves in
a pattern, called a modulation scheme, such as AM or FM. In receiving the
modem strips out (demodulates) the information tom the carrier wave.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key to Steinbrecher radios is the broadband mixer. It surmounts what
was long seen as an impossible challenge: moving a large array of the relatively
high career frequencies on the antenna down to a so-called baseband level
where they can be used without losing any of the information or adding spurious
information in the process. Compared to FM carrier frequencies of 100 megahertz
or even PCS frequencies of two gigahertz, baseband audio frequencies run
between 20 hertz and 20 kilohertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mixers were the basic Steinbrecher product, and in 1978 and 1980, Steinbrecher
acquired patents on a unique broadband mixer with high range and sensitivity
called the Paramixer. Even to its expected military customers, the Paramixer
was a hard sell because other radio components were unable to keep pace
with its performance. Today, however, the Paramixer is the foundation of
the Steinbrecher radio in the MiniCell.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the old world of radio, transceivers integrated all of these components--antenna,
tuner, modem and mixer--into one analog hardware system. Because the radio
is analog and hard-wired, its functions must be standardized. Each radio
can receive or transmit only a very limited set of frequencies bearing information
coded in a specific modulation scheme and exclusively occupying a specific
spectrum space at a particular power range. If you are in the radio business--whether
as an equipment manufacturer such as Motorola or Ericsson, a provider of
services, such as McCaw or Comsat, or a broadcaster, such as NBC or Turner--you
care deeply about these hard-wired specifications, frequencies and modulation
schemes.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Comprising the &quot;air standard,&quot; these issues embroil businesses,
politicians, standards bodies and regulators in constant warfare. For everything
from High Definition Television to digital cellular and cordless telephony,
standards bodies are wrangling over frequencies and modulation schemes.
<PRE><B>

How Digital Radios Can End The Spectrum Wars</B></PRE>
To the people at Steinbrecher Corp., all these wrangles seem utterly unnecessary.
With antennas, tuners, modems and mixers, wideband digital radios perform
all the same functions as ordinary radios. Only the antenna and mixer are
in hardware, and these are generic; they don't care any more about air standards
than your shirt hanger does.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In Steinbrecher radios, all of the frequency tuning, all of the modulating
and demodulating, all of the channelization, all of the coding and decoding
that so embroil the politicians are performed by programmable digital signal
processors and can be changed at a base station in real time. Strictly speaking,
the tuner and modem are not part of the base station radio at all. The broadband
radio in a Steinbrecher base station can send or receive signals to or from
any handset or mobile unit operating within its bandwidth (in current cellular
systems the full 12.5 megahertz of the band; in PCS, still larger bands
of as much as 30 megahertz).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All the processing of codes, frequencies, channels and modulations, as well
as all special mobile services, can move onto computers attached to the
network. Steinbrecher technology thus can open up the spectrum for open
and programmable client/server systems like those that now dominate the
computer industry. Moore's Law, in fact, is changing radios into portable
digital computers. The most pervasive personal computer of the next decade
will be a digital cellular phone operating at least 40 MIPS (millions of
instructions per second).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the performance of analog-to-digital converters defines the limits
of Steinbrecher radios. Even if the mixers are perfect, the system's performance
can be no better than the accuracy of the A/D processors that transform
the output of the mixers into a digital bit stream for the DSPs. Steinbrecher
estimates that better broadband A/D converters--which can sample wave forms
more accurately at high frequencies--could increase the performance ofSteinbrecher
systems by an amazing factor of 10. Pushed by demands and designs from Steinbrecher,
Analog Devices and other suppliers are advancing converter technology nearly
at a pace with Moore's Law, and Steinbrecher's broadband digital radios
are rapidly approaching the ideal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Don Steinbrecher puts it, broadband A/D and DSP have changed wireless
&quot;turn a radio business to a computer business.&quot; At first, the
computer portion of a broadband radio was very expensive. Until the early
1980s, military customers performed advanced broadband analog-to-digital
conversion and digital signal processing on million-dollar custom supercomputers.
In 1986, an advanced DSP system for graphics at Bell Labs entailed the use
of 82 AT&T DSP32 chips and supporting devices in a custom computer that
cost some $ 130,000. Today, these same functions are performed on an Apple
Quadra 84o AV using an AT&T 3210 running at 33 megaflops (million floating-point
operations per second) and 17 MIPS for under $ 20 in volume. This rising
tide of advances in digital technology, propelled by Moore's Law, is about
to sweep Steinbrecher's recondite radio company into the midst of a mass
market in cellular telephony.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And the entire cellular and PCS industries will be beating a path to Steinbrecher's
door. Just as millions of people today have learned the meaning of MIPS
and megabytes, millions of people around the world, believe it or not, are
going to come to understand the meaning of &quot;spurious-free dynamic range.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a very rough analogy, imagine cranking the volume of your radio as high
as possible without marring the desired signal with static and distortion.
The spurious-free dynamic range of your radio would measure the distance
between the lowest and the highest volumes with a clear signal. In more
technical terms, spurious-free dynamic range is defined as the range of
signal amplitudes that can simultaneously be processed without distortion
or be resolved by a receiver without the emergence of spurious signals above
the noise floor.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In building broadband radios with high dynamic range, however, Steinbrecher
faced a fundamental technical problem. As a general rule, bandwidth is inversely
proportional to dynamic range. You can have one or the other, but you can't
have both. The broader the band, the more difficult it is to capture all
of its contents with full accuracy and sensitivity or with full spurious-free
dynamic range. An ordinary radio may command a high dynamic range of volumes
because it is narrowband.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But Steinbrecher radio does not begin by tuning to one frequency alone;
it gasps every frequency in a particular swath of spectrum. In some extreme
Paramixer applications (94-gigahertz radar, for example), the bandwidth
could be 10 gigahertz--larger than the entire range of spectrum commonly
used in the air, from submarine communications at 60 hertz to C band satellite
at 6 gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In most Steinbrecher applications that require high dynamic range, however,
the bandwidth runs between a few megahertz and hundreds of megahertz (compared
to 30 kilohertz in a cellular phone). Unless all of the frequencies captured
by the broadband radio are really present in the band rather than as artifacts
of the equipment--in technical jargon, unless the signals are spurious-free--the
radio user cannot tell what is going on, cannot distinguish between spurs
and signals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher has devoted much of his career to the graft of spurious-free
dynamic range. Soon after he arrived at Massachusetts Institute of Technology
in September 1961 to pursue work on device physics, he moved into the school's
new Radio Astronomy Lab. The radio astronomers were using millimeter waves
at 75 gigahertz to probe remote galaxies and pour through evidence of a
big bang at the beginning of time. Because the return reflections from outer
space were infinitesimal, the radio telescopes had to command a bandwidth
of at least two gigahertz, a spurious-free dynamic range of more than 100
decibels (tens of billions-, or even trillions-to-one) and noise levels
of less than 10 decibels (millionths of a watt).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telescope signals turned out not to be spurious-free. More than 90 percent
of the receiver noise--the spurious signals--originated in the frequency
converter or mixer, which translated the 75-gigahertz millimeter waves in
cascading analog stages of diodes and transistors, fed by tunable local
oscillators, down to baseband levels that could be usefully analyzed. This
impelled Steinbrecher's obsession with spurious-free dynamic range in mixers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To achieve high dynamic range in broadband mixers, Steinbrecher discovered,
was chiefly a problem of the basic physics of diodes. At the University
of Florida, at ECI Corp. and at MIT, Steinbrecher had pursued studies in
device physics focusing on the theory of PIN junctions--the positive-negative
interfaces that create the active regions in diodes and transistors. How
cleanly and abruptly they switch from on to off--how fully these switches
avoid transitional effects--determines how well they can translate one frequency
to another without spurs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From this experience, Steinbrecher concluded in 1968 that receivers could
be built with at least a thousand times more dynamic range than was currently
believed possible. He assigned his student Robert Snyder to investigate
the issue mathematically, integrating the possible performance of each component
into the performance of a mixer. Snyder's results stunningly continued Steinbrecher's
hypothesis. They predicted that in principle--with unlimited time and effort--the
linearity and dynamic range of a radio could be improved to any arbitrary
standard. In a key invention, Steinbrecher figured out how to create a diode
circuit that could produce a perfect square wave, creating a diode with
essentially zero switching time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Steinbrecher then proceeded to put his theory into practice by developing
the crucial diode and field-effect transistor arrays, mixers, amplifiers
and other components necessary to build a working system of unparalleled
dynamic range. Most of their advances required detailed knowledge of the
behavior of P/N junctions. To this day, the performance of Steinbrecher's
equipment depends on adjustment to unexpected nonlinearities and noise sources
that were discovered as part of Robert Snyder's work but are still not integrated
into the prevailing models of diode behavior.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond radio astronomy, the people who were interested in analyzing signals
of unknown frequencies, rather than tuning into preset frequencies, were
in the field of military intelligence. Enemies did not normally announce
in advance the frequencies they planned to use or how they would modulate
them. Steinbrecher Corp.'s first major contract came in the early 1980s
for remote over-the-horizon radar (ROTHR) systems used to detect planes
carrying drugs from Latin America. Steinbrecher also won contracts to supply
MILSTAR satellite transceivers and 94-gigahertz &quot;eyes&quot; for smart
munitions and jet aircraft.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 these large potential businesses began to attract venture capitalists,
including EG&G venture partners, The Venture Capital Fund of New England
and Raytheon. As often happens, the venture capitalists sought professional
management. They pushed Steinbrecher upstairs to chairman and summoned a
Stanford EE graduate named Douglas Shute to manage the company's move from
a manufacturer of hard-sell mixers Into a producer of revolutionary digital
radios.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still, Steinbrecher Corp. long remained a tiny firm occupying a dingy one-story
building in a Woburn, Mass., industrial park, where it rarely pulled in
more than $ 5 million in revenues. Not until the early 1990s, when its technology
converged with Moore's Law, did the company begin to escape its niche. 
<PRE><B>
Collision With Texas Instruments' DSP</B></PRE>
Indeed, strictly speaking even Moore's Law was not enough to make this Pentagon
turkey fly. Crucial was Texas Instruments' mid-1980s campaign to remake
the digital signal processor into a commodity device comparable to Intel's
microprocessor. Creating development systems and software tools, TI transformed
the DSP from an exotic and expensive printed circuit board full of integrated
circuits into a single programmable microchip manufactured in volume on
the same factory floor the company used to produce hundreds of millions
of dynamic random access memories. The results exceeded all expectations.
Outpacing Moore's Law by a factor of nearly four for some eight years so
far, DSP cost-effectiveness began soaring tenfold every two years. Pricing
the devices for digital radios, Douglas Shute saw that the wideband digital
radio had &quot;moved onto the map as a commercial product.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Also in 1989, a secret contractor asked the company if its radios could
snoop on calls in the cellular band. After gigahertz explorations in radio
astronomy and military projects, the 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth
seemed a piece of cake. Although this national security application never
came through, the idea galvanized the company. If it should need a commercial
market, cellular telephony was a good bet.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pull of opportunity, however, is usually less potent than the push of
catastrophe--which is the key reason for socialism's failure. Insulating
the economy from failure, it also removes a key spur for success. For all
the bureaucratic rigmarole of military procurement, producers for the Pentagon
live in a relatively comfortable socialist world of cost plus contracts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In 1989, however, just before the fall of the Soviet Union, Steinbrecher
began to get clear signals from Washington that the market for his products
was about to collapse. MILSTAR remained an experimental program; the ROTHR
system was halted after the creation of just four stations with 1,600 mixers;
and suddenly the cellular opportunity was not merely an attractive option--it
was crucial for survival.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Shute and Steinbrecher viewed the cellular scene in the United States,
however, they became increasingly disdainful. These radio companies had
no more idea of what was possible in radio technology than had the MIT engineering
lab when he arrived in 1961. Indeed, Steinbrecher Corp.'s first potential
customer--a wireless colossus--refused even to meet with Shute: The chief
technologist said he had investigated digital radios several years before
and determined they were unable to achieve the requisite dynamic range.
Moreover, at scores of thousands of dollars apiece, digital signal processors
were far too expensive. Most cellular executives, along with their Washington
regulators, seemed stuck in a 1970s time warp when analog still ruled and
DSP was a supercomputer. 
<PRE><B>
Importing Obsolescence</B></PRE>
As a result, the entire industry was convulsed by what Shute and Steinbrecher
saw as a retrograde war over standards. Because Europe in general lagged
far behind the United States in adopting analog cellular technology, the
EEC had sponsored a multinational drive to leapfrog the United States by
adopting a digital standard, which could then be exported to America. The
standard they chose was called GSM (global services mobile), a time-division
multiple-access (TDMA) scheme that exceeded analog capacity by breaking
each channel into three digital time slots. Racing to catch up, the American
industry adopted a similar TDMA approach that also increased the current
system's capacity by a factor of three. With McCaw Cellular in the lead,
American firms quickly committed themselves to deploy TDMA as soon as possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Then in 1991, Qualcomm unleashed a bombshell Exploiting the increasing power
of DSPs to process digital codes, the company demonstrated a spread-spectrum,
code-division multiple-access (CDMA) modulation scheme that not only increased
capacity some twentyfold over analog but also allowed use of the entire
11.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth in every cell. To prevent interference
between adjoining cells, analog and TDMA systems could use a frequency in
only one cell out of seven.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Much of the industry seemed paralyzed by fear of choosing the wrong system.
To Shute and Steinbrecher, however, these fears seemed entirely reckless.
Using wideband digital radios, companies could accommodate any array of
frequencies and modulation schemes they desired TDMA, CDMA, voice, data
and eventually even video. Shute resolved to adapt Steinbrecher's advanced
radio technology to these new markets. In mid-1991, Shute rushed ahead with
a program to create a prototype cellular transceiver that could process
all 12.5 megahertz of the cellular bandwidth and convert it to a digital
bit stream.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The first major customer for the radios turned out to be ADC-Kentrox, a
designer of analog cell extenders designed to overcome &quot;dead zones&quot;
caused by large buildings in urban areas. This system was limited in reach
to the few hundred meters the signals could be sent over analog wires without
deterioration. By converting the signals to digital at the remote site,
the Steinbrecher radio extended this distance from hundreds of meters to
scores of kilometers and allowed the price of the product to remain at $
100,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But these gains concealed the potential impact and meaning of the Steinbrecher
technology. Once again, the Steinbrecher radios are being used to complement
the existing system rather than overthrow it. In a similar way, McCaw plans
to buy some $ 30 million worth of Steinbrecher machines to carry through
its cellular digital packet data (CDPD) network. To be provided to 95 percent
of McCaw's regions by the end of 1995, CDPD is a data overlay of the existing
cellular system, which allows users of the current analog system to send
digital data at a rate of 19.2 kilobits per second, compared to the 9.6-kilobit-per-second
rate offered by most modems over twisted-pair wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher radio can survey any existing swath of spectrum in real
time and determine almost instantly which channels are in use and which
are free. It is this capability that convinced McCaw to buy Steinbrecher
data cells despite the commitment of McCaw's putative owner, AT&amp;T, to
sell narrowband units made by Cirrus Logics' subsidiary Pacific Communications
Sciences Inc. (PCSI), which have to scan through channels one at a time.
McCaw is using the Steinbrecher radios as sniffers that constantly survey
the cellular band and direct data bursts to those channels that are not
being used at a particular time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the immediate needs of the marketplace alone justify the adoption
of Steinbrecher data cells. With modems and antennas increasingly available
and even moving sometime next year to PCMCIA slots the size of a credit
card, demand for wireless data is likely to soar.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
PCSI is now shipping a quintuple-threat communicator that fits into the
floppy bay of an advanced IBM ThinkPad notebook or an Apple PowerBook, enabling
them to send and receive faxes, make wireless or wire-line phone calls,
dispatch data files across the existing cellular network or send CDPD packets
at 19.2 kilobits per second. Speech recognition capabilities from IBM and
Dragon Systems will come next year to personal digital assistants, permitting
them to read or receive E-mail by voice. Although the first Newtons and
Zoomers have disappointed their sponsors, the market will ignite over the
next two years as vendors adopt the essential form factor of a digital cellular
phone with computer functions rather than providing a kluge computer with
a vaporware phone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, McCaw has more on its mind with Steinbrecher than merely gaining
a second source for CDPD sniffers. By simultaneously purchasing some 10
percent of the company and putting chief technical officer Nicholas Kauser
on the Steinbrecher board, McCaw is signaling not a tactical move but a
major strategic thrust. The Steinbrecher rollout in fact represents McCaw's
stealth deployment of broadband digital capability.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today the rival CDPD equipment from PCSI, Hughes and AT&T all can be made
to perform CDPD communications as an overly to the existing cellular phone
system. However, only the Steinbrecher systems can be upgraded to perform
all of the functions of a base station and more, for voice, data and video.
Only Steinbrecher allows the replacement of 416 radio transceivers, one
for each channel, with one broadband radio and some digital signal processing
chips. Only Steinbrecher can replace a $ 1.5 million, 1,000 square foot
cellular base station with a box the size of a briefcase costing some $
100,000 but, thanks to Moore's Law, racing toward $ 10,000.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It remains to be seen only whether McCaw will have the guts to follow through
on this initiative by completely rebuilding its network to accommodate the
wideband radio being installed at its heart. Self-cannibalization is the
rule of success in information technology. Intel and Microsoft, for example,
lead the way in constantly attacking their own products. But this mode of
life is deeply alien to the telephone business--even an entrepreneurial
outfit like McCaw.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With new software and a simple upgrade to a MiniCell, the Steinbrecher DataCell
will allow the McCaw system to handle all modulation schemes simultaneously--AMPS,
TDMA, CDMA and future methods such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple
Access--obviating the need for hybrid phones. The multiprotocol and aerobatic
capabilities of broadband digital radios could enable McCaw to roll out
a cornucopia of PCS services--for everything from monitoring vending machines
or remote power stations to tracking tracks and packages, and linking laptops
and PDAs--while the rest of the industry is still paralyzed by wrangles
over incumbent users, regulatory procedures, frequency access and radio
standards.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Making channel sizes a variable rather than a fixed function of radios,
Steinbrecher systems offer the possibility of bandwidth on demand. They
could open up the entire spectrum as one gigantic broadband pipe into which
we would be able to insert packets in any empty space--dark fiber in the
air. 
<PRE>
<B>So Stop The Auction</B></PRE>
<BR>
So what does this have to do with the impending spectrum auction? Almost
everything. Strictly speaking, the FCC is leasing 10 year exclusive rights
to radiate electromagnetic waves at certain frequencies to deliver PCS.
This entire auction concept is tied to thousands of exclusive frequency
licenses. It has no place for broadband radios that treat all frequencies
alike and offer bandwidth on demand. It has no place for modulation schemes
that do not need exclusive spectrum space. Continuing to use interference
standards based on analog transmissions that are affected by every passing
spray of radiation, FCC rules fail to grasp the far more robust nature of
digital on-off codes with error correction. By the time the FCC gets around
to selling its 1,500 shards of air, the air will have been radically changed
by new technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The FCC is fostering a real estate paradigm for the spectrum. You buy or
lease spectrum as you would a spread of land. Once you have your license,
you can use it any way you want as long as you don't unduly disturb the
neighbors. You rent a stretch of beach and build a wall.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The Steinbrecher system, by contrast, suggests a model not of a beach but
of an ocean. You can no more lease electromagnetic waves than you can lease
ocean waves. Enabled by new technology, this new model is suitable for an
information superhighway in the sky. You can use the spectrum as much as
you want as long as you don't collide with anyone else or pollute it with
high-powered noise or other nuisances.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Steinbrecher model, you employ the spectrum as you use any public
right of way. You are responsible for keeping your eyes open and avoiding
others. You cannot just buy a 10 year lease and then barge blindly all over
the air in a high-powered vessel, depending on the government to keep everyone
else off your territory and out of your way. The spectrum is no longer dark.
The Steinbrecher broadband radio supplies you with lights as you travel
the information superhighway. You can see other travelers and avoid them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Even if Steinbrecher radios did not exist, however, the assumptions of the
auction are collapsing in the face of innovations by Qualcomm and other
spread-spectrum companies. Like Steinbrecher radios, CDMA modulation schemes
allow you to use spectrum without interfering with others. To auditors without
the code, calls seem indistinguishable from noise. But radios with the code
can dig up signals from under the noise floor. Up to the point of traffic
congestion where the quality of the signal begins to degrade gracefully,
numerous users can employ the same frequencies at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This property of CDMA has been tested in Qualcomm's CDMA Omnitracs position
locator and two-way communications system. Mainly used by trucking companies,
it is now being extended to cars, boats, trains and other mobile equipment.
Based on geosynchronous satellites, it operates all across the country,
with some 60,000 units, under a secondary license that forbids Qualcomm
to interfere with the primary license-holders of the same frequencies. Qualcomm's
transceivers on the tops of trucks use a small antenna that issues a beam
six to 10 degrees in width. Because satellites are just two degrees apart,
the Qualcomm beam can blanket several satellites. Other users, however,
are entirely unconscious of the presence of the CDMA signal. Omnitracs has
operated for some six years and has not interfered with anyone yet. 
<PRE>
<B>No More Blind Drivers On The Information Superhighway</B></PRE>
<BR>
<BR>
With an increasing array of low-interference technologies available, the
FCC should not give exclusive rights to anyone. Instead, it should impose
a heavy burden of proof on any service providers with blind or high-powered
systems that maintain that they cannot operate without an exclusive license,
that want to build on the beach and keep everyone else out of the surf.
In particular, the FCC should make all the proponents of TDMA, whether in
the American or European GSM systems, explain why the government should
wall off spectrum. The wireless systems of the future will offer bandwidth
on demand and send their packets wherever there is room.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the same time that new technologies make hash of the need to auction
off exclusive licenses, Qualcomm and Steinbrecher also radically attack
the very notion of spectrum scarcity on which the auction is based. Steinbrecher's
radio makes it possible to manufacture new spectrum nearly at will. By putting
one of his MiniCells on every telephone pole and down every alley and in
every elevator shaft, the cellular industry can exponentially multiply the
total number of calls it can handle. At some $ 100,000 apiece and dropping
in price, these MiniCells can operate at 900 megahertz or six gigahertz
just as well as at the two-gigahertz range being auctioned by the government.
It is as if Reed Hundt is auctioning off beachfront property, with a long
list of codicils and regulations and restrictive covenants, while the tide
pours in around him and creates new surf everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Still more important in view of the coming auction, the wideband capability
of the Steinbrecher radio joins CDMA in allowing the use of huge spans of
spectrum that are ostensibly occupied by other users. The Steinbrecher radio
can survey the gigahertz reserves of the military and intelligence services,
UHF television and microwave, and direct usage to the many fallow regions.
For example, the prime territory between 225 megahertz and 400 megahertz,
consisting of some 3,0130 25-kilohertz channels, is entirely occupied by
government and air force communications. But most of the channels are largely
unused. A Steinbrecher radio could sit on those frequencies and direct calls
to empty slots.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
An ideal system would combine Steinbrecher broadband machines with Qualcomm's
modulation schemes. Steinbrecher supplies the lights and eyes to find space
in already licensed spectrum bands; CDMA allows the noninvasive entry Into
spans of spectrum that are in active use.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the Steinbrecher system changes the very nature of spectrum &quot;ownership&quot;
or rental. Unrestricted to a single band or range of frequencies, Steinbrecher
radios can reach from the kilohertz to the high gigahertz and go to any
unoccupied territory. As Steinbrecher radios become the dominant technology,
the notion of spectrum assignments allotted in 2,500 specific shards becomes
a technological absurdity.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Wall Street is beginning to catch on. When Steinbrecher announced in January
a private placement through Alex. Brown, the company wanted to raise some
$ 20 million. The response was overwhelming, and hundreds of frustrated
Investors were left wringing their hands as the new radio left the station.
The sole proprietorship of the mid-1980s with revenues of $ 5 million or
less was moving into sleek new headquarters off Route 198 in Burlington.
Steinbrecher Corp. was becoming yet another of the Moore's Law monsters.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the issue for Washington emerges starkly. Do we want a strategy
for MiniCells or for Minitels?

<PRE></PRE>
The perennial question of all suitors of fate and fortune now whispers and
resounds through conference resorts, executive retreats and consulting sessions
across the land as business leaders from Hollywood to Wall Street pose with
pundits and ponder the new world of converging technologies. Symbolized
in a famous mandala by MIT's Media Lab, this grand fondue of information
tools_to be served la carte on a flat-panel screen_is foreseen to be a $3.5
trillion feast for American business sometime early next century. Few would
guess that crucial to the emerging mediamorphosis_as king of the flat panel_will
be a slight, graying, bearded man with some 30 teddy bears, Roger Fidler.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler coined the term mediamorphosis as the title of his forthcoming book.
His office in Boulder, Colo., looks out on the panorama of a picturesque
downtown of red brick and neo-Gothic, surrounded by the Rocky Mountain foothills
and sepia sandstone buildings of a mile-high Silicon Valley. Down the hall
is an Apple Computer media center which is developing graphical forms of
AppleLink, the company's on-line network. Down the block is Cablelabs, John
Malone's research arm, which is designing the future of the cable industry.<BR>
<BR>
Roger Fidler, though, is a newspaperman, a veteran of some 32 years in a
business little known for technology. Beginning as an 11-year-old paperboy
in Eugene, Oreg., Fidler went on to serve as a reporter, science columnist
and art director before launching what is now Knight-Ridder Tribune Graphics.
A multimillion-dollar business and reliable profit center, this venture
provides digital graphics for newspapers and video animations for TV stations
across the country over a dedicated network called PressLink, also launched
by Fidler. Now Fidler and his allies working in Knight-Ridder's Information
Design Laboratory are concocting an audacious plan to make the lowly newspaper
the spearhead of the information economy.<BR>
<BR>
Most information companies and executives are betting on him to fail. Barry
Diller, the former ruler of 20th Century Fox, recently circled the planet
of technology on a celebrated pilgrimage from Hollywood to find where the
money would be made in the new information economy. Shunning Fidler's little
lab, he arrived at nearby Cablelabs and resolved on home shopping through
cable TV. He bought into QVC for some $20 million and went into business
with John Malone. After a more corporate investigation, featuring polls
and customer surveys, Robert Allen of AT&T settled to a remarkable degree
on the $14 billion market in electronic games. Since launching an alliance
with Sega, AT&T has been collecting game companies as compulsively as your
kid collects games. It has bought shares of Sierra Online, 3DO, Spectrum
HoloByte and PF Magic.<BR>
<BR>
Moving toward the news trade is IBM. But rather than collaborating with
one of the thousands of newspapers that use its equipment, the computer
giant is trysting with General Electric's NBC in a kind of elephants' waltz
into the sunset of old broadcast media.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these leaders in the new gold rush toward multimedia are getting
it wrong. Fixated by market surveys that map demand for existing video,
they are plunging down dead ends and cul-de-sacs with their eyes firmly
focused on the luminous visions in their rearview mirrors. Blockbuster,
Nintendo and other game and video vendors have good businesses, for the
moment, but they are ballast from the past.

News In The Microcosm

</B></PRE>
The leader who best comprehends the promise of the next phase in information
technology may be Fidler of Knight-Ridder. A student of electronic technology,
he has grasped an amazing and rather obscure fact: of all the information
providers, only newspapers are fully in tune with the law of the microcosm.<BR>
<BR>
Based on the constant rise in the computing power of individual microchips
relative to systems of chips, the law of the microcosm dictates that power
will continually devolve from centralized institutions, bureaucracies, computer
architectures and databases into distributed systems. On the most obvious
level, it caused the fall of the mainframe computer and the companies that
depended upon it, and assured the ascent of personal computers and workstations.
In the next decade, the law of the microcosm will assure the displacement
of analog television, with its centralized networks and broadcast stations,
by computer networks with no center at all. While offering a cornucopia
of interactivity, computer networks can perform all the functions of TV.<BR>
<BR>
With the cost-effectiveness of chips still doubling every 18 months, the
law of the microcosm is not going away. Now it dictates that of all the
many rivals to harvest the fruits of the information revolution, newspapers
and magazines will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
The secret of the success of the newspaper, grasped by Roger Fidler, is
that it is in practice a personal medium, used very differently by each
customer. Newspapers rely on the intelligence of the reader. Although the
editors select and shape the matter to be delivered, readers choose, peruse,
sort, queue and quaff the news and advertising copy at their own pace and
volition.<BR>
<BR>
In this regard, newspapers differ from television stations in much the way
automobiles differ from trains. With the train (and the TV), you go to the
station at the scheduled time and travel to the destinations determined
from above. With the car (and the newspaper), you get in and go pretty much
where you want when you want. Putting the decisionmaking power into the
hands of the reader, the newspaper accords with the microcosmic model far
better than TV does. Newspaper readers are not couch potatoes; they interact
with the product, shaping it to their own ends.<BR>
<BR>
Computers will soon blow away the broadcast television industry, but they
pose no such threat to newspapers. Indeed, the computer is a perfect complement
to the newspaper. It enables the existing news industry to deliver its product
in real time. It hugely increases the quantity of information that can be
made available, including archives, maps, charts and other supporting material.
It opens the way to upgrading the news with full-screen photographs and
videos. While hugely enhancing the richness and timeliness of the news,
however, it empowers readers to use the &quot;paper&quot; in the same way
they do today_to browse and select stories and advertisements at their own
time and pace.<BR>
<BR>
Until recently, the expense of computers restricted this complementarity
to newsrooms and pressrooms. The news today is collected, edited, laid out
and prepared for the press by advanced digital equipment. Reporters capture
and remit their data in digital form. But the actual printing and distribution
of the paper remain in the hands of printers and truckers.<BR>

Now the law of the microcosm has reduced the price of personal computers
below the tag on a high-end TV and made them nearly coextensive with newspapers.
Newspapers and computers are converging, while computers and televisions
still represent radically different modes. It is the newspaper, therefore,
not the TV, that is best fitted for the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
Newspapers can be built on foundations of sand_the silicon and silica of
microchips and telecom. Not only does the computer industry generate nearly
three times the annual revenues of television but computer hardware sales
are growing some eight times faster than the sales of television sets. By
riding the tides of personal computer sales and usage, newspapers can shape
the future of multimedia.<BR>
<BR>
High-definition PC displays will benefit text far more than images. The
resolution of current NTSC (National Television Standards Committee) analog
television_62 dots per inch_is actually ample for most images, particularly
the studio-quality forms that can be converted for digital delivery over
fiber-optic lines. Even the conventional interlaced TV screen_in which alternate
lines are filled in every second_easily fools the eye for video. But for
fully readable text you need the 200 to 300 dots per inch of a laser printer
or super-high-resolution screen. Such screens are now being developed. Overkill
for most images, they could supply the first display tablets with screens
as readable as paper.

Fat Panel's Digital Newspaper

</B></PRE>
After the &quot;Rocky Mountain High&quot; panorama, the first thing you
see in Roger Fidler's office is a more modest tableau. At a round table
in the corner is a huge teddy bear he calls Fat Panel. Fat Panel is poised
to read a tablet that looks very much like a newspaper, but in fact is a
flat-panel screen some nine inches wide, a foot high and a half-inch thick.
Weighing a little over a pound, far less than the Sunday edition of your
local newspaper, this device_call it a newspanel_might contain a trove of
news, graphics, audio and even video, representing more than a year of Sunday
papers. Through fiber-optic lines and radio links, it might connect to databases
of news and entertainment from around the world.<BR>
<BR>
On the face of this tablet is something that looks a lot like the page of
a newspaper. It contains headlines for featured stories followed by their
first few paragraphs and a jump to an inner page. The jump, unlike that
in your usual newspaper, is electronic and immediate. You click an arrow
with a pen or a mouse_or in the near future, say the word_and the rest of
the story almost instantly appears. If your eyes are otherwise engaged,
you can click on an audio icon and have the story read aloud to you.<BR>
<BR>
Discreetly placed on the bottom of the panel are three sample ads. Since
ads currently supply some 80 percent of the revenues of many newspapers
and magazines, the entire system will rise and fall on the effectiveness
of the ads. However, electronics promises a more total revolution in advertising
than in any other facet of the newspaper outside of printing. This change
comes none too soon. As shown by a general drop in margins from 30 percent
in the mid-1980s to close to 10 percent last year, newspapers are suffering
a sharp decline in conventional advertising revenues, only partly compensated
for by an influx of funds from blow-in coupons and inserts.<BR>
<BR>
In a 1988 prophecy at the American Press Institute in Reston, Va., Fidler
envisaged electronic newspanel ads in the year 2000: &quot;When you touch
most ads, they suddenly come alive. More importantly, advertisers can deliver
a variety of targeted messages that can be matched to each personal profile.
An airline ad offering discount fares to South America attracts me with
the haunting music of an Andean flute. I'm planning to take some vacation
time in Peru next month [Fidler's wife is a Peruvian recording artist],
so I touch the ad to get more information. Before I quit, I'll check the
ad indexes to see if any other airlines are offering discount fares. With
the built-in communicator, I can even make my reservations directly from
the tablet if I choose. The airline's reservation telephone number is embedded
in the ad, and my credit card numbers and other essential data are maintained
in the tablet, so all I would have to do is write in the dates and times
that I want to travel and touch a button on the screen. The information
is encrypted as well as voice-print protected, so there is no risk of someone
else placing orders with my tablet.<BR>
<BR>
Contrary to the usual notion, the electronic newspaper will be a far more
effective advertising medium than current newspapers, television or home
shopping schemes. Rather than trying to trick the reader into watching the
ad, the newspaper will merely present the ad in a part of the paper frequented
by likely customers. Viewers who are seriously interested in the advertised
item can click on it and open up a more detailed presentation, or they can
advertise their own desire to buy a product of particular specifications.<BR>
<BR>
In deference to Fidler, who currently combs the world looking for the best
flat-panel screens, Fat Panel appears to be perusing a story on field emission
displays (FEDs). Even cathode ray tubes with VGA graphics command only 72
dots per inch of resolution. This has been shown to slow down reading by
some 25 percent compared with paper. Readers of Voyager Co.'s tomes on Mac
PowerBooks quickly discover that even Susan Faludi's breezy Backlash or
Michael Crichton's compulsive Jurassic Park or James Gleick's normally riveting
biography of Richard Feynman bog down in subtle but insidious typographical
fuzz. A newspaper with more than one item on the screen would be worse.
The age of electronic text entirely depends on the development of screens
with the definition of a laser printer. For this purpose, FEDs offer great
long-term promise.<BR>
<BR>
While the prevailing liquid crystal displays (LCDs) merely reflect or channel
light, FEDs emit light like a cathode ray tube. Indeed, as currently envisaged
by a Micron Display Technology process, FEDs will array millions of tiny
cathode light emitters that allow bright displays with high resolution and
full-motion video. Although today's FEDs require too much power for full
portability with current battery technology, they represent an inviting
option for newspaper tablets at the turn of the century.<BR>
<BR>
Usable tablets, however, will arrive long before then. At the August Siggraph
show, Xerox demonstrated a 13-inch-diagonal liquid crystal display with
a record 6.3 million pixels, delivering 279 dots per inch of resolution.
The 279 dots per inch provide some three times more definition than the
screen of a Sun workstation_the current desktop graphics workhorse_and negligibly
short of the 300-dot resolution of a laser printer.<BR>
<BR>
Beyond resolution, the key to the newspaper tablet is portability. Portability
means low power. Active-matrix LCDs are inherently a high-power, low-transmissive
medium. The crystals absorb light; the polarizer wastes half the light;
the transistors at each pixel squander power. For high contrast, backlighting
is essential. That sinks another 20 to 30 watts. The higher the resolution,
the worse all these problems become.
<PRE>


<B>


Full-Motion Images Or Full-Motion Users?

</B></PRE>
According to the Fidler vision, the U.S. should stop emulating the Japanese,
who boldly invested some $12 billion in manufacturing capacity for power-hungry
liquid crystal displays used on notebook computers and flat-screen TVs.
Urged by the Clinton administration, this U.S. industrial policy is based
on a strategy of &quot;catch up and copy,&quot; and it will fail. Rather
than chase the Japanese by achieving high resolution at high power to compete
with cathode ray tubes, the U.S. should target high resolution at low power
to compete with paper.<BR>
<BR>
As in semiconductor electronics, the winners will follow a strategy of low
and slow. The law of the microcosm ordains exponential performance gains
from slower and lower-powered transistors packed ever closer together on
individual microchips. Throughout the history of semiconductors_from the
first transistor to the latest microprocessor_the industry has succeeded
by following this law: replacing faster and higher-powered components with
smaller, slower and lower-powered devices. When you pack enough of the slow
and low transistors close enough together, your system may end up operating
faster than a supercomputer based on the highest-powered and fastest discrete
transistors. And it will definitely be more efficient in MIPS per dollar.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm has not been suspended for displays. The Japanese
have been focusing on high-powered screens capable of reproducing the features
of low-end CRTs: full-motion color video. Rather than favoring full-motion
video, however, the U.S. should foster full-motion readers through low-
powered and slow components. It is the people rather than the pixels that
should be able to move. Speed will come in due course.<BR>
<BR>
Demonstrating the first prototype of such a system is Zvi Yaniv of Advanced
Technology Incubator (ATI) of Farmington Hills, Mich. Long among the most
inventive figures in America's eternally embryonic flat-panel industry,
Yaniv was a founder of Optical Imaging Systems, currently the leading U.S.-based
producer, with well under one-percent global market share.<BR>
<BR>
For his tablet, Yaniv uses a material invented at Kent State University
in Ohio called Polymer Stabilized Cholesteric Texture (PSCT). On it he inscribes
pixels in the form of helical liquid crystal devices. The helices are chemically
doped to give them a specific reflectivity: showing all wavelengths or colors
of light that do not match the resonant wavelengths in the helix.<BR>
<BR>
So far ATI has demonstrated images in black and white and in 16 levels of
gray scale. Color, according to Yaniv, poses no theoretical problems. Based
on current experimental successes, it will be achieved within the next two
years. For the first newspanels, however, color is less important than the
high-resolution text capability, which ATI delivers at a breakthrough price.<BR>
<BR>
This technology offers four key advantages over the active-matrix LCD: no
transistors, no polarizers, no color filters, no backlighting. Without these
power-and space-hungry features, Yaniv's screens can achieve higher density
of pixels at far lower energy use. This adds up to far higher resolution
at milliwatts of power (rather than 20 watts) and at far higher manufacturing
yields, and thus far lower cost. Yaniv predicts screens with laser-printer
resolution and with contrast higher than paper, costing between $1 and $2
per square inch (compared with around $10 for current active-matrix devices).
That means 8-1/2-by-11-inch tablets for $100 to $200 in manufacturing cost,
well under Fidler's target price.<BR>
<BR>
Still an R&D project in an intensely competitive industry, ATI may not have
all the answers, but it points the way to a solution. Within the next three
or four years, a portable tablet with laser-printer resolution and contrast
and with hundreds of megabytes of solid-state or hard disk memory will be
purchasable for an acceptable price. Fat Panel's tablet is not merely a
toy; it is the token of a technology that will sweep the world.

News On The Net

</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, precusor solutions are being rolled out on personal computers,
Newtons, Zoomers and other personal digital assistants. Already collecting
and transmitting copy in digital form, reporters and editors could just
as well provide digital content to all the other platforms that are emerging
in the 1990s, from tiny portable personal communications services to supercomputer
knowledge bases.<BR>
<BR>
Also empowering the newspaper industry will be the exploding new world of
boundless bandwidth or communications power in both the atmosphere and the
fibersphere (see Forbes ASAP, December 7, 1992, and March 29, 1993). One
of the most difficult concepts for many business planners to grasp is the
onset of bandwidth abundance: the idea that the electromagnetic spectrum
is not scarce but nearly limitless. The text of a daily newspaper takes
up about a megabyte; a hundred or so black-and-white photographs take up
about 100 megabytes; 25 color photos could run another 100 megabytes, or
even a gigabyte, depending on resolution. Video clips would take about 100
megabytes apiece. With just 500 megabytes, you could throw in the entire
&quot;MacNeil/Lehrer News Hour.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Summing it all up, the total bit-cost of a paper, including video-rich ads,
might be comparable to that of a two-hour movie_perhaps two gigabytes with
compression. Two gigabytes can be transmitted in a second down fiber-optic
lines, in perhaps 10 seconds down a gigahertz cable connection, and in perhaps
a matter of three or four minutes down a twisted-pair copper line equipped
with Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Loop (ADSL) technology, Amati Corp.'s
amazing new phone-company access system. From Digital Equipment Corp. and
Zenith to Hybrid Technologies and Continental Cablevision, several firms
are demonstrating impressive ways to use cable lines for two-way digital
data transmission at a rate of 10 megabits a second or more, which would
fill up a two-gigabyte newspanel in just over three minutes. Electrical
power companies also are laying fiber along with their power lines. All
these pipes are little used for long hours of the night and could be employed
to deliver newspapers.<BR>
<BR>
Complementing this web of wires will be wireless methods of delivery. Cellular
technology is moving toward a code division multiple access (CDMA) protocol
that allows use of the entire spectrum every mile or so, and toward millimeter
wave frequencies that offer gigahertz of capacity. Again, access to these
systems might be expensive on a demand basis, but a newspaper can be sent
whenever space or time is available. Delivery of the basic paper through
wires and fiber and delivery of short updates and extras via the air would
be optimal. Whatever electronic or photonic techniques are used, the laws
of the microcosm and telecosm ordain that distribution of newspapers will
become vastly cheaper, more efficient and more timely than their present
methods: trucks and bicycles.
<PRE>


<B>


The &quot;Domonetics&quot; Of The Word

</B></PRE>
The future of newspapers will not depend on technology alone, however. The
ultimate strength of the &quot;press&quot; comes not from its machinery
but from its &quot;domonetics&quot;_a word that describes an institution's
cultural sources and effects.<BR>
<BR>
Judeo-Christian scripture declares that in the beginning was the word. There
is no mention of the image. Today in information technology, the word still
widely prevails. In 1992, trade publications, newspapers and magazines alone
generated some $73 billion in sales, compared with television revenues of
$57 billion.<BR>
<BR>
In general, images are valuable as an enhancement to words. As Robert Lucky
of Bellcore has pointed out, images are not in themselves usually an efficient
mode of communication. In his definitive work &quot;Silicon Dreams,&quot;
just released in a new paperback edition, Lucky writes that after an evening
of television, &quot;we sink into bed, bloated with pictorial bits, starved
for information.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
People who gush that a picture is worth a thousand words usually fail to
point out that it may well take a million computer &quot;words&quot; to
send or store it. Written words are a form of compression that has evolved
over thousands of years of civilization. In a multimedia encyclopedia, such
as Microsoft's Encarta, some 10,000 images take up 90 percent of the bits,
but supply perhaps one-100th of the information. With the pictures alone,
the encyclopedia is nearly worthless; with the words alone, you still have
a valuable encyclopedia. Most of the work and the worth are in the words.
Supremely the masters of words, newspapers can add cosmetic pictures, sounds
and video clips far more easily than TV or game machines can add reporting
depth, expertise, research and cogent opinion.<BR>
<BR>
More profoundly, the domonetics of the new technologies strongly favors
text-based communications. Video is most effective in conveying shocks and
sensations and appealing to prurient interests of large miscellaneous audiences.
Images easily excel in blasting through to the glandular substrates of the
human community; there's nothing like a body naked or bloody or both to
arrest the eye and forestall the TV zapper.<BR>
<BR>
TV news succeeds because of timeliness and vividness. Compared with TV imagery,
news photos tend to be late and lame. Nonetheless, for all its power and
influence, broadcast television news is a dead medium, awaiting early burial
by newspapers using new technologies.<BR>
<BR>
The TV news problem is summed up by the two-minute rule_the usual requirement
that, short of earthquake or war, no story take more than two minutes to
tell. This rule even applies to the epitome of broadcast news_CNN. It is
entirely a negative rule. The reason for it is not that the audience desires
no more than two minutes of coverage of stories of interest. On any matter
deeply interesting to the viewer, two minutes is much too little.<BR>
<BR>
The rationale for the two-minute rule is that the viewer will not tolerate
more than two minutes of an unwanted story. Its only function is to forestall
the zapper, but its effect is to frustrate any viewer with more than a superficial
interest in a story. Increasingly it reduces TV news to a kaleidoscope of
shocks and sensations, portents and propaganda, gossip and titillation.<BR>
<BR>
The new technologies, however, put individual customers in command. Making
their own first choices among scores of thousands of possibilities, individuals
eschew the hair-trigger poise of the channel surfer. Narrowcasting allows
appeal to the special interests and ambitions, the hobbies and curiosities,
the career pursuits and learning needs of particular individuals. Thus,
the new media open up domonetic vistas entirely missed by mass media.<BR>
<BR>
At the domonetic elevation of newspapers, images are supplementary, not
primary. The new technologies thus favor text over pure video because text_enhanced
by graphics where needed_is by far the best (and digitally most efficient)
way to convey most information and ideas. Where graphics are overwhelmingly
more efficient than alphanumerics_as in visualization of huge bodies of
data or statistics_the newspanel can supply true computer graphics and simulations.
Interactivity, after all, is the computer's forte.

The $700 Million Incentive

</B></PRE>
As early as 1981, Fidler saw and predicted that computer technology using
flat-panel screens would allow the newspaper business to eliminate much
of its centralized manufacturing and printing plant and much of its distribution
expenses, and deliver the product directly to the customer at half the cost.
He saw that this process would jeopardize neither the branded identity nor
the editing functions nor the essential character of the paper. The distribution
of intelligence would simply permit the customer rather than the newspaper
to supply the display and the printer. This microcosmic shift would drastically
simplify and improve the accessibility and worth of the information, enhancing
the value of newspaper archives and other resources. This step could theoretically
save Fidler's employer, Knight-Ridder, some $700 million, or between half
and two-thirds of its current costs.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler's vision is just as promising for magazines. In effect, his concept
allows newspapers to combine the best features of daily journalism with
the best qualities of specialty magazines. The front pages and shallower
levels of the system will still function like a streamlined newspaper, which
readers can browse, search and explore as they do a conventional paper without
thrashing about through the pages. The deeper levels will function like
magazines, focusing on business, technology, lifestyles, sports, religion
or art. Indeed, to exalt their offerings into an ever richer cornucopia,
news systems will want to collaborate with magazines, just as they often
distribute magazines today with their Sunday papers.
<PRE>


<B>


The Soul Of The New Medium

</B></PRE>
In addition, electronic magazines can excel newspapers in providing a sense
of community through interaction with other readers and authors in new kinds
of dynamic letters, bulletin boards and classified sections. In a sense,
the news panel never ends. Beyond its offering of news, articles and archives,
it opens into new dimensions of interactivity.<BR>
<BR>
As Stephen Case puts it: &quot;Everybody will become information providers
as well as consumers. The challenge is to create electronic communities
that marry information and communications_thereby creating an interactive,
participatory medium. This community aspect is crucial--it is the soul of
the new medium.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The most practical current vessel for this expansion of the press is Case's
own company, America Online, a supplier of an icon-based interface and gateway
to scores of &quot;infobases&quot; and bulletin boards in Vienna, Va., outside
the District of Columbia. Ten percent owned by the Tribune Co. of Chicago,
eight percent controlled by Apple, allied with Knight-Ridder and providing
access to such journals as the New Republic, National Geographic, Time and
Macworld, America Online has uniquely focused on the vital center of the
new market: the point of convergence of newspapers, magazines and computers
in new communities of interest and interaction.<BR>
<BR>
Following this strategy, America Online has invested just $20 million (one-100th
the capital of Prodigy) and devoted half the time, to achieve nearly one-third
the customer base and generate strong profits, in contrast to huge estimated
losses on the part of IBM and Sears. Prodigy is now paying AOL the high
tribute of imitation, making deals with Cox Enterprises Inc. and its 17
newspapers, and with Times-Mirror. Perhaps most audacious in pursuing this
vision, however, is Murdoch's News Corp. Ltd., which recently purchased
Delphi Internet Services Corp., the only on-line service with full Internet
access to home PC users. Delphi already offers an array of news programs
and special-interest conferences, including a popular computer news show
led by moderator Jerry Pournelle that provides interactive dialogs on everything
from abstruse computer features to science fiction. Pournelle and some 300
other conference moderators can function like editors in cyberspace.<BR>
<BR>
Internet is the global agglomeration of data networks that has emerged from
the original Pentagon research network called ARPANET. Growing at some 15
percent a month for several years to a current level of 10 to 20 million
users, Internet has bifurcated into linked commercial and research nonprofit
divisions. As John Evans, president of News Corp.'s Electronic Data, puts
it, explaining the Delphi purchase: &quot;Internet is like a giant jellyfish.
You can't step on it. You can't go around it. You've got to go through it.&quot;
Delphi now plans to go through it using much quicker access systems, including
cable.<BR>
<BR>
Evans declares that these new collaborations between News Corp. and Internet
will &quot;put the 'me' back into media.&quot; His concept, also shared
by Nicholas Negroponte's Media Lab and Apple Computer's Knowledge Navigator,
is an automated news database ultimately supplying the customer with a personal
paper filtered from floods of daily information by an agent programmed to
pursue your own interests. In Fidler's view, however, these digital papers
will succeed only to the extent that they transcend this vision of the Daily
Me.<BR>
<BR>
Fidler prefers the vision of a Daily Us, shaped by human editors rather
than by electronic agents or filters. According to Fidler, the law of the
microcosm will put so much intelligence and storage in the tablet that the
individual can personalize the &quot;paper&quot; every day in a different
way. If, as Case puts it, the soul of the new medium is community, the reader
will want to begin in a particular context, a specially favored &quot;place&quot;
in the world of information, a place with a brand name and identity: a newspaper.
<PRE>


<B>


The Computer Imperative

</B></PRE>
Above all, the key to the special advantage of newspapers in the new era
is their great good fortune in being forced to focus on computers. It should
be evident by now to everyone in the information business that the energy,
the creativity, the drive, the gusto, the pulse, the catalyst of this industry
is computers. The magic is in the microcosm of solid-state electronics (doubling
the density of components on a chip every 18 months) and in the concentric
circles of enterprise and invention that surge outward from this creative
core: the some 5,000 software firms, the thousands of manufacturers of chips,
peripherals, printed circuit boards and add-on cards; the double-digit annual
expansion in the armies of computer scientists and software engineers; the
ever growing millions of PC owners devoting their creative energies and
passions to this intoxicating machine.<BR>
<BR>
What the Model T was to the industrial era-the teenage training board, the
tinkerer's love and laboratory, the technological epitome-the PC is to the
Information Age. Just as people who rode the wave of automobile technology-from
tiremakers to fast-food franchisers-prevailed in the industrial era, so
the firms that prey on the passion and feed on the force of the computer
community will predominate in the information era.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, are so many apparently ambitious and visionary executives shrinking
from the central arena to play around on the fringes with TVs and game machines?
Why are American computer executives standing silently aside while the so-called
U.S. Grand Alliance for the Future of Advanced Television, so-called digital
HDTV, adopts an interlaced screen technology that is fundamentally hostile
to computers?<BR>
<BR>
For images, the human eye cannot tell the difference between interlaced
and progressively scanned displays. But interlace poses endless problems
for text and multimedia. Apart from Zenith, the American leaders in the
Grand Alliance are AT&amp;T, General Instrument Corp., MIT, Sarnoff Laboratories
and GE-NBC. All but MIT capitulated to pressure from foreign TV interests
such as Sony, Thomson Corp. and Philips Electronics to betray the American
computer and newspaper industries by adopting a display scheme unsuited
for the multimedia and text programs central to the next computer revolution.<BR>
<BR>
Without text and multimedia capabilities, high-resolution images can open
virtually no markets not already served by current &quot;digitally enhanced&quot;
improved-definition television displays. Limiting the teleconferencing market,
for example, is not the resolution of the screens but the bandwidth of the
network. Without computer capabilities, digital TV is likely to be a large
disappointment.<BR>
<BR>
Claiming to set a standard that can survive deep into the next century,
the Grand Alliance is focusing on short-term economies for manufacturing
TVs tomorrow. These executives are all missing the point and the promise
of the era in which they live. The Information Age is not chiefly about
kicks and thrills, offering games for kids and so-called dildonics for &quot;adults.&quot;
Markets for educational programs and on-line information services are already
growing much faster than game markets. In 1992 in the computer business,
according to the Software Publishers Association, entertainment software
revenues rose some 29 percent to a level of $342 million. Educational software
for the home rose some 47 percent to $146 million. Meanwhile, sales of computers
with modems are rising at about 1,000 percent a year, hugely faster than
the sales of TVs. Online services like America Online and Prodigy have been
growing almost 500 percent per year since 1988. According to current projections
based on microprocessor CPU sales, some 50 million PCs may be sold over
the next 12 months, and perhaps three-quarters of them will contain either
on-board modems or networking systems.<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate reason that the newspapers will prevail in the Information
Age is that they are better than anyone else at collecting, editing, filtering
and presenting real information, and they are allying with the computer
juggernaut to do it. The newspapers are pursuing the fastest expanding current
markets rather than rearview markets. They are targeting adults with real
interests and ambitions that generate buying power rather than distracting
children from more edifying pursuits. In the computer age, follow the microcosm
and you will find the money, too.

</H3>
The world of networks breaks into two polar paradigms. Most familiar is
the Public Switched Telephone Network. From the tiniest transistor flip-flop
on a modem chip through labyrinthine layers of rising complexity on up to
a 4ESS supercomputer switch linking 107,520 telephone trunk lines (itself
consisting of millions of interconnected transistors), the public network
is a vast, deterministic web of wires and switches. Once you are connected
in the public network, your message is guaranteed to get through.<BR>
<BR>
In the public network, bandwidth constantly expands as you rise in the hierarchy.
At the bottom are the twisted-pair copper wires of your telephone that function
at four kilohertz (thousands of cycles per second). At the top are fiber-optic
trunk lines that function at rates close to the 2.9-gigahertz speeds of
the electronic transistors that feed the glass wires. In The Geodesic Network,
writer Peter Huber has described the five tiers of the telephone switching
system as a structure with &quot;the solidity, permanence and inflexibility
of the Great Pyramid of Cheops, which on paper it resembled.&quot; Although
the pyramid has suffered erosion and change in recent years, it remains
mostly in place today: the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
That is one network paradigm. The other paradigm is Robert Metcalfe's. It
germinated in his mind in 1970 as he read a paper by Norman Abramson of
the University of Hawaii given at a computer conference that year. Abramson
told of another paradigm. He called it Aloha. With Aloha, there were no
guarantees.<BR>

AlohaNet was a packet radio system used for data communications among the
Hawaiian Islands. Packets are collections of bits led by a header, which
is a smaller collection of bits, bearing an address; they proceed through
a communications system rather like envelopes through a postal system. The
key feature of AlohaNet was that anyone could send packets to anyone else
at any time. You just began transmitting. If you didn't get an acknowledgment
back, you knew the message had failed to get through. Presumably your packets
had collided with others. In Metcalfe's words, &quot;They were lost in the
ether.&quot; At that point, you would simply wait a random period (to avoid
a repeat collision as both parties returned to the channel at once). Then
you would retransmit your message.<BR>
<BR>
To Metcalfe, AlohaNet seemed a beautifully simple network. But Abramson
showed that, because of collisions and other problems, it could exploit
only 17 percent of its potential capacity. A student of computer science
searching for thesis ideas, Metcalfe believed that by using a form of advanced
mathematics called queuing theory he could drastically improve the performance
of AlohaNet without damaging its essential elegance and simplicity. What
Metcalfe, then a graduate student at Harvard, eventually discovered would
bring such networks up toward 90 percent of capacity and make the Aloha
concept a serious threat to the entire structure of the public network pyramid.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe's discovery is known as Ethernet. Twenty years later, Ethernet
is the world's dominant local area network and, at 47, Metcalfe is known
and celebrated as its inventor. He was also founder in 1981 of 3Com Corp.
of Santa Clara, Calif., the leading producer of Ethernet adapter cards and
a major communications products company. In this era of networking, he is
the author of what I will call Metcalfe's law of the telecosm, showing the
magic of interconnections: connect any number, &quot;n,&quot; of machines
- whether computers, phones or even cars - and you get &quot;n&quot; squared
potential value. Think of phones without networks or cars without roads.
Conversely, imagine the benefits of linking up tens of millions of computers
and sense the exponential power of the telecosm.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, the power of the telecosm reproduces on a larger scale - by interconnecting
computers - the exponential yield of the microcosm, a law describing the
near magical effect of interconnecting transistors on chips of silicon:
As increasing numbers of transistors are packed ever closer together, the
transistors run faster, cooler, cheaper and better. Metcalfe's law suggests
that a similar spiral of gains is available in the telecosm of computer
communications.<BR>
<BR>
Already the world economy is beginning to reap these gains. Ethernet now
links more than half of the world's 40 million networked computers, extending
Metcalfe's paradigm and his law. Indeed, the law would suggest that in addition
to his some $20 million of personal net worth from 3Com, Metcalfe's concept
has fostered scores of billions of dollars in global wealth. Led by Novell
Inc., with an equity capitalization of more than $8 billion, the top 15
publicly traded computer networking companies have a total market value
of some $22 billion. Add to that sum the productivity value derived from
the world's 100 million computers as they are increasingly linked in networks,
and you may sense the power of the Metcalfe paradigm.<BR>
<BR>
Today, 20 years after Metcalfe conceived it at Xerox's Palo Alto Research
Center, Ethernet is still gathering momentum, gaining market share and generating
innovations. Between 1989 and 1993, the percentage of America's computers
on LANs rose from less than 10 to more than 60, and most of these gains
were in Ethernets.

Ether Moves to Cable
</B></PRE>
The telecosm's powers could end up saving the American economy from itself.
In an era when the new payroll taxes and regulations of Clintonomics could
end up driving millions of mind workers back into their homes, Digital Equipment
Corp. is now extending Ethernet's range from its current two-mile limit
to some 70 miles. Called Channelworks, the DEC system can run Ethernet on
the some 50 million miles of cable television coax. This will enable potential
scores of millions of telecommuters to access their familiar office LAN,
tap their company E-mail and their corporate databases, and generally make
themselves feel at work while at home. Deployed at a profit and extended
to customers at a flat monthly rate, Ethernet in the neighborhood could
become a massive growth business for the cable industry over the next decade.<BR>
<BR>
As Ethernet spreads and faces the challenge of remote work teams using digital
images, simulations, maps, computer-assisted design schematics, visualizations,
high-fidelity sounds and other exotic forms of data, the system is constantly
adapting. From 3Com spin-offs Grand Junction Networks and LAN Media Corp.
to smart hubmaker David Systems, from Kalpana to Synernetics, from National
Semiconductor to Hewlett Packard, from Cabletron to SynOptics, from AT&T even
to Token Ring leader IBM, scores of companies are pushing Ethernet into
new functions and performance levels. It is emerging in full-duplex, multimedia,
fast, fiber- optic, shielded, unshielded, twisted, thin, thick, hubbed,
collapsed, vertebrate, invertebrate, baseband, broadband, pair, quartet,
coaxial and wireless versions. It now can run at 2.9, 10, 20 and 100 megabits
per second. It has moved from 2.9 megabits per second to 100 megabits per
second and from a few hundred to several million users in some 10 years.
At its present pace of progress, Ethernet will someday run isochronous (real-time)
gigabits per second on linguine.

Aloha ATM, Gushing Cash
</B></PRE>
So why is its boyish-looking inventor - over Metcalfe's anguished protests,
think of Ted Kennedy some 10 years ago - giving up on his baby just as it
enters its roaring 20s? Why is he ready to abandon his basic paradigm in
favor of a return to the public network vision of massive, intelligent switching
systems? Why is he now talking of Ethernet as a &quot;legacy LAN&quot;?<BR>
<BR>
Discoursing this summer from a deck chair on his yacht (a converted lobster
boat) as he breezed down from his Maine retreat to a dock on the Charles
River for his 25th MIT reunion, Metcalfe has the air of an elder statesman.
Though humbly grateful for the benisons of Ethernet, he has seen the future
in a poll of experts prophesying the universal triumph of a powerful new
switching system called asynchronous transfer mode (ATM). &quot;I have found,&quot;
Metcalfe solemnly intones, &quot;an amazing consensus among both telephone
industry and computer networking experts that ATM is the future of LANs.&quot;
Aloha, ATM.<BR>
<BR>
Metcalfe is not alone among Ethernet pioneers flocking back to Ma Bell's
pyramid of switches. Also leaving Ethernet behind is his onetime nemesis,
Leonard Kleinrock of UCLA, a leading guru of gigabit networks who helped
define the mathematical limits of Ethernet, and is given credit (or is it
blame?) for naming its Carrier Sense Multiple Access/Collision Detection
protocol (CSMA/CD). Preparing to defect to ATM is Ronald Schmidt, the brilliantly
ebullient technical director of SynOptics, who created the latest Ethernet
rage - sending the signals over telephone wire under the 10baseT standard
(10 megabits of baseband data over twisted pair).<BR>
<BR>
There has not been such a stampede to a new standard since the global rush
to ISDN (Integrated Services Digital Network) in the early 1980s. Offering
digital phone lines at 144 kilobits per second, ISDN is just now coming
on-line in time to be aced by the megabits per second of Ethernet over cable.<BR>
<BR>
In a prophetic memo launching the concept in 1973, Metcalfe foreshadowed
the secret of Ethernet's success. He wrote: &quot;While we may end up using
coaxial cable trees to carry our broadcast transmissions, it seems wise
to talk in terms of an ether, rather than `the cable'.... Who knows what
other media will prove better than cable for a broadcast network: maybe
radio or telephone circuits, or power wiring, or frequency-multiplexed cable
TV or microwave environments, or even combinations thereof. The essential
feature of our medium - the ether - is that it carries transmissions, propagates
bits to all stations.&quot; In other words, it is the stations, rather than
the network, that have to sort out and &quot;switch&quot; the messages.<BR>
<BR>
The word Ethernet may be capitalized to signify the official standard of
CSMA/CD. Or it may be lowercased to suggest a medium without switches, routers
and other intelligence. In either case, the word &quot;ether&quot; conveys
the essence of the ethernet. An ether is a passive, omnipresent, homogeneous
medium. Long believed essential for the propagation of electromagnetic waves,
the literal existence of an ether was disproven in the late 19th century
by the famous experiments of Albert Michelson and Edward Morley. But the
concept of a figurative ether - a dumb medium of propagation - survives
in modern communications.<BR>
<BR>
The enduring magic of ethernets stems from the law of the microcosm, favoring
distributed terminals over centralized hierarchies, peer networks of PCs
over mainframe pyramids. The microcosm's relentless price/performance gains
on chips have endowed Metcalfe's peer-to-peer scheme with ever more powerful
peers, at ever lower prices. Medium-independent from the outset, the Metcalfe
systems do not require central switching. In an ethernet system the intelligence
is entirely in the terminals, not in the network itself, and most of the
bandwidth is local (where some 80 percent of traffic resides).<BR>
<BR>
Although this ATM is expected to gush jackpots of cash for gaggles of network
companies and investors, it is unrelated to its acronymic twin, automatic
teller machines. Think of ATM rather as an automated postal center that
takes messages (of any size or addressing scheme), chops them up, puts them
into standardized little envelopes and figures the best routes to their
destinations in billionths of a second. The magic of ATM comes from restricting
its services to those uniform envelopes (called cells) of 53 bytes apiece
(including a five-byte address) and creating for each envelope what is called
a virtual circuit through the network. These features make it unnecessary
for intermediate switches in the network to check the address; the cell
flashes through the system on a precomputed course.<BR>
<BR>
A compromise defined by phone companies as the longest packet size that
can handle voice in real time, 53-byte cells are also short enough to be
entirely routed and switched in cheap hardware; i.e., microchips. This means
that the ATM postal center can function at speeds of up to 155 megabits
per second or even higher. Perhaps most attractive of all, ATM can handle
multimedia data, such as digital movies or teleconferences, with voice,
text and video that must arrive together at the same time in perfect sync.
As the world moves toward multimedia, the industry is flocking toward ATM,
the innovation that can make it possible. 
<PRE><B>


Ethernet: A Legacy LAN?
</B></PRE>
By contrast, Ethernet seems old and slow: the vacuum tube of computer communications.
Think of it, crudely, as a system where all the messages are cast into the
ocean and picked up by terminals on the beach which scan the tides for letters
addressed to them. Obviously, this system would work only if the beach terminals
could suck up and filter tremendous quantities of sea water. The magic of
ethernet comes from the ever growing power of computer terminals. The microcosm
supplies sufficiently powerful filtering chips - chiefly digital signal
processors improving their powers some tenfold every two years - to sort
mail and messages in the vasty deep. This is quite a trick. To the experts,
it seems unlikely to prevail for long against the fabulously swift switching
of ATM.<BR>
<BR>
True, there is some confusion about just how, where and when this miracle
cure will arrive. The industry's leading intellectual, Robert Lucky of Bellcore
- a paragon of long- distance networks - predicts that ATM will come first
in local area networks, while Metcalfe, of local area network fame, thinks
it will come first in wide area networks. James Chiddix of Time- Warner
Cable is probably right in predicting digital cable pay- per-view as the
first big ATM customer, using it for broadcasting films in his 500-channel
digital cable TV project in Orlando. But most experts agree that one way
or another ATM will blow away Ethernet during the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, as usual, conventional wisdom is wrong. Ethernet is quietly
preparing for a new era of hegemony in the marketplace for computer connections.<BR>
<BR>
The reason Ethernet prevailed in the first place is that, in the words of
Ronald Schmidt, &quot;it was incredibly simple and elegant and robust.&quot;
In other words, it is cheap and simple for the user. Customers can preserve
their installed base of equipment while the network companies innovate with
new transmission media. When the network moves to new kinds of copper wires
or from one mode of fiber optics to another, Ethernet still looks essentially
the same to the computers attached to it. Most of the processing - connecting
the user to the network, sensing a carrier frequency on the wire and detecting
collisions - can be done on one Ethernet controller chip that costs a few
dollars.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe described the conception of this technology in 1981, &quot;I
explored the advantages of moving the transceiver down out of the ceiling
onto the adapter board in the host computer. I had seen many actual Ethernet
installations in which our brick transceivers were not up in the ceiling
tapping into the ether cable, as they were supposed to be...but instead
were on floors behind computers, dropped in the centers of neatly coiled
transceiver cables.... We were discovering that the people buying personal
computers and workstations in those days were not generally the same kind
of people who were allowed to remove ceiling tiles and string cables through
conduits.... The personal computer revolution was taking place in organizations
from the bottom up.... It was time for Ethernet to be re- invented for bottom-up
proliferation among the personal computer work group revolutionaries.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Using &quot;silicon compiler&quot; design tools to radically reduce the
time to market, Seeq Technology created an Ethernet chip for PCs in time
for a single-board version of the interface unit. Putting the transceiver
on the adapter board eliminated a special transceiver cable and drastically
simplified the system. There is no bulky connection between the coding device
preparing information for the network and the transceiver sending or receiving
the signals on the net. All this processing is done in the computer, on
one printed circuit board, now reduced to the size of a credit card. While
its rival from IBM - Token Ring - requires a mostly proprietary array of
token-passing managers, clocking assignments and other complexities, Ethernet
is an open system. Relative to the alternatives, it offers the possibility
of something near plug-and-play. So advantaged, Ethernet has overcome IBM's
Token Ring, 20 million nodes to 8 million in installed base.<BR>
<BR>
But this does not persuade Ethernet pioneers Bob Metcalfe, Leonard Kleinrock
and Ronald Schmidt. Because ATM can handle all kinds of data fast, Metcalfe
sees it as the &quot;grand unifier&quot; bringing together WANs and LANs
and effecting a convergence of television, telephony and computing in turbulent
multimedia bit streams bursting into our lives early next century. &quot;And
of all the variations of multimedia,&quot; he writes in Infoworld - Metcalfe
is now its publisher - &quot;the one that will drive ATM is personal computer
video conferencing - interactive, two-way, real-time, integrated digital
voice, video and data.&quot; Although Ethernet will persist as a &quot;legacy
LAN,&quot; he says, it cannot compete with ATM in these crucial new roles.
Schmidt makes the same essential case, stressing the need for switch-based
architectures in a world of exotic new media. 
<PRE>
<B>

Kleinrock's Formula
</B></PRE>
Why the pessimism on Ethernet? Bringing mathematics to bear on the argument,
Kleinrock declares that the collision-detecting functions of Ethernet bog
down with large bandwidths, short packets and long distances. Thus, the
system must fail with the onset of fiber highways across the land. The oceans
of Ethernet will simply grow too large to allow efficient detection of collisions
in its depths. With large bandwidths, more packets can be pumped into the
wire or glass before a collision is detected; by that time, most of the
transmission is finished. When the distances get too long, collisions can
occur far from the transmitting computer and take longer to be detected.
The shorter the packets, the worse these problems become.<BR>
<BR>
As Kleinrock computes these factors, the efficiency of Ethernet is roughly
a function (a), computed as five times the length of the line in kilometers
times the capacity of the system in megabits per second, divided by the
packet size in bits. When a exceeds a certain level (Kleinrock sets it at
0.05), Ethernet's efficiency plummets.<BR>
<BR>
With ATM packet sizes needed for voice traffic - or even at the minimum
Ethernet packet size of 72 bytes - any Ethernet with a capacity much higher
than 10 megabits per second exceeds this tipping point. Therefore, high-speed
Ethernets must either use packets too long for voice or shrink in extent
to far less than three kilometers. This is what Howard Charney's Grand Junction
and its rival LAN Media propose with Fast Ethernet. Noticing that 10baseT
hubs have reduced the length of Ethernet connections by a factor of 10,
Ron Crane, founder of LAN Media, suggests that this change allows acceleration
of the system by an equal amount: to 100 megabits per second.<BR>
<BR>
But this seems a one-time fix that fails to address the multigigabit world
of fiber optics. At some point, Kleinrock, Schmidt and Metcalfe agree, ad
hoc fixes will begin to fail and ATM (or possibly some other system) will
begin to prevail. Using Kleinrock's formula, that point is here today, with
100-megabit- per-second Ethernet lines.<BR>
<BR>
As an increasing share of network traffic takes the form of pictures, sounds,
simulations, three-dimensional visualizations, collaborative work sessions,
video teleconferences and high- resolution medical images, the Ethernet
model already seems to be foundering, according to many expert projections.
The triumph of ATM, so it would seem, is just a matter of time.<BR>
<BR>
Time, however, is precisely what is absent from all these projections. Ethernet
is a system based on the intelligence of terminals; ATM is a system based
on the intelligence of switches and networks. All the arguments for ATM
miss the law of the microcosm: the near annual doubling of chip densities,
the spiraling increase of computer power surging on the fringes of all networks
as transistor sizes plummet over the next decade. 
<PRE>
<B>

The Power of Exponents
</B></PRE>
Amazingly, most technology prophets fail to come to terms with the power
of exponents. You double anything annually for long - whether deforestation
in ecological nightmares or transistors on silicon in the awesome routine
of microchip progress - and you soon can ignite a sudden moment of metamorphosis:
a denuded world or a silicon brain.<BR>
<BR>
Shortly after the year 2000, semiconductor companies will begin manufacturing
microchips with more than a billion transistors on them - first as memories,
and soon after as processors. A billion transistors could accommodate the
central processing units of 1,000 Sun workstations or 16 Cray supercomputers.
This means roughly a millionfold rise in the cost-effectiveness of computing
hardware over the next decade or so.<BR>
<BR>
Intelligence in terminals is a substitute for intelligence in networks;
switching and routing functions migrate from the center of the web to the
increasingly powerful computers on its fringe. Looming intelligence on the
edge of the network will relieve all the current problems attributed to
ethernets and will render the neatly calculated optimizations of ATM irrelevant.<BR>
<BR>
Meanwhile, the law of the telecosm is launching a similar spiral of performance
in transmission media, ultimately increasing their bandwidth, also by a
factor of millions. Bandwidth is a replacement for switches. If you can
put enough detailed addressing, routing, prioritization and other information
on the packets, you don't have to worry about channeling the data through
ATM switches. The emergence of dumb, passive all-optical networks with bandwidths
some ten- thousandfold larger than existing fiber optics will obviate much
of the pressure on switches. Combining microcosm and telecosm in explosive
convergence makes it nothing short of ridiculous to expect a system optimized
for 1995 chip densities and fiber capacities to remain optimal in 2013,
when Metcalfe foresees the final triumph of ATM, or even in 2001.<BR>
<BR>
Of course, ATM will be useful in various applications before then. Sun and
SynOptics envisage putting ATM ports in future workstations where ISDN ports
mostly languish today. AT&amp;T, MCI, Sprint and Wiltel will incorporate
ATM switches in their long- distance networks. Time-Warner may indeed use
them for distributing movies. In general, however, companies that rely on
an apparent trend toward centralized switches will be disappointed.<BR>
<BR>
Cable firms will do better by sticking to the ethernet paradigm of dumb
bandwidth that has made them the envy of all in the emerging era of digital
video. IBM and other computer firms with powerful ethernet and fiber technologies
should not rush to adopt the public network paradigm. Telephone companies
in particular should maintain an acute interest in their ongoing experiments
with all-optical networks and other passive optical technologies. Any near-term
successes of ATM, afflicted with the many glitches and growing pains of
any new technology, are likely to come too slowly to deflect the continuing
onrush of ethernets.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet prevails because it is dumb. In the old world of dumb terminals
- whether phones, IBM displays or boob tubes - a network had to be smart.
There was time even to put human operators into the loop, and a need to
concentrate programming at one central location. But in the emerging world
of supercomputers in your pocket or living room, networks will have to be
dumb bandwidth pipes. What the coming array of desktop supercomputers and
cheap massively parallel servers will need is passive dark fiber, mostly
unlit by switching intelligence. Dark fiber can allow for the huge variety
of data forms and functions, protocols and modulation schemes that is emerging
in the new era of convergence between phones and computers.<BR>
<BR>
Ethernet is the protocol for a dumb pipe, a passive ether. That is why it
fits so well on a cable TV line and why it will fit even into the multigigabit
world of a multimedia future. 
<PRE><B>


The Return of Aloha
</B></PRE>
The dumb networks of the fibersphere will be ethernets. These all-optical
links that have been made possible by the creation of erbium-doped amplifiers
and other passive devices give access to the full 25,000-gigahertz bandwidth
of fiber optics (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; December 7, 1992).
In these networks, fiber changes from a substitute for copper to a substitute
for air. Just as the microcosm put entire computer systems on single slivers
of silicon, the telecosm will put entire communications systems on seamless
webs of silica. Terminals will tune into the infrared colors of the fibersphere
like radios tuning into the frequencies of AM or FM.<BR>
<BR>
As chips and fiber are hugely expanding their performance and bandwidth,
information traffic is rapidly migrating from the wires to the air. Although
many experts contend that the radio frequencies in the air - the electromagnetic
spectrum - are running out, communications systems now use only a tiny sliver
of spectrum, well under one percent of the usable span. As shown by Cellular
Vision's success in sending cable TV signals over the air at 28 gigahertz,
it is now possible to move up the spectrum into the vast domains of microwaves;
other experiments show that network traffic in these portions of the spectrum
can be accommodated with error rates of less than one in a billion, enough
to avoid extensive error correcting.<BR>
<BR>
At the same time, the replacement of today's 30-mile cells with tomorrow's
closely packed microcells means an exponential rise in available spectrum
and an exponential reduction in power usage. The replacement of analog systems
with digital systems using code division multiple access (CDMA) will allow
the reuse of all frequencies in every cell, thus further expanding available
spectrum (see &quot;New Rules of Wireless,&quot; March 29, 1993). A company
called ArrayCom in Santa Clara, Calif., is developing a new system, called
spatial division multiple access (SDMA), based on smart antennas that can
follow an individual communicator as it moves through a cell. This technology
would allow the use of all the available spectrum by each &quot;phone.&quot;
<PRE>
<B>

Back to the Real &quot;Ether&quot; Net
</B></PRE>
Inspired by a radio network, ethernet is well adapted for this new world
of wireless. The increasing movement of data communications into the air
- the real ether - will give new life to Metcalfe's media-independent system.
Cellular systems already operate with protocols similar to CSMA/CD. As microcells
fill up with digital wireless traffic, all networks will increasingly resemble
the most popular computer networks. In the ether, links will resemble ethernets
far more than ATMs.<BR>
<BR>
The coming age of bandwidth abundance in glass and in air converges with
an era of supercomputer powers in the sand of microchips. We should build
our systems of the future - the cathedrals of the Information Age - on this
foundation of sand. It will not disappoint us.<BR>
<BR>
Whether in glass or in air, the basic protection of Ethernet is not smarts
but statistics. Ethernet is a probabilistic system. This fact has caused
endless confusion. Because a probabilistic system cannot guarantee delivery
of data on a specific schedule, or at all, many experts have concluded that
Ethernet is unsuited for critical functions, or for isochronous data inherent
in multimedia - with voice and video that must arrive in real time. When
and whether anything arrives is a stochastic matter.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, if there is enough bandwidth for the application, ethernets
work just as reliably and well as their deterministic rivals, even for advanced
video traffic. As Kleinrock observes, for many image applications, very
long packets can be as effective as very short ones. The long packets become
a virtual circuit connection, somewhat like a phone call. It is likely that
perhaps 80 percent of all multimedia will be sent in burst mode, with a
store-and-forward protocol, rather than isochronously in real time. Broadband
ethernets will be better for burst mode than ATM's short packets.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, the combination of intelligence at the terminals and statistics
in the network is more robust than the mechanistic reliability of Token
Rings or ATM switches. As Metcalfe points out in explaining the triumph
of his vision over Token Ring, Ethernet is a simple system that is stabilized
by its own failures. The CSMA/CD algorithm uses collision detection in a
negative feedback loop that delays retransmission in exponential proportion
to the number of collisions, which is a reliable index of the level of traffic.
Thus thriving on a worst- case assumption of frequent failure, Ethernet
has outpaced all rivals that guarantee perfect performance and depend on
it. 
<PRE><B>


Metcalfe's Law: Transcending His Own Doubts
</B></PRE>
Now, in ATM, Ethernet is faced with a new paragon of determinism offering
high speeds and rigorous guarantees, a new version of the public network
paradigm, a new pyramid of switching power. But Metcalfe's law and legacy
may well win again, in spite of his own defection.<BR>
<BR>
As Metcalfe explains, &quot;Ethernet works in practice but not in theory.&quot;
The same could be said of all the devices of the microcosm and telecosm.
Both of the supreme sciences that sustain computer and communications technology
- quantum theory and information theory - are based on probabilistic rather
than deterministic models. They offer the underpinnings for an age of individual
freedom and entrepreneurial creativity.<BR>
<BR>
Humankind's constant search for deterministic assurance defies the ascendant
science of the era, which finds nature itself as probabilistic. To Einstein's
disappointment, God apparently does throw dice. But chance is the measure
of human ignorance and the mark of divine knowledge. Chance thus is the
paradoxical root of both fate and freedom.<BR>
<BR>
Nations and networks can win by shunning determinism and finding stability
in a constant shuffle of collisions and contentions in ever expanding arenas
of liberty.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an acceptance of setbacks, capitalist markets are more robust
than socialist systems that plan for perfection. In the same way, successful
people and companies have more failures than failures do. The successes
use their faults and collisions as sources of new knowledge. Companies that
try to banish chance by relying on market research and focus groups do less
well than companies that freely make mistakes and learn from them.<BR>
<BR>
Because of an ability to absorb shocks, stochastic systems in general are
more stable than deterministic ones. Listening to the technology, we find
that ethernets resonate to the deepest hymns and harmonies of our age.

<HR>In the spring of 1989 when Michael Bookey first visited the Middle School
in Issaquah, Wash., to help the school system with its computers, he was
reminded of his early ventures into Communist China. After 20 years of working
with computer networks, to enter Issaquah seemed to me like encountering
an exotic tribe of primitives untouched by the modern world.<BR>
<BR>
The only sign of modern technology was a forlorn computer room full of Radio
Shack TRS-80 machines, most of which had broken down. Then he learned that
as a remedy for this problem, the district had recently voted a levy of
$2.7 million for outlays on high technology.<BR>
<BR>
Lacking any better ideas, the school system had decided to distribute the
money equally among the teachers, to spend as they wanted. What they wanted
turned out to be VCRs, incompatible CD- ROM drives and a random selection
of computers, printers and other gear to be scattered through the schools
under the influence of a flock of computer salespeople attracted to the
site by the pool of mandated money.<BR>
<BR>
To Bookey, this remedy seemed worse than the disease. It meant that the
bulk of the money would be wasted, further estranging both taxpayers and
students from the most powerful technologies of their era. Bookey wanted
school officials to know that the most powerful technology is not computers,
but computers joined in networks.<BR>
<BR>
Explaining the magic of networks, Bookey asks you to imagine a car plumped
down in the jungle. Checking it out, you might find it a very useful piece
of equipment indeed. A multipurpose wonder, it would supply lights, bedding,
radio communications, tape player, heat, air conditioning, a shield against
arrows and bullets, and a loud horn to frighten away fierce animals. In
awe of the features of this machine, you might never realize that the real
magic of a car comes in conjunction with asphalt.<BR>
<BR>
For the first 10 years of the personal computer era, according to Bookey,
we have used our computers like cars in the jungle. We have plumbed their
powers for processing words and numbers. All too often, home computers have
ended up in the closet unused. We have often failed to recognize that most
of the magic of computing stems from the exponential benefits of interconnection.<BR>
<BR>
In the microcosm, the interconnections come on individual chips, as ever
smaller transistors crammed ever closer together work faster, cooler and
cheaper, enhancing both the capability and the speed of the processor. The
microcosm strewed some 100 million personal computers around the world and
endowed individuals at workstations with the creative power of factory owners
of the Industrial Age.<BR>
<BR>
Just as the microcosm generates exponential gains from increasing connections
on chips, the telecosm generates exponential gains by increasing connections
between chips, powerful microcomputers in themselves. These links between
increasingly potent microchips will soon dominate the world of communications.<BR>
<BR>
The networking industry therefore faces a drastic transition from a people-to-people
regime to computer-to-computer. This change is so radical that it resembles
a mutation that creates a new species. People communicate in domains of
time and space entirely alien to the world of computers. To a person, a
one- second delay on a voice line seems hardly noticeable; to a computer,
one second may mean a billion computations that would take hundreds of human
lifetimes to accomplish by hand.<BR>
<BR>
Most important, people can transmit or receive only a small stream of information
at a time. They want relatively narrow bandwidth connections for a relatively
long period, a 64-kilobit- per-second voice link, for example, for a 10-minute
phone call.<BR>
<BR>
Computers, on the other hand, can handle hundreds of millions or even billions
of bits a second. They often need many millions of bits of bandwidth for
a short time fractions of seconds. As industry shifts from a human scale
of time and space to a computer scale, the systems and structures in existing
telephone and broadcast networks become almost irrelevant. Essentially,
all other forms of networks: voice, text, video and sound, are rapidly giving
way to various new forms of multimedia computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Driving this overwhelming force of change is the alchemy of interconnections,
working in the telecosm with the same logic and feedback loops as connections
in the microcosm. hile dumb terminals such as phones and TVs use up bandwidth
without giving anything back, computers are contributors to bandwidth, not
consumers of it.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the more computers, the more bandwidth. Not only is the network
a resource for each new computer attached to it, but each new computer is
also a resource for the network. Each new computer expands the potential
switching and processing capacity of the system by a large multiple of the
increasing demands it makes on other switches and processors.<BR>
<BR>
As ever more powerful computers are linked ever more closely, whether in
digital cellular microcells or in webs of fiber and coaxial cable, usable
bandwidth expands explosively. Governing the expansion of networks, the
law of the telecosm is just as potent as the law of the microcosm. Indeed,
in enhancing the productivity of organizations, the telecosm consummates
the microcosmic miracle.

Microsoft Windows for Jungle Cars</B></PRE>
The creator in the early 1970s of what may have been the world's first fully
functioning system of corporate electronic mail, Bookey was quick to foresee
this radical shift from person- to-person to computer-to-computer communications.
Pursuing his vision of networks, Bookey in 1982 spurned a possible job at
Microsoft on the grounds that the company was outfitting cars for the jungle,
a decision that probably cost him several million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Instead, he joined Seafirst Bank in Seattle, where he made history (in the
form of a reference in John Sculley's autobiography, Odyssey) by pushing
the purchase of a thousand Macintosh computers for bank networks at a crucial
time for Apple.<BR>
<BR>
In 1986 Bookey left the bank to join Doelz Co., a startup in Irvine, Calif.,
that built advanced computer network equipment that he had used at Seafirst.
For Doelz, Bookey designed software and spearheaded marketing. A so-called
cell-based network, the Doelz system broke up a stream of data into short,
equal-sized packets, each with its own address, to be sent through the nodes
of the net in nanoseconds, like letters accelerated a trillionfold through
the branches of the post office.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey was not necessarily wrong in choosing this technology over Microsoft's.
In the form of asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) systems, this essential
approach, based on short, uniform packets that can be switched at gigabit
speeds in hardware, is now the rage of planners in the computer networking
industry.<BR>
<BR>
ATM is seen as the crucial enabler for digital networks combining voice,
data and video in so-called multimedia applications. Bill Gates now calls
multimedia the future of his industry. Although many observers still see
ATM as a futuristic technology, Bookey believes its future is nearly now.
From the humblest personal digital phone to the most advanced supercomputer,
computer-to-computer links will dominate the entire universe of telecommunications,
and ATM will dominate network switching.<BR>
<BR>
Doelz, however, was ahead of its time and failed to survive a tangled legal
imbroglio with AT&T in 1988. So Bookey took a big profit on his California
residence and returned with his wife Robin and daughter Erin to Seattle,
where he had grown up and set records in the mile on the track at the University
of Washington. He bought his dream house on the top of Cougar Mountain in
Issaquah, with a view of the very Twin Peaks made famous in the television
series and put out his shingle as a network consultant under the name Digital
Network Architects (DNA). Almost as an afterthought, the Bookeys sent Erin
to Issaquah Middle School.<BR>
<BR>
Having designed networks around the world, Bookey had often seen their powerful
impact on business organizations, such as banks. Bookey believed that networks
could have a similar revitalizing impact on schools. Like banks, schools
are essentially information systems that have brought their Industrial Age
hierarchy into the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
Creating networks in schools, however, posed many special problems. Most
school systems, like Issaquah, were largely unaccustomed to managing technology.
The system would need to create a large MIS (management information services)
organization just to keep the network functioning. Then, as the teachers
at Issaquah hastened to point out to Bookey, there was the problem of students.
Impulsive, mischievous and messy, they in no way resembled the disciplined
employees of a corporation. Speaking from grim experience, some of the teachers
told Bookey that his network plans would succeed only if the computers were
reserved exclusively for teachers and if students were barred entirely.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey, however, thought there had to be a way to bring the magic of networks
to America's increasingly troubled school systems. The secret would be to
recognize that, just as computers are not consumers of but contributors
to bandwidth, students should be seen not as a problem, but as a precious
resource in launching the networks that inform the Information Age.

Networks as Productivity Engines</B></PRE>
Ever since Adam Smith first maintained that the division of labor, the spread
of specialization, is the catalyst of the wealth of nations, economists
have seen the breakdown of functions into subfunctions and specialties as
the driver of efficiency and growth. The key force expanding specialization
in the contemporary capitalist economy is networks. Indeed, networks, by
their nature and purpose, refine the division of labor.<BR>
<BR>
In the financial industry, for example, networks allowed the proliferation
of specialized institutions. In the ever-shifting kaleidoscopes of American
finance, some institutions went local, some global. Some managed car loans,
credit cards or other consumer services; some handled mortgages, mutual
funds or real estate trusts; still others stressed computer leases, junk
bonds, venture capital or large corporate accounts.<BR>
<BR>
The pell-mell fragmentation of American finance during the 1980s into an
ever more refined division of labor enabled the U.S. to lead the world in
levels of capital efficiency, with more economic growth per dollar of savings
than any other country. Each financial business did not have to repeat all
the work of all the rest, and each became more efficient at a particular
task.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey believes that networks can have a similar effect on that other great
information-processing industry: education. Why should every school have
an all-purpose library and a French teacher and a calculus scholar and a
health center and an administrative office? Why should every school have
an entire complement of buildings?<BR>
<BR>
With all the schools on networks, individual schools could specialize in
particular subjects, functions and resources, as financial companies do.
Education would not have to happen exclusively, or even mostly, in schools.
The explosive spread of networks is now the prime mover of the U.S. economy,
allowing all industries to break down into patterns of specialization unbound
by place and time. And now the government wants to get into the act.

Superhighways in the Sky</B></PRE>
Zoom through tax-hike tollgates and glide out onto data superhighways; this
is the new mantra of American industrial policy. Add the further fillip
of investment for educational infrastructure and you can sweep up the ramp
toward the federal treasury and drive out with a bonanza.<BR>
<BR>
In this new era of the big bands, there are now some 10 bills before Congress
to foster vast new networks with large bandwidth, or communications capacity.
Some $2 billion has already been authorized and $765 million appropriated
this year for various programs related to a National Research and Educational
Network (NREN).<BR>
<BR>
Candidate Bill Clinton presented the concept of NREN as Ra national information
network to link every home, business, lab, classroom and library by the
year 2015. President Bill Clinton, vice-president Albert Gore and a raft
of advisors all celebrate the highway as the metaphor for the future information
economy. Gore points out that his father was a leader in building the Interstate
Highway System in the early 1950s; Albert Jr., wants to play a key role
in building the information highways of the 1990s.<BR>
<BR>
Indeed, data superhighways would seem to be the fulfillment of the fibersphere;
the way to create the vast new infrastructure of fiber-optic lines that
will bring the full promise of digital video and multimedia communications
to all citizens.<BR>
<BR>
Why, then, is Mike Bookey so worried? He would seem to be the perfect NREN
champion. Bookey has pursued networks through most of his career and now
is focusing on networks for education. In explaining the importance of computer
connections, he has even long used Gore's favored highway metaphor. Bookey
thinks that the federal superhighwaymen do not grasp the nature of networks
and how they grow. In systems work we have a rule: You design top down,
but you build bottom up.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey sees the creation of networks as an organic process, driven by public
demand, shaped by human needs and rooted in a moral universe of growth through
sharing. It is the experience of building the network that creates the expertise
to maintain and use it. In all these processes, big government is nearly
irrelevant. 
<PRE>


<B>


None of the Above</B></PRE>
For the past 10 years, Washington, D.C. experts have been wringing their
hands over the supposedly unbearable costs of building broadband networks
and the urgent need for large federal funding. Analysts have been ruminating
over the question of who would spearhead the creation of broadband nets;
the phone companies, the cable television companies or the government.<BR>
<BR>
Before any of these forces could act, however, it became clear that the
answer would be none of the above. The hardest part of the job was accomplished,
with astonishing speed, by computer and networking companies. The rest of
the work is well under way, as cable and phone companies adopt the computer
technologies.<BR>
<BR>
As recently as 1989, only seven percent of America's personal computers
were connected to local area networks. By 1991 45 percent were connected,
and by 1993, close to two-thirds were linked to LANs. Growing even faster
than LANs is the internetworking business: the interconnection of existing
local area nets in wide area networks.<BR>
<BR>
Building internetworking gear or accessories, such companies as Cisco Systems,
Cabletron, Wellfleet, 3Com and SynOptics are among the highest flyers in
the technology stock market boom. Cisco, for example, is growing some 50
percent a year and commands a market value of almost $6 billion, comparable
to that of Digital Equipment Corp. Cabletron has hiked its revenues some
16-fold in the last five years.<BR>
<BR>
Most of these connections run at some 10 megabits per second, enough for
high-resolution digital video, but inadequate for the more exotic traffic
in images predicted for use later in the decade. Increasingly, however,
the connections are fiber- optic lines or are broadband coax, which is nearly
as good as fiber for short-distance transport. The potential of fiber is
almost unlimited (see &quot;Into the Fibersphere,&quot; Forbes ASAP, December
7, 1992).<BR>
<BR>
Although moving more slowly than the computer firms, telephone and cable
companies are rushing to lay fiber ever deeper into the nation's neighborhoods.
Spending some $2 billion (as much as NREN), Telecommunications Inc. (TCI)
vows, according to CEO John Malone, to have 90 percent of its subscriber
households served by fiber to the curb by 1995.<BR>
<BR>
Bringing fiber into the local loop at a slower pace, the telephone companies,
led by Bell Atlantic, also are forging ahead with ingenious new ways to
make their twisted-pair copper connections carry as much as six megabits
per second of digital information. Wireless technology is also moving into
the local loop for video delivery (see &quot;The New Rule of Wireless,&quot;
Forbes ASAP, March 29, 1993).<BR>
<BR>
The U.S. networking industry is not in need of fixing. The U.S. currently
commands some three-fourths of all the world's LANs and perhaps 85 percent
of its internetworks. Although Gore and others justify their industrial
policies by referring to the imperious plans of Japan, the U.S. currently
commands about three times the computer power per capita as Japan, some
10 times as many computers attached to networks, and an installed base of
broadband fiber and cable nearly 10 times as large. The remarkable thing
is that the U.S. government is so eager to fix a fabulously flourishing
system that is the envy of the world.<BR>
<BR>
The electronic and photonic networking industries actually resemble highways
in only the most superficial way. The highway construction trade has not
advanced substantially in 50 years. By contrast, the networking trade is
the fastest-moving part of the ever-accelerating computer industry and doubles
its cost- effectiveness every year. Although interconnecting government
laboratories, contractors and supercomputer centers with fiber is desirable,
a massive government network is not. Issaquah offers better guidance for
the future.... But first it will be necessary to deal with the abiding menace
of the student problem. 
<PRE>


<B>


Overcoming the Student Problem</B></PRE>
&quot;What do you think you are doing? Answer me,&quot; the voice insisted
with the I've-got-you-squirming-now confidence of a teacher who has caught
a pupil red-handed.<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just lookin' around,&quot; grumbled Lee Dumas, the red-headed 13-
year-old, trying to sound natural. Glimpsing a telltale red screen of network
management among the array of blue displays used in the keyboarding class,
the teacher had walked up silently behind Dumas as he broke into the student
lists, software programs and grades, and was on the verge of entering the
administrative server.<BR>
<BR>
Dumas was a bad kid. No one at Maywood Middle School (one of the 16 campuses
in Issaquah) doubted that. His teachers called him &quot;obnoxious&quot;
or even &quot;brain-dead.&quot; He set what he believes was an all-time
record at Maywood by being detained after class some 60 times for insubordination.
Using the approved psychobabble, he says, &quot;I had problems with authority.
I couldn't accept teachers ordering me around.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
After being caught breaking into the computer system, Dumas was dragged
up to the principal's office. Neither the teacher nor the principal could
figure out the nature of the crime or judge its seriousness. For help, they
summoned Don Robertson, the administrator assigned to Issaquah's Technology
Information Project (TIP). He considered the situation gravely and recommended
severe punishment. Toward the end of the meeting, however, he turned to
Dumas and said, &quot;With your talent, you should become the sheriff rather
than the outlaw. Why don't you come down and join TIP?&quot; Since no one
had previously detected any talent in Dumas, this comment made a sharp impression.<BR>
<BR>
About a week later, he showed up sheepishly at Robertson's door. To school
administrators, kids like Dumas might be a problem, but to Bookey, Issaquah's
9,000 students seemed a wonderfully cheap resource. By training the students
to build and maintain the networks, he could make the $2.7 million the foundation
of an enduring educational resource.<BR>
<BR>
In the end, the Issaquah network was almost entirely built by students between
the ages of 12 and 17. Using students to solve the problems of network maintenance
and support and thus reduce the real costs by some 80 percent was Mike Bookey's
solution to the perplexing problem of computers in schools.<BR>
<BR>
The first step in the Issaquah networking venture, in the spring of 1990,
cost no money and arose from pure necessity. Just as in businesses across
the country, the initial motive for networking was the arrival of laser
printers from Hewlett Packard. Bookey began by giving his 10-person TIP
team a pile of manuals and having them install a basic network connecting
two PCs, an Apple II and a Macintosh to a laser printer. This step enhanced
the value of all the computers at a small fraction of the cost of buying
new dot-matrix printers for each. Four of the ten students managed to cobble
together the network in about a month. They learned the intricacies of pulling
twisted-pair wiring for 10baseT Ethernet computer connections running at
the standard rate of 10 million bits (megabits) per second.<BR>
<BR>
The next step was to add a hard disk containing school files and software
programs. Using both Apples and IBM PCs, the Issaquah network from the beginning,
had to handle a variety of communications protocols. If the network was
to connect to anything outside itself to the school's administration building
or the school system's libraries, for example, Issaquah would have to install
equipment that could sort out messages from different computers. This meant
Issaquah joined the market for multiprotocol routers. A router is a device
that sits on a computer network and reads the addresses on all the message
packets that pass by. If the address is on another network with a different
protocol, the router creates a new envelope for the packet and sends it
to the other network.<BR>
<BR>
Nonetheless, with all their routers and Ethernet wiring, the Issaquah networks
slowed to a crawl as soon as they had to connect outside a building. There,
they had to depend on what is known as the Public Switched Telephone Network,
where everything turns to analog and drowses down to some 2,400 bits per
second.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey demonstrated that the school could save money on its voice communications
by buying a digital T-1 line that multiplexes 24 phone circuits onto a 1.544-megabit-per-second
system. Since 12 of the 24 circuits would be enough to satisfy the school's
internal voice needs, the rest of the T-1 line, some 760 kilobits per second,
could be devoted to the data communications needs created by the school's
new Ethernets. Thus, while getting a cheaper solution for its voice traffic,
the school increased its data bandwidth by some sevenfold for free.<BR>
<BR>
Once these connections were in place, the students acquired a Microsoft
Mail program to incorporate E-mail in the system. Soon, this became the
heart of the network, with both students and teachers using it constantly
to handle papers, consult teachers in other schools in the system, make
reports to the state and interact with parents and students. E-mail became
so central to the functioning of Issaquah that when the computers were down
teachers would talk of canceling classes.<BR>
<BR>
To E-mail were added connections to Internet, the global research and education
network launched some 33 years ago as DARPA Net (the Pentagon's Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency). Since Internet was civilianized in 1983,
adopting the TCP/IP networking standard, it has been expanding its traffic
at a pace of some 15 percent per month. Between 1981 and 1992 the number
of computers connected to Internet rose from 281 to 1.1 million. Through
Internet, the students could search through a variety of databases for material
for a paper or connect to Japan for help in learning Japanese.<BR>
<BR>
Along with several other Issaquah students, Aaron Woodman, Jr., a burly
boy with his long blonde hair in a ponytail, became so adept at using Internet
that he now gives speeches to national conferences on the subject. The speechmaking
needs that grew out of the Issaquah project have imparted valuable lessons
in English communications for the students.<BR>
<BR>
All these developments did not occur without administrative resistance.
But the administration eventually became a prime beneficiary. Soon, the
computer networks in the Issaquah system were connected by a T-1 line to
the Washington Schools Information Processing Cooperative (WSIPC) 20 miles
north in Redmond, where attendance and other student records were kept for
the entire state.<BR>
<BR>
To make these WSIPC services more readily available to schools across the
state, Bookey proposed the creation of a statewide educational network running
on T-3 lines (45 megabits per second), now known as WEDNET. This provides
links all over Washington, from Shaw Island and Stehekin to Seattle and
Issaquah, with a rogue line down to Portland, Oreg.<BR>
<BR>
As for Lee Dumas, according to his mother, his situation has changed completely,
&quot;both in his attitude toward school and in the school's attitude toward
him.&quot; After joining TIP, Dumas became one of its most active and enthusiastic
members. Last summer, he got a job at the Computer Store in Seattle teaching
the Macintosh HyperCard program to a student body consisting, yes, of public
school teachers. According to Dumas, they had no problem accepting his authority
as a fledgling computer guru.<BR>
<BR>
No longer one of the outlaws, Dumas became an official beta tester for the
new Microsoft DOS 6.0 and Windows NT operating systems, specializing in
their security procedures. Following the path of another student who found
the &quot;Issaquah bug&quot; in Microsoft's LAN Manager program, Dumas believes
he found three or four bugs in NT.<BR>
<BR>
Having just finished his sophomore year, Dumas has gone to work this summer
at Microsoft for the company's network development chief, Brian Valentine,
who regards this once brain- dead punk as a valued employee with high promise
for the future. This student who floundered in the usual educational system
flourished when his individual specialization was discovered. The Issaquah
economy released his energies, just as the national economy releases its
own energies through the specialization and division of labor in computer
networks.<BR>
<BR>
Since there are millions of Lee Dumases in the schools of America, many
of them being given up for lost by analysts such as Labor Secretary Robert
Reich, because they are not adept at the usual curriculum for &quot;symbolic
analysts,&quot; Dumas' redemption by technology bears crucial lessons. The
lessons are Bookey's: Students are a resource, not a rabble; specialized
practical experience is more edifying than most textbook learning; networks
are the critical technology both for economic growth and for educational
renewal.<BR>
<BR>
To these insights should be added Lewis Perelman's view, in his book &quot;School's
Out&quot; (1992, Morrow), that teachers should increasingly abandon their
role as a &quot;sage on the stage&quot; in favor of service as a &quot;guide
on the side,&quot; steering their students through a global cornucopia of
educational resources. 
<PRE>


<B>


Education as a Network Driver</B></PRE>
It may seem peculiar that Bookey, a network guru for large corporations
like U.S. West, should focus his attentions on such problems as interconnecting
school children in Issaquah with libraries in Bellevue, parents on Squaw
Mountain, teachers across town and administrators at the Washington State
Information Processing Cooperative. Yet Bookey believes that the educational
application may well drive the creation of a true national infrastructure
of digital networks.<BR>
<BR>
The networking problems of schools closely resemble the networking problems
of a nation full of diverse systems. To achieve their full promise, school
networks must link computers of many varieties owned by parents, students
and teachers, to administrative servers owned by state and local governments,
to printers, libraries and databases. School networks must connect LANs
to IBM SNA (Systems Network Architecture) links, to a variety of telephone
technologies, from T-1 lines of 1.5 megabits per second to T-3 lines at
45 megabits per second and, soon, to ATM switches and other potential gigabit
systems. In all its dimensions, including an acute financial constraint,
this challenge is altogether as difficult as interconnecting supercomputers
over fiber in an NREN.<BR>
<BR>
Bookey relished this challenge at Issaquah. Advocates of NREN might disparage
Issaquah as a relatively low-grade network. After all, it currently has
no fiber outside of the fiber links in the telephone network that it uses.
Without fiber, the network will not be able to accommodate collaborative
learning in multimedia forms across the country. Bookey demurs. Buying a
fiber-optic network before personal computer technology can manage broadband
flows of data is premature. In five years, fiber-optic links will probably
cost about one-fifth of what they cost today. When the network is needed,
Issaquah will be able to purchase it and, more important, also use it. Moreover,
TCI recently offered to install fiber throughout the Issaquah school system
for nothing as part of its general program of fiber to the curb.<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that big-band technology will come to Issaquah in due course,
with or without NREN money. Critics, of course, will carp that Issaquah
is a special case &quot;a relatively rich community&quot; that could afford
to levy $2.7 million for technology. Yet the Issaquah example is galvanizing
schools across the state of Washington and even in California and Arkansas,
where Bookey and his colleague Mason Conner have been consulting with education
officials. Emulating Issaquah, other districts in Washington have since
raised some $140 million for network ventures. 
<PRE>


<B>


Glass Ceiling for Networks?</B></PRE>
The lesson of Issaquah is that data highways and superhighways, driven by
the convergence of microcosm and telecosm, are indeed emerging in America,
and at an astonishing pace. They already are revitalizing the economy and
society, and are helping to reform the system of education. The only federal
initiatives that will significantly assist the process are lower taxes,
accommodation of Internet growth and use, and further deregulation of telecommunications.
Communication must begin locally, with access to the community. From these
local roots can emerge the great branching systems that can interconnect
an information economy.<BR>
<BR>
By starting from the top, the government risks paving over the pullulating
fabric of networking enterprise with a glass ceiling of expensive and misplaced
fiber. In 1993 an estimated 37 million personal computers will be sold worldwide.
The same forces that impelled the networks of Issaquah will drive the owners
of these new PCs to interconnect them to other networks and will induce
the owners of the networks to link them together.<BR>
<BR>
As the centrifugal force of the microcosm, multiplying and distributing
intelligence through the world, converges with the integrating power of
the telecosm, the exponential miracles of specialization and growth will
gain new momentum. How far can this spiral reach? Internet will soon approach
some interesting limits. According to International Data Group, the number
of users has risen from 9,800 in 1986, all in the United States, to 4.7
million around the world today.<BR>
<BR>
At this pace, Internet will embrace the entire world population by the year
2001. That's one limit. As the system's trunking backbone rises to 45 megabits
per second on T-3 lines and above, the sky is the limit for the amount of
message traffic. In the first month after the enlargement to T-3 lines in
October 1992, usage rose from 3.5 trillion bytes to 4 trillion bytes. All
these networks are dominated by text and still pictures. But the miracles
of Internet and Issaquah are about to be joined with a new miracle of growth
in digital video connections in the local loop. 
<PRE>


<B>


Bombshell from Time-Warner</B></PRE>
How soon can this happen? Advocates of NREN speak of this technology being
consummated in 2015. But to most politicians and businessmen, a projected
date more than five years ahead is essentially a synonym for never-never
land; a way of saying, &quot;Forget about it. I'll be retired.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
The fact is that a widespread system of two-way broadband networks reaching
most American homes, schools and offices is less than five years away. All
U.S. business planners must come to terms with this transforming reality.
Announcements this spring from leading cable, telephone and computer companies;
from TCI and U.S. West to IBM and Silicon Graphics; bring the shape of this
network into clear focus.<BR>
<BR>
Exemplary among plans announced by a variety of firms is Time-Warner's projected
system in Orlando. As described by Jim Chiddix, the company's college-dropout
technical guru, the Time- Warner showcase venture will be a giant client/server
computer network, suggestive of the arrangements now ubiquitous in corporate
computing. The wires will be a combination of fiber to the curb and coax
to the home. Much of the system's hardware and software will be supplied
by computer companies (allegedly including IBM and Silicon Graphics). The
&quot;client&quot; computers will be digitized TVs or teleputers linked
to powerful database computers that use a parallel-processing architecture
to access hierarchical memory systems, from DRAM caches to optical disk
archives. These memories will contain terabytes (trillions of bytes) of
digital video movies, games, educational software and other programming.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the most dramatic breakthrough, though, will come in the switches.
While much of the computer and telephone world continues to dither about
the future of ATM (many consigning it to the pits of 2015), Time-Warner
is committed to installing ATM switches, built by AT&amp;T, beginning next
year in Orlando. The ATM system will allow Time-Warner to offer telephone,
teleputer and multimedia services together, as soon as the regulators allow
it. Chiddix predicts that ATM will soon gravitate to local area networks
and ultimately become ubiquitous.<BR>
<BR>
But the most portentous announcements of all have come from the telephone
companies, who have the most to lose from this cable-oriented network design.
Both U.S. West and Pacific Bell have disclosed that they are adopting a
combination architecture of fiber and coaxial cable closely resembling the
Time-Warner and TCI projects. This unexpected action by two leading Baby
Bells, of turning their backs on their millions of miles of twisted-pair
copper wires shows both the boldness of the new telephone company leadership
and the imperious power of this digital technology.<BR>
<BR>
From all sides the telecommunications and computer industries are converging
on one essential configuration of advanced parallel-processing hardware,
client/server database software and ATM switching. As microcosm and telecosm
converge in the living room, with interactive digital video and supercomputer
image processing, the leading edge of the digital revolution moves from
millions of offices toward billions of homes. Just as Michael Milken, then
of Drexel Burnham Lambert, and the late William McGowan of MCI in 1983 rescued
long-distance fiber optics from the never-never lands of the year 2015 to
which AT&amp;T had consigned it, John Malone of TCI, Gerald M. Levin of
Time-Warner and Richard D. McCormick of U.S. West in 1993 have burst open
the floodgates for fiber and ATM in the local loop.<BR>
<BR>
Again, the force behind this revolutionary development was fierce business
and technical rivalry in the marketplace. In the real world the ruling principle
of network development is not imposed standardization by government but
spontaneous order. It springs from the interplay of human creativity and
entrepreneurship with the inexorable laws of physics and technology.<BR>
<BR>
These dynamics of interconnection in the Information Age will continue well
into the next century. The microcosm will yield chips containing billions
of transistors, equivalent to scores of supercomputers on single slivers
of silicon. The telecosm will yield bandwidth exploding into the terahertz
of all- optical networks and the gigahertz of millimeter waves in the air.<BR>
<BR>
Provided that rulers and regulators do not stifle this spiral of opportunity,
the human spirit &quot;emancipated and thus allowed to reach its rarest
talents and aspirations&quot; will continue to amaze the world with heroic
surprises. The Issaquah miracle of Mike Bookey and Lee Dumas and all the
others, and the continuing miracle of American networks, which was entirely
unexpected by the world, will repeat themselves again and again in new forms
of entrepreneurship and technology.

<HR>At first glance, Vahak Hovnanian, a homebuilding tycoon in New Jersey,
would<B> </B>seem an unlikely sort to be chasing rainbows. Yet in the converging
realms of computers and communications that we call the telecosm, rainbows
are less a matter of hue and weather than they are a metaphor for electromagnetism:
the spectrum of wavelengths and frequencies used to build businesses in
the Information Age.<BR>
<BR>
An Armenian Christian from Iraq, Hovnanian ran a business building high-quality
&quot;affordable&quot; housing. His first coup came on Labor Day in 1958
when, together with his three older brothers, he bought an apparently undesirable
property near the waterfront in Tom's River for $20,000. From this modest
beginning has arisen not only one of the nation's largest homebuilding enterprises
(divided among the four immigrant brothers), but also a shattering breakthrough
on some seemingly bleak frontiers of the electromagnetic spectrum. Together
with maverick inventor Bernard Bossard, Hovnanian has launched a wireless
cellular TV business in frequencies once thought usable only in outer space.<BR>
<BR>
Perhaps the reason Hovnanian feels comfortable today pioneering on the shores
of the telecosm is that some 35 years ago he was an engineer at Philco Semiconductor
following in the theoretical steps of AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories titan William
Shockley. Shockley led the team that plunged into the microcosm of solid-state
physics and invented the transistor. At the heart of all-digital electronics,
this invention still reverberates through the world economy and imposes
its centrifugal rules of enterprise.<BR>
<BR>
This law of the microcosm dictates exponential rises in computer efficiency
as transistors become smaller. It is this law that drives the bulk of the
world's computations to ever- cheaper machines and pushes intelligence from
the center to the fringes of all networks. Today the microcosm is converging
with the telecosm and igniting a new series of industrial shocks and surprises.<BR>
<BR>
The convergence of microcosm and telecosm in an array of multimedia industries
- from personal intelligent communicators to video teleputers to digital
films and publishing - is now the driving force of world economic growth.
John Sculley, chairman and CEO of Apple Computer, has projected that by
2002 there will be a global business in multimedia totaling some $3.5 trillion
- close to the size of the entire U.S. economy in the early 1980s.<BR>
<BR>
This new world of computer communications will break down into two domains
- the fibersphere and the atmosphere. The fibersphere is the domain of all-optical
networks, with both communications power - bandwidth - and error rate improving
by factors in the millions. In &quot;Into the Fibersphere&quot; (Forbes
ASAP, December 7, 1992), we saw that the potential capacity for communications
in the fibersphere is 1,000 times greater than all the currently used frequencies
in the air - and so radically error-free that it mandates an entirely new
model of wired telecommunications. Now we will discover that the atmosphere
will offer links as mobile and ubiquitous as human beings are. It thus will
force the creation of an entirely new model of wireless networks.<BR>
<BR>
In one sense, Sculley's $3 5 trillion dream can be seen as the pot of gold
at the end of Maxwell's rainbow. In 1865, in a visionary coup that the late
Richard Feynman said would leave the American Civil War of the same decade
as a mere &quot;parochial footnote&quot; by comparison, Scottish physicist
James Clerk Maxwell discovered the electromagnetic spectrum. Encompassing
nearly all the technologies imagined by Sculley, Maxwell's rainbow reaches
from the extremely low frequencies (and gigantic wavelengths) used to communicate
with submarines all the way through the frequencies used in radio, television
and cellular phones, on up to the frequencies of infrared used in TV remotes
and fiber optics, and beyond that to visible and ultraviolet light and X-
rays. In a fabulous feat of unification, Maxwell reduced the entire spectrum
to just four equations in vector calculus. He showed that all such radiations
move at the speed of light - in other words, the wavelength times the frequency
equals the speed of light. These equations pulse at the heart of the information
economy today.<BR>
<BR>
Virtually all electromagnetic radiation can bear information, and the higher
the frequencies, the more room they provide for bearing information. As
a practical matter, however, communications engineers have aimed low, thronging
the frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum, comprising far less than
one percent of the total span.<BR>
<BR>
The vast expansion of wireless communications forecast by Sculley, however,
will require the use of higher frequencies far up Maxwell's rainbow. This
means a return to the insights of another great man who walked the halls
of Bell Labs in the late 1940s at the same time as future Nobel laureate
William Shockley, and who left the world transformed in his wake.<BR>
<BR>
In 1948, the same year that Shockley invented the transistor, Claude Shannon
invented the information theory that underlies all modern communications.
At first encounter, information theory is difficult for nonmathematicians,
but computer and telecom executives need focus on only a few key themes.
In defining how much information can be sent down a noisy channel, Shannon
showed that engineers can choose between narrowband high-powered solutions
and broadband low-powered solutions. 
<PRE>


<B>


From Long & Strong to Wide & Weak
</B></PRE>
Assuming that usable bandwidth is scarce and expensive, most wireless engineers
have strived to economize on it. Just as you can get your message through
in a crowded room by talking louder, you can overcome a noisy channel with
more powerful signals. Engineers therefore have pursued a strategy of long
and strong: long wavelengths and powerful transmissions with the scarce
radio frequencies at the bottom of the spectrum.<BR>
<BR>
Economizing on spectrum, scientists created mostly analog systems such as
AM radios and televisions. Using every point on the wave to convey information
and using high power to overcome noise and extend the range of signals,
the long and strong approach seemed hugely more efficient than digital systems
requiring complex manipulation of long strings of on-off bits.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, however, the long and strong policy of economizing on spectrum
led to using it all up. When everyone talks louder, no one can hear very
well. Today, the favored regions at the bottom of the spectrum are so full
of spectrum- hogging radios, pagers, phones, television, long-distance,
point- to-point, aerospace and other uses that heavy-breathing experts speak
of running out of &quot;air.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's theories reveal the way out of this problem. In a counterintuitive
and initially baffling redefinition of the nature of noise in a communications
channel, Shannon showed that a flow of signals conveys information only
to the extent that it provides unexpected data - only to the extent that
it adds to what you already know. Another name for a stream of unexpected
bits is noise. Termed Gaussian, or white, noise, such a transmission resembles
random &quot;white&quot; light, which cloaks the entire rainbow of colors
in a bright blur. Shannon showed that the more a transmission resembles
this form of noise, the more information it can hold.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's alternative to long and strong is wide and weak: not fighting
noise with electrical power but joining it with noiselike information, not
talking louder but talking softer in more elaborate codes using more bandwidth.
For example, in transmitting 40 megabits per second - the requirement for
truly high-resolution images and sounds - Shannon showed some 45 years ago
that using more bandwidth can lower the needed signal-to- noise ratio from
a level of one million to one to a ratio of 30.6 to one. This huge gain
comes merely from increasing the bandwidth of the signal from two megahertz
(millions of cycles per second) to eight megahertz. That means a 33,000-fold
increase in communications efficiency in exchange for just a fourfold increase
in bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Such an explosion of efficiency radically limits the need to waste watts
in order to overcome noise. More communications power comes from less electrical
power. Thus, Shannon shows the way to fulfill Sculley's vision of universal
low-powered wireless communications.<BR>
<BR>
This vision of wide and weak is at the heart of the most promising technologies
of today, from the advanced digital teleputer sets of American HDTV to ubiquitous
mobile phones and computers in so-called personal communications networks
(PCNs). Shannon's theories of the telecosm provide the basic science behind
both Sculley's dream and Hovnanian's video spectrum breakthrough.<BR>
<BR>
Shannon's world, however, is not nirvana, and there is no free lunch. Compensating
for the exponential rise in communications power is an exponential rise
in complexity. Larger bandwidths mean larger, more complex codes and exponentially
rising burdens of computation for the decoding and error-correcting of messages.
In previous decades, handling 40 megabits per second was simply out of the
question with existing computer technology. For the last 30 years, this
electronic bottleneck has blocked the vistas of efficient communication
opened by Shannon's research.<BR>
<BR>
In the 1990s, however, the problem of soaring complexity has met its match
- and then some - in exponential gains of computer efficiency. Not only
has the cost-effectiveness of microchip technology been doubling every 18
months but the pace of advance has been accelerating into the 1990s. Moreover,
the chips central to digital communications - error correction, compression,
coding and decoding - are digital signal processors. As we have seen, the
cost-effectiveness of DSPs has been increasing - in millions of computer
instructions per second (MIPS) per dollar - some tenfold every two years.<BR>
<BR>
This wild rush in DSPs will eventually converge with the precipitous plunge
in price-performance ratios of general-purpose microprocessors. Led by Silicon
Graphics' impending new TFP Cray supercomputer on a chip, Digital Equipment's
Alpha AXP device and Hewlett Packard's Precision Architecture 7100, micros
are moving beyond 100-megahertz clock rates. They are shifting from a regime
of processing 32-bit words at a time to a regime of processing 64-bit words.
This expands the total addressable memory by a factor of four billion. Together
with increasing use of massively parallel DSP architectures, these gains
will keep computers well ahead of the complexity problem in broadband communications.<BR>
<BR>
What this means is that while complexity rises exponentially with bandwidth,
computer efficiencies are rising even faster. The result is to open new
vistas of spectrum in the atmosphere as dramatic as the gains of spectrum
so far achieved in the fibersphere.

Attacking Through the Air
</B></PRE>
Hovnanian's campaign into the spectrum began when a cable company announced
one day in 1985 that under the Cable Act of 1984 and franchise rights granted
by local governments, it had the right to wire one of his housing developments
then under construction. Until that day, Hovnanian's own company could package
cable with his homes through what are called satellite master antenna TV
systems. In essence, each Hovnanian development had its own cable head end
where programs are collected and sent out to subscribers.<BR>
<BR>
When the cable company, now Monmouth Cable Vision, went to court and its
claim was upheld by a judge, Hovnanian sought alternatives. First he flirted
with the idea of having the phone company deliver compressed video to his
homes. In 1986, in the era before FCC Commissioner Alfred Sikes, that was
both illegal and impractical. Then he met Bernard Bossard and decided to
attack through the air. An early pioneer in microchips who had launched
a semiconductor firm and eventually sold it to M/A COM, Bossard was familiar
with both the soaring power of computers and the murky problems of broadband
noise that have long restricted the air to a small number of broadcast AM
TV stations.<BR>
<BR>
Air delivery of cable television programming had long seemed unpromising.
Not only was there too little spectrum available to compete with cable,
but what spectrum there was, was guarded by the FCC and state public utilities
commissions. Nonetheless, in the early 1990s &quot;wireless cable&quot;
did become a niche market, led by Microband Wireless Cable and rivals and
imitators across the land. Using fragments of a frequency band between 2.5
and 2.7 gigahertz (billions of cycles per second), Microband, after some
financial turmoil, now profitably broadcasts some 16 channels to 35,000
New York City homes in line of sight from the top of the Empire State Building.
As long as they are restricted to a possible maximum of 200 megahertz and
use AM, however, wireless firms will not long be able to compete with the
cable industry. Cable companies offer an installed base of potential gigahertz
connections and near universal coverage.<BR>
<BR>
Having spent much of his life working with microwaves for satellites and
the military, Bossard had a better idea. He claimed he could move up the
spectrum and pioneer on frontiers of frequency between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz,
previously used chiefly in outer space. That would mean he could command
in the air some half a million times the communications power, or bandwidth,
of typical copper telephone links, some ten times the bandwidth of existing
wireless cable, some four times the bandwidth of the average cable industry
coaxial connection, and twice the bandwidth of the most advanced cable systems.<BR>
<BR>
The conventional wisdom was that these microwaves (above about 12 gigahertz)
are useless for anything but point-to-point transmissions and are doubtful
even for these. For radio communication, the prevailing folklore preferred
frequencies that are cheap to transmit long distances and that can penetrate
buildings and tunnels, bounce off the ionosphere or scuttle across continents
along the surface of the earth. The higher the frequency, the less it can
perform these feats essential to all broadcasting - and the less it can
be sent long distances at all.<BR>
<BR>
Moreover, it was believed, these millimeter-sized microwaves not only would
fail to penetrate structures and other obstacles but would reflect off them
and off particles in the air in a way that would cause hopeless mazes of
multipath. Multipath would be translated into several images, i.e., ghosts,
on the screen.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, there was the real show-stopper. Everyone knew that these frequencies
are microwaves. The key property of microwaves, as demonstrated in the now
ubiquitous ovens, is absorption by water. Microwaves cook by exciting water
molecules to a boil. Microwave towers are said to kill birds by irradiating
their fluids. Microwave radar systems won't work in the rain. Mention microwaves
as a possible solution to the spectrum shortage, and everyone - from editors
at Forbes to gurus at Microsoft, from cable executives to Bell Labs researchers
- laughs and tells you about the moisture problem.<BR>
<BR>
So it was no surprise that when in 1986 Bossard went to M/A COM and other
companies and financiers with his idea of TV broadcasting at 28 gigahertz,
he was turned down flat. Amid much talk of potential &quot;violations of
the laws of physics,&quot; jokes about broiling pigeons and warnings of
likely resistance from the FCC, he was spurned by all. In fairness to his
detractors, Bossard had no license, patent or prototype at the time. But
these holes in his plan did not deter Vahak Hovnanian and his son Shant
from investing many millions of dollars in the project. It could be the
best investment the Hovnanian tycoons ever made.

New Rule of Radio
</B></PRE>
For 35 years, the wireless communications industry has been inching up the
spectrum, shifting slowly from long and strong wavelengths toward wide and
weak bands of shorter wavelengths. Mobile phone services have moved from
the 1950s radio systems using low FM frequencies near 100 megahertz, to
the 1960s spectrum band of 450 megahertz, to the current cellular band of
900 megahertz accommodating more than 10 million cellular subscribers in
the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1990s, this trend will accelerate sharply. Accommodating hundreds
of millions of users around the world, cellular communications will turn
digital, leap up the spectrum and even move into video. Shannon's laws show
that this will impel vast increases in the cost-effectiveness of communications.<BR>
<BR>
In general, the new rule of radio is the shorter the transmission path,
the better the system. Like transistors on semiconductor chips, transmitters
are more efficient the more closely they are packed together. As Peter Huber
writes in his masterly new book, The Geodesic Network 2, the new regime
favors &quot;geodesic networks,&quot; with radios intimately linked in tiny
microcells. As in the law of the microcosm, the less the space, the more
the room.<BR>
<BR>
This rule turns the conventional wisdom of microwaves upside down. For example,
it is true that microwaves don't travel far in the atmosphere. You don't
want to use them to transmit 50,000 watts of Rush Limbaugh over 10 midwestern
states, but to accommodate 200 million two-way communicators will require
small cells; you don't want the waves to travel far. It is true that microwaves
will not penetrate most buildings and other obstacles, but with lots of
small cells, you don't want the waves to penetrate walls to adjacent offices.<BR>
<BR>
Microwaves require high-power systems to transmit, but only if you want
to send them long distances. Wattage at the receiver drops off in proportion
to the fourth power of the distance from the transmitter. Reducing cell
sizes as you move up the spectrum lowers power needs far more than higher
frequencies increase them. Just as important, mobile systems must be small
and light. The higher the frequency, the smaller the antenna and the lighter
the system can be.<BR>
<BR>
All this high-frequency gear once was prohibitively expensive. Any functions
over two gigahertz require gallium arsenide chips, which are complex and
costly. Yet the cost of gallium arsenide devices is dropping every day as
their market expands. Meanwhile, laboratory teams are now tweaking microwaves
out of silicon. In the world of electronics - where prices drop by a third
with every doubling of accumulated sales - any ubiquitous product will soon
be cheap.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the telecosm dictates that the higher the frequency, the shorter
the wavelength, the wider the bandwidth, the smaller the antenna, the slimmer
the cell and ultimately, the cheaper and better the communication. The working
of this law will render obsolete the entire idea of scarce spectrum and
launch an era of advances in telecommunications comparable to the recent
gains in computing. Transforming the computer and phone industries, the
converging spirits of Maxwell, Shannon and Shockley even pose a serious
challenge to the current revolutionaries in cellular telephony.

The New PC Revolution: PCN
</B></PRE>
Many observers herald the huge coming impact of wireless on the computer
industry, and they are right. But this impact will be dwarfed by the impact
of computers on wireless.<BR>
<BR>
In personal communications networks (PCN), the cellular industry today is
about to experience its own personal computer revolution. Just as the personal
computer led to systems thousands of times more efficient in MIPS per dollar
than the mainframes and minicomputers that preceded it, PCNs will bring
an exponential plunge of costs. These networks will be based on microcells
often measured in hundreds of meters rather than in tens of miles and will
interlink smart digital appliances, draining power in milliwatts rather
than dumb phones using watts. When the convulsion ends later this decade,
this new digital cellular phone will stand as the world's most pervasive
PC. As mobile as a watch and as personal as a wallet, these PICOs will recognize
speech, navigate streets, take notes, keep schedules, collect mail, manage
money, open the door and start the car, among other computer functions we
cannot imagine today.<BR>
<BR>
Like the computer establishment before it, current cellular providers often
seem unprepared for this next computer revolution. They still live in a
world of long and strong - high- powered systems at relatively low frequencies
and with short- lived batteries - rather than in a PCN world of low-power
systems at microwave frequencies and with batteries that last for days.<BR>
<BR>
Ready or not, though, the revolution will happen anyway, and it will transform
the landscape over the next five years. We can guess the pattern by considering
the precedents. In computers, the revolution took 10 years. It began in
1977 when large centralized systems with attached dumb terminals commanded
nearly 100 percent of the world's computer power and ended in 1987 with
such large systems commanding less than one percent of the world's computer
power. The pace of progress in digital electronics has accelerated sharply
since the early 1980s. Remember yesterday, when digital signal processing
(DSP) - the use of specialized computers to convert, compress, shape and
shuffle digital signals in real time - constituted an exorbitant million-dollar
obstacle to all-digital communications? Many current attitudes toward wireless
stem from that time, which was some five years ago. Today, digital signal
processors are the fastest-moving technology in all computing. Made on single
chips or multichip modules, DSPs are increasing their cost- effectiveness
tenfold every two years. As radio pioneer Donald Steinbrecher says, &quot;That
changes wireless from a radio business to a computer business.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Thus, we can expect the cellular telephone establishment to reach a crisis
more quickly than the mainframe establishment did. The existing cellular
infrastructure will persist for vehicular use.<BR>
<BR>
As the intelligence in networks migrates to microcells, the networks themselves
must become dumb. A complex network, loaded up with millions of lines of
software code, cannot keep up with the efflorescent diversity and creativity
among ever more intelligent digital devices on its periphery. This rule
is true for the broadband wire links of fiber optics, as intelligent switching
systems give way to passive all-optical networks. It is also true of cellular
systems.<BR>
<BR>
Nick Kauser, McCaw Cellular Communications' executive vice- president and
chief of technology, faced this problem early in 1991 when the company decided
to create a North American Cellular Network for transparent roaming throughout
the regions of Cellular One. &quot;The manufacturers always want to sell
switches that do more and more. But complex switches take so long to program
that you end up doing less and less,&quot; says Wayne Perry, McCaw vice-chairman.
Each time Kauser tried to change software code in one of McCaw's Ericsson
switches, it might have taken six months. Each time he wanted to add customer
names above a 64,000 limit, Ericsson tried to persuade him to buy a new
switch. The Ericsson switches, commented one McCaw engineer, offer a huge
engine but a tiny gas tank. The problem is not peculiar to Ericsson, however;
it is basic to the very idea of complex switch- based services on any supplier's
equipment.<BR>
<BR>
When McCaw voiced frustration, one of the regional Bell operating companies
offered to take over the entire problem at a cost of some $200 million.
Instead, Kauser created a Signaling System 7 (SS-7) network plus an intelligent
database on four Tandem fault-tolerant computers, for some $15 million.
Kauser maintains that the current services offered by North American Cellular
could not be duplicated for 10 times that amount, if at all, in a switch-based
system. Creating a dumb network and off- loading the intelligence on computer
servers saved McCaw hundreds of millions of dollars.<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm is a centrifuge, inexorably pushing intelligence
to the edges of networks. Telecom equipment suppliers can no more trap it
in the central switch than IBM could monopolize it in mainframes.<BR>
<BR>
Kauser should recognize that this rule applies to McCaw no less than to
Ericsson. His large standardized systems with 30- mile cells and relatively
dumb, high-powered phones resemble big proprietary mainframe networks. In
the computer industry, these standardized architectures gave way to a mad
proliferation of diverse personal computer nets restricted to small areas
and interlinked by hubs and routers. The same pattern will develop in cellular.
<PRE>


<B>


Could &quot;Charles&quot; Upend McCaw?
</B></PRE>
Together with GTE and the regional Bell operating company cellular divisions,
McCaw is now in the position of DEC in 1977. With its new ally, AT&amp;T,
McCaw is brilliantly attacking the mainframe establishment of the wire-line
phone companies. But the mainframe establishment of wires is not McCaw's
real competition. Not stopping at central switches, the law of the microcosm
is about to subvert the foundations of conventional cellular technology
as well. Unless McCaw and the other cellular providers come to terms with
the new PC networks that go by the name of PCNs, they will soon suffer the
fate of the minicomputer firms of the last decade. McCaw could well be upended
by its founder's original vision of his company - a PICO he called &quot;Charles.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
Just as in the computer industry in the late 1970s, the fight for the future
is already under way. Complicating the conflict is the influence of European
and Japanese forces protecting the past in the name of progress. Under pressure
from EEC industrial politicians working with the guidance of engineers from
Ericsson, the Europeans have adopted a new digital cellular system called
Groupe Speciale Mobile (GSM) after the commission that conceived it.<BR>
<BR>
GSM is a very conservative digital system that multiplies the number of
users in each cellular channel by a factor of three. GSM uses an access
method called time-division multiple access (TDMA). Suggestive of the time-sharing
methods used by minicomputers and mainframes to accommodate large numbers
of users on centralized computers, TDMA stems from the time-division multiplexing
employed by phone companies around the world to put more than one phone
call on each digital line. Thus, both the telephone and the computer establishments
are comfortable with time division.<BR>
<BR>
Under pressure from European firms eager to sell equipment in America, the
U.S. Telephone Industry Association two years ago adopted a TDMA standard
similar to the European GSM. Rather than creating a wholly new system exploiting
the distributed powers of the computer revolution, the TIA favored a TDMA
overlay on the existing analog infrastructure. Under the influence of Ericsson,
McCaw and some of the RBOCs took the TDMA bait.<BR>
<BR>
Thus, it was in the name of competitiveness and technological progress,
and of keeping up with the Europeans and Japanese, that the U.S. moved to
embrace an obsolescent cellular system. It made no difference that the Europeans
and Japanese were technologically well in our wake. Just as in the earlier
case of analog HDTV, however, the entrepreneurial creativity of the U.S.
digital electronics industry is launching an array of compelling alternatives
just in time.<BR>
<BR>
Infusing cellular telephony with the full powers of wide and weak - combining
Shannon's vision with computer advances - are two groups of engineers from
MIT who spun out to launch new companies. Qualcomm Inc. of San Diego, is
led by former professor Irwin Jacobs and telecom pioneer Andrew Viterbi.
A Shannon disciple whose eponymous algorithm is widely used in digital wire-line
telephony, Viterbi now is leading an effort to transform digital wireless
telephony. The other firm, Steinbrecher Corp. of Woburn, Mass., is led by
an inventor from the MIT Radio Astronomy Lab named Donald Steinbrecher.<BR>
<BR>
Like Bernie Bossard and Vahak Hovnanian, the leaders of Qualcomm and Steinbrecher
received the ultimate accolade for an innovator: They were all told their
breakthroughs were impossible. Indeed, the leaders at Qualcomm were still
contending that Steinbrecher's system would not work just weeks ago when
PacTel pushed the two firms together. Now they provide the foundations for
a radical new regime in distributed wireless computer telephony.

Signals in Pseudonoise
</B></PRE>
Ten years ago at Linkabit, the current leaders of Qualcomm conceived and
patented the TDMA technology adopted as the U.S. standard by the Telephone
Industry Association. Like analog HDTV, it was a powerful advance for its
time. But even then, Viterbi and Jacobs were experimenting with a Shannonesque
technology.<BR>
<BR>
A classic example of the efficacy of wide and weak, CDMA exploits the resemblance
between noise and information. The system began in the military as an effort
to avoid jamming or air- tapping of combat messages. Qualcomm brings CDMA
to the challenge of communications on the battlefronts of big-city cellular.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than compressing each call into between three and 10 tiny TDMA time
slots in a 30-kilohertz cellular channel, Qualcomm's CDMA spreads a signal
across a comparatively huge 1. 25-megahertz swath of the cellular spectrum.
This allows many users to share the same spectrum space at one time. Each
phone is programmed with a specific pseudonoise code, which is used to stretch
a low-powered signal over a wide frequency band. The base station uses the
same code in inverted form to &quot;despread&quot; and reconstitute the
original signal. All other codes remain spread out, indistinguishable from
background noise.<BR>
<BR>
Jacobs compares TDMA and CDMA to different strategies of communication at
a cocktail party. In the TDMA analogy, each person would restrict his or
her talk to a specific time slot while everyone else remains silent. This
system would work well as long as the party was managed by a dictator who
controlled all conversations by complex rules and a rigid clock. In CDMA,
on the other hand, everyone can talk at once but in different languages.
Each person listens for messages in his or her own language or code and
ignores all other sounds as background noise. Although this system allows
each person to speak freely, it requires constant control of the volume
of the speakers. A speaker who begins yelling can drown out surrounding
messages and drastically reduce the total number of conversations that can
be sustained.<BR>
<BR>
For years, this problem of the stentorian guest crippled CDMA as a method
of increasing the capacity of cellular systems. Spread spectrum had many
military uses because its unlocalized signal and cryptic codes made it very
difficult to jam or overhear. In a cellular environment, however, where
cars continually move in and out from behind trucks, buildings and other
obstacles, causing huge variations in power, CDMA systems would be regularly
swamped by stentorian guests. Similarly, nearby cars would tend to dominate
faraway vehicles. This was termed the near-far problem. When you compound
this challenge with a static of multipath signals causing hundreds of 10,000-to-
1 gyrations in power for every foot traveled by the mobile unit - so-called
Rayleigh interference pits and spikes - you can comprehend the general incredulity
toward CDMA among cellular cognoscenti. Indeed, as recently as 1991, leading
experts at Bell Labs, Stanford University and Bellcore confidently told
me the problem was a show-stopper; it could not be overcome.<BR>
<BR>
Radio experts, however, underestimate the power of the microcosm. Using
digital signal processing, error correction and other microcosmic tools,
wattage spikes and pits 100 times a second can be regulated by electronic
circuitry that adjusts the power at a rate of more than 800 times a second.<BR>
<BR>
To achieve this result, Qualcomm uses two layers of controls. First is a
relatively crude top layer that employs the automatic gain control device
on handsets to constantly adjust the power sent by the handset to the level
of power received by it from the base station. This rough adjustment does
not come near to solving the problem, but it brings a solution into reach
by using more complex and refined techniques.<BR>
<BR>
In the second power-control step, the base station measures the handset's
signal-to-noise and bit-error ratios once every 1.25 milliseconds (800 times
a second). Depending on whether these ratios are above or below a constantly
recomputed threshold, the base station sends a positive or negative pulse,
either raising or lowering the power some 25 percent. 
<PRE>


<B>


Dynamic Cells
</B></PRE>
Passing elaborate field tests with flying colors, this power- control mechanism
has the further effect of dynamically changing the size of cells. In a congested
cell, the power of all phones rises to overcome mutual interference. On
the margin, these high- powered transmissions overflow into neighboring
cells where they may be picked up by adjacent base station equipment. In
a quiet cell, power is so low that the cell effectively shrinks, transmitting
no interference at all to neighboring cells and improving their performance.
This kind of dynamic adjustment of cell sizes is impossible in a TDMA system,
where adjacent cells use completely different frequencies and fringe handsets
may begin to chirp like Elmer Fudd.<BR>
<BR>
Once the stentorian voice could be instantly abated, power control changed
from a crippling weakness of CDMA into a commanding asset. Power usage is
a major obstacle to the PCN future. All market tests show that either heavy
or short-lived batteries greatly reduce the attractiveness of the system.
Because the Qualcomm feedback system keeps power always at the lowest feasible
level, batteries in CDMA phones actually are lasting far longer than in
TDMA phones. CDMA phones transmit at an average of two milliwatts, compared
with 600 milliwatts and higher for most other cellular systems.<BR>
<BR>
A further advantage of wide and weak comes in handling multipath signals,
which bounce off obstacles and arrive at different times at the receiver.
Multipath just adds to the accuracy of CDMA. The Qualcomm system combines
the three strongest signals into one. Called a rake receiver and co- invented
by Paul Green, currently at IBM and author of Fiber Optic Networks (Prentice
Hall, 1992), this combining function works even on signals from different
cells and thus facilitates hand-offs. In TDMA, signals arriving at the wrong
time are pure interference in someone else's time slot; in CDMA, they strengthen
the message.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, CDMA allows simple and soft hand-offs. Because all the phones are
using the same spectrum space, moving from one cell to another is easy.
CDMA avoids all the frequency juggling of TDMA systems as they shuffle calls
among cells and time slots. As the era of PCN microcells approaches, this
advantage will become increasingly crucial. Cellular systems that spurn
Qualcomm today may find themselves in a quagmire of TDMA microcells tomorrow.
Together, all the gains from CDMA bring about a tenfold increase over current
analog capacity. In wireless telephony above all, wide and weak will prevail.<BR>
<BR>
Like any obsolescent scheme challenged by a real innovation - and like minicomputers
and mainframes challenged by the PC - TDMA is being sharply improved by
its proponents. The inheritors of the Linkabit TDMA patents at Hughes and
International Mobile Machines Corp. (IMMC) have introduced extended TDMA,
claiming a 19-fold advance over current analog capacity. Showing a conventional
cellular outlook, however, E-TDMA fatally adopts the idea of increasing
capacity by lowering speech quality. This moves in exactly the wrong direction.
PCN will not triumph through compromises based on a scarce-spectrum mentality.
PCN will multiply bandwidth to make the acoustics of digital cellular even
better than the acoustics of wire-line phones, just as the acoustics of
digital CDs far excel the acoustics of analog records.<BR>
<BR>
Riding the microcosmic gains of digital signal processing, CDMA inherently
offers greater room for improvement than TDMA does. Bringing the computer
revolution to cellular telephony, CDMA at its essence replaces frequency
shuffling with digital intelligence. Supplanting the multiple radios of
TDMA - each with a fixed frequency - are digital-signal-processing chips
that find a particular message across a wide spectrum swath captured by
one broadband radio.<BR>
<BR>
With the advance in digital electronics, the advantage of CDMA continually
increases. As the most compute-intensive system, CDMA gains most from the
onrushing increases in the cost- effectiveness of semiconductor electronics.
Qualcomm recently announced that it has reduced all the digital signal processing
for CDMA into one application-specific chip.<BR>
<BR>
For all the indispensable advances of CDMA, however, Qualcomm cannot prevail
alone. It brilliantly executes the move to digital codes, but proprietary
mainframe computer networks are digital, too. As presently conceived, CDMA
still aspires to be a cellular standard using the same mainframe architecture
of mobile telephone switching offices that now serve the analog cellular
system. In itself the Qualcomm solution does little to move cellular toward
the ever cheaper, smaller and more open architectures that now dominate
network computing and will shape PCN.

Hearing Feathers Crash Amid Heavy Metal
</B></PRE>
Consummating the PCN revolution - with its millions of microcells around
the globe and its myriad digital devices and frequencies - will require
a fundamental breakthrough in cellular radio technology. In the new Steinbrecher
minicell introduced early this month at the Cellular Telephone Industry
Association show, that breakthrough is at hand. The first true PC server
for PCN, this small box ultimately costing a few thousand dollars will both
replace and far outperform a 1,000-square-foot base station costing more
than a million dollars.<BR>
<BR>
Once again, in an entrepreneurial economy, crucial innovations come as an
utter surprise to all the experts in the field. Donald Steinbrecher began
in the Radio Astronomy Lab at MIT in the 1960s and early 1970s, creating
receivers that could resolve a random cosmic ray among a mass of electromagnetic
noise. This required radios with huge dynamic range - radios that could
hear a feather drop at a heavy metal rock concert. He and his students solved
this intractable problem by creating unique high-performance receivers and
frequency &quot;Mixers.&quot; These could process huge spans of spectrum
with immense variations of power and translate them without loss into intermediate
frequencies. Then, computer systems convert the signals from analog to digital
and analyze them with digital signal processors.<BR>
<BR>
Moving out to begin his own company in 1973, Steinbrecher and his colleagues
made several inventions in the fields of radar and digital signal analysis.
At first, most of their customers were national security contractors in
the intelligence field. For example, Steinbrecher supplied the radios for
the ROTHR (remote over the horizon radar) systems that became famous for
their role in the war against airborne drug traffic. Then in 1986, the company
was asked if its equipment could work in the cellular band.<BR>
<BR>
After cosmic rays and battlefield radar, the cellular band was easy. When
he saw that the digital signal processors at the heart of his systems were
dropping in price tenfold every two years, Steinbrecher knew that his esoteric
radios could become a consumer product.<BR>
<BR>
Translated to cellular, this technology opens entire new frontiers for wireless
telephony. Rather than tuning into one fixed frequency as current cellular
radios do, Steinbrecher's cells can use a high-dynamic-range digital radio
to down-convert and digitize the entire cellular band. TDMA, CDMA, near
or far, analog cellular, video, voice or data, in any combination, it makes
no difference to the Steinbrecher system. His minicell converts them all
at once to a digital bit stream. The DSPs take over from there, sorting
out the TDMA and CDMA signals from the analog signals and reducing each
to digital voice. To the extent the Steinbrecher system prevails, it would
end the need for hybrid phones and make possible a phased shift to PCN or
a variety of other digital services.<BR>
<BR>
Hoping to use Qualcomm chipsets and other technology, Steinbrecher could
facilitate the acceptance of CDMA. For CDMA, the minicell provides a new,
far cheaper radio front end that offers further relief to the near-far problem
and is open to the diverse codes and fast-moving technologies of PCN. For
the current cellular architecture, however, Steinbrecher offers only creative
destruction, doing for large base stations what the integrated circuit did
for racks of vacuum tubes in old telephone switches.<BR>
<BR>
In essence, the new minicell replaces a rigid structure of giant analog
mainframes with a system of wireless local area networks. Reconciling a
variety of codes and technologies, the Steinbrecher devices resemble the
smart hubs and routers from SynOptics Communications and Cisco Systems that
are transforming the world of wired computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
Best of all, at a time when the computer industry is preparing a massive
invasion of the air, these wide and weak radios can handle voice, data and
even video at the same time. Further, by cheaply accommodating a move from
scores of large base stations to scores of thousands of minicells per city
- on poles, down alleys or in elevator shafts - the system fulfills the
promise of the computer revolution as a spectrum multiplier. Since each
new minicell can use all the frequencies currently used by a large cell
site, the multiplication of cells achieves a similar multiplication of bandwidth.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the Steinbrecher receivers can accommodate the coming move into
higher frequencies. Banishing once and for all the concept of spectrum scarcity,
these high-dynamic-range receivers can already handle frequencies up to
the &quot;W band&quot; of 90 gigahertz and more. 
<PRE>


<B>


Boundless Bandwidth
</B></PRE>
The future of wireless communications is boundless bandwidth, accomplished
through the Shannon strategy of wide and weak signals, moving to ever smaller
cells with lower power at higher frequencies. The PCN systems made possible
by Qualcomm and Steinbrecher apply this approach chiefly to voice and data.
Recent announcements by Bossard and Hovnanian extend the concept to television
video as well. Last December, they disclosed that their company, Cellular
Vision, was already wirelessly delivering 49 cable television channels to
350 homes near Brighton Beach, Long Island, in the 28-gigahertz band. They
declared a plan to soon sign up some 5,000 new customers a month all over
New York.<BR>
<BR>
Among engineers in cellular and cable firms, Cellular Vision evokes the
same responses of incredulity and denial familiar at Qualcomm and Steinbrecher.
Like them, Bossard is resolutely on the right side of the Shannon and Shockley
divide. In answer to the multitude of qualms and objections and demurrals,
all three companies cite the huge benefits of more bandwidth. Qualcomm can
assign some 416 times as much bandwidth to each call as a current cellular
or TDMA system. Steinbrecher's minicell receivers can process 4,160 times
as much bandwidth as an analog cell site or TDMA radio.<BR>
<BR>
Hovnanian achieves some 300 times the bandwidth of a broadcast TV station
and some three times the bandwidth of even a typical cable head end. For
Hovnanian's so-called multipoint local distribution system, the FCC has
allocated a total of two gigahertz between 27.5 and 29.5 gigahertz - one
gigahertz for TV and one gigahertz for experimental data and phone service.
This large swath of spectrum allows Cellular Vision to substitute bandwidth
for power. Using FM rather than the AM system of cable, Cellular Vision
gains the same kind of increased fidelity familiar in FM radio. Assigning
20 megahertz to each channel - three times the six megahertz of an analog
system - Cellular Vision proves the potency of wide and weak by getting
20 decibels - some 10 times - more signal quality. These extra decibels
come in handy in the rain.<BR>
<BR>
With a radius of three miles, Cellular Vision cells are about 100 times
smaller than telephone cells. Transmitting only 10 milliwatts per channel
over a three-mile radius, the system gets far better signal-to-noise ratios
than the three-watt radios of cellular phones or the multikilowatt systems
of AM radio or television broadcasts. The millimeter wavelengths at 28 gigahertz
allow narrowband high-gain antennas that lock onto the right signal and
isolate it from neighboring cells. At 28 gigahertz, small antennas command
the performance of much larger ones (for example, a six-inch antenna at
28 gigahertz is equivalent to a three-foot antenna at 4 gigahertz or a 300-foot
antenna at broadcast television frequencies).<BR>
<BR>
In Brighton Beach the receiving antennas, using a fixed- phased-array technology,
are just four inches square, and the transmitting antennas deliver 49 channels
from a one-inch omnidirectional device on a box the size of a suitcase.
Between cells, these transmitters can send programming and other information
through a conventional point-to-point microwave link. 
<PRE>


<B>


Singing in the Rain
</B></PRE>
So what happens in the rain? Well, it seems that Cellular Vision does better
than conventional cable. When you have small cells in geodesic low-power
wireless networks using the full computational resources of modern microchips,
you have plenty of extra decibels in your signal-to-noise budget to endure
the most violent storms. Indeed, the 350 Brighton Beach customers of Cellular
Vision received continuous service during the November 1992 near hurricane
in New York, which brought floods that interrupted many cable networks for
hours. One competitive advantage of Cellular Vision over cable seems to
be less vulnerability to water.<BR>
<BR>
Moving television radically toward the regime of wide and weak, Bossard
and the Hovnanians have changed the dimensions of the air. However, they
cannot escape the usual burdens of the innovator. Any drastic innovation
must be some 10 times as good as what it replaces. Otherwise, the installed
base, engineering momentum and customer loyalty of the incumbents will prevail
against it.<BR>
<BR>
Cellular Vision faces a wired cable system with some $18 billion in installed
base. Already deploying fiber at a fast pace, cable companies plan to move
within the next year toward digital compression schemes that increase capacity
or resolution by a factor of between six and 10 (depending on the character
of the programming). That means some 500 digital channels or more. TCI,
the leading cable company, has ordered some one million cable converter
and decompression boxes from General Instruments' Jerrold subsidiary for
delivery late in 1993. In the U.S. cable industry, Hovnanian faces an aggressively
moving target. Most cable experts doubt he can make much of a dent.<BR>
<BR>
This view may be shortsighted. Clearly, Cellular Vision - and its likely
imitators - can compete in the many areas with incompetent cable systems,
in areas yet unreached by cable or in new projects launched by developers
such as the Hovnanians. In the rest of the world, cable systems are rare.
Cellular Vision is finding rich opportunities abroad, from Latvia to New
Zealand. Most of all, as time passes, Cellular Vision might find itself
increasingly well positioned for a world of untethered digital devices.<BR>
<BR>
Such a cellular system could be adapted to mobile telephone or computer
services. With a bit-error rate of one in 10 billion, it could theoretically
transmit computer data without error correction. With one gigahertz of bandwidth,
the system could function easily as a backbone for PCN applications, collecting
calls from handsets operating at lower frequencies and passing them on to
telephone or cellular central offices or to intelligent network facilities
of the local phone companies.<BR>
<BR>
The future local loop will combine telephone, teleputer and digital video
services, together with speech recognition and other complex features, in
patterns that will differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Easily customizable
from cell to cell, a system like Bossard's might well offer powerful advantages.<BR>
<BR>
In an era of bandwidth abundance, the Negroponte switch - with voice pushed
to the air and video onto wires - may well give way to this division between
fibersphere and atmosphere. With the fibersphere offering virtually unlimited
bandwidth for fixed communications over long distances, the local loop will
be the bottleneck, thronged with millions of wireless devices. Under these
conditions, a move to high-frequency cellular systems is imperative to carry
the increasing floods of digital video overflowing from the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
In any case, led by Qualcomm, Steinbrecher and Cellular Vision, a new generation
of companies is emerging to challenge the assumptions and structures of
the existing information economy. All these companies are recent startups,
with innovations entirely unexpected by international standards bodies,
university experts and government officials. They are the fruit of an entrepreneurial
America, guided by the marketplace into the microcosm and telecosm. 
<PRE>

Why Imitate European Failures?
</B></PRE>
Meanwhile, the European and Japanese experiences with government-guided
strategies should give pause to proponents of similar policies here. Thirty
years of expensive industrial policy targeting computers has left the Europeans
with no significant computer firms at all. The Japanese have done better,
but even they have been losing market share across the board to the U.S.<BR>
<BR>
In the converging crescendos of advance in digital wireless telephony and
computing, progress is surging far beyond all the regulatory maps and guidebooks
of previous years. If the entire capacity of the 28-gigahertz band, renewed
every three miles, is open to telephony and video, bandwidth will be scarcely
more limiting in wireless than it is in glass.<BR>
<BR>
In this emerging world of boundless bandwidth, companies will prevail only
by transcending the folklore of scarcity and embracing the full promise
of the digital dawn. In an era of accelerating transition, the rule of success
will be self- cannibalization. Wire-line phone companies are not truly profitable
today; their reported earnings all spring from slow depreciation of installed
plant and equipment that are fast becoming worthless. As George Calhoun
of IMMC demonstrates in his superb new book, Wireless Access and the Local
Telephone Network (Artech, 1992), new digital wireless connections are already
less than one-third the cost of installing wire-line phones. For the RBOCs,
aggressively attacking their own obsolescent enterprises is their only hope
of prosperity.<BR>
<BR>
As Joseph Schlosser of Coopers & Lybrand observes, self- cannibalization
will not appear to be in the financial interests of the established firms;
it will not prove out in net-present- value terms. There will be no studies
to guarantee its success. Executives will have to earn their pay by going
with their gut. As semiconductor and computer companies have already learned,
phone and cable companies will discover that self-cannibalization is the
only way to succeed in this era - the only way to stop others from capturing
the heart of your business.<BR>
<BR>
This is the lesson of the last decade. When Craig McCaw sold his cable properties
and plunged into cellular telephony and $2 billion of Michael Milken's junk
bond debt, there was no way to prove him right. Today AT&T is preparing
to launch him as a rival to Bill Gates as the nation's richest man. Yet
McCaw cannot rest on his laurels; the hour of the cannibal is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
In theory, the transition should not be difficult for this resourceful and
ingenious entrepreneur, who has long been a leading prophet of ubiquitous
wireless phones and computers - his predicted personal digital assistant,
&quot;Charles.&quot; But a company that has paid billions for its 25-megahertz
national swath of long and strong frequencies faces especially acute dilemmas
in moving toward a regime of wide and weak. As a man - and company - that
has made such transitions before, McCaw is favored by history and by AT&amp;T.
As a giant pillar of the new establishment, though, McCaw may find it as
difficult to shift gears as did the computer establishment before him. The
stakes are even higher. The next decade will see the emergence of fortunes
in ever- changing transmutations of PCN, digital video, multimedia and wireless
computers that dwarf the yields of cable and cellular. The window of opportunity
opens wide and weak.

Philip Hope, divisional vice president for engineering systems of EDS,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has an IQ problem. His chief client and owner, General Motors, wants to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
interconnect thousands of 3-D graphics and computer aided engineering (CAE)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
workstations with mainframes and supercomputers at Headquarters, with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
automated assembly equipment at factories in Lordstown, Indiana, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Detroit, with other powerful processors at their technical center in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Warren, Michigan, with their Opel plant in Ruesselheim, Germany, and with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their design center outside San Diego. On behalf of another client, Hope<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wants to link multimedia stations for remote diagnostics, X-ray analysis,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and pharmaceutical modeling in hospitals and universities across the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
country.<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Any function involving 3-D graphics, CAE, supercomputer visualization,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lossless diagnostic imaging, and advanced medical simulations demands large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth or communications power. Graphics workstations often operate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
screens with a million picture elements (pixels), and use progressive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
scanning at 60 frames or images a second. Each pixel may entail 24 bits
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
color. That adds up fast to billions of bits (gigabits) a second. And<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that's for last year's technology in a computer industry that is doubling<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
its powers and cost effectiveness every year.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What Hope needs is bandwidth and connections. The leading bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and connections people have always been the telephone companies. But when<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope goes to the telephone companies, they want to tell him about<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligence: their Advanced Intelligent Network which will be coming on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
line over the next decade or so and will solve all his problems. For now,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they have what they call DS-3 services available in many areas, operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
T-3 lines at 45 megabits (million bits) a second. These facilities are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ample for most computer uses and working together with several different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), Hope should be able to acquire<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
these services in time for a General Motors takeover by Toyota.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope has been through this before. In the early 1980s, he actually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wanted D-3 services. Then he was interconnecting facilities in Southeast,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Michigan, with plants in Indiana and Ohio. But Michigan Bell could not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply the lines in time. EDS had to build a network of microwave towers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to bear the 45 megabit traffic. Later in the decade, the phone companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have even offered him higher capacity fiber optic lines, with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
requirement that the optical bits be slowed down and run periodically<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through an electronic interface so the telco could count the number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;equivalent channels&quot; being used.<BR>

<BR>
What Hope and others in the systems integration business need is not<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
intelligent networks tomorrow but dumb bandwidth that they can deliver to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their customers flexibly, cheaply, and now. To prepare for future demand,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
they want the network to use fiber optics. It so happens that America's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies have some two million miles of mostly unused fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines in the ground today, kept as redundant capacity for future needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hope would like to be able to tap into this &quot;dark fiber&quot; for his
own<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers.<BR>

As a leader in the rapidly expanding field of computer services, EDS<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
epitomizes the needs of an information economy. With a backlog of 22<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollars in already contracted business, EDS is currently a seven<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
billion dollar company growing revenues at an annual rate of 15 percent,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some three times as fast as the phone companies. EDS will add a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollars or so in new sales in 1992 alone. If the company is to continue
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply leading edge services to its customers, it must command leading edge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications. To EDS, that means dumb and dark networks.<BR>

The &quot;Dark Fiber&quot; Case<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That need has driven EDS into an active role as an ex parte pleader in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Case 911416, currently bogging down in the District of Columbia<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Federal Court of Appeals as the so-called &quot;dark fiber&quot; case. On
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
surface, the case, known as Southwestern Bell et al versus the Federal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Communications Commission and the U.S. Justice Department, pits four<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Regional Bell telephone companies against the FCC. But the legal maneuvers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
actually reflect a rising conflict between the Bells and several large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
corporate clients over the future of communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Beyond all the legal posturing, the question at issue is whether fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks should be dumb and dark, and cheap, the way EDS and other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
customers like them. Or whether they should be bright and smart, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;strategically&quot; priced, the way the telephone companies want them.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
On the side of intelligence and light are the phone companies;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southwestern Bell, U.S. West, Bell South, and Bell Atlantic. The forces
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
darkness include key officials at the FCC and such companies as Shell Oil,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the information services arm of McDonald Douglas, long distance network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider Wiltel, as well as EDS.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For most of the four year course of the struggle, it has passed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unnoticed by the media. In summary, the issue may not seem portentous.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The large corporate customers want dark fiber; the FCC mandates that it
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplied; the Bells want out of the business. But for all their obscurity,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the proceedings raise what for the next twenty years will be the central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
issue in communications law and technology. The issue, if not the possible<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trial itself, will shape the future of both the computer and telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries during a period when they are merging to form the spearhead of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new information economy.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Dark fiber&quot; is simply a glass fiber optic thread with nothing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
attached to it, (ie. no light being sent through it). In this &quot;unlit&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
condition, it is available for use without the intermediation of phone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company electronics or intelligent services.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the mid-1980s, the Bells leased some of their dark fiber lines to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
several large corporations on an individual case basis. These companies<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
learned to love dark fiber. But when they tried to renew their leases with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the Bells, the Bells clanged no! Why don't you leave the interconnections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and protocols to us? Why don't you use our marvellous smart network with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the acronyms and intelligent services? Why don't you let us meter your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
use of the fiber and send you a convenient monthly bill for each packet
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bits you send?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
EDS and the other firms rejected the offer; they preferred that dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber to the intelligent network. When the Bells persisted in an effort
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
deny new leases, the companies went to the FCC to require the Bells, as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
regulated &quot;common carrier&quot; telephone companies, to continue supplying
dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the fall of 1990, the FCC ruled that the phone companies would have<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to offer dark fiber to all comers under the rules of common carriage.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rather than accept this new burden, the phone companies petitioned to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
withdraw from the business entirely under what is called a rule 214<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
application. Since the FCC has not acted on this petition, the Bells are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
preparing to go to court to force the issue. Their corporate customers are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ready to litigate as well.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is safe to say that none of the participants fully comprehend the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
significance of their courthouse confrontation. To the Bells, after all
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
said and done, the key problem is probably the price. Under the existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
tariff, they are required to offer this service to anyone who wants it for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an average price of approximately $150 per strand of fiber per month. As<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an offering that competes with their T-3 45 megabit (millions of bits) a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second lines and other forthcoming marvels, dark fiber threatens to gobble<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
up their future as vendors of broadband communications to offices, even
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cable TV preempts them as broadband providers to homes. Since the Bells'<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
profits on data are growing some 10 times as fast as their profits on voice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephony, they see dark fiber as a menace to their most promising markets.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The technological portents, however, are far more significant even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than the legal and business issues. The coming triumph of dark fiber will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mean not only the end of the telephone industry as we know it but also the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
end of the telephone industry as they plan it: a vast intelligent fabric<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of sophisticated information services. It also could mean a thoroughgoing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restructuring of a computer industry increasingly dedicated to supplying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;smart networks.&quot; Indeed, for most of the world's communications
companies,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
professors of communications theory, and designers of new computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, the triumph of dark and dumb means &quot;back to the drawing board,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
if not back to the dark ages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the new dark ages cannot be held back.<BR>

Springing out the depths of IBM's huge Watson Laboratories is a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powerful new invention: the all optical network, that will soon relegate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all bright and smart executives to the Troglodyte file and make dumb and<BR>

dark the winning rule in communications.<BR>

The Wringer Effect<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
From time to time, the structure of nations and economies goes through<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a technological wringer. A new invention radically reduces the price of
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
key factor of production and precipitates an industrial revolution. Before<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
long, every competitive business in the economy must wring out the residue<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the old costs and customs from all its products and practices.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The steam engine, for example, drastically reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
physical force. Power once wreaked at great expense from human and animal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
muscle pulsed cheaply and tirelessly from machines burning coal and oil.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throughout the world, dominance inexorably shifted to businesses and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nations that reorganized themselves to exploit the suddenly cheap resource.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Eventually every human industry and activity, from agriculture and sea<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transport to printing and war, had to centralize and capitalize itself to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
take advantage of the new technology.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Putting the world through the technological wringer over the last<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
three decades has been the integrated circuit, the IC. Invented by Robert<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Noyce of Intel and Jack Kilby of Texas Instruments in 1959, the IC put<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire systems of tiny transistor switches, capacitors, resistors, diodes,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and other once costly electronic devices on one tiny microchip. Made<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chiefly of silicon, aluminum, and oxygen, three of the most common<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
substances on earth, the microchip eventually reduced the price of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic circuitry by a factor of a million.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As industry guru Andrew Rappaport has pointed out, electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
designers now treat transistors as virtually free. Indeed, on memory<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chips, they cost some 400 millionths of a cent. To waste time or battery<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power or radio frequencies may be culpable acts, but to waste transistors<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is the essence of thrift. Today you use millions of them slightly to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enhance your TV picture or to play a game of solitaire or to fax Doonsbury<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to Grandma. If you do not use transistors in your cars, your offices, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone systems, your design centers, your factories, your farm gear,
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your missiles, you go out of business. If you don't waste transistors,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your cost structure will cripple you. Your product will be either too<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive, too slow, too late, or too low in quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Endowing every information age engineer or PC hacker with the creative<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
potential of a factory owner of the industrial age, the microchip reversed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the centralizing thrust of the previous era. All nations and businesses<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had to adapt to the centrifugal law of the microcosm, flattening<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hierarchies, outsourcing services, liberating engineers, shedding middle<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
management. If you did not adapt your business systems to the new regime,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you would no longer be a factor in the world balance of economic and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
military power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
During the next decade or so, industry will go through a new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology wringer and submit to a new law: the law of the telecosm. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
new wringer, the new integrated circuit, is called the all optical network.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is a communications system that runs entirely in glass. Unlike existing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optic networks, which convert light signals to electronic form in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
order to amplify or switch them, the all optical network is entirely<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
photonic. From the first conversion of the signal from your phone or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer to the final conversion to voice or data at the destination, your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
message flies through glass on wings of light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the old integrated circuit put entire electronic systems on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single slivers of silicon, the new IC will put entire communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems on seamless webs of silica. Wrought in threads as thin as a human<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hair, this silica is so pure that you could see through a window of it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seventy miles thick. But what makes the new wringer roll with all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
force of the microchip revolution before it is not the purity but the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
price. Just as the old IC made transistor power virtually free, the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, the all optical network, will make communications power virtually free.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Another word for communications power is bandwidth. Just as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entire world had to learn to waste transistors, the entire world will now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to learn how to waste bandwidth. In the 1990s and beyond, every<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry and economy will go through the wringer again.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The impact on the organization of companies and economies, however,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
has yet to become clear. What is the law of the telecosm? Will the new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology reverse the centrifugal force of the microchip revolution...or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
consummate it? To understand the message of the new regime, we must follow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the rule of microcosmic prophet Carver Mead of Caltech: &quot;Listen to
the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology...and find out what it is telling us.&quot;<BR>

The Shannon-Shockley Regime<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The father of the all-optical-network, the man who coined the phrase,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
built the first fully functional system, and wrote the definitive book on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the subject, is Paul E. Green, Jr. of Watson Laboratory at IBM. Now<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
standing directly in the path of Green's wringer is Robert Lucky, who some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seven years ago at a conference at Cornell first gave Green the idea that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
an all optical network might be possible.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The leading intellectual in telephony, Lucky recently shocked the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry by shifting from AT&amp;T's Bell Labs, where he was executive director<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of research, to Bellcore, the laboratory of the Regional Bell Operating<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Companies (RBOCs). There he will soon have to confront the implications
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's innovation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Contemplating the new technology, Lucky recalls a course on data<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks that he used to teach many years ago with Green. As a computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
man, Green relished the contrast between the onrushing efficiencies in his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology and the relative dormancy in communications. Indeed, for some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twenty five years, while computer powers rose a millionfold, network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacities increased about a thousandfold. It was not until the late 1980s<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that most long distance data networks much surpassed the Pentagon's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;ARPANET&quot; running at 50 kilobits (thousands of bits) per second
since the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mid sixties.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This was the era dominated by the powerful mathematic visions and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
theories of Claude Shannon of MIT and Bell Labs. Shannon was the reclusive<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
genius who invented Information Theory to ascertain the absolute carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity of any communications channel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Whether wire or air, channels were assumed to be narrow and noisy, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way God made them (sometimes with help from AT&amp;T). Typical were the
copper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone lines that still link every household to the telephone network and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the air waves that still bear radio and television signals and static.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all-purpose remedy for these narrow, noisy channels was powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Invented at Bell Laboratories by a team headed by William<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Shockley and then developed by Robert Noyce and other Shockley proteges
in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Silicon Valley, silicon transistors and integrated circuits engendered a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
constant exponential upsurge of computing power.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Throwing ever more millions of ever faster and cheaper transistors at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every problem, engineers created fast computers, multiplexors, and switches<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that seemed to surmount and outsmart every limit of bandwidth or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
restriction of wire. This process continues today with heroic new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression tools that allow the creation of full video conferences over
64<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilobit telephone connections. Scientists at Bellcore are now even<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
proposing new ways of using the Motion Picture Engineering Group (MPEG)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compression standard to send full motion movies at 1.5 megabits a second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
over the 4 kilohertz twisted pair copper wires to the home. Using ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
faster computers, the telephone company is saying it can give you pay-per-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
view movies without installing fiber, or even coaxial cable, to the home.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the Shannon-Shockley era, the communications might be noisy and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
error prone, but smart electronics could encode and decode messages in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
complex ways that allowed efficient identification and correction of all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
errors. The Shannon channel might be narrow, but fast multiplexors allowed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it to be divided into time slots accommodating a large number of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simultaneous users in a system called time division multiplexing. The<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
channel might clog up when large numbers of users attempted to communicate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with each other at once, but collision detectors or token passers could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sort it all out in nanoseconds. Graphics and video might impose immense<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods of bits on the system, but compression technology could reduce the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
floods to a manageable trickle with little or no loss of picture quality.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
If all else failed, powerful electronic switches could compensate for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
almost any bandwidth limitations. Switching could make up for the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inadequate bandwidth at the terminals by relieving the network of the need<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to broadcast all signals to every destination. Instead, the central switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could receive all signals and then route them to their appropriate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
addresses.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To this day, this is the essential strategy of the telephone<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies: compensate for narrow noisy bandwidth with ever more powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and intelligent digital electronics. Their &quot;core competence,&quot;
the Bells<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hasten to tell you, is switching. They make up for the shortcomings of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
copper wires by providing smart, powerful digital switches.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Their vision for the future is to join the computer business all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way, making these switches the entering wedge for ever more elaborate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information services. Switches will grow smarter and more sophisticated<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
until they provide an ever growing cornucopia of intelligent voice and fax<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
features, from caller ID and voice mail to personal communications systems<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that follow you and your number around the world from your car commute to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
your vacation beach hideaway. In the end, these intelligent networks could<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supply virtually all the world's information needs, from movies, games and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
traffic updates to data libraries, financial services, news programs, and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
weather reports, all climaxing with yellow pages that exfoliate into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigantic global mall of full motion video where your fingers walk (or your<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
voice commands echo) from Harrods, to Jardines, to Akihabara, to Century
21<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
without you leaving the couch.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the time when Green and Lucky taught their course, this strategy<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for the future was only a glimmer in the minds of telephone visionaries.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But the essence of it was already in place. As Green pointed out,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephone companies' response to sluggishness in communications was to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enter the computer industry, where progress was faster. The creativity of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
digital electronics would save the telephone industry from technical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stagnation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky, however, protested to Green that it was unjust to compare the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two fields. Computers and telecom, as Lucky explained it, operate on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
entirely different scales. Computers work in the microscale world of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
IC, putting ever more thousands of wires and switches on single slivers
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
silicon.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, telecommunications functions in the macroworld, laying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
out wires and switches across mostly silicon landscapes and seabeds. It<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
necessarily entails a continental, or even intercontinental stretch of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cables, microwave towers, switches, and poles. &quot;How was it possible,&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Lucky asked, &quot;to make such a large scale system inexpensive?&quot;
Inherent in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the structure and even the physics of computers and telecommunications,
so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
it seemed to Lucky two decades ago, was a communications bottleneck.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Lucky remembers it, Green was never satisfied with Lucky's point.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green believed that someday communications could achieve miracles<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to the integrated circuit in computing....<BR>

The Bandwidth Scandal<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, as Lucky was the first to announce, fiber optics has utterly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
overthrown the previous relationship between fast computers and slow wires.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now it is computer technology that imposes the bottleneck on the vast<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vistas of dark fiber.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A silicon transistor can change its state some 2.5 billion times a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second in response to light pulses (bundles of photons) hitting a photo-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
detector. Since it would take a human being a thousand years or so of 10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hour workdays even to count to two billion, two billion cycles in a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
second (two gigahertz) might seem a sprightly pace. But in the world of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber optics running at the speed and frequencies of light, even a rate
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two billion cycles a second is a humbling bow to the slothful pace of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Since optical signals still have to be routed to their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
destinations through computer switches, communications now suffers from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what is known as the &quot;electronic bottleneck.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is this electronic bottleneck, the entire Bell edifice of Shannon<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and Shockley, that Paul Green plans to blow away with his all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks. Green is targeting what is a secret scandal of modern<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecommunications: the huge gap between the real capacity of fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and the actual speed of telephone communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In communications systems, the number of waves per second (or hertz)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
represents a rough measure of its potential bandwidth or ultimate carrying<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
capacity. The bandwidth of a radio system, for example, is determined by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the frequency of each station or channel and by the number of stations that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
can fit within the band. Your AM dial, for example, runs from around 535<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand hertz (kilohertz) to 1705 kilohertz and each station uses some
10<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
kilohertz. With an ideal receiver, the AM passband might carry 117<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
stations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, the intrinsic bandwidth of one strand of dark fiber is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
some 25 thousand gigahertz in each of three groups of frequencies (three<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands) through which fiber can transmit light over long distances. At<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a gigahertz per terminal, this bandwidth might accommodate some 25,000<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supercomputer &quot;stations&quot; (or 2.5 billion AM stations). Using what
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
called dispersion shifted fiber, it may be possible to use two of these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passbands at once: a total of some 40 or 50 thousand gigahertz. For<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparison, consider all the radio frequencies currently used in the air<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
for radio, television, microwave, and satellite communications and multiply<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by two thousand. The bandwidth of one fiber thread could carry more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two thousand times as much information as all these radio and microwave<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies that currently comprise the &quot;air.&quot; One fiber thread
could bear<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
twice the traffic on the phone network during the peak hour of Mothers'
Day<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
in the U.S. (the heaviest load currently managed by the phone system).<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Yet even for point-to-point long distance links, let alone connections<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to homes, telephone and computer network engineers now turn their backs
on<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
this immense capacity and use perhaps one or two fifty thousandths it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Deferring to the electronic bottleneck, the telephone industry uses fiber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
merely as a superior replacement for the copper wires, coaxial cables,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
satellite links, and microwave towers that connected the local central<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
office switches to one another for long distance calls.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last 15 years, the Bell Laboratory record for fiber optics<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication has run from 10 megabits per second over a one kilometer span<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to some 10 gigabits per second over nearly one thousand kilometers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
all the heroic advances in point-to-point links between central offices<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
continued to use essentially one frequency on a fiber thread, while<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ignoring its intrinsic power to accommodate thousands of useful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
frequencies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In a world of all optical networks, this strategy is bankrupt. No<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
longer will it be possible to throw more transistors, however cheap and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fast, at the switching problem. Electronic speeds have become an<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
insuperable bottleneck obstructing the vast vistas of dark fiber beyond.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
So called gigabit networks planned by the telephone and computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
companies will not do. What is needed is not a gigabit spread among many<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals, but a large network functioning at a gigabit per second per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The demands of EDS offer a hint of the most urgent business needs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Added to them will be consumer demands. True high definition television,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
comparable to movies in resolution, requires close to gigabit-a-second<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, particularly if the program is dispatched to the viewer in burst<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mode all at once in a few seconds down the fiber, or if the user is given
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chance to shape the picture, choose a vantage point, window several images<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at once, or experience three dimensions. When true broadband channels<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
become available, there will be a flood of new applications comparable to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the thousands of new uses of the IC.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
No foreseeable progress in electronics can overcome the electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bottleneck. To do that, we need an entirely new communications regime. In<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the form of the all optical network, this regime is now at hand.<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

Law Of The Telecosm: Networks Dumb As A Stone<BR>
</B><BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime will use fiber not as a replacement for copper wires<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but as a new form of far more capacious and error-free air. Through a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
system called wavelength division multiplexing and access, computers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telephones will tune into desired messages in the fibersphere the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios now tune into desired signals in the atmosphere. The fibersphere<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be intrinsically as dumb and dark as the atmosphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The new regime overcomes the electronic bottleneck by altogether<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
banishing electronics from the network. But, ask the telcos in unison,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
what about the switches? As long as the network is switched, it must be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
partly electronic. Unless the network is switched, it is not a true any-<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
to-any network. It is a broadcast system. It may offer a cornucopia of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services. But it cannot serve as a common carrier like the phone network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
allowing any party to reach any other. Without intelligent switching it<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cannot provide personal communications nets that can follow you wherever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
you go. Without intelligent switching, the all optical network, so they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
say, is just a glorified cable system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
These critics fail to grasp a central rule of the telecosm: bandwidth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
is a nearly perfect substitute for switching. With sufficient physical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it is possible to simulate any kind of logical switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
whatsoever. Bandwidth allows creation of virtual switches that to the user<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
seem to function exactly the way physical switches do. You can send all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
messages everywhere in the network, include all needed codes and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
instructions for correcting, decrypting, and reading them, and allow each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminal to tune into its own messages on its own wavelength, just like
a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
two-way radio. When the terminals are smart enough and the bandwidth great<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
enough, your all optical network can be as dumb as a stone.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Over the last several years, all optical network experiments have been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
conducted around the world, from Bellcore in New Jersey to NTT at Yokosuka,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Japan. British Telecom has used wavelength division multiplexing to link<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
four telephone central offices in London. Columbia's Telecom Center has<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launched a &quot;Teranet&quot; that lacks tunable lasers or receivers but
can<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
logically simulate them. Bell Laboratories has generated most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology but as a long distance specialist has focussed on the project
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
sending gigabits of information thousands of miles without amplifiers. But<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only fully functional system is the Rainbow created by Paul Green at IBM.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As happens so often in this a world of technical disciplines sliced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
into arbitrary fortes and fields, the large advances come from the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrators. Paul Green is neither a laser physicist, nor an optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
engineer, nor a telecommunications theorist. At IBM, his work has ranged<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
from overseeing speech recognition projects at Watson Labs to shaping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
company strategy at corporate headquarters in Armonk. His most recent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
success was supervising development of the new APPN (Advanced Peer to Peer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Network) protocol. According to an IBM announcement in March, APPN will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
replace the venerable SNA (systems network architecture) that has been<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
synonymous with IBM networking for more than a decade.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green took some pride in this announcement, but by that time, the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
project was long in his past. He was finishing the copy editing on his<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
magisterial tome on Fiber Optic Networks (published this summer by Prentice<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Hall). And he was moving on to more advanced versions of the Rainbow which<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
he and his team had introduced in December 1991 at the Telecom 91<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Conference in Geneva and which has been installed between the various<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
branches of Watson Laboratories in Westchester County, N.Y.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Peter Drucker points out, a new technology cannot displace an old<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
one unless it is proven at least 10 times better. Otherwise the billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of installed base and thousands of engineers committed
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
improving the old technology will suffice to block the new one. The job
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Paul Green's 15 man team at IBM is to meet that tenfold test.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Green's all optical network creates a fibersphere as neutral and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
passive as the atmosphere. It can be addressed by computers the same way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
radios and television sets connect to the air. Consisting entirely of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
unpowered glass and passive spitters and couplers, the fibersphere is dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dumb. Any variety of terminals can interconnect across it at the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
time using any protocols they choose.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as radios in the atmosphere, computer receivers connected to the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere do not find a series of bits in a message; they tune into a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wavelength or frequency. Because available Fabry Perot tunable filters<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
today have larger bandwidth than tunable lasers, Green chose to locate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Rainbow's tuning at the receiver and have transmitters each operate at a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fixed wavelength. But future networks can use any combination of tunable<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
equipment at either end.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
When Green began the project in 1987, the industry stood in the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
general position as the pioneers of radio in the early years of that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industry. They had seemingly unlimited bandwidth before them, but lacked<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters and receivers powerful enough to use it effectively. Radio<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transmitters suffered &quot;splitting losses&quot; as they broadcast their
signals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
across the countryside. Green's optical messages lose power everytime they<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are split off to be sent to another terminal or are tapped by a receiver.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The radio industry solved this problem by the development of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
audion triode amplifier. Green needed an all optical amplifier to replace<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the optoelectronic repeaters that now constitute the most widespread<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronic bottleneck in fiber. Amplifiers in current fiber networks first<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert the optical signal to an electronic signal, enhance it, and then<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
convert it back to photons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Like the pioneers of radio, Green soon had his amplifier in hand.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Following concepts pioneered by David Payne at the University of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Southhampton in England, a Bell Laboratories group led by Emmanuel<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Desurvire and Randy Giles developed a workable all optical device. They<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
showed that a short stretch of fiber doped with erbium, a rare earth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mineral, and excited by a cheap laser diode, can function as a powerful<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier over the entire wavelength range of a 25,000 gigahertz system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today such photonic amplifiers enhance signals in a working system of links<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between Naples and Pomezia on the west coast of Italy. Manufactured in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
packages between two and three cubic inches in size, these amplifiers fit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
anywhere in an optical network for enhancing signals without electronics.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This invention overcame the most fundamental disadvantage of optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks compared to electronic networks. You can tap into an electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
network as often as desired without weakening the voltage signal. Although<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
resistance and capacitance will weaken the current, there are no splitting<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
losses in a voltage divider. Photonic signals, by contrast, suffer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
splitting losses every time they are tapped; they lose photons until<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
eventually there are none left. The cheap and compact all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
amplifier solves this problem.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Not only did Green and his IBM colleagues create working all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks, they also reduced the interface optoelectronics to a single<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microchannel plug-in card that can fit in any IBM PS/2 level personal<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer or R6000 workstation. Using off-the-shelf components costing a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
total of $16,000 per station, Rainbow achieved a capacity more than 90<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
times greater than FDDI at an initial cost merely four times as much.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as Jack Kilby's first ICs were not better than previous adders<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and oscillators, the Rainbow I is not better in some respects than rival<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks based on electronics. At present it connects only 32 computers
at<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
a speed of some 300 megabits per second, for a total bandwidth of 9.5<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigabits. This rate is huge compared to most other networks, but it is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
still well below the target of a system that provides gigabit rates for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
every terminal.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A more serious limitation is the lack of packet switching. Rather<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
than communicating down a dedicated connection between two parties, like<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phones do, computer networks send data in small batches, called packets,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
each bearing its own address. This requires switching back and forth<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
between packets millions of times a second. Neither the current Rainbow's<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lasers nor its filters can tune from one message to another more than<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of times a second. This limitation is a serious problem for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
links to mainframes and supercomputers that may do many tasks at once in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
different windows on the screen and with connections to several other<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Green shows, however, all these problems are well on the way to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
solution. A tide of new interest in all optical systems is sweeping<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the world's optical laboratories. The Pentagon's Defense Advanced<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Projects Agency (DARPA) has launched a program for all optical networking.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With Green installed as the new President of the IEEE Communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Society, the technical journals are full of articles on new wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division technology. Every few months brings new reports of a faster laser<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
with a broader bandwidth, or filter with faster tuning, or an ingenious
new<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
way to use bandwidth to simulate packet switching. Today lasers and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
receivers can switch fast enough but they still lack the ability to cover<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the entire bandwidth needed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The key point, however, is that as demonstrated both in Geneva and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Armonk, the Green system showed the potential efficiency of all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Even in their initial forms they are more cost effective in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth per dollar than any other network technology. Scheduled for<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
introduction within the next two years, Rainbow III will comprise a<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand stations operating at a gigabit a second, with the increasingly<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
likely hope of fast packet switching capability. At that point, the system<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
will be a compelling commercial product at least hundreds of times more<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost effective than the competition.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Without access to dark fiber, however, these networks will be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
worthless. If the telephone companies fail to supply it, they risk losing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
most of the fastest growing parts of their business: the data traffic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
which already contributes some 50 percent of their profits. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
also a possibility that they will lose much of their potential consumer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
business as well: the planned profits in pay-per-view films and electronic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
yellow pages. This is the message of a second great prophet of dark fiber,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Will Hicks of Southbridge, Massachusetts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A venerable inventor of scores of optical products, Hicks believes<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that Green's view of the future of fiber is too limited. Using wavelength<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
division, Hicks can see the way to deliver some 500 megahertz two-way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
connections to all the homes in America for some $400 per home. That is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fifty times the 10 megahertz total capacity of an Ethernet (with no one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
else using it) for some 20 percent of the cost. That is capacity in each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
home for twenty digital two-way HDTV channels at once at perhaps half the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cost of new telephone connections. Then, after a large consumer market<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
emerges for fiber optics, Hicks believes, Green's sophisticated computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services will follow as a matter of course.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The consumer market, Hicks maintains, is the key to lowering the cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of the components to a level where they can be widely used in office<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
networks as well. He cites the example of the compact disk laser diode.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Once lasers were large and complex devices, chilled with liquid nitrogen,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and costing thousands of dollars; now they are as small as a grain of salt,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
cheap as a box of cereal, and more numerous than phonograph needles. An<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
executive at Hitachi told Hicks that Hitachi could work a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation on laser diodes and amplifiers for all optical networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Just tell me what price you want to pay and I'll tell you how many
you<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have to buy.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The divergence of views between the IBM executive and the wildcat<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
inventor, however, is far less significant than their common vision of dark<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fiber as the future of communications. By the power of ever cheaper<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
bandwidth, it will transform all industries of the coming information age<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
just as radically as the power of cheaper transistors transformed the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries of the computer age.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
For the telephone companies, the age of ever smarter terminals<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mandates the emergence of ever dumber networks. This is a major strategic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge; it takes a smart man to build a dumb network. But the telcos<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
have the best laboratories and have already developed nearly all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
components of the fibersphere.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Telephone companies may complain of the large costs of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transformation of their system, but they command capital budgets as large<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as the total revenues of the cable industry. Telcos may recoil in horror<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
at the idea of dark fiber, but they command webs of the stuff ten times<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
larger than any other industry. Dumb and dark networks may not fit the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company self-image or advertising posture. But they promise larger<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
markets than the current phone company plan to choke off their future in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the labyrinthine nets of an &quot;intelligent switching fabric&quot; always
behind<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
schedule and full of software bugs.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The telephone companies cannot expect to impose a uniform network<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
governed by universal protocols. The proliferation of digital protocols<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and interfaces is an inevitable effect of the promethean creativity of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer industry. Green explains, &quot;You cannot fix the protocol zoo.
You<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
must use bandwidth to accommodate the zoo.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As Robert Pokress, a former switch designer at Bell Labs now head of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Unifi Corporation, points out, telephone switches (now 80 percent software)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are already too complex to keep pace with the efflorescence of relatively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
simple computer technology on their periphery. While computers become ever<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more lean and mean, turning to reduced instruction set processors, networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
need to adopt reduced instruction set architectures. The ultimate in dumb<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
and dark is the fibersphere now incubating in their magnificent<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laboratories.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The entrepreneurial folk in the computer industry may view this<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wrenching phone company adjustment with some satisfaction. But the fact
is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that computer companies face a strategic reorientation as radical as the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telcos do. In a world where ever smarter terminals require ever dumber<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communications, computer networks are as gorged and glutted with smarts
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
phone company networks and even less capacious. The nation's most<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
brilliant nerds, commanding the 200 MIPS Silicon Graphics superstations
or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Mac Quadra multimedia power plants, humbly kneel before the 50 kilobit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
lines of the Internet and beseech the telcos to upgrade to 64 kilobit basic<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ISDN.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now addicted to the use of transistors to solve the problems of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limited bandwidth, the computer industry must use transistors to exploit<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the opportunities of nearly unlimited bandwidth. When home-based machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are optimized for manipulating high resolution digital video at high<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speeds, they will necessarily command what are now called supercomputer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
powers. This will mean that the dominant computer technology will emerge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
first not in the office market but in the consumer market. The major<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
challenge for the computer industry is to change its focus from a few<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
hundred million offices already full of computer technology to a billion<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
living rooms now nearly devoid of it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Cable companies possess the advantage of already owning dumb networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
based on the essentials of the all optical model of broadcast and select--<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of customers seeking wavelengths or frequencies rather than switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
circuits. Cable companies already provide all the programs to all the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
terminals and allow them to tune in to the desired messages. Uniquely in<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the world, U.S. cable firms already offer a broadband pipe to ninety<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
percent of American homes. These coaxial cables, operating at one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
gigahertz for several hundred feet, provide the basis for two way broadband<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
services today. But the cable industry cannot become a full service<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
supplier of telecommunications until it changes its self-image from a cheap<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
provider of one way entertainment services into a common carrier of two
way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information. Above all, the cable industry cannot succeed in the digital<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
age if it continues to regard the personal computer as an alien and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
irrelevant machine.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Analogous to the integrated circuit in its economic power, the all<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optical network is analogous to the massively parallel computer in its<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technical paradigm. In the late 1980s in computers, the effort to make one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor function ever faster on a serial stream of data reached a point<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of diminishing returns. Superpipelining and superscalar gains hit their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
limits. Despite experiments with Josephson Junctions, high electron<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
mobility, and cryogenics, usable transistors simply could not made to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
switch much faster than a few gigahertz.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Computer architects responded by creating machines with multiple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processors operating in parallel on multiple streams of data. While each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
processor worked more slowly than the fastest serial processors, thousands<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of slow processors in parallel could far outperform the fastest serial<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Measured by cost effectiveness, the massively parallel machines<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dwarfed the performance of conventional supercomputers.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The same pattern arose in communications and for many of the same<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
reasons. In the early 1990s the effort to increase the number of bits that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
could be time division multiplexed down a fiber on a single frequency band<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
had reached a point of diminishing returns. Again the switching speed of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
transistors was the show stopper. The architects of all optical networks<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
responded by creating systems which can use not one wavelength or frequency<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
but potentially thousands in parallel.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Again, the new systems could not outperform time division multiplexing<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
on one frequency. But all optical networks opened up a vast vista of some<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
75 thousand gigahertz of frequencies potentially usable for communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That immense potential of massively parallel frequencies left all methods<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of putting more bits on a single set of frequencies look as promising as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
launching computers into the chill of outer space in order to accelerate<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
their switching speeds.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Just as the law of the microcosm made all terminals smart,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
distributing intelligence from the center to the edges of the network, so<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the law of the telecosm creates a network dumb enough to accommodate the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
incredible onrush of intelligence on its periphery. Indeed, with the one<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
chip supercomputer on the way, manufacturable for under a hundred dollars<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
toward the end of the decade, the law of the microcosm is still gaining<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
momentum. The fibersphere complements the promise of ubiquitous computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
power with equally ubiquitous communications.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What happens, however, when not only transistors but also wires are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
nearly free? As Robert Lucky observes in his forward to Paul Green's book,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Many of us have been conditioned to think that transmission is inherently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
expensive; that we should use switching and processing wherever possible
to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
minimize transmission.&quot; This is the law of the microcosm. But as Lucky<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
speculates, &quot;The limitless bandwidth of fiber optics changes these<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assumptions. Perhaps we should transmit signals thousands of miles to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
avoid even the simplest processing function.&quot; This is the law of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
telecosm: use bandwidth to simplify everything else.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Daniel Hillis of Thinking Machines Corporation offers a similar<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
vision, adding to Lucky's insight the further assertion that massively<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
parallel computer architectures are so efficient that they can overthrow<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the personal computer revolution. Hillis envisages a powerplant computer<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
model, with huge Thinking Machines at the center tapped by millions of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively dumb terminals.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
All these speculations assume that the Law of the Telecosm usurps the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Law of the Microcosm. But in fact the two concepts function in different<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
ways in different domains.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Electronic transistors use electrons to control, amplify, or switch<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons. But photonics differ radically from electronics. Because<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moving photons do not affect one another on contact, they cannot readily
be<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
used to control, amplify, or switch each other. Compared to electrons,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
moreover, photons are huge: infrared photons at 1550 or 1300 nanometers<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
are larger than a micron across. They resist the miniaturization of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
microcosm. For computing, photons are far inferior to electrons. With<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
single electron electronics now in view, electrons will keep their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
advantage. For the foreseeable future, computers will be made with<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrons.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
What are crippling flaws for photonic computing, however, are huge<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
assets for communicating. Because moving photons do not collide with each<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
other or respond to electronic charges, they are inherently a two way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
medium. They are immune to lightning strikes, electromagnetic pulses, or<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electrical power surges that destroy electronic equipment. Virtually<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
noiseless and massless pulses of radiation, they move as fast and silently<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
as light.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Listening to the technology, as Caltech prophet Carver Mead<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
recommends, one sees a natural division of labor between photonics and<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Photonics will dominate communications and electronics will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dominate computing. The two technologies do not compete; they are<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
beautiful complements of each other.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The law of the microcosm makes distributed computers (smart terminals)<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
more efficient regardless of the cost of linking them together. The law
of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the telecosm makes dumb and dark networks more efficient regardless of how<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
numerous and smart are the terminals. Working together, however, these two<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
laws of wires and switches impel ever more widely distributed information<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It is the narrow bandwidth of current phone company connections that<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
explains the persistence of centralized computing in a world of distributed<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
machines. Narrowband connections require smart interfaces and complex<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
protocols and expensive data. Thus you get your online information from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
only a few databases set up to accommodate queries over the phone lines.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You limit television broadcasting to a few local stations. Using the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
relatively narrowband phone network or television system, it pays to<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
concentrate memory and processing at one point and tap into the hub from<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousands of remote locations.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Using a broadband fiber system, by contrast, it will pay to distribute<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
memory and services to all points on the network. Broadband links will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
foster specialization. If the costs of communications are low, databases,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
libraries, and information services can specialize and be readily reached<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
by customers from anywhere. On line services lose the economies of scale<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
that lead a firm such as Dialog to attempt to concentrate most of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
world's information in one set of giant archives.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By making bandwidth nearly free, the new integrated circuit of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere will radically change the environment of all information<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
industries and technologies. In all eras, companies tend to prevail by<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
maximizing the use of the cheapest resources. In the age of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fibersphere, they will use the huge intrinsic bandwidth of fiber, all 25<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
thousand gigahertz or more, to replace nearly all the hundreds of billions<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dollars worth of switches, bridges, routers, converters, codecs,<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
compressors, error correctors, and other devices, together with the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
trillions of lines of software code, that pervade the intelligent switching<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
fabric of both telephone and computer networks.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The makers of all this equipment will resist mightily. But there is<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
no chance that the old regime can prevail by fighting cheap and simple<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
optics with costly and complex electronics and software.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical network will triumph for the same reason that the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
integrated circuit triumphed: it is incomparably cheaper than the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
competition. Today, measured by the admittedly rough metric of MIPS per<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
dollar, a personal computer is more than one thousand times more cost<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
effective than a mainframe. Within 10 years, the all optical network will<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
be millions of times more cost effective than electronic networks. Just
as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the electron rules in computers, the photon will rule the waves of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
communication.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The all optical ideal will not immediately usurp other technologies.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Vacuum tubes reached their highest sales in the late 1970s. But just as<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
the IC inexorably exerted its influence on all industries, the all optical<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
technology will impart constant pressure on all other communications<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
systems. Every competing system will have to adapt to its cost structure.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In the end, almost all electronic communications will go through the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
wringer and emerge in glass.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
This is the real portent of the dark fiber case wending its way<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
through the courts. The future of the information age depends on the rise<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
of dumb and dark networks to accommodate the onrush of ever smarter<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
electronics. Ultimately at stake is nothing less than the future of the<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
computer and communications infrastructure of the U.S. economy, its<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
competitiveness in world markets, and the consummation of the age of<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
information. Although the phone companies do not want to believe it, their<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
future will be dark.

The current immigration debate founders on ignorance of one huge fact: Without
immigration, the U.S. would not exist as a world power. Without immigration,
the U.S. could not have produced the computerized weapons that induced the
Soviet Union to surrender in the arms race. Without immigration, the U.S.
could not have built the atomic bomb during World War II, or the hydrogen
bomb in the early 1950s, or the MIRVs in the 1970s or the cruise missiles
for the Gulf War in the 1990s. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Today, immigrants are vital not only for targeted military projects but
also for the wide range of leading-edge ventures in an information age economy.
No less than military superiority in previous eras, U.S. industrial dominance
and high standards of living today depend on outsiders. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Every high-technology company, big or small is like a Manhattan Project.
All must mobilize the personnel best trained and most able to perform a
specific function, and deliver a product within a window of opportunity
as fateful and remorseless as a war deadline. This requires access to the
small elite of human beings in the world capable of pioneering these new
scientific and engineering frontiers. For many specialized high-technology
tasks, the pool of potential talent around the world numbers about 10 people,
or even fewer. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
The Right People </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
If you are running such a technology company, you will quickly discover
that the majority of this cognitive elite are not citizens of your country.
Unless you can find the right people wherever they may be, you will not
be able to launch the exotic innovation that changes the world. Unless you
can fill the key technology jobs, you will not create any other jobs at
all, and your country will forgo the cycle of new products, skills, and
businesses that sustain a world-leading standard of living. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Discussing the impact of immigration, economists and their followers are
beady-eyed gnatcatchers, expert on the movement of cabbage pickers and au
pair girls and the possible impact of Cubans on Miami wage levels. But like
hunters in a cartoon, they ignore the tyrannosaurus rex crouching behind
them. Thus sophisticated analysts, such as George Borjas of the University
of California, San Diego, and artful writers, such as Peter Brimelow, conclude
that the impact of immigration on the U.S. economy is slight or negligible.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
In fact, the evidence in overwhelming and undeniable; it is all around us,
in a spate of inventions and technical advances, from microwaves and air
bags to digital cable and satellite television, from home computers and
air conditioners to cellular phones and life saving pharmaceuticals and
medical devices. Without immigration over the last 50 years, I would estimate
that the U.S. real living standards would be at least 40% lower. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The underplaying of immigration as an economic force stems from a basic
flaw in macroeconomic analysis. Economists fail to account for the indispensable
qualitative effects of genius. Almost by definition, genius is the ability
to generate unique products and concepts and bring them to fruition. Geniuses
are literally thousands of times more productive than the rest of us. We
all depend on them for our livelihoods and opportunities. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The feats of genius are necessarily difficult to identify or predict, except
in retrospect. But judging from the very rough metric of awards of mathematical
doctorates and other rigorous scientific and engineering degrees, prizes,
patents, and publications, about a third of the geniuses in the U.S. are
foreign born, and another 20% are the offspring of immigrants. A third of
all American Nobel Prize winners, for example were born overseas. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A stellar example of these elates in action is Silicon Valley in California.
Silicon Valley companies have reduced the price of computer MIPs and memory
bits by a factor of some 10,000 in 2 1/2 decades. Although mainstream economists
neglect to measure the qualitative impact of these innovations, most of
the new value in the world economy over the last decade has stemmed, directly
or indirectly, from the semiconductor and computer industries, both hardware
and software. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Consider Intel Corp. Together with its parent Fairchild Semiconductor, Intel
developed the basic processes of microchip manufacture and created dynamic
and static random access memory. In other words, Intel laid the foundations
for the personal computer revolution and scores of other chip-bases industries
that employ the vast bulk of U.S. engineers today. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Two American born geniuses, Robert Noyce and Gordon Moore, were key founders
of Fairchild and Intel. But their achievements would have been impossible
without the help of Jean Hourni, inventor of planar processing; Dov Frohmann-Benchkowski,
inventor of electrically erasable programmable ROMs; Federico Faggin, inventor
of silicon gate technology and builder of the first microprocessor; Mayatoshi
Shima, layout designer of key 8086 family devices; and of course Andrew
Grove, the company's now revered CEO who solved several intractable problems
of the metal oxide silicon technology at the heart of Intel's growth. All
these Intel engineers - and hundreds of other key contributors - were immigrants.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The pattern at Intel was repeated throughout Silicon Valley, from National
Semiconductor and Advanced Micro Devices to Applied Materials, LSI Logic,
Actel, Atmel, Integrated Device Technologies, Xicor, Cypress, Sun Microsystems
and Hewlett-Packard, all of which from the outset heavily depended on immigrants
in the laboratories and on engineering work benches. LSI, IDT, Actel, Atmel,
Xicor, and Sun were all founded or led by immigrants. Today, fully one-third
of all the engineers in Silicon Valley are foreign born. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now, with Silicon Valleys proliferating throughout the U.S. economy, with
Silicon Deserts, Prairies, Mountains, and even Alleys being hopefully launched
from Manhattan to Oregon, immigration becomes ever more vital to the future
of the U.S. economy. And microchips are just the beginning. On the foundation
of silicon have arisen world-leading software and medical equipment industries
almost equally dependent on immigrants. As spearhead of the fastest growing
U.S. industry, software, Microsoft offers some of the most coveted jobs
in the U.S. economy. But for vital functions, it still must turn to immigrants
for 5% of its domestic work force, despite the difficult and expensive legal
procedures required to import an alien. 
<H4><BR>
<BR>
Freedom of Enterprise </H4>
<BR>
<BR>
In recent congressional testimony, Ira Rubenstein, a Microsoft attorney,
declared that immigration bars could jeopardize the 58% of its revenue generated
overseas, threaten American dominance of advance &quot;client-server&quot;
business applications, and render &quot;stillborn&quot; the information
superhighway. In particular, Corning and other producers of fiber-optic
technology have faced a severe shortage of native engineers equipped to
pursue this specialty crucial to both telecommunications and medical instruments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
With U.S. high school students increasingly shunning mathematics and the
hard sciences, America is the global technology and economic leader in spite
of, not because of , any properties of the American gene pool or dominant
culture. America prevails only because it offers the freedom of enterprise
and innovation to people from around the world. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
A decision to cut back legal immigration today, as Congress is contemplating,
is a decision to wreck the key element of the American technological miracle.
After botching the issues of telecom deregulation and tax rate reduction,
and wasting a year on Hooverian myths about the magic of a balanced budget,
the Republican Congress now proposes to issue a deadly body blow to the
intellectual heart of U.S. growth. Congress must not cripple the new Manhattan
Projects of the U.S. economy in order to pursue some xenophobic and archaic
dream of ethnic purity and autarky.

Washington Post columnist William Raspberry</A></H5>
<BR>
<HR>Dinesh D'Souza is currently the perplexed benificiary and victim of
an uproar over his book <I>&quot;The End of Racism,&quot;</I> which emerged
in the midst of a momentous furor over the centrality of race in America.
Except for the always bravely Olympian sage Thomas Sowell, even conservative
blacks have fiercely renounced much of his argument along with his intemperate
language. How can anyone deny the power of racism in the face of the taped
ruminations of Mark Fuhrman, the rhetoric of Louis Farrakhan the indignant
voices at the Million Man March, the radical split between the races reacting
to the acquittal of O.J. Simpson? <BR>
<BR>
I know how Mr. D'Souza feels. In 1979, I published a book called <I>&quot;Visible
Man: A True Story of Post Racist American.&quot;</I> Now this book is being
republished by the ICS Press in San Francisco. <I><A HREF="visible.html">&quot;Visible
Man&quot;</A></I> showed that white racism was not a significant problem
for American blacks in the late 1970's. If white racism was not much of
a problem in 1978, it is manifestly not a problem in 1995. <BR>
<H4>Black Achievement </H4>
<BR>
Neither I nor Mr. D'Souza denies the existence of racial feelings in America
and throughout the world. But far from being hostile to black achievement,
American whites celebrate blacks at every opportunity. In the truest test,
governed by messive voluntary choices in the marketplace, Americans have
made the National Basketball Association, 80% black, the most popular sports
league, Whitney Houston the most popular and richest American singer, Bill
Cosby the most popular and richest comedian, and Oprah Winfrey the most
prosperous entertainer. Far from showing racism, American employers, mostly
white, have given black women higher earnings, on average, than comparable
white women. Between 1973 and 1994, the current-dollar revenues of the top
100 black owned industrial companies, as listed by <I>Black Enterprise</I>
magazine, rose from $473 million to $6.7 billion, plus $4.9 billion in revenues
from auto dealerships. Blacks in America have far outperformed blacks in
any other society with a substantial black population. <BR>
<BR>
In my view, the most important finding in <I>&quot;The Bell Curve&quot;</I>
by Richard Herrnstein and Charles Murray was that after controlling for
age, IQ and gender, the average full-time worker actually out-earns the
average white by 1%. Let the IQ number stand for real educational attainment
(as opposed to degrees in easier subjects and from less rigorous institutions),
and it is clear that racial discrimination no longer limits black earnings.
A more appropriate standard, though, would include a correction for marital
status, since married men of all races earn some 30% more than single men
of the same age and credentials. Correcting the Murray figures for marital
status gives black men a dramatic edge in earnings over white men. Although
such comparisons are full of pitfalls, it is safe to say that black men
in the U.S. today earn more, not less, than truly comparable whites. <BR>
<BR>
Rather than admit this reality, the intelligentsia, black and white, would
rather pusue fantasies of racial hatred. As I discovered during appearances
related to the original publication of <I>&quot;Visible Man,&quot;</I> and
as Mr. D'Souza is now learning, denial of racism today is widely seen as
evidence of it. In the face of the fury of the charges of bigotry, whites
find it easier to go along than to tell the truth. <BR>
<BR>
Public opinion polls, for example, show that the beating of Rodney King
galvanized a newly intense feeling of alienation among blacks in America.
Yet anyone, regardless of race, who took the police on an eight- mile, high-speed
chase, and then charged at them at the end, should be grateful if he is
not shot (rather than beaten). Sensible people learn not to defy or insult
police officers who are performing an inevitably messy and treacherous job
under tremendous strain. Yet the white media almost unanimously confirmed
the black outrage. Today whites indulge the idea of reasonable doubt in
the Simpson trial, as if it were possible that a team of policemen would
or could contrive an instant frame-up of a supremely popular black athelete.
<BR>
<BR>
In effect, all America treats blacks as children who cannot be told the
truth. From Harvard Law School deans to ghetto social workers; from the
chairman of the New York Times to the editors of Time magazine, to the steady
drumbeat of three broadcast networks, eminent whites are constantly confirming
blacks in the crippling comfort of their belief in white racism. <BR>
<BR>
If racism explains next to nothing about black poverty and crime, what does
explain it? What is the real cause, so unspeakably unwelcome that it drives
opinion toward almost any other explanation, however false or unsavory?
The chief cause of black poverty is welfare state feminism. Thirty years
of affirmative action programs have artificially elevated black women into
economic power over black men. <BR>
<BR>
This regime prevailed from the highest levels of the economy, where black
female college graduates with five years on the job significantly outearned
black men in 1991, to the underclass, where a typical package of welfare
benefits produced disposable income 28% above a typical job in 1994. It
prevailed on college campuses, where more than 60% of the blacks are women.
It dominated government job training programs, where girls are found to
benefit far more than boys. It even invaded such male bastions as the cockpits
of fighter planes, police squad cars, fire stations, construction sites
and university athletic teams. In a grotesque abuse of the Civil Rights
Act of 1964, judges have interpreted Title IX of the 1972 amendments as
requiring academic institutions, in effect, to retrench scholarships and
opportunities for superior black male athletes to advance the careers of
measurably inferior female athletes, white and black, soley on the basis
of sex. <BR>
<BR>
It is an unpopular fact of life that in all societies and in all races monogamous
marriage is based on patriarchal sex roles, with men the dominant provider.
Welfare state feminism destroyed black families by ravaging the male role
of provider. <BR>
<BR>
Some observers claim that black communities benefit from matriarchal institutions.
Looking more closely, however, you will find inner cities implacably ruled
by gangs of young men, with the &quot;matriarchs&quot; cowering in their
triple bolted apartments in fear of them. <BR>
<BR>
Men either dominate as providers or predators. There is hardly any other
option. The key problem of the underclass - the crucible of crime, the source
of violence, the root of poverty - is the utter failure of socialization
of young men through marriage. The problem resides in the nexus of men and
marriage. Yet nearly all the attention, subsidies, training opportunities
and therapies of the welfare state focus on helping women function without
marriage. The welfare state attacks the problem of the absence of husbands
by rendering husbands as entirely superfluous. &quot;Welfare reform&quot;
continues the policy giving welfare mothers new training and child care
benefits and further obviating marriage by pursuing unmarried fathers with
deadbeat dad campaigns. <BR>
<BR>
Today, in large American cities, fully 40% of young black men between the
ages of 17 and 35 are in prison, on probation, or on the lam; and some 40%
of young black women say they have been forced into unwanted sexual activity.
To fear young black males has become a mandate for survival on the streets
of many American cities. This unspeakable social tragedy - with all its
infuriating reverberations on law-abiding balck citizens - is the inevitavble
harvest of government policy. <BR>
<BR>
<H4>The Great Fiasco </H4>
<BR>
Even Margaret Mead recognized that in all cultures family values depend
on religious supports and male providers. The effort to unculcate ethical
behavior and sustain marriage without religious faith is the great fiasco
of the modern age. In order to relieve the pain of the poor, our soicety
must come to recognize that their problem is not lack of jobs or lack of
money but moral anarchy originating with the establishment and most sorely
victimizing blacks. <BR>
<BR>
With both the black and white establishments and even the leading Christian
churches succumbing to the siren appeal of unisex policy, what could be
more predictable than the emergence of patriarchal religion - however offensive
in some ways - as a galvanizing force among black men. If Mr. Farrakhan
is deeply culpable for his ethnic fanaticism, surely the entire U.S. establishment
is equally culpable for its fanatical assault on family roles. For all races,
patriarchal religion has played a central role in human civilization. Patriarchal
black churches, from Father Divines' mid-century movement to Christian fundamentalists
and Black muslims today - have served more as part of the solution than
as part of the problem of black poverty. <BR>
<BR>
These lessons have become increasingly relevant to whites who imagine that
they can sustain a civilization based on secular liberation from monogamous
sex roles. As the white illegitimacy rate moves toward the level reached
by blacks at the time of the Moynihan Report - and decisively surpasses
it in Britain - the events of recent weeks should ring a tocsin for all
Americans. <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
What's wrong with welfare? Here's an answer you haven't heard: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The key problem of the welfare culture is not unemployed women with
illegitimate children. It is the women's skewed and traumatic relationships
with men and boys. In a reversal of the usual pattern in civilized socieitie,
the women have the income and the ties to government authority and support.
The men are economically and socially subordinate.... This balance of power
virtually prohibits marriage which is everywhere based on the provider role
of men counterbalancing the sexual and domestic superiority of women.&quot;
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I almost don't want to mention the source of this arresting notion - conservative
<A HREF="gildrbio.html">George Gilder</A> writing in the conservative American
Spectator (June 1995) - for fear that the name and affiliation might lead
some readers to suspend thought. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
You see, of course, where Gilder is headed: Men, he believes, are the key
to strong families. And they are, the more successful welfare is - even
if it leads women to jobs, child care and improved earnings - the worse
it will be for families, because it will &quot;render the men still more
optional, desperate, feral, and single.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Does any of this make sense? How would I feel, hearing this indispensable-man
argument, if I were female - especially if I were a single mother? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Already there has been a stream of books and articles (several of the latter
by me) arguing the negative effects of absent fathers on children and on
communities, or contending that the breakdown of marriage is the leading
indicator of social pathology, or otherwise calling for reclamation of men
and boys as the means of rescuing society. The Million Man March only underscored
the notion. Women must be wondering what makes us think men are God's primary
gift? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Well, Gilder isn't quite saying we are. What he is saying is that children
need their fathers, too - and so do their mothers - and that welfare almost
calculatedly drives the men away, perpetuating both the worst effects of
welfare and the need for it. Listen: <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;The entire welfare state - from Donna Shalala to Bob Dole's Senate
offices - is relentlessly feminist, mandating preferences for women on construction
sites, in police cruisers, in Air Force jets and in athletic scholarships.
These programs necessarily concentrate their job incentives, training benefits,
and subsidies on women rather than on men because, in general, it is only
the mothers who are on welfare. The fathers use the apartments and take
the money of a series of welfare mothers, usually without joining the dole.
Thus the recipients of welfare-related work will mainly be women. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;But we know from reams of studies and centuries of experience that
only fathers can satisfactorily sustain families, reliably discipline teen-age
boys, and lift a community from poverty. The idea that welfare mothers can
do it while the government raises their children is incredibly naive....
The very idea that women with small children should work outside the home
is perverse. The welfare state has already deprived these children of fathers.
The workfare state proposes to take away the mothers as well.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Implicit in Gilder's analysis is his thesis of woman as civilizer of naturally
predatory man. How does she do it? By demanding commitment (which she needs)
in exchange for sex (his priority). Welfare eliminates the economic basis
for the commitment. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Unless they are tamed by marriage and the provider role,&quot; he
says, &quot;men become enemies of civilization and revert to their primordial
role as predators.&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Is this blame-shifting drivel, as some surely will contend? Or has Gilder
found the virus that is killing our families and our communities? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
He says it too harshly and too categorically, perhaps, but I think he is
on to something. The natural promiscuity of men combined with the increasing
unnecessity of men (except for sex) produces a breed frighteningly close
to Gilder's description of &quot;optional, desperate, feral and single.&quot;
We have to make men necessary again. <BR>

<P>In the oceanic sweep of the information age, the once separate streams
of computers and telecom are converging into new digital floods of innovation
that shift as inexorably as the tides of the sea. As we rush toward a millennial
crest of invention, a new tidal shift is at hand.<BR>
<BR>
At the heart of this shift is not the computer industry, which has long
ruled supreme, but the telecom equipment industry. Because average citizens
have always preferred communicating to computing, the shift from computers
to networks will transform the fruits of progress - once chiefly accessible
from the lofty reaches of the elite - to an everyday harvest as popular
and ubiquitous as the phone.<BR>
<BR>
The latest cycles began in the years following the Second World War, when
the telecommunications industry spearheaded research that brought such key
advances as the transistor and the laser. Over the last forty years, the
computer industry has ridden the transistor to dominance in the information
economy. New laser-based breakthroughs in fiber optics, however, now promise
to turn the tide again toward telephony. While the computer will still be
king, the network will become the computer.<BR>
<BR>
The siege of computer progress has been sustained over the last twenty years
by Moore's Law, based on the famous prophecy by Intel founder Gordon Moore
in 1978 that the number of transistors on a single chip would double every
eighteen months. Implicit in Moore's Law is a similar doubling every eighteen
months in computer power: the number of millions of instructions per second
(MIPS) that a single microprocessor or personal computer could perform.<BR>
<BR>
But the epoch of Moore's Law dominance is now ending. The silicon microcosm
- the physical source of innovation in microchips and computers - is giving
way to the optical telecosm and its even more rapid pace of advance in communications
power.<BR>
<BR>
Signaling the transition from microcosm to telecosm is one key metric: the
performance of publicly available networks compared to the performance of
the internal computer buses that connect microprocessor central processing
units (CPUs) to memories, hard drives, keyboards, and monitors. Today, new
fiber optics and Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) systems being launched
by leading telco suppliers are overthrowing the key foundations of computer
industry supremacy on the leading edges of innovation. Now in view, as early
as next year, is a bandwidth crossover point where the communications power
of widely available telephone networks will surpass for the first time the
communications power of the internal buses of personal computers.<BR>
<BR>
During the 1980s, while telecom bandwidth apparently stagnated, North American
phone companies installed some ten million miles of optical fiber - in effect,
a new bandwidth infrastructure in North America. So far, less than one-millionth
of the potential communications power of this fiber has been delivered to
customers.<BR>
<BR>
Now this potential bandwidth is about to erupt as a kinetic force of change
in the information economy. Telephone companies plan to increase the maximum
bandwidth of corporate services from the current 2.4 gigabits per second
to 40 gigabits per second in 1997. They will quadruple capacity, and quadruple
it again within the next three years.<BR>
<BR>
The explosion of bandwidth, however, will not transform the information
economy until it is delivered to people's homes. Delivery of the new tides
of bandwidth requires that telcos commanding advanced fiber and switch capabilities
collaborate with cable companies possessing broadband lines to homes.<BR>
<BR>
The most important short-term bandwidth expander is ATM. It radically simplifies
the switching problem by putting all information in uniform 53-byte cells
that can be processed entirely in silicon chips without time-consuming access
to memory and software. With guaranteed delivery of cells on a fixed schedule
soon to reach a pace of 2.4 gigabits a second, ATM can manage multimedia
voice, data, and video all at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
These new technologies can largely eclipse the difference between an internal
hard drive and a remote archive or digital library. PCs will be able to
tap databases and libraries across the world as readily as they can reach
their own hard disks or CD-ROM drives.<BR>
<BR>
For manufacturers of telecom equipment, this new architecture provides huge
opportunities to launch new ATM systems on every scale, new network hardware
and software, and new optical communications equipment. The companies that
truly grasp that the network is the computer, and invest in the infrastructure
of the new networked economy, will dominate the decade.<BR>
<BR>
However, amid these torrents of bandwidth abundance, the greatest rewards
will accrue to people around the globe, joining the ever-expanding circles
of prosperity in an age of information.<BR>
<BR>
Many skeptics suggest that the new technologies will chiefly favor the already
prosperous and powerful in the industrialized countries. But the first beneficiaries
of the new age are Asian nations, from India and Malaysia to Indonesia and
China. Trapped in Third World poverty as recently as two decades ago, they
are now supplying crucial components to major telecom and computer companies
and leading the world in rates of economic growth.<BR>
<BR>
Over the next decade, digital networks will provide a new central nervous
system for the world economy. Transformed by convergence and computerization,
TV will burst forth in a new flowering of choice and empowerment. An abundance
of multimedia choices can remedy and reverse the cultural debacle of mass
market television. Transcending the current programming of the lowest common
denominator, video culture will effloresce into a plethora of products as
rich and various as books and magazines.<BR>
<BR>
Great cities will give up their current role as hives of industry and emerge
as havens of social activity and entertainment. On the network, an inner-city
child in public housing can pursue a curriculum far richer in learning resources
and far better adapted to personal needs and aptitudes than the program
of an elite suburban school today. Equipped with ATM and fiber-optic links,
small towns will become creative centers in the information economy. Productive
citizens will retreat to rural redoubts and reach out to global markets
and communities. Hollywood and Wall Street will become historic curiosities
as their businesses diffuse to all points of the continent and the globe.<BR>
<BR>
Perfectly targeted to the most acute problems of the era, the new technologies
can reverse the spirals of decay afflicting many institutions and communities.
Traffic and pollution, ignorance and waste, can all give way to worldwide
webs of glass and light. <BR>
<BR>
The home will re-emerge as an industrial center, with marriages gaining
new roles and meanings around the evolving silicon hearths of a new cottage
economy, thus strengthening family values.<BR>
<BR>
Lowering the costs and raising the effectiveness of medical care will be
the on-line house call, sharing scarce diagnostic tools, tapping remote
specialists, and bringing busy doctors back to the patients' bedsides in
targeted teleconferences.<BR>
<BR>
Throughout all these changes, one theme will triumph: the empowerment of
individual families and customers against remote and irresponsible organizations.
In essence, people will no longer settle for whatever or whoever is playing
on the tube or at the mall or in the local corporate center. Instead, they
will seek out and command their first choices in jobs, culture, entertainment,
and religion.<BR>
<BR>
Ranging across continents to find the best colleagues for every major project,
workers will scale new pinnacles of productivity and wealth. A culture of
first choices will evince a bias toward excellence rather than a bias toward
the mediocre, the vulgar, or the vicious.<BR>
<BR>
The age of mass manufacturing, mass marketing, and mass media brought capital
and labor together in vast pyramidal corporations, tying workers to the
machine and the tube. The explosive centrifuge of the telecosm will burst
these chains of industrial concentration. Yielding single-chip supercomputers
linked in global broadband networks, these technologies fling intelligence
beyond the boundaries of every top-down institution and machine-age social
system.<BR>
<BR>
Bandwidth abundance not only fuels the advance of electronics; it also galvanizes
the growth of economies. The new media extend the webs of news and interconnection
that nourish markets and expand opportunity. <BR>
<BR>
Lavishing the exponential gains of networks, endowing old jobs with newly
productive tools, and unleasing creativity with increasingly fertile and
targeted capital, the advance of the telecosm offers unprecedented hope
to the masses of people who the industrial revolution passed by.<BR>
<BR>
Rather than giving millions of viewers access to five hundred channels of
one-way TV, the new technology will give all users two-way teleconferencing
with colleagues regardless of where they are - reading documents and books,
sharing multimedia experiences, consulting with specialists on your rare
disease at the Mayo Clinic or Columbia, touring Venice and Vancouver the
same day, dallying simultaneously at the Louvre and the London Museum, designing
a new building with an architect in Israel or a new dress with a couturier
in Paris or a new chip with a guru in Silicon Valley.<BR>
<BR>
Through these channels, the poorest citizens will gain access to new worlds
of education, employment, entertainment, medical care, and communication
now commanded only by elites - a true transfer of power to the people everywhere.<BR>

<PRE>
What will happen over the next several years is that the external 
bandwidth of most computers--that is, the bandwidth of the 
asynchronous transfer mode networks that are being developed by 
some 600 companies and that are being deployed at an increasing 
pace--will be bigger than the internal bandwidth. And that will mean 
that computers will be able to tap remote databases and educational 
possibilities as readily as they tap their internal disk drives and CD-
ROMs. This means that, in a sense, the computer will hollow out, and 
the network will become the computer in a way that has never been 
true before. 


And the effect of this is that the Law of the Microcosm will join the 
Law of the Telecosm. The Law of the Microcosm says that if you take 
any number n transistors and put them on a single sliver of silicon, 
you get n-squared performance and value (thats one of the key 
exponentials that drive this era). The Law of the Telecosm says that 
if you take any number n computers and put them on a network you 
get n-squared performance and value, because each computer uses 
the network as a resource and is also a potential resource for the 
network.
	

And so the value of the network exponentially increases as the 
number of computers connected to it increases. And I think its the 
convergence of these two laws, both of which are central to the 
evolution of the computer industry, that will really shape the future. 
Its not going to be Hollywood executives who are going to be the 
chief drivers of the new age; they in fact will be victims of the new 
age. The chief drivers and the real winners are the computer and 
computer networking industries, as they interconnect Americas 
schools and colleges and homes into a truly new World Wide Web of 
glass and light. That is the real promise of the next era, and its going 
to happen faster than people expect, not more slowly. 


Theres still an optical illusion at the communications cliff at LANs 
end, but that can be quickly overcome by the use of cable 
technology--the coaxial that is already in the ground and connecting 
American homes, and particularly connecting to all the homes with 
computers. Last year there were some 26 million PCs in American 
homes, and 24 million of those homes had cable connections, and 
these cable connections are fully adequate to open the way for this 
transformation of the computer--the hollowing out of the computer, 
the moving of the computer onto the network, and the 
transformation of computer network architecture over the next 
decade.
	

So I think its a sure thing that education will be a much bigger 
market than entertainment. This is almost a certainty. Because 
education fits with computer technology, which is the driving force of 
this industry. But its not just the computer technology thats 
important, its the culture of the computer industry. Its the power of 
the commitment of increasing millions of citizens to this technology 
as a key channel for their creation of wealth and their advancement 
of learning.
	

And so its not just a technological issue, its a cultural issue, and 
the computer as a learning tool is a generator of wealth that will 
absorb an increasing share of our energies and creativity in the 
information age and will continue to expand its domain; whereas 
television will always be a disappointment because its essentially a 
diversion. It doesnt edify, it doesnt add to the national endowment, it 
tends to subtract from it. Its not the idiot box that will lead the U.S. 
into a new information age.


I think that the past years well-publicized efforts at convergence 
were really misconceived. US West and Bell Atlantic and Nynex 
turning to Hollywood talent agent Mike Ovitz is really rather 
pathetic, because when you think about it, if youre Mike Ovitz and 
you make a movie you really want it to go on everybodys conduit, 
whereas if youre Bell Atlantic and you run a network you want 
everybodys movies on that network. In other words, theres no 
benefit anymore from combining content and conduit in an era of 
truly broadband network. The exponential thrust comes from 
combining conduit with conduit, and allowing the people on the 
network to supply their own content to a great extent, in an 
entrepreneurial process thats almost entirely unpredictable.
	

But I think you can tell the general shape of the multimedia 
market that will emerge. It wont resemble Hollywood and it wont 
resemble broadcast television: It will resemble the book industry. 
There are about 80,000 books published every year in the United 
States, and the stores that are gaining share are the stores that offer 
the most choice. The key to the book industry is when a customer 
goes into a book store the customer gets his or her first choice. You 
get the book you want rather than a book thats been scheduled for 
you.
  

I think that same idea also gives us the key to finding the real 
opportunity in education in the information age. Students will get 
their first choice rather than some choice thats defined for them by 
some remote hierarchy. The power is migrating to the customer and 
that will be the driving force of the economy in the next decade, and 
it will be an exciting time.</PRE>

<PRE>An information technology visionary who writes compellingly about the 
relationship between technology and economics, George Gilder is the 
author of Microcosm: The Quantum Revolution in Economics and Technology 
(1989), Wealth and Poverty (1981), and numerous other works. His 1990 
book Life after Television: The Coming Transformation of Media and 
American Life is now being issued by W.W. Norton Co. in a revised 
paperback edition with five new chapters.

	Gilder has been a fellow of the John F. Kennedy School of 
Government at Harvard and is currently a senior fellow of the Discovery 
Institute in Seattle. He lectures widely across the Country and around 
the world and will be a featured speaker at the Educom'94 conference 
this fall in San Antonio. Educom Review caught up with him just as he 
was about to leave for Europe to present a speech at Cambridge 
University.

Educom Review: You've used &quot;A Convergence of Corpses&quot; as the title for 
the prologue to Life after Television, and you've said that mergers such 
as the one recently attempted by Bell Atlantic and TCI &quot;mostly miss the 
point of the digital age.&quot; Who are all these corpses, and how are all 
these mergers missing the point?

<B>GILDER</B>: The real driving force of all this information technology is the 
triumph of the computer. Just as the personal computer essentially 
displaced the mainframe over the past ten years, over the next ten years 
the personal computer will displace the television set, the telephone, 
and an array of other appliances. So companies that attempt to exploit 
the opportunities of convergence by converging with TV sets, for 
example, tend to fail, as 3DO seems already to have failed, precisely 
because of that mistake. Meanwhile, Creative Labs was based on a less 
exciting technology--a soundboard for the PC--but has become an enormous 
company riding the tremendous ascendancy of 
personal computing.

<B>ER</B>: So your advice to 3DO would have been . . . ?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, my advice at the time was that they had better get 
connected to computers and regard computers as the interactive 
appliance. If they focused on the TV set, they would lose. And that's 
what seems to have been happening.
Other errors are being made by companies that target the set-top box and 
devote an enormous amount of design effort to squeezing computing power 
into the price point and form factor of a consumer electronics set-top 
box. 

<B>ER</B>: Why did 3DO ignore your advice?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I guess they were just infatuated with television. They'd 
come from founding MTV, and they imagined TV as an instrument with a 
future that somehow commands larger markets than the personal computer. 

But personal computers in homes are increasing ten times faster than 
television sets, and PC owners spend fifteen hundred bucks for the 
device itself and then another fifteen hundred bucks on software and 
peripherals, and within that price point you can accomplish anything 
that a set-top box or game machine can accomplish. And if you have 
broadband connections, for example, over cable lines through a cable 
modem, the PC can do anything the TV can do and do it just as well. 

That's the key limitation today: bandwidth. As Andy Grove says, infinite 
processing power will get you only so far with limited bandwidth. The 
key to the next generation of computer development is coupling the 
personal computer with broadband networks. 

Today, the personal computer is crippled by its need to devote most of 
its MIPs [million instructions per second], or a large portion of them, 
to compressing and decompressing any images that it uses. Thus 
teleconferencing, for example, and video telephones are so drastically 
unsatisfactory because all the computer MIPs are devoted to compressing 
and decompressing rather than to real computer functions. 

Once the PC is connected to broadband networks, it will really ascend to 
its dominant level in homes as well as offices. And that will be the 
crucial opportunity for educational materials as well.

<B>ER</B>: You say in Life after Television that &quot;TV ignores the reality that 
people are not inherently couch potatoes; given a chance they talk back 
and interact.&quot; Then how do you explain some of the disappointments of 
interactivity, such as GTE's Cerritos project, or the US West/TCI 
project in Denver, neither of which seemed to gain much loyalty from its 
subscribers?

<B>GILDER</B>: The explanation is that they all use the TV, and the TV is 
inherently a couch potato device, which is particularly lame at 
presenting text. Yet text is a crucial part of multimedia communications 
and interactivity. Those projects made the same error that 3DO made: 
they converged with a corpse. Unless you're a necrophiliac, that's not 
particularly gratifying.

<B>ER</B>: Alan Kay used the phrase &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; to express the concern 
that the new media would be mass communications oriented and that 
literacy would fall apart.

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, any instrument that creates &quot;mouse potatoes&quot; is going to 
fail, because it's going to make people poorer. Markets expand in the 
long run only if they are absolutely central industries in the economy--
if they're creating capital rather than depleting it. TV in general 
dissipates and deflates human capital, and game machines are 
distractions that fail to edify their users. 

The people who use PCs generate wealth with them rather than merely 
distract themselves, so they're willing to invest a lot more effort into 
their PCs. They're willing to master the intricacies of use, and they're 
also willing to contribute to the development of further applications. 
In contrast, all these consumer electronics devices are mostly self-
limiting, because they don't contribute to wealth creation, but instead 
actually distract people from their career and their higher pursuits.

<B>ER</B>: By emphasizing the extent to which people are different, don't you 
run the risk of ignoring how much they are actually the same, that is, 
of ignoring what we might uncharitably call the herd instinct that 
dictates a lot of fashion, a lot of politics, and a lot of life?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think that people are the same in relatively lower-level 
ways, so if you have a medium that appeals chiefly to the way people are 
the same, they're going to gravitate increasingly to prurient interests, 
morbid fears and anxieties, and shocks and sensations. If you do that, 
the whole culture will become depraved--and I think that's what happened 
with the TV--whereas I think that if you appeal to people's special 
curiosities and hobbies and career interests and other ambitions--if you 
appeal to people's first choices rather than their lowest-common-
denominator choices--then the culture gravitates toward excellence 
rather than toward mediocrity, toward distinction rather than prurient 
interest and titillation.

<B>ER</B>: So what becomes of the herd instinct? Does it go away?
GILDER: There will always be certain things that people still want to do 
in large numbers, but in general it's people as individuals or as 
members of homes and families that can cement to more edifying 
disciplines. A mob can just say yes or no, whereas an individual can 
articulate, can express subtle and complex ideas, can respond to art, 
can aspire toward God. 

Rather than encouraging the mass tendencies of the population, we should 
be trying to counteract them and to educate the population. Education is 
a fulfillment of individual distinction and excellence; it shouldn't be 
a pandering to mass taste and appetites. And to the extent that schools 
do try to cater to their students rather than to teach them, the schools 
will fail and will contribute to the general deterioration of learning.

<B>ER</B>: If we think of life before television as the age of the amateur 
(with social life focused on the family piano, on amateur theater 
groups, on sandlot baseball games), and life during television as the 
age of the professional (with social life organized around boob tube 
performances by millionaire actors, comedians, athletes, and 
politicians), how should we think about the quality of life after 
television? Will it help us back to the idyllic past of the amateur? Or 
will it be better than our past as well our present?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think it will be better. I think the culture will take a form 
more resembling the book culture than the TV culture. There are 55,000 
books published in the United States every year. There's a religious 
book market as big as the trade book market, and each of those markets 
amount to about $2.5 billion. There are a huge number of successful 
technical books and career books, and there's a wide diversity of 
literature. I think the book market is a much better reflection of 
American culture than the TV market, which I think is a perversion of 
American culture. 

In general, the interactive media culture will resemble book culture and 
literary culture more than it will the current mass culture. You know, 
the people who produce mass culture are the ultimate elitists. I've 
often debated with them, and they'll say to me, &quot;You don't understand, 
George, the reason that the boob tube is an idiot box is that people 
really are boobs. We've done market research. We know they're boobs.&quot;

 Well, I think they just don't understand the business. Of course, 
confronted with the boob tube, we're all boobs; when I get into a hotel 
room at night and start clicking through channels, I get distracted by 
the shocks and sensations just as anyone else would. The critical fact 
is that a mass medium is no good whatsoever at conveying educated ideas; 
if it happens to convey a sophisticated idea, that's just an accident. 

I think the French were perfectly right in trying to exclude U.S. 
television programs, because for the most part such programs are the 
ultimate realization of mass taste, and they are depraved and 
destructive. They are deeply destructive to American society, 
particularly to any effort to educate anyone in it. And yet the schools 
increasingly try to simulate the TV culture, which is their worst 
betrayal!

<B>ER</B>: Simulate TV culture in what way?

<B>GILDER</B>: By having students read dumb books that seem to be simulations 
of TV sensibility. By avoiding anything difficult. By trying to pander 
to the kids, to entertain them rather than teach them.

<B>ER</B>: Compare two serious approaches to television: PBS and C-SPAN. Some 
people have said that C-SPAN is what public television ought to be. What 
do you think?

<B>GILDER</B>: C-SPAN now exists without the aid of public TV, and PBS works at 
all only because of the garbage that's on all the other channels. Just 
by being explicitly elitist, PBS can shine luminously in the darkness. 
But beyond that, I just don't really believe any of these channels or 
networks have a future. And, particularly, I don't think TV news has any 
future at all. So I believe that although within the existing regime of 
thirty channels or whatever, C-SPAN and PBS are better than the others, 
it's all still a vast wasteland. A channel like C-SPAN will still have a 
place in a world where you have one channel and it's yours, but 
enterprises like PBS and CNN are resources only for a world in which 
there are few channels and no control over them.

<B>ER</B>: Why is there no future for TV news?

<B>GILDER</B>: Because TV news is all governed by the two-minute rule, which 
says that you can't devote more than two minutes to a story unless it's 
a war or something. But the reason for that is not that people have any 
particular desire for two-minute stories; to the contrary, people want 
much more than two minutes on any story that actually interests them.
TV's two-minute rule exists because people will zap any story longer 
than two minutes that doesn't interest them. And so network news is 
guided entirely by that negative constraint, and within the two-minute 
limit, it necessarily has to go for sensational images and crashes and 
fires and murders and whatever. 

News is getting worse and worse that way, and the only reason TV news 
now succeeds is its timeliness and its ability to present video, but 
newspapers will shortly be able to present video and pictures and 
everything else in just as timely a way as television does; moreover, 
the newspaper of the future will be able to give you access to archives 
and to advertisements that actually step you through to the transaction 
itself, a process that requires text.

<B>ER</B>: You've pointed out in Life after Television that some 70 percent of 
the costs of a film go for distribution and advertising, saying, &quot;In 
every industry--from retailing to insurance--the key impact of the 
computer-networking revolution is to collapse the costs of distribution 
and remove the middlemen.&quot; What's the future of the middlemen in 
educational systems? Do you agree with Lew Perelman's thesis in School's 
Out that hyperlearning will replace, rather than merely reform, 
conventional education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Yeah, I agree mostly with Lew. I don't think that things change 
so abruptly as he implies they will, but it's clear that because schools 
are centralized and dominated by these educationist elites, they're 
ineffective in teaching children. And so I think in the same way as the 
computer has tended to break down all existing hierarchies, monopolies, 
pyramids, and power grids of established industrial society, it will 
break down centralized educational institutions as well. There is no 
correlation--period--between spending per student and performance per 
student, adjusted for education and income of parents. But there is a 
very statistically significant negative correlation between the amount 
of bureaucracy per student and the performance of the student. 

So it's clear that the middlemen in education are not merely dead wood, 
they are also a  destructive force, and they actually prevent education. 
It's teachers that are needed, and teachers don't need much supervision. 

The computer essentially replaces vertically organized institutions with 
horizontally organized institutions. It distributes intelligence and 
power rather than concentrates them; it endows teachers with authority 
and responsibility rather than reducing teachers to being instruments of 
some educational bureaucracy. And the reason teachers don't care about 
anything but money as far as their organizations are concerned is that 
the bureaucrats have destroyed the experience of teaching and the 
gratification of teaching. This is why the schools are such perverse 
institutions. As Lew Perelman says, academia is a socialist bureaucracy 
as big as the Soviet government at its height, and it is going to fail 
just about as cataclysmically.

<B>ER</B>: Do your observations apply from top to bottom? Do they also apply to 
higher education?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there's greater diversity in higher education--
quite a lot of diversity--and that the schools people think are good are 
mostly bad, and some of the schools people think are bad are in fact 
quite good. For example, I think about 70 percent of the courses at 
Harvard are useless. You know less when you finish than when you 
started. All those endless sociology courses and social science courses 
and social psychology and political science courses, and the endless 
efforts to retrieve some inkling of truth from Marxism!  
You know, it's as though they were still teaching some pre-Copernican 
astronomy--they're really obscurantists in those institutions. It 
reflects the collapse of the elite culture in the United States, but I 
think there are a lot of other cultures out there, and a lot of schools 
that people don't pay attention to are in fact a lot better. Schools 
like Hillsdale, schools like Thomas Aquinas.

There are also schools like CalTech and Harvey Mudd--schools that are 
excellent in science and technology. These are the best schools in the 
country, because the one thing this culture does well is science and 
technology. One of the real jokes is when you find MIT increasingly 
trying to teach students the humanities. I think the humanities as 
taught in existing universities are mostly perverse: Nihilist, 
relativist, feminist, and Marxist. Marxism is just a completely 
worthless mode of study, and yet it's pursued intently at a great many 
elite universities as though there's something still in it.

<B>ER</B>: What would you recommend to a 17-year-old?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think there are two possibilities. One is, if such 17-
year-old boys or girls really have their act together, have strong 
convictions, and know what they want to study, then it would be 
interesting to attend one of the elite universities and be kind of a 
counterforce there and create an adversarial culture. Publications like 
the Dartmouth Review, the Salient at Harvard, and the Prospect at 
Princeton are part of a whole series of conservative publications across 
the country that are kinds of centers of resistance and rebellion on 
these corrupt campuses, and that's probably a pretty good education, to 
pursue that course. In general, however, I'd recommend getting a 
technical or scientific education, because I don't think the schools are 
teaching anything else.

<B>ER</B>: Granting that technological advances will have a great impact on the 
general culture, don't you fear that money will have an even greater 
impact? Are cities with thirty trashy radio stations better served than 
towns with only two, and are they not the victims of investors who are 
chasing maximum ad revenues? Have the 55,000 trade books published last 
year in the United States produced a better general culture? Or has the 
culture been affected mainly by the small number of books--and movies 
and television shows--that were hyped into best-seller-dom?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think that America is still the world's leading economy and it 
produces a tremendous amount of art and literature that elude the elite 
media and elite institutions and elite critical vessels. If American 
culture were really summed up by TV culture, there would be no leading 
software company, no world-leading 
scientific/educational enterprise, no globally ascendant computing 
industry. Bioengineering wouldn't be centered in the United States, and 
so forth.

So I really don't think this elite mass culture--and I believe it is 
elitist, contrived by elites to pander to mass prurience and anxiety--
can generate anything worthwhile, and I don't think it does. The actual 
success of the United States does not stem from what the media generally 
treat--in other words, phenomena like the personal computer that are 
incomparably more important than phenomena like Madonna.

<B>ER</B>:  What is the hardest part of your ideas for people to comprehend? 
I'm sure that many of the people in charge of the converging corpses of 
Hollywood, TV, cable, and publishing have read your books or heard you 
speak. Why do you think they can't get the message?

<B>GILDER</B>: Well, I think a lot of them do get the message, and the ones who 
do are actually doing well. The ones who are pursuing the PC incurred 
nothing but upside surprises last year. At the beginning of the year it 
was predicted by Bill Gates and Andy Grove--the world's leading experts 
on the subject--that between 34 and 37 million personal computers would 
be sold in 1993; the actual number turned out to be almost 50 million 
computers--about 30 or 40 percent more than expected. 

And all the people who produce software and peripherals for personal 
computers and personal computer networks prospered. The computer 
industry grew 20 percent or so last year, while consumer electronics was 
stagnant. A lot of people developed CD-ROMs, which were a $5-billion 
business last year, up from virtually nothing a few years ago. 

The cable industry, which I consulted with a lot and which I think I 
influenced a lot, recently launched a wide array of products to connect 
computers over the cable network, and those products are going to be 
very important and valuable. I predict that during the next five years 
or so the computer industry will yield more products for cable companies 
than the TV industry does.

<B>ER</B>: What advice would you give to the president of a college or 
university?

<B>GILDER</B>: I think a kind of organizing principle, such as St. John's Great 
Books Program or St. Thomas Aquinas's orientation toward the Catholic 
worldview, can animate an educational experience, whereas trying to be a 
smorgasbord of secular social theory is going to result in both a bad 
experience for students and failure as an educational institution. 
You've got to be willing to teach some specific thing. You can't adopt 
some relativist posture, because that will mean that fanatics will 
dominate the institution, and most of these institutions are dominated 
by propagandists rather than by teachers.

<B>ER</B>: And what would you advise college and university presidents to do 
with regard to information technology?

<B>GILDER</B>: They should digitize their libraries and make them available 
from student rooms over computer networks. They should in general not 
restrict the resources of the college to the classrooms in it, but reach 
out from their own classrooms to students around the world who want to 
take courses with the excellent teachers available, while at the same 
time allowing the students on campus to reach out around the world. In 
other words, make your educational institution one that summons the best 
from universities everywhere, rather than focusing on the faculty and 
students that happen to be assembled at your particular location.</PRE>

<H1><CENTER>The Dark Fiber Interview with George Gilder </CENTER>
</H1>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rwbline.gif" WIDTH="540" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<BLOCKQUOTE><B>George Gilder mixes high technology and social politics.
His best-selling book, <I>Wealth and Poverty</I>, practically outlined our
loving embrace of high- tech entrepreneurs in the 1980s. Research for that
book led him deeper into the physics of silicon microchips. He emerged with
<I>Microcosm</I>, a book about how silicon-chip technology causes matter
to &quot;collapse&quot; into a microcosm where the usual economies of scale
are reversed: Small is better. <BR>
<BR>
The impact of decentralized telecommunications prompted his monograph <I>Life
After Television</I>, which is in some ways a warm-up for the book he is
working on now - <I>Telecosm</I> - a study of how the telecomputer will
enhance individual liberty. In this interview with Wired's Executive Editor
Kevin Kelley, Gilder expounds on society's current great work: wiring the
planet. </B></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P><CENTER><IMG SRC="rwbline.gif" WIDTH="540" HEIGHT="8" ALIGN="BOTTOM"
NATURALSIZEFLAG="3"></CENTER>
<P><B>KK</B>: Your book, Microcosm, begins with a quote from physicist Carver
Mead, who said, &quot;Listen to technology; find out what it's telling you.&quot;
I was wondering, what is the current technology of modems, packet-switching,
and fiber optics telling you?&quot; <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
GG</B>: It's telling me that today we're at the same general point that
we were with integrated circuits in about 1970. In 1970, people didn't anticipate
that transistors would be virtually free by today. Today you can buy a transistor
for 4,000-millionths of a cent. I think the same thing is on its way in
fiber optics. We're going to gain access to the 25,000 gigahertz of capacity
that's in each of the three windows in infrared spectrum that work with
fiber optics. With 25,000 gigahertz, you get the equivalent to the number
of phone calls in America during the peak moment on Mother's Day. Or take
all the radio spectrum currently used for communications, from AM radio
to KU-band satellite. It's 1,000 times that, on one thread of glass the
width of a human hair. I don't think people have come to terms with what
fiber really means. You can simulate any kind of switching configuration
you want. All of a sudden this huge apparatus of electronic switching that
dominates our current communications becomes unnecessary. Suddenly, you're
going to find that just as the integrated circuit rendered transistors -
and hence mips and bits - virtually free, fiber optics is going to render
bandwidth and hertz virtually free. This world is quite different from the
world that assumes bandwidth scarcity. A dearth of spectrum has to be regulated
and parceled out carefully by sensitive federal bureaucrats beset by tens
of thousands of lawyers. That whole apparatus, both the technology of it
- the huge switching fabric of the phone companies - and the legislative
apparatus and all its bureaucracies and legal accessories, are going to
be rendered almost worthless over the next ten years. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Every time I hear the phrase &quot;virtually free&quot; I think
of the claim about nuclear power: &quot;too cheap to meter.&quot; It's almost
utopian. I find myself not believing it, as much as I want to go along with
the idea. Am I too skeptical? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yep. It's just that when things become free you ignore them.
Transistors that used to be seven bucks apiece now cost about a millionth
of a cent. That means that you can regard them as insignificant, just as
they're becoming ubiquitous and thus determining the whole atmosphere of
enterprise. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, you could say that aluminum - by the atom - has become
virtually free, but that doesn't mean aluminum in any useful amount is free.
As long as we have storage devices, we'll find things to fill them up with,
so there will always be a demand for more. That means no matter how cheap
storage becomes, it won't be free. It seems to me that the appetite for
bandwidth is equally insatiable, so people will always want more than they
have. It has to cost something. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Of course it will. The point is that in every industrial revolution,
some key factor of production is drastically reduced in cost. Relative to
the pervious cost to achieve that function, the new factor is virtually
free compared to its expense when it derived from animal muscle power and
human muscle power. Suddenly you could do things you could not afford to
do before. You could make a factory work 24 hours a day churning out products
in a way that was just incomprehensible before the industrial era. It really
did mean that physical force became virtually free in a sense. The whole
economy had to reorganize itself to exploit this physical force. You had
to &quot;waste&quot; the power of the steam engine and its derivatives in
order to prevail, whether in war or in peace. <BR>
<BR>
Over the last 30 years, we've seen transistors (or switching power) move
from being expensive, crafted vacuum tubes to being virtually free. So today,
the prime rule of thrift in business is &quot;waste transistors.&quot; We
&quot;waste&quot; them to correct our spelling to play solitaire, to do
anything. As a matter of fact, you've got to waste transistors in order
to succeed in business these days. My thesis is that bandwidth is going
to be virtually free in the next era in the same way that transistors are
in this era. It doesn't mean there won't be expensive technologies associated
with the exploitation of bandwidth - just as there are expensive computers
employing transistors; but it does mean that people will have to use this
bandwidth, they'll have to waste bandwidth rather than economize on bandwidth.
The wasters of bandwidth will win rather than the people who are developing
exquisite new compression tools and all these other devices designed to
exploit some limited bandwidth. <BR>
<BR>
One of the key ways you economize on bandwidth is switching. Switching has
been the whole foundation of our communications systems. You run narrow-band
wires to some switch and then switch the data to its destination in order
to avoid using lots of bandwidth to broadcast signals to every terminal.
It seems to me that we're going to start using fiber the way we currently
address air. Instead of switching, we'll broadcast on fiber optic. We'll
be tuning in rather than processing all the bits. And instead of using a
lot of switching intelligence in order to economize on bandwidth, we're
going to use bandwidth in order to economize on intelligence. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Okay. In a world where physical force, switching, and computation
are almost free, we now add almost-free bandwidth. What becomes expensive?
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The scarce resource is the human mind. People will be more valuable.
People will get paid better. We need people to provide the software, the
interfaces, the standards, and the protocols to all these systems that make
it possible to exploit these increasingly cheap resources. So it's the human
mind that you ultimately have to economize on. That's the reason I think
it's utter garbage to say that our grandchildren won't live as well as we
do. People who say this just don't see the technology. They live in this
bizarre world of thermodynamics, where entropy rules, and we're dominated
by our waste products. it is very short-sighted. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: It take it then that as a believer in the human mind as sort
of the ultimate repository of wealth and power, that you're not a believer
in artificial intelligence as an attainable thing?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Artificial intelligence is obviously attainable, it just won't
be human intelligence. It's a different function. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Do you think there's a downside to having everything connected
to everything else? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I don't see any. There must be a downside to the telephone, but
I can't remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Well, when you're in the middle of supper and some solicitor
is calling you, you'll probably remember what it is. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, that's the downside. But that's the downside all this stuff
overcomes. When you can have intelligence in you telephone it can defer
the calls you don't want to voice mail and still take emergency calls. It
can be adapted to your needs. So, the chief effect of these technologies
is to put you in command again. The trouble with top-down centralized technologies,
which the telephone and television represent, is that they're dumb equipment
attached to complex switching systems and broadcasting technologies. On
the other hand, the chief virtue of distributed intelligence is that the
network can be dumb and the control of it can be distributed to smart users.
That means that technologies are much more servants than rulers of your
life. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: When I look at networks I see counter-intuitive behavior. Distributed
networks have a remarkable ability to be slightly out of anyone's control.
They possess an organic out-of-control quality. Does that concern you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: I think it's good. The Internet, for instance, is an exciting
kind of metaphor for spontaneous order. It shows that in order to have a
very rich fabric of services you don't need a regimented system of control.
When there's a lot of intelligence at the fringes everywhere, the actual
network itself can be fairly simple. The future is dumb networks. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: Dumb networks? Why not smart networks? We put smartness into
everything else. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There's smartness all around the network, but the actual network
should be essentially dumb glass. The fiberspace, as I call it. I think
the mistake that the phone companies sometimes make is to think that they
can keep up with the computer. What they call &quot;network intelligence&quot;
will usually appear as a bottleneck to a computer industry that's rapidly
rushing forward into new possibilities. So what you really want is dumb
networks where all intelligence is on the fringes. You'll have intelligent
devices of various sorts that are easily reachable from the network but
aren't part of the actual fabric of the network. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What is the fabric of the network? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Photons. Electronics are not good for communications. Photons
- optical computing - are. What makes photons so great for communication
is they don't interfere with each other. They collide and pass on unaffected.
You can send them two-way, and they are not subject to electromagnetic disruption.
Many signals can flow through one fiber. But the fact that photons don't
affect each other means they are cumbersome for computing, since you want
interactions in computing. You need to have the charges affect one another
- that's the heart of computing. The heart of the transistor function is
that you can control a bigger force with a smaller force. But photons don't
control each other. So for computing functions I still think that electronics
will prevail; but for communications, photonics will prevail. <BR>
<BR>
<B><BR>
KK</B>: One would think that there is wealth to be made in the interface
then between photons and electrons. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yeah, there is. Opto-electronics is very important. However,
opto- electronics should not be in the middle of the network, it should
be one the edges of the network where it links the computing functions to
the communications functions. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There are some advocates who claim that we can get a lot of what
we want in fiber optic by using the existing copper wires beefed up with
the ISDN communication protocol. Do you go along with the idea of implementing
(and paying for ) ISDN right now? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Yes. The phone companies should do ISDN. We might as well get
as much out of the existing copper switch system as we can. ISDN is already
installed in all the new switches; it's more a matter of getting the tariffs
right so they can charge some reasonable amount for it is use. There's no
excuse not to do ISDN today. It won't detract from the fibersphere. But
while they do ISDN, all-optical networks are going to be launched all over
the place by different companies. Some people have this vision that either
we devote our resources to ISDN, or we devote them to creating this fabulously
expensive fiber network. My belief is that fiber network is going to get
rapidly cheaper, so that we're going to be able to do both it and ISDN perfectly
well. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What role do you think the US government should play in laying
data highways? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: The role for the US government is to make government as efficient
as possible. Government operates leviathan laboratories, hospitals, universities,
bureaucracies, and post offices, and they all should be interconnected with
fiber. The government always discovers technology after its moment is passing.
If you're a winner, you don't go to the government. You're too busy. You've
got too many customers. It's the people with no customers who end up besieging
the government. There are all these wise-asses in Washington who really
think that they can choose technologies. They think they know better. They
get bowled over by every earnest representative of IBM who comes up to talk
to them. <BR>
<BR>
Just now the US government thinks that HDTV is absolutely the future of
the world because all the old farts at Zenith, and the broadcasting moguls
who aren't really making it with the new computer technologies, are converging
on Washington. it's always going to be that way. It's not going to change
with Clinton and Gore. The dog technologies run to Washington, decked out
like poodles. The politician is always the dogs best friend. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: There is a myth, a utopian hope, that all these electronic connections
(what I call the &quot;advent of the net&quot;) are going to eliminate hierarchy.
The belief is that we will come into a peer world, where everything is on
a peer-to- peer level. All the experimental work that I have seen shows
that that's probably not very likely. On the contrary, anything complex
self-organizes into nested hierarchies, just in order to manage itself.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Right. The complexity of digital systems requires a hierarchical
organization. It's the only way to deal with the kind of combinatorial explosions
that attend interlinking of billions of nodes, all functioning in parallel.
You need nested hierarchies, but the real miracle of micro- electronics
is that these extraordinarily complex hierarchies can be incorporated into
individual silicon chips, with virtual supercomputer power capabilities.
This fabulous supercomputer power can be ubiquitously distributed, which
renders them an egalitarian force. <BR>
<BR>
When everybody commands a supercomputer, you give the average owner of a
work station the power that an industrial tycoon commanded in the industrial
era, or that a TV station owner commands in the age of broadcasting. In
other words, the hierarchy is in the silicon rather than in the human organization.
So you have this incredible distribution of power. This is a period of transition
that resembles the transition between railroads and automobiles. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: How's that? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: When you ride a train you go to the railway station at a scheduled
time, you travel with the people that happen to be on the train, you go
to preset destinations. This is what the current television world is like.
You tune into the stations that have been prescribed through some collaboration
between advertisers and TV executives in New York and Hollywood. Moving
from broadcast model to the teleputer is like moving from a railroad model
to automobiles. Automobiles are essentially egalitarian transportation systems.
They aren't organized - like the Internet. A Ferrari, say, and a Toyota
Tercel look like radically different machines, but the fact is that any
car endows the average person with more freedom than any railroad. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: You are a tireless champion of small business. For the last 20
years or so, really big projects have been considered arrogant, incapable
of working because they are big. Now there is talk of Motorola's global
satellite project Iridium. Do you think that the fibersphere gives us permission
to think big again. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: There are going to be a lot of big fiber projects in the next
decade. They're already coming right now. I'm sort of worried that they're
going to think too small. I hope that the government, with its National
Research and Education Network (NREN) doesn't end up buying a lot of obsolescent
telephone company fiber systems that make networks with a total power of
a gigabit rather than a gigabit per terminal. The fibersphere is a big project,
and it will take scores of thousands of small companies to do it. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What about big companies? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: Sure. Laboratories where lots of people work on their own special
visions, with the luxury of very long-term goals, are very valuable. Such
places are usually supported by relatively big companies and consortia of
companies. IBM, AT&amp;T, and Bell Labs developed most of the component
for all optical networks. When you're producing millions of something it
becomes a commodity, and almost by definition you have a big company. MS-DOS
and Windows are commodity products, so Microsoft is a big company. <BR>
<BR>
There are cycles in which companies get big exploiting commodity products
with wide distribution, which then mature and then are displaced by new
products. It's relatively rare that the company that's triumphant in the
commodity phase. Insurrections are ordinarily led by entrepreneurs. I don't
see any likelihood that will change anytime soon. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>KK</B>: What else is the technology telling you? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<B>GG</B>: What the technology tells me is that, among other things, Clinton's
going to get a bonanza. He doesn't know what's coming, but technology's
just going to be breaking out all over. Bush did virtually everything that
Clinton promises to do, and because Bush has done it already it doesn't
leave Clinton much room except to play cock-a-doodle-do. He'll get up on
the post and crow as the marvelous sunrise technologies come blindingly
to the fore during his administration. They're going to have 50,000 technology
programs and behold, a million technologies will bloom and they will take
credit for it all. <BR>

</H2>
Once upon a time in a distant mountainous land there was a young and beautiful
princess who loved to wander in the woods. The forest was deep below the
snowcapped peaks and the valleys were quiet and safe. She could go freely
without care or fear. She could saunter along the trails that took local
merchants and messengers toward the passes to neighboring lands and brought
them back laden with news and commerce. She could watch for birds radiant
among the leaves and sometimes glimpse a deer dancing through the brush.
In summer she could swim in the brooks that hurtled down the mountains and
gathered in pools in the crevices. She was carefree and gay, at ease with
nature and the world.<BR>
<BR>
Then one year trouble struck this halcyon land. A barbarian moved into a
cave somewhere in the woods and began to prey on the merchants and messengers
making their way through the mountain passes. Although groups of young men
formed posses to pursue him, he was so strong and swift and so resourceful
in the ways of the woods and canyons that no one could catch him. Commerce
slowed and the kingdom grew steadily poorer. Merchants could travel only
in large groups protected by warriors. The king and queen bade the princess
to halt her wanderings and stay in the castle night and day. Someday, they
said, she would be queen, but until then she would have to learn the ways
of the palace. She pined for her dark and secret places among the trees,
but she did not disobey.<BR>
<BR>
One night, however, her sleep was beset with dreams of serpents. She woke
in fear as shadowy shapes lurched on her walls and sinister sounds whirred
outside her window. She went to the sill, parted the curtains, and gasped
at the wild beauty beyond. Through the trees, waving their arms in the night
winds and glistening in the moonlight, she could see deep into the forest
that she longed to explore. She yearned to run along the sylvan paths and
feel the pine needles under her bare feet and the breezes against her face
and in her hair. She longed to spy on the creatures of the night. Surely,
no one would notice or care if she should steal down the stone stairs and
step out on the moonlit path.<BR>
<BR>
As it happened, that same evening the barbarian, also restless in the night
season, set forth into the lunar darkness down the path that led toward
the castle. He walked quietly, like a cat slinking through the woods, until,
startled by the sound of steps, he slid behind a huge oak. At first he thought
he had heard some animal and raised his club. Then he sensed a human rhythm
in the paces and steeled himself for a robbery. When the princess finally
came into view, he gasped at the sight of her- -a beautiful girl garbed
only in a silken gown--gliding barefoot along the trail.<BR>
<BR>
Never before had a vision moved him so powerfully. The luminous night and
the woman alone, the shape and the shadows, reached in beyond his bearded
face and bristling chest and touched his sinuous heart. He stepped forward
and asked her if he might walk with her a while. She screamed and fled.
He pursued her, caught her, and pulled her to the ground, ripping her gown.
Then he seized her flailing arms and shook her to silence.<BR>
<BR>
Soon, however, he sensed that he wanted less to overpower than to please
her. Entranced by the wonders of her strong young body, he pleaded with
her to stop struggling--he meant her no harm. She told him to go ahead and
kill her if he wanted her, but to do it quickly and mercifully. He insisted
he had no desire to have her dead. He wanted her alive; he wished to hold
her body against his in the night. She said she would die first.<BR>
<BR>
He then changed his approach and asked her again if she would walk with
him for a while in the woods. She consented; it was a way to gain release
from his grasp. But as they strolled along, his gruff voice softened. With
quiet authority he described his life in the woods among the fierce animals
that threatened his survival and that he sometimes had to kill to escape.
She listened and marveled as he told her fantastic tales of the barbarian
life. She had never before heard of the struggle for life in the wilds beyond
the castle walls. They walked together until the glow of dawn shocked her
to her senses and she said she had to run back to the castle. The great
barbarian slumped in helpless anguish. She assured him she would be back
the next week to learn more. But to the barbarian, a week seemed an eternity.<BR>
<BR>
The next week she once more sneaked away from her bed after midnight and
walked in the woods with the barbarian. When the sun rose he lunged for
her, and she delicately slipped aside, saying she would be back again in
another seven days. The next week they once again walked and talked for
hours in the night. Finally he asked her to come back to see the etchings
on the walls of his cave.<BR>
<BR>
She said no, she would never go back to his lair until he halted his attacks
upon the merchants and messengers of the realm. He said robbery was his
way of life; all men robbed in one way or another; the king's entire territory
had been stolen from the barbarian's forebears, the natives of the land.
She told him severely that he had better find another way of living if he
expected her ever to visit him in his cave. He should make a clearing, build
a cabin, and grow a garden in the woods. He could collect nuts and berries
and hunt small game. With all his knowledge of the wilderness he could live
well, and she would come weekly to hear his tales of the night wood.<BR>
<BR>
The barbarian was heartbroken. The idea of a different life frightened and
repelled him. He was a nomadic predator, born to run in the forest and prey
on the weak. But finally he saw that he had no choice. To avoid losing the
princess, he recognized at last that he would have to give up the barbarian
life and get to work. And so he did. By the time he met her seven days hence,
he had cleared a large space among the trees. Within six months he had planted
a garden and built a cabin.<BR>
<BR>
During that time no robberies were reported on the road. Commerce with neighboring
kingdoms expanded rapidly as travel grew safer and merchants could go through
the mountain passes without an expensive guard of young warriors. With the
country growing richer, the barbarian did well selling wood and nuts to
the people. At last one day, after showing her his trove of produce, his
cabin enlarged with an octagonal wing, and his large gardens and herds of
goats, he asked the princess to marry him. Joyfully she said yes and brought
him back to the castle to meet her father and mother, the king and queen.<BR>
<BR>
At first the king declared that the barbarian's background made him entirely
unsuitable to be the mate of his precious daughter. But the queen replied
with a smile that he too had been something of a barbarian in his day and
he had to confess that this was true. The barbarian was certainly a refreshing
change from the unctuous courtiers who had previously pursued the princess.
The king and queen soon welcomed the youth as a strong and resourceful husband
for their daughter and an asset to the realm.<BR>
<BR>
The wedding brought a huge celebration throughout the kingdom. After a nostalgic
honeymoon in the cabin in the woods, the couple moved into the castle. Freed
from the ravages of the barbarian, the land continued to prosper. After
the princess's parents died, the barbarian himself became king and expanded
his domains deep into the mountains and the forest. In the course of time
the new queen bore a daughter and the daughter too grew into a beautiful
young princess, who, like her mother, hearkened to the call of the wild.<BR>
<BR>
As the realm grew ever richer, the king and queen invited famous wise men
from a neighboring kingdom to entertain at court. These men told of seductive
new ideas. They chilled the king and queen with tales of the death of God
and the eclipse of law, and excited them with accounts of the joys of libertine
sex. They brought books and art celebrating the new freedoms that followed
the breakdown of traditional morality and religion. They told of a city
called New York where everything indeed was new and free.<BR>
<BR>
The young princess listened avidly. Poring over the books, she learned of
the powers that princesses held in other nations. She learned to disdain
the stodgy, hardworking life of her parents' kingdom and to long for a land
where happiness was the only goal. As time passed these ideas gnawed at
her nocturnal thoughts. Like her mother she found her sleep disturbed by
serpentine dreams, and she would walk in the woods to quell the disquieting
desires that flooded her young body.<BR>
<BR>
Then a crisis struck the country. Another barbarian--as young and strong,
ruthless and resourceful as his predecessor--moved into the forest and began
preying on the commerce between the kingdom and the neighboring realm. Once
again the land became poor, and this princess too was forbidden to walk
in the woods. The princess, however, rebelled against her parents and continued
her excursions.<BR>
<BR>
One night she found herself suddenly confronted by the young barbarian.
She was even more beautiful than her mother, and the barbarian surged with
admiration and desire. He asked her if she minded if he walked with her
for a while. Deeply bored by her life in the castle, she agreed. They sauntered
along the path discussing the flaws of the king and the oppressive rules
within the walls. Shortly he put his arm around her shoulders and she pulled
away and said please, not yet. He asked her if she would return with him
to see the etchings in his cave. She suggested they first walk longer and
get to know one another better. But eventually they visited his cave together.
When she left at dawn, she promised to return the next week. &quot;Wow,&quot;
she exclaimed, &quot;you're good!&quot;<BR>
<BR>
For the next several months she visited with the barbarian every week and
they reveled in the cave. Then one day, a king arrived from the progressive
country of the wise men to visit with the father of the princess. This foreign
king was the most charming and cosmopolitan man the princess had ever seen.
He told her of the great riches and romantic forests of his land, of the
advanced universities and museums, of the flourishing commerce and art.
And after everyone went to bed, there was a knock on the door of the princess's
chamber.<BR>
<BR>
The princess opened the door and saw the foreign king outside, garbed in
a robe of purple velour. He asked to come in. He stayed until dawn, and
as the morning light suffused the room, along with the royal aroma of his
Paco Rabanne, he asked her to return with him to his kingdom. He would divorce
his queen and marry her. They had &quot;drifted apart,&quot; he said, and
his marriage &quot;was no longer a growthful experience.&quot; His wife
needed &quot;more space,&quot; and in his progressive views and liberated
lifestyle, he discovered he had far more in common with youth than with
his own generation. The princess agreed joyfully. Banishing the barbarian
in the woods from her thoughts, she returned the next day with the king
to her new land.<BR>
<BR>
Each week the barbarian waited in the forest for his princess. But she never
came. After a while he gave up waiting and angrily escalated his attacks
on the commerce between the two nations. As time passed, the mood of license
fostered by the wise men induced many young men to join the barbarian in
the woods. The nation fell into ruin and the forest became a jungle, ruled
by barbarians, where no princess ever dared to tread.

<H2>WHY WE NEED TO OVERHAUL<BR>
OUR ADVERSARIAL LEGAL SYSTEM
</H2>
<H4><I>By Roberta R. Katz<BR>
(Copyright 1996 by Roberta R. Katz)</I>
</H4>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It's a great honor for me to be standing up here today. I've spent several
years now thinking, and then writing, about legal reform, but this is the
<B>first </B>time I have publicly shared some of my thoughts with such a
large audience of businesspeople.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Here's a short preview of what I will spend the next 20 minutes talking
about. I intend to show you why legal reform issues are deadly serious for
this country, why the adversary system of justice is no longer a fully functional
system, and why you -- whoever you are -- need to get personally involved
in the resolution of these legal refon-n issues.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My own interest in this topic goes back to my law-firm days, when the anthropologist
in me began to sense some kind of shift taking place. It was not just that
clients had become so vocal about high legal costs. Or that lawyers were
now the butt of so many jokes and cartoons. Or even that many of my fellow
lawyers had become so aggressive and crude in how they practiced law. No,
what I was sensing was far more troubling to me. It was an awareness that
an increasing amount of the high-priced work we lawyers were doing was just
about process, and not about substance. In other words, the clients were
paying for more and more icing, and less and less cake.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
It has taken me several years to figure out the real cause of this problem.
The easy answer would have been to say that it's all the fault of greedy
lawyers. During the 1980s, when the money was rolling into the law fin-ns,
a relative few lawyers did get greedy. I'm sure you've read articles about
lawyers who prolonged cases, padded bills, exploited the system and otherwise
adopted dishonest means of bilking their clients and society. But contrary
to the popular view, in my experience the majority of lawyers are honest
and hardworking. And they are as confused and troubled as nonlawyers over
what is happening to their profession.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Confused and troubled. That could describe just about everyone these days.
And this is because we are living in revolutionary times. Remember in your
student days, when you learned about the Industrial Revolution? The move
off the farms, the break-up of extended families, the grimy factories, the
blight of the cifies? This history generally evoked pity for our forebears,
and relief that we were living in more stable times. But the fact is, that
with the dawning of the Information Age we are going through just as much,
if not more, change in our lives as were those troubled souls in the early
19th century. Because we are living it, putting one foot in front of the
other each day as we try to raise our children and do our jobs, it's hard
to put our individual problems in the broader context. This is big-time
social change we are experiencing, but big-time social change, when you
are living it rather than reading about it, necessarily comes slowly, in
stages.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Recently there has been an acknowledgment of the need for fundamental changes
in many of our social institutions. Our businesses were the first place
these fundamental changes were accepted. Following the widespread introduction
of computing technology into private businesses, it became clear that we
needed to organize workers differently. Teams began to replace top-down
management structures. Bosses began to come out of their offices and manage
by walking around. Restructuring and reengineering became the norin rather
than the exception.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now it's also become clear to most people that our schools need fundamental
changes. It no longer sounds radical to speak about individualized learning
using the computer, or about changing the classroom setting to have greater
focus on teamwork, and less focus on the teacher as the only source of learning.
These organizational changes in the educational context, like the organizational
changes pervading businesses, are directly the result of our bigger move
as a culture from a factory-based mindset to an infonnation-based mindset.<BR>
<BR>
So what kind of similar organizational changes are happening in the legal
context? Very, very few. It seems that while we can accept major change
in our businesses and our schools, we consider our legal system to be more
sacrosanct. The courts are, after all, a key part of the bedrock foundation
of our society. Fundamental organizational change in our legal system feels
like it could threaten the core of our democratic ways.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But here's the irony. It's actually our refusal to implement fundamental
change in our legal system that could bring down the whole house. Let me
explain why.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Until this decade, I think most Americans considered their courts to be
places where justice would generally be served. There was a basic belief
that if a wrong had occurred, our court system would redress that wrong
and restore a balance. In the popular media, Perry Mason was the personification
of that faith in our court system. We believed that through incisive questioning,
a good lawyer could ferret out the truth, expose the bad guy, reward the
good guy, and serve justice. Yes, sometimes there were mistakes, but by
and large, for most people the system worked.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
By contrast, today, a growing number of people believe that our justice
system is unreliable at best and a total farce at worst. Moreover, among
those who are con-fing to share that belief are people who see the system
from the inside: lawyers, judges, and legal scholars. For example, two years
ago, Bill Ide, who was then the President of the American Bar Association,
said this to the ABA membership (and I quote):<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
&quot;Legal institutions created many years ago weren't designed to handle
the complex issues and burdensome caseloads we routinely see in our courtrooms.
What is needed today is nothing short of a revolution in our administration
of justice.... We must remember that it is the existence of and public confidence
in the legal system that has kept our nation at peace with itself. ... Should
the public confidence be lost in the government to be fair and equitable
through our justice system, we will only be sowing and nurturing the seeds
of a real revolution that no one wants.&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Those were strong words stated over two years ago from an influential person.
And yet, as far as I can tell, they have inspired virtually nothing in the
way of &quot;revolutionary change&quot; in our legal system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a cultural anthropologist whose research focussed on social change, I
have observed that serious social change issues typically smolder quietly
until there is an unexpected event that sparks a bigger fire that results
in change. It may well be that the O.J. Simpson trial has been that event
as applied to changes in our legal system. If nothing else, that trial allowed
a wide spectrum of Americans to see what life inside our court system is
like today. And many of those who watched were appalled, not necessarily
by the outcome but by the process. The endless bickering. The game playing.
The withholding of important infon-nation from the jury. It just didn't
seem right, when all was said and done.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The problem, as ABA-President Ide realized, is that when people no longer
believe that their justice system will reliably dispense justice, they take
matters into their own hands. And that is exactly what is beginning to happen
today. At one end of the spectrum, we have the growth of what is called
&quot;alternative dispute resolution,&quot; or &quot;ADR&quot; for short.
ADR is basically a private justice system. Under ADR, two disputing parties
will agree to avoid the courts and go to a private decisionmaker to end
their dispute. It is growing dramatically in popularity, especially in the
business context.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
At the other end of the spectrum, however, a more frightening event is occurring.
Some groups, such as the militias, have simply written off our established
justice system and substituted their own &quot;peoples' courts.&quot; Similarly,
even within our established courts, a growing number of j@es are simply
ignoring the confusing evidence presented to them and making their decisions
on bases that have little or nothing to do with the facts of the case.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The ultimate cure for this problem is not easy. In my view, to cure the
problem in our legal system we will have to do a substantial overhaul of
the adversary system. Yes, I said overhaul. I know this sounds bold, maybe
even heretical, but stop to think about it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
The adversary system is about two sides of a dispute being able to tell
their respective stories to a jury. In other words, it's all about information.
That's why we haveinterrogatories, depositions, and testimony at trial --
the purpose is to get information to the decision-makers so that they can
make an infon-ned decision.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Now the adversary system in practice today is remarkably similar to the
adversary system that was created in England at the dawning of the Industrial
era. (And let me add here that the adversary system was itself the result
of a legal reform movement that occurred in response to abuses occurring
in pre-Industrial England, when defendants were not allowed to testify in
their own defense.) Now, as then, there were a plaintiff and defendant,
each <B>with </B>their lawyers, a judge, and jury, and the various rules
of procedure and of evidence.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
But think how different the rest of our lives are. When the adversary system
was bom, information was simple and relatively sparse. This was before the
time of widespread publishing or broadcasting, before the time we became
specialized into so many different types of business endeavors. This was
also a time when communities were small and relatively cohesive, unlike
today, when we often don't even know the names of our next-door neighbors.
It was certainly before the days of technical expert witnesses (especially
hired technical expert witnesses), laboratory tests, statistical analyses,
and all the other exhaustive and exhausting paraphernalia of modem trials.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To our collective credit, I believe the adversary system served us fairly
well throughout the Industrial era. But now that we are well into the Information
Age, now that we are participating in a global economy fueled by high tech,
that system is clogging up. That's why we now find interrogatories over
100 pages long, and jurors that are hopelessly lost in the face of highly
technical evidence, and depositions that last for weeks, and trials that
are delayed for years. That's why we have come to a point that our legal
processes, far from serving justice, are actually thwarting justice.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Please don't misunderstand me. My criticism in this respect is not directed
at the new technologies. Far from it -- as you might guess from my present
employment, I am genuinely excited about the changes that the Information
Age is bringing us. Rather, my point is that the legal system is not employing
the new technologies in an intelligent maimer. Just because we now have
word processors and copying machines instead of typewriters and carbon paper
doesn't mean that it is wise for us to be drafting 100 page legal documents.
An excess of information, especially when that excess leads to manipulation,
is every bit as harmful to justice as is a lack of information.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
How might we overhaul the adversary system? Here are a few examples that
would apply with respect to civil disputes. First, let's make sure that
civil disputes involving highly technical information are decided by jurors
who themselves are experts. This would avoid the junk science and battles
of the experts that today thoroughly confuse lay jurors.<BR>
Second, let's create more systems that are designed to resolve certain harms
without any adversarial process -- much like we treat workers' compensation
and no-fault insurance claims today.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And, third, let's acknowledge that in the age of specialization, our courts
of general jurisdiction are inefficient. We need more specialized courts,
which will be staffed by judges and administrators who are knowledgeable
in the court's subject matter. Today we have the Tax and Bankruptcy Courts.
Why not create a Business Court? Or a Personal Injury Court? Or an Environmental
Court? For lawyers, the era of the general practitioner ended at least 10
years ago, and today the bar is divided into well over 20 different areas
of expertise. If law and lawyers have had to specialize to reflect our society's
broader reality, why haven't we demanded that our courts and our legal procedures
make the same adaptation?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I know that overhauling the adversary system is not something to be undertaken
lightly. The effort must begin at the highest levels of our state and federal
judiciaries, and constitutional principles must be protected. This is a
most serious job for our courts, but I believe that there is no choice.
To ignore the ugly realities of our present-day legal system is to assure
the ultimate breakdown of that system.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To cure our problems, it is also high time to rethink the professional role
of lawyers if lawyers are going to be useful to our society in the Information
age. We need to dramatically revise our law school curricula, starting right
now, in order to teach our young lawyers to be problem solvers rather than
problem creators. In a world of diverse cultures, which is where we inevitably
will be spending more and more of our time in the future, an adversarial
mindset is a liability, not an asset. We need to teach our lawyers how to
facilitate communication, and we need to stop teaching them that human affairs
are always win/lose. In the Information age, we will need our best thinkers,
many of whom are lawyers, to be focussing on how to create win/win solutions
to problems.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And that's where each of you also comes in. Don't forget: as paying customers
of lawyers, you have a right to make things better. And I think you also
have a responsibility to make make things better. Are you using the legal
system as a competitive tool, sort of for blackmail, trying to defeat your
foes through weak legal claims? Do you assume that the only way to solve
your problems is through your lawyers, or do you try to solve things more
creatively, without threatening a lawsuit? Do you instruct your lawyers
to be aggressive and overreaching or do you urge them to be pragmatic and
cooperative on your behalf? Most importantly, do you stay involved when
you use a lawyer's services, or do you just let the lawyer dictate the outcome
of your case?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
My point here is that lawyers don't operate in a vacuum. They work for you,
and not vice versa. As the client, it is your interests, not your lawyer's,
that are at stake. And every time you misuse -- or condone the misuse --
of the legal system, every time you take advantage of the sorry state of
our adversary system today, you exacerbate the problem. So take this as
a reminder that there are often many better -- and cheaper -- ways to solve
problems than through lawyers and courts.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I also urge you to support legal reform efforts. The securities-abuse legislation
that was recently passed over President Clinton's veto is one exwnple, but
there are many other tort-reform bills still before our federal and state
legislators. The media has positioned these bills as business-versus-consumer,
but this misses the whole point. These bills are about stopping some of
the procedural excesses I talked about before. In that respect, they are
only temporary fixes to the adversary-system problems, but they are fixes
nonetheless. Until we can overhaul this old, tired adversary system to meet
the needs of the Information Age, the best we can do is put some temporary
fixes in place. Without them, our faith in our legal system to deliver justice
will surely be further eroded. So these are the ideas I am working on in
my project at Discovery Institute. These are the marching orders I think
we need to give our society if we are to change the adversarial system before
it self-destructs and takes us with it.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To judges: participate in streamlining the adversary system. We need a major
overhaul of our procedures, all the way down to revamping the way our courts
of general jurisdiction are organized.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To legislators: set up new incentives in law to promote prompt and more
just resolution of disputes, including through passage of tort reform legislation.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To law schools: revise the law school curricula, so that the emphasis is
placed on dispute resolution rather than on adversarial combat.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
To lawyers: recognize that these changes are necessary if the profession
is going to play any kind of useful role in the Information Age. One reason
so many lawyers are unhappy today is that even they are already questioning
the value of what they do.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
And to all of us in general: take personal responsibility for helping to
restore justice and balance to our legal system. Stop condoning the use
of the system for extortion and abuse, and participate in the transition
that is ahead of us. Legal reform is not something to fear; it is something
to welcome. Given the legal system's foundation role in our culture, there
is simply no way to have profound technological and social change occurring
all around us and not change the legal system to adapt to those other changes.
Our mutual goal is to make that change as painless as possible.<BR>

<P>&quot;We disapprove of the measures adopted by a certain party, styling
themselves the Christian party in politics,&quot; declared the petition
from a citizens' group. The document went on to indict Christian political
activists for advocating policies that were &quot;infusing a spirit of religious
intolerance and persecution into the political institute of the country,
and which, unless opposed, will result in a union of church and statte.
...&quot;<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Given present controversies, the petition could have been written last week.
Instead, it was issued in 1831. Those who believe that religion in politics
is somehow a recent phenomenon in America should re-examine their history
books. Religion has been an integral part of the nation's politics from
the early years of the republic. This book tries to explain why. It also
seeks to illuminate both the opportunities and the dangers religion poses
for politics in a representative democracy. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
As a political scientist interested in current affairs, I initially considered
writing about contemporary conflicts over faith and politics in America.
The more I studied the early years of the United States, however, the more
I realized that present controversies are simply a continuation of arguments
that have been going on since the nation began. The questions debated during
the early years of America are hauntingly familiar: Does religion have a
political role, and if so, what should it be? What are the advantages of
religion in politics? What are the dangers? And how can people of faith
bring their religious beliefs to bear on public issues without dividing
citizens along religious lines and infringing on the liberty of conscience
of those who do not share their religious views? <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Exploring how these questions were answered in the past can help clarify
what is at stake at present. Indeed, examining the debate over religion
and politics more than a century-and-a-half ago may provide more illumination
than looking at current conflicts over abortion, school prayer, gay rights,
or any number of other issues. Contemporary controversies often cloud our
judgment because we have a direct interest in their outcome. When we are
able to examine the same fundamental disputes at a distance, however, we
are more likely to grapple with the real merits of the respective arguments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
That is what I hope can happen here, for there is much we all can learn
from the way religion became involved in politics in the early United States.
Those who criticize the role of faith in politics today might gain a better
understanding of how and why religion can play a beneficial role in our
politics; and those who champion religion's political role might gain a
deeper appreciation of the dangers as well as the possibilities of religious
political activism. Finally, evangelical Christians might rediscover part
of their heritage, for much of the book is the story of how their forebears
first became involved in politics in America. Politically-active evangelicals
of today might profit from both the mistakes and the successes of their
nineteenth-century predecessors. <BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Evangelical political activisim in America has a long history
behind it, and present-day evangelicals might learn much from both the triumphs
and the failures of those who came before them. For example, evangelicals
in the early 19th century -- like their counterparts today -- were harshly
criticized for mixing religion and politics. In response, they appealed
to the twin ideas of religious libe4rty and common moral standards articulated
by America's founders. The purpose of this project is to reacquaint today's
evangelical reformers with the wisdom of their forebears. The project includes
public onferences, books, and an historical reprint series of classics of
American evangelical political thought.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<h3>WHY THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION MUST BE ABOLISHED</h3>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
	The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was established by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 to provide free legal assistance to the indigent in civil, non-criminal matters. Its origins lie in President Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty, specifically with the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), which in 1965 began making direct grants to local legal aid organizations.2<p>	Despite its name, however, the Corporation does not use its budget (currently $400 million) to provide direct legal services to the poor. Rather, it distributes federal tax dollars to 323 private groups around the country. These grantees also receive another $255 million from lawyer groups, local and state governments, interest on lawyers' trust accounts (IOLTA), and private sources.3<p>	Unfortunately, taxpayer-funded legal groups, under LSC, engage in political, lobbyist, and cause-advocacy activities, often at the expense of providing real legal services needed by poor people.
<p>
	Legal Services suffers from an institutionalized ideological bias. Attorneys have promoted racial preferences and illegal immigration, and grantees are sufficiently politicized to become involved in congressional redistricting, litigation, and campaigning on ballot referendum questions. For the past 30 years, the LSC has been the legal pillar of the welfare state. Through litigation, advocacy, and lobbying, it has caused an increase in local, state, and federal welfare spending by hundreds of billions of dollars and has effected the addition of millions of people to the welfare rolls.4  It has sued to stop welfare reform in New Jersey and in other states. It even has engaged in actions -- litigating to prevent the eviction of drug dealers from public housing, for example -- that harm the poor.<p>	During the 1980s, even though its budget was cut by Congress, the program survived an attempt by the Reagan Administration to eliminate it. Now, however, just as welfare itself is being debated in Congress, so is the LSC's future. Like the War on Poverty itself, the Legal Services Corporation has failed. It should be abolished.
<p>

<b>LEGAL SERVICES AS POLITICAL MOVEMENT</b>
<p>
	Legal Services sees itself as a "movement."5<p>	  According to its founders, its primary mission is not to meet the needs of individual poor people, but to achieve broader social change through "law reform."6<p>	  The Legal Services agenda is grounded in the belief that the "system" creates poverty; therefore, it is the system -- America's economic, political, and cultural institutions -- that must be altered. To this end, the LSC:
<p>
Attempts to effect a redistribution of income by litigating increases in transfer payments through class action suits against local, state, and federal governments;
<p>
Is at the forefront of the so-called rights revolution, litigating to promote "children's rights,"7 to protect aggressive panhandling,8 and to establish the right to camp in city parks and streets;9 and
<p>
Engages in lobbying and political advocacy. Sixteen LSC grantees known as "support centers," national in scope and organized around specific issues such as housing, welfare, immigration, youth, and food,10 function as the legal arm of a host of social and political causes.<p>	The LSC says grantees handled 1.6 million matters last year. Supporters say allegations of ideological bias are without merit and that, due to sheer volume, it is inevitable that the program will become involved in some controversial cases. But a review of thousands of cases and news articles11clearly indicates that the LSC has never filed a major case opposed to the goals of the homosexual, feminist, or environmental movements or designed to help poor clients preserve the right to home schooling, defend the right to own firearms, stop the establishment of substance abuse facilities in their neighborhoods, or challenge any type of gender or ethnic quota.<p><b>AVOIDING ACCOUNTABILITY</b><p>	The Legal Services Corporation cannot be reformed because it was designed to avoid external controls. In affect, it takes public funds and transforms them into private funds, immune from the safeguards that govern other federal spending.
<P>
	The LSC's unique structure, established by the Legal Services Corporation Act of 1974 (drafted in part by Alan Houseman, a legal services movement theoretician) guarantees a lack of accountability. The LSC is an independent, private, nonprofit corporation which makes grants to separately incorporated, private, nonprofit grantees, some of which make subgrants to other groups and to each other. An eleven-member board is appointed by the President, subject to Senate confirmation,12 but has little actual influence over grantees and how they spend their grant money. Presidents Ronald Reagan and (to a lesser extent) George Bush appointed LSC critics to the board, but they were unable to effect any real reform. Moreover, by law, the LSC's budget is submitted directly to Congress. All the Office of Management and Budget can do is review it.13<p>	The LSC's status as a private corporation also exempts it from many provisions of the federal criminal code, such as the Anti-Deficiency Act, that apply to government officials. While it is a felony for a federal official to misappropriate federal funds, the LSC Act declares that "officers and employees of the Corporation shall not be considered officers and employees" of the federal government.<p>	From time to time, Congress and the LSC board have sought to exercise oversight. They have been all but ignored. Since most grantees receive at least some funding from IOLTA funds and from state and local governments, they can claim that any restricted activities are not supported by LSC funds. The result:  Restrictions on LSC involvement in abortion, congressional redistricting, politics, lobbying, and advocacy are ignored or circumvented.
<p>
	There is no way to confirm resource allocation claims because LSC attorneys do not keep time sheets. Attorney time is the most valuable asset in any law office, and timekeeping is absolutely <i>de riguer</i> at any private firm. Lack of timekeeping prevents oversight by eliminating the only real way to track the activities of Legal Services lawyers.
<p>
	LSC lawyers do not report their cases to anyone outside their offices, and all client and case records are closed. This secrecy, based on invocation of attorney-client privilege, makes it impossible to evaluate the effectiveness of Legal Services attorneys. Moreover, there are no provisions for the waiving of this privilege for purposes of oversight, even though tax funds pay for the services rendered.
<p>
	Because of these built-in problems, there is little information on expenditures, either per case or per type of case. While most government programs are required to have detailed accounting systems to explain how taxpayer money is used, Legal Services continues to ask for government funding without offering any detailed evidence of how it has used money already received.
<p>
	At present, the only way the LSC can track how grants are used is through a monitoring program involving on-site visits to programs by Washington-based staff. During the Bush Administration, about 125 visits took place annually, so the average program could expect a visit only once every three years. Under the Clinton-appointed board, this largely ineffective program has been weakened to the point where only six monitoring visits took place last year.
<P>
	It makes little difference who sits in the White House, in Congress, or on the LSC board. As long as they flow through the LSC to its 323 grantees, public funds will be spent to further a private political agenda. As Alan Houseman wrote in a 1984 history of the LSC, "Since the central directions of the program were not created by statutes or regulations, they are invariably difficult to undo by regulations and LSC policies."14<p><b>POLITICS AND SURVIVAL</b><p>	After the election of Ronald Reagan, even though the LSC supposedly is restricted in its ability to lobby Congress,15 officials directed a "survival campaign"16 that cost millions of dollars and mobilized thousands of Legal Services lawyers. This effort included such activities as training activists to lobby;17 transferring hundreds of thousands of LSC dollars to sympathetic outside organizations;18 orchestrating positive media coverage; and generating thousands of phone calls, letters, and visits to Congress.19  Some LSC offices were advised to have receptionists respond to potential clients by saying:  "I'm sorry but at this time we are unable to handle this kind of case. Due to the recent proposed federal cutbacks, we have had to reduce our caseload drastically. It would be unethical for us to take any cases.... "20<p>	An LSC grantee, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association (NLADA) became the "corporation in exile."  Having received no more than $72,900 annually in LSC support before 1981, NLADA received $2.2 million in late 1981. Staff members responsible for awarding the grants went on the NLADA payroll after leaving the LSC.21  This effort was known as "saving the rubies," a reference to the action of Czar Nicholas in sending the Russian Crown Jewels to Switzerland for safekeeping during the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917.<p>	In 1983, the Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee conducted oversight hearings on the survival campaign. Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-UT) concluded that "The political abuses by LSC and many of its gr
ant recipients were not simply isolated anomalies. They were the business of Legal Services. They were committed on a national scale and were planned by key members of the LSC's national leadership."
<p>
	Also in 1983, the U.S. General Accounting Office concluded that the LSC survival campaign had violated the law.22  This prompted a criminal investigation by the Justice Department. In July 1984, Assistant Attorney General Stephen S. Trott asserted that "the unauthorized activities of the Corporation, and many people associated with it, are uniquely reprehensible and beyond the scope of LSC's original mission" but that "notwithstanding these inappropriate, misguided, and abusive activities, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 1913 as well as the federal theft and fraud laws -- for technical reasons -- were not violated by the lobbying activities involved here."23  Among these "technical reasons," of course, was the fact that LSC employees are not subject to laws that apply to federal employees.<p>	LSC grantees have sought to affect the composition of Congress through redistricting litigation. In 1989, the LSC board banned grantees from participating in redistricting cases, only to be sued by Texas Rural Legal Aid, California Rural Legal Assistance, and North Mississippi Rural Legal Services. A U.S. Appeals Court upheld the prohibition, "particularly in light of the Act's mandate to LSC to ensure that the legal services program remain free from partisan political involvement.... " According to Judge (now former White House Counsel) Abner Mikva, "we cannot conclude that LSC has no right to prohibit its grantees from engaging in partisan activities."24<p>	In addition to grants, the legal services infrastructure benefits from money litigated away from taxpayers. The National Center for Youth Law forced Arkansas in 1993 to expand its child welfare system and won $314,107 in legal fees.25  Kansas Legal Services has charged clients up to $100 per hour for filing Social Security disability insurance cases, collecting almost $2 million in fees from money awarded in these actions.26<p><b>PROMOTING WELFARE DEPENDENCY</b>
<p>
	LSC grantees have won hundreds of billions in expanded welfare, AFDC,27 Medicaid, and food stamp benefits. Legal Services also has expanded welfare by seeking to nullify any "moral" conditions connected to its provision, such as a requirement for identifying the fathers of illegitimate children;28 by attacking citizenship29 and residency requirements;30 and by signing up thousands of alcoholics and substance abusers for Social Security disability insurance benefits.31  Western Massachusetts Legal Services (WMLS) has published a brochure advising lottery winners that they can stay on welfare by such devices as prepaying rent, buying a special gift, or taking a vacation.32  In 1994, WMLS filed suit to get Arthur Cooney back on welfare after he admittedly had spent the $75,000 he won in a 1992 lottery on drugs and gambling.33<p>	While the exact amount cannot be calculated, government spending for LSC litigation, advocacy, and lobbying has contributed significantly to the national debt. In 1973, former OEO Legal Services Director Earl Johnson, Jr., wrote that "A bare handful of lawyers, scarcely a footnote in the federal budget, has produced massive transfers of goods and services to the poor -- some from the private sector and some from the public treasury."34  Johnson pointed to the initial period between 1965 and 1972, when federal legal services cost the taxpayer a total of $290 million:<p><blockquote>	     [T]he welfare residency decision already has produced between $300 and $600 million added income for the poor, the 1968 man-in-house decision $400-$800 million, the 1969 and 1970 food stamp cases have thus far produced over $450 million in additional food stamp allotments, the prior hearing case over $200-$300 million. The California Medicaid suit saved $200 million in health services, the New York Medicaid case thus far has saved $367 million, and other actions undoubtedly have generated several million in additional income. Thus a total dividend in excess of $2 billion actually has been received by th
e poor since the beginning of the federal investment in legal services to the poor.35 </blockquote><p>		 Asserting that the program's "benefits" outweighed its "cost" by a ratio of 7 to 1, Johnson further calculated that since benefits were won in the form of entitlements, and therefore would continue many years into the future, the actual ratio was closer to 34 to 1.36<p>	Legal Services now seeks to protect earlier gains. To this end, LSC lawyers have responded to the 1988 Family Support Act, which allowed states to seek waivers from the federal government to experiment with welfare, by suing to obstruct or stop virtually every reform that has been attempted.
<p>
	In 1993, for example, Legal Services of New Jersey sued both the state and federal governments to prevent implementation of a cap on AFDC benefits designed to discourage illegitimacy.37<p>	In 1995, the Legal Services Organization of Indiana (LSOI) filed a class action suit challenging Governor Evan Bayh's welfare reform plan, which includes a work requirement and benefit reduction for families that fail to get their children immunized or to send them to school.38  An LSOI-employed lobbyist organized opposition to the plan when it was before the Indiana legislature.39<p>	Legal Services also has sued to block welfare reform in California, New York, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Should Congress enact a serious overhaul of the welfare system, it is safe to assume that LSC lawyers will fight its implementation in the courts as well.<p><b>HELPING TO DESTROY PUBLIC HOUSING</b>
<p>
	One of the major problems in public housing today is drug-related crime. In Georgia, according to John Hiscox, Executive Director of the Macon Housing Authority (MHA), "One of the most difficult and persistent obstacles to removing drug-related, criminal activity from public housing has been Georgia Legal Services."  While it has never won a case, GLS routinely demands costly jury trials. The result:  The MHA's average legal cost for an eviction went from a few hundred dollars in 1987 to $8,000 in 1990. During the same period, its annual legal bill increased from $10,000 to $90,000.
<p>
	In 1989, Georgia Legal Services tried to prevent the eviction of Tina Burke, whose apartment was surrounded by gangs of young men and lookouts. During surveillance, police witnessed her presence during drug transactions in her apartment. But GLS maintained that she lacked knowledge of such transactions. In 1994, tenant Shon Scott was arrested after leaving a crack house two blocks from his residence. Along with a firearm and a beeper, he possessed 33 pieces of crack cocaine. He pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute. GLS fought Scott's eviction on the basis that his crimes did not take place on public housing property.40<p>	In New York City, the Legal Aid Society of New York went to court in 1994 to challenge the New York Housing Authority's plan to make it easier to evict drug dealers by cutting the process (which now can take as long as three years) to only three to four months. The Interim Council of Presidents, the organization representing public housing tenant groups, filed a brief in support of faster evictions. Tenants say they cannot sit out at night, let their children play after dark, or even visit others in their own buildings.41<p>	In Pennsylvania, when the Philadelphia Housing Authority (PHA) attempted to evict a woman who allegedly was dealing drugs, loan sharking, and extorting money from other tenants, an LSC grantee filed a federal civil rights suit on her behalf and won on the grounds that the PHA had not given her adequate notice of the charges. Legal Services lawyers obtained $5,500 in legal fees. In 1993, another tenant set fire to her unit and the PHA won her eviction in state court. Legal Services filed a federal civil rights case and won a stay of the eviction. As of June 15, 1995, the case was still pending.42<p>	In Pittsburgh, Neighborhood Legal Services (NLS) has sued Northside Tenants Reorganization (NTR) repeatedly to prevent evictions of tenants responsible for drug dealing, violence, and vandalism. NTR is a tenant group which manages and owns its own low-incom
e housing. NTR Executive Director Harriet Henson and a building manager say they saw a tenant's boyfriend complete a heroin deal. "It took us two years to evict because NLS took us to appeal and appeal and appeal."43<p><b>UNDERMINING THE FAMILY</b><p>	Some Legal Services cases undermine the rights of parents. In 1994, notwithstanding a congressional ban on involvement in abortion litigation, the National Center for Youth Law (NCYL), co-counsel with the American Civil Liberties Union, succeeded in overturning a 1987 California law requiring a teenager to seek the approval of a parent or juvenile court judge before getting an abortion. NCYL sought legal fees for 681 hours at $300 per hour from the state. It was awarded two-thirds of the amount it sought, pending eventual success before the California Supreme Court.44<p>	In another area, the San Francisco-based National Center for Youth Law in April 1995 admonished Idaho parents about inviting police into their homes to search for drugs they suspected their children of using. The innovative Canyon County, Idaho, program is completely voluntary, and police make no arrests unless the drugs they find are especially dangerous or in large quantities.45<p>	Other cases also carry serious implications for adoptive parents. In 1993, for example, the Idaho Legal Aid Society (ILAS) sued to take a four-year-old child away from his legal parents. Karla and Leland Swenson had adopted a half-Sioux boy in 1989 when he was one-day old and were raising him on their dairy farm. ILAS claimed the boy should live with Indian relatives even though neither of his natural parents had sought custody. Representing the natural father's Indian sister, ILAS argued that a tribe's efforts to preserve its cultural integrity took precedence over the best interests of the child. The Swensons sold their home to raise funds to continue the legal fight.46<p>	In New Jersey, Somerset-Sussex Legal Services is seeking to take a one-year-old boy away from his adoptive parents because his natural
 father wants him back. Reverend Paul Rack and his wife adopted the baby in February 1994 when he was three weeks old. According to a letter circulated by community leaders in support of the Racks, the natural father is unemployed, has a criminal record, and already cannot support several other children.47<p>	In a third case, however, Legal Services fortunately did not fare well. Pennsylvania's Lehigh Valley Legal Services sued to get parental rights for the 16-year-old father of a child conceived by his rape of a 13-year-old. The rapist has a long criminal record and two other illegitimate children. In March 1995, the judge ruled against LVLS and criticized "misguided adults" for bringing the case.48<p>	Several LSC actions advance goals of homosexual activists. In 1993, James Cox and his male "partner" attempted to adopt a child. The Florida Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services denied their application because Florida law prohibits homosexual adoption. The American Civil Liberties Union Foundation successfully sued, the state appealed, and the statute in question was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court on April 27, 1995.49  Legal Services of Greater Miami filed a brief in support of the ACLU Foundation's position in this case.<p>	In a similar 1994 case, Brooklyn Law School's Family Law Clinic, another LSC grantee, successfully represented a lesbian seeking to adopt her female "partner's" child. A Family Court ruled that a same-sex partner had the same rights as a stepparent for purposes of the adoption statute.50  In a 1989 case also attempting to equate homosexual relationships with the traditional family, the Legal Aid Society of New York and Community Action for Legal Services, Inc., filed amicus curiae briefs in state courts arguing that a "gay life partner" should have the same right as a spouse to remain in a rent-controlled apartment after the tenant's death. The New York Supreme Court agreed.51<p>	LSC lawyers even have attempted to secure legal recognition of a right to public housi
ng for minors. In a 1993 case, a U.S. Court of Appeals upheld federal requirements that public housing be leased to tenants at least 18 years old, and in 1991, Central Pennsylvania Legal Services sued the Reading, Pennsylvania, Housing Authority for refusing to lease a unit to an unemancipated and unmarried 16-year-old girl.52<p><b>PROMOTING ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION</b><p>	The Legal Services apparatus has been equally active on issues pertaining to illegal immigration. When the voters of California passed Proposition 187 in 1994 to deny public benefits to illegal aliens, California Rural Legal Assistance, the American Civil Liberties Union, and other groups filed suit to stop its implementation.53  Prior to election day, LSC grantees campaigned against the measure. Claudia Smith, a lawyer with California Rural Legal Assistance, told the media that "It's just a question of whether we have the time or the resources to lay Prop 187 bare."54<p>	The National Immigration Law Center (NILC), a Legal Services support center, sued the state of California over a 1992 law requiring those seeking emergency health services under Medi-Cal to disclose their immigration status. Legal Services attorneys contended that the law should be struck down because it would deter undocumented immigrants from seeking emergency services. The California Supreme Court rejected this argument in December 1994.55  The NILC also condemned Congress's insertion of a stipulation into the $9 billion earthquake relief bill last year prohibiting non-emergency aid to illegal aliens. The amendment denied illegal aliens access to home repair loans, disaster grants, and U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) housing assistance, although it did allow them to collect emergency food and clothing.56<p>	The National Immigration Law Center also sued to force the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) to stop asking resident aliens to pay $70 to renew green cards issued before 1978. The replacement program was part of an INS effort 
to end widespread document fraud. Legal Services claimed the $70 fee was excessive. A federal judge in Sacramento, however, disagreed and upheld the fee in November 1993.57<p>	This Legal Services activity extends even to the deportation of criminals. In Georgia, for example, the Atlanta Legal Aid Society attempted to halt the deportation of Cuban nationals convicted of committing serious crimes, including attempted murder and drug trafficking. Arriving in 1980 via the Mariel Boatlift, the Cubans committed these crimes while on immigration parole. After their release from prison, their immigration parole was revoked, and authorities subsequently placed them in detention to await return to Cuba. Atlanta Legal Aid lawyers said their detention violated their constitutional rights and international law. In 1993, a U.S. Appeals Court rejected the petition.58<p>	In Massachusetts, Greater Boston Legal Services sued to stop the deportation of an alien resident who had been convicted of serious drug offenses. A Dominican woman was tried, convicted, and sentenced on four drug offenses that took place in 1982, including possession of and intent to distribute cocaine. Twelve years later, in 1994, a U.S. Court of Appeals let the deportation order stand.59  Another case involved the ability of the INS, under the 1986 Immigration Control Act, to deny residency to immigrants with one felony or three misdemeanors. In 1992, California Rural Legal Assistance sued the INS to stop the denial of temporary residency to immigrant agricultural workers with criminal records, arguing that this practice violated both the workers' Fifth Amendment rights and the Administrative Rules Procedure Act. In 1994, a U.S. Appeals Court rejected the Fifth Amendment claims but upheld Legal Services' challenge on administrative grounds.60<p>	Two LSC grantees sued California's Department of Motor Vehicles for refusing to issue drivers' licenses to illegal aliens. As required by law, the DMV requires that all applicants provide proof of legal reside
ncy to obtain licenses. The National Immigration Law Center and California Rural Legal Assistance sued the DMV on behalf of several illegal aliens whose applications had been rejected. A state appeals court ruled that the "DMV is not only authorized but obligated" to deny licenses to illegal aliens.61<p>	In yet another California Rural Legal Assistance case, the organization in 1982 sued U.S. Attorney Joseph Russoniello for investigating allegations that unqualified aliens had been registered to vote. The purpose of this investigation was not to prosecute improperly registered voters, but to find out whether someone was deliberately signing up unqualified residents. CRLA sued Russoniello on the grounds that his investigation of Spanish-speaking residents was "invidious discrimination."  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected this argument.62<p>	The extremes to which such litigation can be pushed may be indicated in a 1991 case. Two LSC grantees, Texas Rural Legal Aid and the Los Angeles-based National Health Law Program, filed a complaint with the Department of Health and Human Services asking it to sue the McAllen, Texas, Medical Center because its security guards wore uniforms allegedly resembling those of Border Patrol agents. Legal Services said this discriminated against illegal aliens because it discouraged them from seeking care.63<p><b>PROMOTING RACIAL PREFERENCES</b><P>	The Legal Services apparatus certainly is no stranger to litigation that promotes racial preference. In 1978, LSC filed an <i>amicus</i> brief supporting the University of California's minority set-aside program in the famous <i>Bakke</i> case. The U.S. Supreme Court, however, declared the UC-Davis set-aside unconstitutional because it reserved places for minorities exclusively because of their race.64<p>	In a 1992 case, the outcome was somewhat different. The Cincinnati, Ohio, quota system, adopted in the 1970s, required that at least 18 percent of all fire personnel be minorities. To achieve this numerical goal, the fi
re division made it a practice to insure that at least 40 percent of all new recruits were minorities. White applicants who scored higher than minority applicants on the civil service exam but were rejected sued the city for reverse discrimination. A U.S. Court of Appeals agreed with the Legal Aid Society of Cincinnati's position and ruled that the white applicants' constitutional rights were not violated.65<p><b>HELPING CRIMINALS</b>
<P>
	In addition to litigating in behalf of criminals the government is seeking to deport, Legal Services lawyers have been active in behalf of domestic criminals. Starting in 1991, for example, Georgia Legal Services has filed petitions for the release of David Nagel from a maximum security mental hospital. Nagel was imprisoned for murdering both his grandparents by slitting their throats in 1981 when they refused to give him the car keys.66<p>	In Florida, Greater Orlando Area Legal Services in 1989 successfully sued the Orange County Jail to stop segregation of HIV-positive inmates. Infected inmates now are placed in the general prison population without notification to other inmates in order to insure their "privacy."  The suit was filed on behalf of 18 former inmates, most of whom were deceased when the case was settled in 1994. After four and a half years of litigation, a federal judge ordered Orange County to pay Greater Orlando Area Legal Services $81,500 in legal fees.67<p><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<P>
	The Legal Services Corporation cannot be reformed. Because money is fungible in the hands of private groups with more than one funding source, no new restrictions can insure the accountability of taxpayer funds. Most legal problems faced by the poor fall into several basic categories:  family, including divorce, custody, guardianship and child support; housing, including landlord/tenant controversies; financial, including bankruptcy, wills, estates, and inability to pay bills; consumer; employment; and public benefits. While taxpayer funds are provided to Legal Services for the handling of individual cases, too great a portion of such funds are used to pursue class action suits and ideologically important test cases.
<p>
	Legal Services has helped to destroy the independence and dignity of poor people and to create a permanent underclass. Its activities undermine both the family and the larger community. For the sake of the American taxpayer -- and for the sake of America's poor -- it is time to abolish the Legal Services Corporation.

<title>Straight Talk November 1, 1995 Transcript</title>
<body>
<center><h2>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</h2>
<p>
<h4>Broadcast aired Wednesday, November 1, 1995, 8:00-9:00 P.M.</h4></center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You've never seen this show before, <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>.  You may be wondering what we're
about or why we have a television show.
<P>
 Well, the Family Research Council has been researching and influencing
government and cultural policies affecting the American family
since 1981.  Already this year, Family Research Council has appeared
on more than 50 television programs, from CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> to PBS
<i>MacNeil-Lehrer</i> to ABC's <i>Nightline</i>.  In fact, we are profiled in
the <i>New York Times</i> news feature, today.
<P>
 We've responded to what many have to say about families.  I am
your host, Kristi Hamrick, and now <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i> gives you the opportunity to hear what we have
to say, unedited.
<P>
 You watch the news and read the newspaper, but do you ever wonder
if you're getting the real story?  Gary Bauer is one source that
you can trust.  He knows what is happening behind Washington's
closed doors, from years of experience, from the Reagan White
House to grassroots America.  For a news perspective you can't
get in the newspapers, our first segment features Gary Bauer,
president of the Family Research Council, Behind the Headlines.
<P>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<P>
Gary, it has been a very historic week on Capitol Hill, and particularly
with the budget.  We've seen some real fights, almost to the finish.
 What's your perspective on the historic things we have been seeing
lately?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I think what's so unique about this past week is
that we've had a group of people run for office last year promising
the American people they would cut the budget, they would get
a balanced budget on the books that really would be predictable
and something where there would be a deadline for that balanced
budget.  And they have come to Washington and, lo and behold,
they have actually done what they said they were going to do in
the campaign.
<P>
 There has been a lot of public cynicism, and legitimately so,
in the last few years, about politicians saying one thing and
doing another.  But this latest group of Congressmen and Senators
have fulfilled their promises, and I think the American people,
over the next year, when they begin to look at the details instead
of listening to some of the scare tactics, are going to be astonished
and quite pleased that we now have some fiscally responsible people
in Washington and are cutting back the size of government.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In this budget debate, we have seen some new heroes
as a result of the last election.  What's your perspective on
who deserves the credit for the historic things taking place on
Capitol Hill?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  There's a lot of good guys in the House and Senate,
but I think the thing that really stands out is this freshman
class, particularly in the House of Representatives.  They have
come here, and they haven't been taken in by the power structure
of Washington at all.  They really have moved to cut some programs
that even impact their own home districts.  They have been willing
to take on their own leadership on occasion, which is really extraordinary
for freshmen.
<P>
 And so I think there has been a real generational change.  If
we have a couple more cycles like this where the types of people
you get in the House and Senate from both parties are more willing
to deal with some of these tough issues, I think the country will
be a lot better off for it.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I think what strikes me about that -- and I am
interested in your perspective -- is here we see the most successful
class of recent history, maybe of all time, in terms of a real
change from the floor up, saying it's economic and social issues.
 At the same time, we see the GOP, it would appear, ready to throw
away the marriage of those issues and go with someone like perhaps
a Powell.  Colin Powell is in the news a lot lately.  What's your
perspective on what it means for the GOP or just what it means
for the current political climate?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  Well, you know, Christy, I think the important thing
here is not the Powell candidacy or Bob Dole's candidacy or Phil
Gramm's candidacy; all of that will sort itself out, I think,
in the months ahead.  But the key thing really is what kind of
party is it; what are the principles the party stands for.
<P>
 I got into politics way back in 1964 in the Barry Goldwater campaign,
which was a disaster at the polls but began the movement in the
Republican Party to becoming a predictably conservative traditional
party.  And as the party stood for those principles over the years
after that, it began to win elections.  When it violated some
of those principles, the conservative coalition got divided, and
then we would lose elections.
<P>
 I guess the most obvious example is when some of his advisors
convinced George Bush to raise taxes.  I understand the pressure
he was under, but that was a mistake, and it ended up creating
Ross Perot and costing Bush the election.
<P>
 My hope would be that whoever the nominee of the party is a year
from now, that the party remembers that it has gotten this success
because it stood for things:  low taxes, smaller government, traditional
family values, the sanctity of life, a strong foreign policy.
 Those are the things that have gotten the party where it is today.
 Those are the things, I think, that can carry it into victory
later and make it the majority party in the next century, and
those are the things that I certainly want to fight for in the
months ahead.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  One last question, Gary.  There is a lot going
on on the Hill, and I know you need to get back to the phone calls,
Congressmen and Senators lining up.  But one thing that we hear
a lot about these days is that social conservatives are willing
to give on certain points.  And yet one of the things I know that
-- some of the data that Family Research Council has been looking
at, original polling, would indicate that some of those values
aren't for sale.  What's your perspective on whether or not conservative,
pro-family Americans are willing to have victory at any cost or
whether there are some things that are going to be sticking points
as people start looking at their platforms, issues, and just the
kind of society we want?
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I think this is really important for the party establishment
to understand.  If the party walked out again on tax issues, for
example, or if for some bizarre reason it became a big-tax party,
millions of voters would walk out of the party at that point.
 These voters believe that Americans are overtaxed.  I believe
Americans are overtaxed.  So the party really needs to stay with
that issue.
<P>
 Likewise, if the party walked out on the concept of the sanctity
of human life, or if they walked out on issues involving parents
and the rights they ought to have in raising their children, if
they did that, there is a significant segment of the Republican
Party that would walk out on them.
<P>
 So I think it is a pretty basic issue.  Parties stay together
and become majorities because they deal with the issues that draw
those voters to them, and when they abandon those issues, the
voters abandon the party, and I think that is what would happen
in 1996.  I hope the party or no one in the party is so foolish
as to think that they can throw anybody in the coalition a bone
and somehow still get their votes on election day.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for being
with us, Gary.  We'll look forward to some of your insights next
week. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll ask some hard
questions about what is happening to our children's education.
 Stay tuned.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 ANNOUNCER:  Parents want their children to learn how to read,
to write, to do math, and to tell right from wrong.  We want schools
that teach sound curriculum and positive values, schools where
teachers are good role models.  At one time, it didn't seem like
this was too much to ask, but today our school system is not accomplishing
this essential task.
<P>
 Secretary of Education Richard Riley says that he has the answer.
 He says that he has a system that works, and it is called Goals
2000.  Those opposed to Riley believe that Goals 2000 creates
federal control over our children's education and over our rights
as parents and communities to have a say in that education.
<P>
 As a result, some states refused to cash in on the program. 
Virginia and New Hampshire never took a penny of the Goals 2000
funds, and Alabama recently sent back the $1.4 million in federal
funding they had received under Goals 2000.  If other states follow
suit, Goals 2000 may eventually go out of business.
<P>
 But for now, a growing number of parents are becoming increasing
disillusioned and distrustful of the public school system.  More
children are being enrolled in private schools, and some 400,000
families are currently homeschooling.
<P>
 The homeschool movement has become a promoter of strong family
relations and a model grassroots organization, providing a framework
for educational reform.  Yet Riley contends that Goals 2000 would
benefit all families, and he claims that there are no strings
attached.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  What are parents to believe?  Bill Mattox, Vice
President for Policy, and Jennifer A. Marshall, Education Policy
Analyst, both with the Family Research Council, are here to help
us understand why, for some, Goals 2000 is a four-letter word.
<P>
 Jennifer, you've worked quite a bit on education issues for us,
and what we have seen is that it is one of those things where
the advertising doesn't really represent the product.  What is
in Goals 2000 that gives us concern?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  It is easiest to look at Goals 2000 as an application
process, where the state is required to do certain things to get
money from the Federal Government, and the Federal Government
requires that a state would turn in its standards and its assessments
in order to get money for this.  And that is an inappropriate
role for them.  They are not to be dealing with curriculum.  Historically,
they haven't been allowed to; now they have transgressed into
that area.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  So it is kind of like all the schools have to submit
their lesson plans -- 
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Exactly.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  -- and the Federal Government is going to say,
&quot;I like it; I don't like it.&quot;
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  But some would say national standards are a good
thing.  I mean, we are looking at inner-city schools with falling
test scores, and we are saying, How do we make it better?  Why
not national standards?  I mean, what's wrong with that?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  It's an easy answer; you're right.  But we've
seen with these national history standards exactly what can go
wrong.  They're easily captured by a political faction, and for
anybody who didn't think that the politically correct, anti-American
history standards that we saw last year were a problem, well,
what if Senator Jesse Helms or Representative Newt Gingrich had
written those?  I think we would have a different picture.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  What's kind of interesting about Goals 2000 is
it makes it out as though government is the solution to our educational
problems.  And, Bill, I know you have taken a look at children
who really do succeed.  A lot of people may have seen some of
Bill's columns country-wide, as a matter of fact, from the Detroit
News even on this topic.
<P>
 What have you seen, Bill, in terms of children who succeed? 
Why do they succeed in school?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, it's interesting.  For a long time, there
has been a great deal of inquiry into questions about why do kids
in certain schools do better than those in others, and dating
back to the mid-1960s, one of the things that has shown up consistently
in the research is that it is not so much what goes on at the
school that may be ultimately most significant; it is, instead,
what is taking place in the home and how rich a learning environment
kids have in the home.
<P>
 When kids have the benefit of growing up in a household where
their parents are actively involved in reading to them, in sharing
in mealtimes where there is a rich dinnertime discussion, in tucking
them into bed and that kind of thing, there are significant differences
that show up in terms of how well kids do in school.  How much
access kids have to home learning tools, to encyclopedias, books,
newspapers, computers, things of that nature, have a dramatic
effect on a child's learning.
<P>
 One of things that I guess concerns me a great deal about Goals
2000 is that it further marginalizes parents.  It kind of pushes
them to the periphery of the education of children and does not
recognize them as a central player.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Secretary Riley -- I have seen the news conference
where he was talking about this new partnership with parents and
how important that they are.  Does anything the government is
doing right now, or maybe the Clinton Administration, really facilitate
a greater partnership with parents?  I mean, in Goals 2000, is
one of the goals Mom and Dad showing up and helping?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  There is quite a bit of rhetoric, actually, about
parental involvement.  But we find a problem when it is the government
defining exactly what parental involvement will be.  We have seen
parents be relegated to a back seat -- just pay and be quiet about
the way schools are run -- and that is not an appropriate role
for involving parents at all.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes.  I mean, this is such an important point, because
a lot of times, you are right, there is a lot of lipservice about
parental involvement.  The Secretary just put out a report last
year saying, Boy, parents are key to education.  And yet when
you stop and really examine what they are saying, the way that
they define parental involvement is, well, if you think of a potluck
dinner, I think they seem to think that what schools and experts
like themselves provide is kind of the meat and potatoes of education,
and what parents provide is kind of the dessert.  It's a nice
frill, but it's not absolutely essential to the well-being of
children and to their educational development.  And yet the research
consistently contradicts that point of view.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  One would think, if you look at some of the Clinton
Administration rhetoric on Goals 2000, that every state is clamoring
for this money, because it all comes down to money.
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Jennifer, what does your analysis show in terms
of how states -- are they embracing this?  Are they exciting about
it?  What's happening at the grass roots?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  You'd be surprised at how much murmuring there
is against Goals 2000, both at the federal and the state level.
 Two states flat out said, &quot;No, we will not take this money.&quot;
 They absolutely rejected the money, and that was New Hampshire
and Virginia.  And then we saw an almost unprecedented move of
Alabama to send back federal money and say, &quot;No, thank you;
we won't stoop this low to take this money.&quot;
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That's kind of astounding.
<P>
 I know, Bill, you've been looking at different educational reforms
in the state.  What states have seen better numbers, or have we
seen better partnerships with parents anywhere?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, the key, I think, is to not think so much
in terms of systems or even in terms of states, but to really
look at how can we succeed in furthering education at the local
level, because one of the things that comes out of the research
again consistently is not just that parents are central players
in this process, but when they are surrounded by a community of
adults that are prepared to help them in that process and to support
them, then you then see the kinds of results that I think we are
all looking for.
<P>
 And so I think a lot of the key to this debate is getting the
discussion back to the local level, getting the Federal Government
-- and even in many ways the state government -- out of the action
and really putting emphasis on the local community and especially
on parents.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I have been really interested as I have been looking
at the data that small things -- whether you read to your child,
which we'll talk more about later; whether a parent even attends
a PTA meeting, or whether there is even a father in the home --
that even family structure needs to be read, rather than what
dollars per child in education.
<P>
 Bill, you headed a fathership program at Family Research Council
for a long time now, Being a Dad Is Important Business.  Just
quickly, as we are getting near the end, what do we know about
the importance of even a father in the home, or for those people
with broken family structures, the importance of having a dad
involved, or a dad figure?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, this is a very important point, because a
lot of the research tends to focus on what are sometimes defined
as process variables; that is, are families eating together, are
they reading to children, are there various processes taking place
within the family that might enhance a child's learning?
<P>
 And yet we know that families in which fathers are present are
much more likely to have these kinds of things take place.  There
are dramatic differences in the rates, say, for example, of how
many family meals a family might enjoy together between two-parent
and single-parent households, and it's not because single mothers
have any less desire to be home and to be able to sit down and
dine with their kids; it is that they are quite often facing extraordinary
odds in trying to do the work of two parents by themselves.  And
it becomes very difficult for all the different trains to run
on time and for them to have the kind of routine that is actually
quite important to a child's well-being and educational development.
<P>
 So it is important that we recognize that the contribution that
families make is one that comes from these different processes
taking place, but there are family structures -- namely, those
in which both parents are present -- that lend themselves more
to these kinds of activities than single-parent families.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Goals 2000, Jennifer, it tries to say that
if we tweak things -- numbers of books, numbers of classrooms,
teacher ratios -- that it is all the hard variables, hard-wired
things, that make a big difference.  Is that accurate?  Would
you say that Goals 2000 says, &quot;Give me enough books; I can
give you an A student&quot;?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  They focus on something called opportunity-to-learn
standards, which is just what you've described:  what goes in,
the inputs, measuring how much we've got there.  And it's all
about systems management.  It doesn't deal with the classroom
learning, the human variables, as Bill as spoken of, at all.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And the human variables make a big difference.
<P>
 When we come back, we're going to add some more human variables.
 We're going to be talking with Mike Farris, president of the
Homeschool Legal Defense Association, and we'll find out why he's
concerned about Goals 2000 and what defense strategies he's using
to combat government control of education here in Virginia and
nationwide.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  We're joined by Mike Farris, president of the Homeschool
Legal Defense Association.  Many political watchers may remember
him as the man that the entire Democratic Party ran against in
recent Virginia elections.
<P>
 Welcome, Mike.  Glad to have you here.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Thank you.  Good to be with you.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for coming.
<P>
 We were talking about some of the problems with education earlier,
and I know they drove you in a very powerful direction:  out of
the schools.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Right.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Tell me, why did your organization decide that
we need to go a completely different direction?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, let's start with my family.  I was raised
in a public school family.  Not only did I go to public schools
myself; my dad was a public school principal.  In fact, I was
being prepared to be a lawyer for school districts.  My undergraduate
honors thesis was written under the tutelage of the state school
board's attorney.
<P>
 Someplace along the line, I figured out that the philosophy that
had taken over the education system was antithetical to the Christian
values that I believe in.  So we decided, first of all, for Christian
schools for our oldest daughter in kindergarten and first grade,
and then we heard about homeschooling and we decided to try that
14 years ago, and that is kind of a similar story -- change the
facts a little bit, but the themes are the same -- and there are
about 400,000 families homeschooling their kids today.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And Goals 2000, did that exacerbate the numbers
of people going one direction or the other?  I mean, what are
you seeing in terms of educational trends today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, homeschooling is growing at a very rapid rate.
 Private schools are growing at a rapid rate.  Goals 2000 helps
the growth of the private school and homeschool movement.  Frankly,
the thing that helped it the most was the election of Bill Clinton.
 Within about three months after Bill Clinton's election, we saw
the most phenomenal growth rate ever in membership of the Homeschool
Legal Defense Association.
<P>
 So I think that that is -- people's uncertainty about their government
is translated to uncertainty about schools.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of the government, the Family Research
Council, under Jennifer's excellent assistance, and Bill, and
Bob Morrison, put together this brochure, Let Freedom Ring, which
took a look at the national history standards.  And it was amazing
to see what they left out, everything from Thomas Edison to the
man on the moon, as you saw earlier.
<P>
 Jennifer, you have been taking a look at what has been happening
in schools.  What kinds of voids are you seeing?  Do you agree
with the voids that Mike is describing?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Yes, and the national history standards show a
direction, a very negative direction, in which public education
is going.  We produced this document with five staff over a course
of five weeks with a couple thousand dollars.  It took the Federal
Government $2 million, over two years, and a panel of probably
hundreds of experts to come up with the anti-American product
that they put out last year.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, I think it needs to be pointed out here that
not only did they overlook some of the folks that you mentioned,
but they did in fact find a way to include Madonna and the Simpsons.
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 So, somehow, somewhere, the priorities were out of whack.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of Mike's organization, recently I was
at a hearing where this whole piece of data came up that the larger
the family, the less intelligent the children at the end; that
somehow large families and homes break down when it gets to numbers.
<P>
 But we were talking about education earlier, Bill, and you saw
a whole different trend and in fact wrote about that recently
in an Op-Ed.  What did you see?
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, this has been a common theme in education research,
and it is confirmed by a new study that's out in just this month's
American Sociological Association Journal, which shows, just as
you said, the larger the family size, the poorer the educational
performance, supposedly.
<P>
 The key thing to remember, though, is this:  that some research
that has recently been done at the University of Michigan refutes
these findings in some very interesting ways.  What the University
of Michigan researchers did was they looked at some Vietnamese
boat children, some kids who had come over as refugees after the
events in the 1970s in Vietnam, and they saw that these kids were
doing amazingly well in the public school system.
<P>
 They began to ask, why is it that these kids are doing so much
better than many of their peers?  And they went and looked at
the dynamics taking place in the home and found that even though
these kids were coming from larger families, even though their
parents really could not speak much English, these kids were doing
exceptionally well; and part of the reason was because there was
something akin to the old one-room schoolhouse effect taking place.
 That is, after the kids would eat dinner, they would clear off
the dining room table.  The older children would tutor the younger
children, which would have the effect of reinforcing some of the
things that they were learning as well as transmitting new information
to the younger children.
<P>
 What that study showed is that if you think of children as kind
of educational consumers alone who are drawing upon their parents'
resources, one can easily imagine where this theory that the larger
the family size, the poorer the kids do in school comes from,
because they are all then in a sense competing with one another
for their parents' attention and resources.
<P>
 But if, instead, these older children end up serving in a sense
as educational producers who are contributing to the educational
environment in the home and making it a richer environment, then,
all of a sudden, everyone does better, and in a sense a rising
tide lifts all boats.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Mike, you've got to be seeing this kind of thing
if you look at homeschooling.  Just today I was reading in the
paper that we are seeing the data across the board that homeschooled
children test better.  What do you see as you are looking at homeschools,
children working together, families working together?  What does
the data show in your people?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Homeschoolers score 20 to 30 percentile points higher
than the public schools.  And so I would be happy to match any
ninth-born homeschooler with any firstborn public schooler any
day.
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 You can jimmy numbers any way you want, but the reality is my
ninth-born child is a smart little kid, and I have no doubts that
he is going to do just fine, and that he is enriched by the large
family.  And, frankly, if you control for some socioeconomic factors,
then I think that it is a complete explanation of these what I
would consider to be phony studies.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of homeschooling, you have had a tough
time, though, despite the growing prominence, sometimes getting
that even legal, and there have been a lot of attacks.  I am sure
we all remember H.R. 6.  What kinds of attacks are coming against
efforts to look at other educational options for families?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, the establishment doesn't like anybody that,
A, pulls out of the system, and, B, does a better job.  The consequential
embarrassment that comes to them causes some retribution at times.
<P>
 But the battles have changed.  We have been defending homeschoolers
for 13 years now.  Initially, it was a total ban on homeschooling.
 It's a little more sophisticated than that now, and they usually
don't try to do a total ban, but the battles are still there.
<P>
 We had a situation in Kansas within this last three or four months
where a judge held that homeschooling was illegal.  We appealed
that and got that reversed.  The more common problem is really
social services agencies that -- like a case we have in Sacramento
right now.  There were three allegations against a family.  One
was that they were very religious; secondly, that they were homeschooling;
and, third is they heard a child say, &quot;No, Daddy, no.&quot;
 And based on those three facts and those three facts alone, they
busted down the door and did a strip-search of the children.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That is amazing.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  And so, of course, we are suing those people in
Federal District Court.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  Even that your organization, Legal Defense Association,
that we have to do that.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  You know, one of the things Mike's comments reminded
me of is that even though we do see the system out there quite
often harassing homeschoolers, one of the things that was rather
interesting to me as I began pulling together some of this recent
research is that there are several very prominent school teachers
who have been in the public school system, or are currently in
the system, who are saying, &quot;You know, there's something
going on over there that we really ought to take notice of.&quot;
<P>
 I know a recent teacher who was just named Teacher of the Year
in New York City made comments of this kind, and a Seattle public
school teacher has written a book about homeschooling and talks
about how, in many ways, the homeschool environment offers what
public school teachers have for many years been advocating in
terms of teacher-student ratio and things of that nature.
<P>
 And so it may be that, at least among some school teachers, we
are seeing a change in attitude that is quite promising for years
to come.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I thought it was interesting, in Massachusetts,
before public schools, 98 percent of the children were literate;
after public schools, it has always been a 6 percent drop and
never been that high.
<P>
 What do you think?  I think the fear that people have to have,
Mike, is that I don't want my children in public schools, but
can I really be a teacher?  How do you address that kind of concern,
if I say, &quot;Look, I'm concerned about national history standards;
I don't know if I can actually do a better job&quot;?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Anyone who wants to homeschool can.  If you can
read and are basically literate yourself, you can homeschool your
kids.  Now, if you can't, you need to learn to read.  Somebody
who can't do basic math and cannot function at high-school-level
reading should not be trying to attempt this.  But for anybody
who meets those basic criteria, if you're willing to work hard,
you can do a very successful job.
<P>
 People imagine themselves trying to conduct a schoolroom.  Well,
you don't have to conduct a schoolroom.  Homeschooling is a much
different form of academic instruction, and it is easier in a
sense because you're not having group dynamics going on where
you're having to teach to the middle and trying to worry about
these; you're just teaching to one child.  It is much more efficient,
academically better, just all around is a very successful way
to produce a good education for your kids.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I think some people see the homeschoolers as people
trying to go outside of the system, maybe an Amish thing, in a
way.  Do you see that?  Because, frankly, in the terms of your
name coming up in the news, it would seem like in some ways you
get more involved in the politics of education rather than less.
<P>
 How do you talk to people who say, &quot;If I go the homeschool
route, then I'm kind of missing out on part of my culture?&quot;
 Because you're certainly here in Washington today for many reasons.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, my own belief -- and it may be a little bit
biased -- is that the most effective, most well-organized political
network in the country is the homeschoolers.  There's nothing
as good.  And people are very, very activist, and the reason is,
they've seen their freedoms directly threatened in their own life,
something that's core to their day-to-day existence; and trying
to motivate other people to get involved is much more difficult,
because it's an abstraction to them.  But homeschoolers have lived
the battles of freedom.
<P>
 What I am really excited about for the long range is the couple
of million kids that are being homeschooled that have had to personally
observe and be involved in the battles for freedom.  The leadership
potential among those kids is enormous, and I think that we're
going to see some great things.  If our generation can just hold
on by our fingernails for about another dozen years or so, my
view is that probably a quarter or a third of Congress will be
homeschool graduates within 20 years.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  That will be fascinating.
<P>
 Bill, politically speaking, in the poll -- Family Research Council
does a lot of original polling -- in the poll last year, you took
a look at who is the constituency for a pro-educational-choice
way of viewing government.  Tell me, we found some interesting,
different demographics on that.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Yes, we really did, because, like many others, we
were measuring the level of support for things like providing
parents opportunities outside of the public school system and
things of that nature, but -- 
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to hear more about that in
a second.  We're going to go to break.  We're going to be right
back with more on educational choice, or maybe you don't have
educational choice.  Please come back.  Thanks.
<P>
 [Commercial break.]
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  It was an exciting day on Capitol Hill today, in
fact a very historic vote.  The partial-birth abortion ban passed
in the House.  This was a long-fought and a very hard-fought bill
that we have been working on for a long time to preserve the lives
of children killed at the very end of the pregnancy, late-term
abortions beginning at five months through the moment of birth.
<P>
 Unfortunately, however, Congressman Joe Scarborough, who was
going to join us, could not be here, but we are happy to have
had his vote on the Hill.
<P>
 Mike, I know that one thing that you and the Congressman are
looking at is the elimination of the Department of Education.
 It is very exciting.  It is the kind of thing that we've been
talking about since 1980.  But why are we still talking about
it today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, we're talking about it because the moderates
in the Republican Party convinced President
<P>
Reagan to table the idea of eliminating the Department of Education,
and frankly, they were wrong.  What has happened to education
since the Federal Government has gotten involved has been abysmal.
 Take any measure of education you want.  Academic achievement
is down.  In fact, it is so bad now that the most recent National
Assessment of Educational Progress scores are only a quarter of
the eighth graders can do math, and only a quarter of the fourth
graders can read at the level of proficiency on both of those
statistics.  And out of every new dollar that has been spent on
education since 1972, 76 cents has gone to administrative costs
and overhead, and only 24 cents has gone to teachers.
<P>
 It's nuts.  It is a crazy, centralized, drunk system.   They're
drunk with bureaucracy.  And every new reform proposal, the only
thing you can say about it is it requires a centralized bureaucracy
to run it.  Other than that, it is just a new five-year plan like
the Soviets brought out.  Every three-and-a-half years, just like
the Soviets, they know that they fail after a while,  And so it
is time to just abolish the system and go back to local control
of schools.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  The issue in some ways is how to do that.  You
know, I think some people have a fear that educational systems
are going to be abolished, or somehow property taxes will go away
and we'll have more money and no schools.
<P>
 But certainly Michigan, which decided to be revolutionary, has
done some exciting things.  What do you think about what's happening
in Michigan?  And maybe you could tell people about it.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, I don't know that much about the details of
the Michigan program.  I just am proud of Governor Engler's general
efforts.  I have a general knowledge of it, and I think that he
has done a good job in showing that you can do things in a completely
different way and make a difference.
<P>
 Now, the impact on a local school district is that about 6 percent
of an average school district's budget comes from federal funds.
 The smarter thing is just not send that money to Washington in
the first place.  So the proposal that Jennifer and I and others
have been working on for several months now is to stop spending
the $70 billion we spend at the federal level and, instead, have
a $70 billion tax cut.  Just leave the money in the locale to
begin with and let the local people figure out how to spend it.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  See, what's so ironic about that is, there was
a survey done recently that the majority of public school teachers
had their children in private school.  We have our President with
his daughter in a private religious school, our Vice President
with his children in private religious school.  And what is funny
is private options are becoming sort of the thing that wealthier
Americans have, and some people are a little intimidated by homeschoolers,
and so people, for lack of financial resources -- which are going
to Washington in taxes -- end up in the hands of the bureaucracy.
<P>
 I mean, Bill, I know that that is a thing that you have been
concerned about.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Well, it really does gall me as one who used to
live here in the District of Columbia and had my daughter in the
public school system here, and I can well remember those kids
that she went to school with that were part of her classroom.
<P>
 You know, when Bill Clinton came to town and walked down Georgia
Avenue and tried to identify with the people that lived there,
and yet then the next week was enrolling his child in a private
school that not one of them could possibly afford, it really did
strike me as very hypocritical.
<P>
 My hope is that we can see reform not just here in the District
of Columbia but throughout the country, so that families that
are far less fortunate than the Clintons or the Gores will enjoy
the kinds of options that they now have.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  And what was ironic about that in terms of the
dollar thing is that, as I understand it, the amount that we spend
per child in the District of Columbia is the highest of any in
the Nation.
<P>
 MR. MATTOX:  Oh, it's extraordinary.  Its extraordinary.  I mean,
if you gave parents that kind of money to do with what Mike's
parents do, it's amazing the kinds of things that they could have
afforded or the kinds of private school options that parents could
avail themselves of.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  But, Jennifer, so you're not a homeschooler.  So
why should we care?  You know, what is it that you're finding
as an education policy analyst that would indicate that everyone
needs to really be in favor of the things that Mike is doing?
<P>
 MS. MARSHALL:  Well, at Family Research Council, we refer to
homeschoolers as pioneers of freedom, because they're defending
freedoms for us all.  We are all going to be better in America
because they are standing up and defending our freedoms.
<P>
 I would like to point out, too, about Mr. Clinton's great idea,
grand plan for local control of education, which he has called
Goals 2000, in that first year of funding, only 50 percent, less
than 50 percent, of the money makes it back down to the local
level.  That is not local control, by any stretch of the definition.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of local control, I think it is always
interesting that, annually, People for the American Way comes
out with a report, &quot;Attacks on the Freedom to Learn,&quot;
which could be as simple as a parent called a school saying, &quot;I'm
concerned about a book.&quot;  And this isn't democracy; this
is an attack on the freedom to learn.
<P>
 What kinds of ridiculous attacks are you seeing out there, Mike?
 And I know the &quot;censorship&quot; word gets thrown around
everywhere, and you're on the front lines of that.
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  I just don't take the People for the American Way
very seriously.  Any group that comes into being for the sole
purpose of saying born-again Christians don't have the right to
participate in politics just doesn't deserve to be called a civil
organization, much less a civil rights organization.
<P>
 Think of it.  What would people say if they would have come into
existence to say, &quot;We don't think Jews should be involved
in politics,&quot; or, &quot;We don't think that Lutherans or
Muslims or some other group&quot; -- apparently, it is okay to
say that evangelical Christians shouldn't be involved in politics,
but nobody else.  It is a patently ridiculous organization, and
I don't think that they have much of importance to say, period.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  As we get ready to close this segment of our show,
what one last thing would you like parents to know about homeschooling
or about their concern for education today?
<P>
 MR. FARRIS:  Well, I think homeschooling works very well, and
our desire simply is to be left alone, and I hope that that is
the desire of every parent, that they want to be left alone by
the Federal Government and allowed to run their schools.  Whatever
school they choose for themselves, whether it is public school
or private school or home school, they need to be left alone and
allowed to pursue excellence.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I would like to thank Mike and our guests for their
insight and for giving us the hope that parents maybe some day
will have the opportunity to influence their children's education.
<P>
 Stay tuned; there is more to come.  Thanks for watching.

 [From Christian Coalition &quot;Road to Victory&quot; Appearance,
September 8, 1995]:
<P>
 MR. BAUER:  I remember, a month or so ago, being in a hotel a
few blocks from here, sitting in a hotel room with Dan Rather
as we did two hours of interviews.  And during those interviews,
Dan Rather at one point leaned over to me and, I thought, in a
very real way, not just rhetorically, looked at me and said, &quot;Gary,
just what is it that you people want, anyway?&quot;
<P>
 I said, &quot;Well, you know, Dan, I would like to live in a
country where my daughters can go out on a date at night and I
don't have to worry about date rape.  Or my wife can take a walk
through the park a few blocks from our house and not feel that
she has to carry a can of mace with her.  I would like a country
where we wouldn't have to have bars on our windows, whether we
live in the inner city or live in the suburbs.
<P>
 &quot;I would like a country where women have economic opportunity.
 I've got two daughters.  Why wouldn't I want that?  But I also
want an America where, if my daughters decide to be a mother or
a homemaker, that that decision will be held up and honored as
something noble and good and decent.&quot;
<P>
 [Applause.]
<P>
 I told him I wanted a country that rejected racism, the racism
of Fuhrmann in Los Angeles and the racism of quotas and set-asides
and all those programs, a country where we actually taught all
of our children -- black, white, and Hispanic -- to judge others
by the content of their character and not the color of their skin.
<P>
 I told him I wanted a country that believed in the sanctity of
life again, that looked at drive-by shootings or 1.5 million abortions
a year and knew that those things were a tragedy.
<P>
 I want to be in a country where, when people play by the rules
and work hard and save and do the right things in their homes,
they actually win at the end of the day, and they're not treated
like suckers.
<P>
 I want a country that takes virtue seriously again, a country
where children aren't crying themselves to sleep at night because
there are no fathers there to comfort them or because their bodies
have been racked by venereal disease or exploited by pornography.
<P>
 In short, I told Dan Rather than I wanted a shining city upon
a hill, the place that our founders promised us.
<P>
 And as I said those things, I watched Dan Rather nod his head
up and down.  He was agreeing with me; the body language was clear.
 When I was finished, he looked at me, and he said, &quot;Gary,
that was an eloquent answer.  I've never heard anybody quite put
it that clearly.&quot;
<P>
 [Laughter.]
<P>
 And, of course, last night, if you watched that special, not
one second of that answer made it into the final show.
<P>
 You know, my friends, I think Dan Rather understood, and I think
the folks at CBS also understand, that if they actually ever really
tell the American people what we want, that the American people
will join with us in one voice and we will win.
<P>
 [Applause.]
<P>
 [From Testimony by Cathy Cleaver, FRC Director of Legal Policy,
before the Senate Judiciary Committee on October 25, 1995]:
<P>
 MS. CLEAVER:  Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, on behalf
of Gary Bauer and the Family Research Council, I want to express
our sincere appreciation for the opportunity to address this distinguished
committee on the critical issue of religious liberty.
<P>
 The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent.  The Establishment
Clause was designed to prevent the state from coercing our religious
belief.  The Free Exercise Clause was designed to prevent the
state from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.
 Thus, the religion clauses were designed to work hand in hand
to promote government neutrality with regard to religion.
<P>
 In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The
Court has created a false conflict between the religion clauses,
which must be reconciled in each case.
<P>
 I will attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional
amendment rather than a federal statute and address certain specific
concerns that have been raised in the public debate.
<P>
 The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the Constitution
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination
against religious expression and against persons, groups, or organizations
in access to government benefits or protections on account of
the religious character of their speech or identity.
<P>
 We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather,
we support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.
<P>
 Several concerns and questions have been raised about this approach.
 Is this radical approach really necessary?  First, it is wise
to keep from confusing procedure with substance.  Amending the
Constitution is a radical procedure, to be sure.  Article V of
the Constitution ensures that it is not to be achieved without
effort and consensus.  Yet the substance of a restorative religious
liberty amendment need not be radical in nature.
<P>
 Legal experts and numerous interested groups have examined potential
approaches for months, and the Family Research Council remains
willing to continue to discuss specific language for such an amendment.
 We are especially eager to hear your specific ideas, Mr. Chairman,
and those of Congressman Hyde.
<P>
 In closing, this principle of neutrality is not new.  It is the
aim and result of our First Amendment's religion clauses, properly
understood.  A religious liberty amendment could restore the saving
principle so that our First Amendment would not be used to promote
the empty state religion of secularism but to promote true freedom
and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth, to which every
American is entitled.
<P>
 Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
<P>
 SENATOR HATCH:  Thank you, Ms. Cleaver.
<P>
 MS. HAMRICK:  I will be right back for some closing thoughts.
 Stay tuned.

</ul><p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight
Talk</i> from the Family Research Council.  We're thrilled to have
made it through our first show last week, and we are looking forward
to an exciting season ahead.  In our many weeks to come, <i>Straight
Talk</i> will be addressing issues that are critical to today's families,
which is really what the Family Research Council is all about.
 Working hand in hand with government policies are cultural issues
that affect those policies.
<p>
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we will be
sharing an investigation into what our society views as typical
sexual behavior, based on the studies and published works of Dr.
Alfred Kinsey, his studies known worldwide as the Kinsey report.
<p>
Within our show, we will be airing an exclusive video production
in full called <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  This video asks, and
attempts to answer, some of the questions first investigated by
Dr. Judith Reisman, who examined the Kinsey data on child sexuality.
 Dr. Reisman cites clear evidence that children were either sexually
abused by adults for scientific studies or somebody lied about
the data.
<p>
This shocking revelation strikes at the core of society's
current sex ideologies, which have solely shaped sex and health
education curriculum; and the funding came even perhaps from our
own government.
<p>
So the Family Research Council decided to get
the word out, let people know that their tax dollars are funding
programs that are based on unscientific research.  Viewer discretion
and parental guidance are therefore strongly advised in viewing
tonight's show.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from Gary Bauer, president
of the Family Research Council.  Gary is quoted weekly in the
nation's newspapers, and makers from all kinds of news programs
call him.  In fact, today you may hear him talking about Colin
Powell.  This is his opportunity to share with you what you might
not hear from journalists and broadcasters.  Join me and Gary
Bauer as we talk about the stories that lie behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
It is Tuesday morning,
and I am here with Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research
Council.  Most of political America, Gary, is watching the elections,
some pivotal ones in Kentucky and Virginia.  As we watch early
returns in what some are calling a referendum on the GOP and the
conservative pro-family movement, what do you see in this election
cycle?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  You know, Kristi, our viewers have us at a
disadvantage:  We are taping this while people vote, and our viewers
will know the outcome of the elections by the time they see us
talking about them.
<p>
But my sense is that whatever happened in
these elections around the country -- in Virginia, New Jersey,
I guess Kentucky, and Mississippi -- you can't cover up what the
overall trend in the country is.
<p>
I suspect conservatives are going
to do well and that our viewers already know that.  But even if
they don't, the fact of the matter is the trend line around the
country is unbelievably in a conservative direction.  And even
in these elections, the Democrats running around the country were
running as conservatives.  They were trying to act like they were
fiscal conservatives, economic conservatives.  They were not talking
about social issues because they know those issues are hurting
them.
<p>
So the untold story is that the Democratic Party and liberalism
around the country is demoralized.  You've got people switching
parties.  I think we'll have three more House members switch before
the end of the year.  State legislatures that have never been
Republican have gone into Republican control in the last few months
as special elections have been held.
<p>
So there is a strong conservative
tide running in the country.  I hope it continued today, but even
if there were some bumps in the road, I think that tide is going
to run for a while.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Some of the different interest
groups have said that an anti-American sentiment has been moving
away from being in favor of any referendum, tax increases of any
kinds.  Do you agree with that?  Because certainly there are all
kinds of tax-increasing referenda on the ballots.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Yes.  I think people will vote for referenda when the issue is
the right issue.  The critics are right about taxes, however.
 Just about anyplace in the country that there is a tax bond measure
or referendum on the ballot, people are saying no.
<p>
I mean, here in Northern Virginia, which is, of course, peculiar to this 
one area, but it really is very similar to a lot of places in the
rest of the country.  You've got state taxes, local taxes.  The
federal tax rate went up in the beginning of the Clinton Administration.
 There is a particular gross receipts tax in Northern Virginia
that has driven a lot of small businesses literally out of business.
<p>
Americans remain deeply overtaxed, and I hope that's an issue
that the Republican Party will continue to emphasize and run with
in 1996, because I think it brings millions of voters to the banner.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When it comes to fear tactics in Washington right
now, some of the worst language is reserved for Medicare and the
Medicare vote.  Gary, you have been watching this for a while.
 Why do you think the Medicare debate needs to go forward? 
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, we believe that that program, which is a valuable
program to many elderly, has to be reformed, and it has to be
reformed to save it.  If you take the current trends in place
and let those trends continue another 20, 25 years, what you have
is a Medicare program that literally would be consuming almost
all of the revenue of the Federal Government.
<p>
Well, obviously,
we can't have that.  That's not going to work.  So we've got to
come up with a way to get costs under control, to save the program
for people like my 75-year-old mother who relies on it and many
of the other elderly who have come to rely on it.
<p>
I think it has
been disgusting to see some of the politicians use scare rhetoric
and harsh rhetoric to try to bamboozle, quite frankly, senior
citizens into thinking that their benefits are going to be taken
away and that they're going to be left without medical care. 
That's a disgusting thing to do to elderly people who already
worry about the future, and I think the politicians who engaged
in that are going to suffer for it at the polls next year. 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the most historic things in this last week has
been the partial-birth abortion ban vote in the House and, we
think, this week in the Senate.  What do you think, Gary, has
brought us to the point where we can see this kind of historic
pro-life vote?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  The problem on the abortion issue has
always been getting facts to the American people.  If you get
them facts, then the votes tend to come out pro-life.  We saw
that in the House of Representatives.  When the Congress had to
actually focus on the facts of what a partial-birth abortion is,
most of them were so horrified by the procedure that they voted
to ban it.
<p>
I think the final vote, at least the vote in favor
of the ban, was 288 votes.  That's a bigger consensus than a lot
of the economic agenda that the Republicans are pushing.  So I
think it was a very historic vote and probably the beginning of
a number of votes in the Congress that will, I think, educate
the American people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for
being with us, and we'll look forward to talking to you next week.
 Good night.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you.  Good to be with you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>
returns, we will speak to Bob Knight, who wrote, produced, directed,
and edited the 1994 documentary, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  Bob
will explain the importance of uncovering Dr. Alfred Kinsey's
unorthodox and unscientific study of child sexuality.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>.  Tonight we are talking to Bob
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies at the Family Research Council.
 Bob daily examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and
are affected by cultural values.  He will be introducing one of
his most recent and possibly one of the most shocking issues he
has encountered.
<p>
Bob, welcome to <i>Straight Talk</i>.  Appreciate you
being here.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for having me, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You were a journalist at the Los Angeles Times, got involved
at the Heritage Foundation on cultural issues.  You have a long
history of looking at the things that really have changed America.
<p>
What drew your attention to this particular topic?  Family Research
Council hasn't done any other videos.  You're the first.  What
caught your eye?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it really began about five
years ago when I was doing research on federal funding for all
sorts of cultural projects, and I kept running into Kinsey, the
name Kinsey, the references to Kinsey.
<p>
I talked to a number of
people, including Dr. Judith Reisman, who had been investigating
Kinsey since 1981, and she revealed in a 1990 book, Kinsey, Sex
and Fraud, that some of the very basis for what we now regard
as gospel in sex education and sexology came out of experiments
on children in the 1940s under the rubric of science; and she
made the charge that it's either fraud or criminal exploitation
of children, but either way, we shouldn't be basing our idea of
normal sexuality on it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was interested in reading
some of the literature that you had written.  I mean, in terms
of attitudes about sex that have come from Kinsey, it has been
everything from 10 percent of the population is homosexual, which
was a project that you worked on; and showing that that was not
true -- it was really 1, at most 2 percent -- but even the data
that says men mature sexually at 18 and women, at 30, that data
all comes from Kinsey as well, correct?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  It does.
 Kinsey is the motherlode of information on the sex issues.  Kinsey
formulated what he called the Kinsey scale, which is a scale from
zero to 6.  Zero is heterosexuality; 6 is homosexuality.  Notice
he puts the norm at the bottom.  And he actually said that only
4 percent of the population constitute either end of the spectrum,
and everybody else is bisexual.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's amazing.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  So he used this and, by the way, developed this before
he did 95 percent of his research -- it just came out of his head
-- and he used this to push the idea of outlet sex, which makes
all sexual acts equal morally, whether it is between husband and
wife or any other combination, in or out of marriage.
<p>
This was a moral leveling force that Hugh Hefner picked up with his 
playboy philosophy, and it became the grounding for the 
if-it-feels-good-do-it generation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, this video which we're going to
see does go into greater detail, but the thing that is compelling
-- you know, today there's a lot of stories -- oh, a priest who
molested children 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 30 years ago --
there have been stories that have come from terrible sexual acts
of the past.  But what is powerful about this is that it's not
really just the past, is it, Bob?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  No, it's the guiding
force of most sex education today.  Kinsey is the only sexual
data on children we have because, after all, it's criminal to
exploit children in this fashion.
<p>
So what the Kinsey people did
was take this data from molestation of children and extrapolate
it into a philosophy that said, &quot;Hey, kids are not only viable
sexually, but they're entitled to it.&quot;  And, if you notice,
the history of sex education is to bring sex ed, graphic materials,
to children at earlier and earlier ages, because, after all, science
says they are sexual beings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I know people have
got to be watching and saying, &quot;Are you really saying children
were molested?&quot;  And we are going to get into that in just
a little bit.
<p>
But, frankly, what has been interesting is the lack
of interest in discussing it.  Have you found that shocking as
you have tried to present this information?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  This has been a hard sell -- and, I think, for one reason:  
It strikes at the very heart of the sexual revolution, because Alfred Kinsey
is the most quoted sexologist in history.  What he said undergirds
most current if-it-feels-good philosophy.  And they sense the
danger here.  If you discredit Alfred Kinsey, a lot falls down
with him.
<p>
So we think that people instinctively who feel that
sex ought to be free and wild and there ought to be no structures
sense that this could be very bad for them if it gets out.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is one fast thing people need to know before we
unveil <i>The Children of Table 34</i>?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, I wouldn't have any children in the room.  You know, some 
of the material is shocking.  We did it as tastefully as we could, and there's
really nothing obscene or anything.  But it's shocking.  It's
hard stuff to digest, and you don't want children around.
<p>
The only other thing is that we took three years to document this
and make sure everything is absolutely accurate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There is a lot of information there to see. When <i>Straight 
Talk</i> returns, we'll take a look at what Bob has investigated and the
revelations that he has discovered as we bring to you <i>The Children
of Table 34</i>.  Again, viewer discretion and parental guidance is
strongly advised, not because of the material you will see, but
just the ideas are very powerful.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>.  Tonight's unique show includes the extraordinary documentary,
<i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  This documentary asks key questions
of Dr. Alfred Kinsey's child sexual studies.  Was consent obtained
from parents or guardians of those children who were sexually
molested in the name of science? <i>Straight Talk</i> now presents <i>The
Children of Table 34</i>.
<p>
<center><h3>The Children of Table 34</h3></center>
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  Hello.  I'm Efrem Zimbalist, Jr.  A number of
years ago, I starred in The Chapman Report, a film about the sex
studies of Dr. Alfred Kinsey.
<p>
Like most Americans, I felt at the
time that Dr. Kinsey's work was groundbreaking, and it was.  But
since then, serious questions have been raised about the Kinsey
research methods, serious enough to warrant a closer look.
<p>
What would you think if you learned that some of the most important
scientific research of the century may have been based on fraud,
or, if not fraud, criminal experimentation on children, funded
by the taxpayer?
<p>
What if you learned that the results of this
research are exerting a profound influence on our society today,
ranging from how we deal with sex offenders to how, when, and
what our children are being taught about sex, not to mention why.
<p>
Every parent in America needs to know the facts behind Alfred
Kinsey's inclusion of children in his famous sex studies in the
late 1940s.  Recent revelations about government-sponsored radiation
experiments remind us once more of the dangers of projects that
violate informed consent and the standards of common decency.
<p>
As you watch this story unfold, you will learn how America has
unknowingly put its children at risk in the name of science. 
And you may also join me in asking, What happened to Dr. Kinsey's
smallest subjects?  Where are the children of Table 34?
<p>
NARRATOR: Children, our most precious gift and our hope for the future.
 Once upon a time, children were free to roam their neighborhoods
without worry.  Parents could count on the good intentions of
neighbors, school officials, and other adults to keep their children
safe.  But in recent years, parents have had to take special measures
to ensure that their children not come to harm.  Their fears are
not unfounded.  Many children have fallen victim to sexual abuse.
<p>
How did we go from a safe, caring environment for children to
one in which parents are terrified that their children are at
risk in just a few short years?  Part of the answer may be found
in Indiana, at the world-famous Kinsey Institute.
<p>
In 1948, a zoologist
named Alfred C. Kinsey shocked the world with his pioneering study,
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>. Although many scientists were
critical of Kinsey's methods, the media popularized Kinsey's findings
about sex.
<p>
By 1981, Dr. Judith Reisman uncovered the role of child
sexual abuse in the Kinsey studies in a paper presented to the
Fifth World Congress of Sexology in Jerusalem.  She documented
Kinsey's reliance on the systematic molestation of more than 300
infants and children from 2 months old to 15 years of age.  Graph
tables depicting sexual activity in children use identical criteria
as those in the tables on adult subjects.
<p>
DR. REISMAN:  Then I went back and I took a look at the Kinsey report, 
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>, and as I reviewed the tables, 
it struck me as clear as day.  How could they get this data?  Where would they
get these data?  How did they know that a 2-month-old baby did
or did not have an orgasm?  How did they get a record of 26 orgasms
in 24 hours for a 4-year-old -- a 4-year-old?
<p>
MR. TRUEMAN:  If these experiments took place, they involved acts to which 
no child could provide consent and for which no parent or guardian could
provide consent on behalf of the child.  Therefore, we are talking
about criminal activity, the criminal sexual abuse of children.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Research scientist Gordon Muir sees broad ramifications
from Kinsey's work.  According to Dr. Muir, who helped edit and
publish Judith Reisman's and Ed Eichel's 1990 book, <i>Kinsey, Sex
and Fraud</i>:
<p>
DR. MUIR:  Children as young as 2 months of age are
featured in tables, in some cases 188 children in one table, and
the legend beneath the table says, &quot;Timed with a second hand
or stopwatch.&quot;
<p>
The understanding that we have of childhood
sexuality and normal childhood sexual development as it is believed
and taught in academia today comes from the experimental evidence
documented in Kinsey's male report published in 1948, with the
child sexuality tables that we have just discussed.  It is absolutely
astonishing that this is taken as the basis for what we understand
to be normal childhood sexual development.
<p>
When I try to explain
this to colleagues in the type of science that I am involved in
and what I call the harder sciences of biology and medicine, statistics,
immunology, they frankly do not believe what I am trying to tell
them, and the only way that I can convince them of the truth of
this is to go to the library, pull off the shelf one of Alfred
Kinsey's books, and show them what in fact is inside, and it is
quite shocking.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Based on the Kinsey data, six researchers
formulated a theory of child sexuality that has influenced everything
from laws against molestation to how and when sex education is
taught.
<p>
Few professionals would disagree that Dr. Kinsey has been
the most influential figure in the study of sex, particularly
the concept of child sexuality.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  He did not openly promote
pedophilia, but he provided the &quot;scientific&quot; basis
for it.  He felt the main problem with adult-child sexual relations
was hysteria and overreaction on the part of parents and authorities.
<p>
He believed that young boys needed the help of older people to
develop effective sexual techniques, and he recorded that adult
sexual contacts with young girls were a source of pleasure to
these girls and may lead to better sociosexual development in
their later lives.
<p>
His co-author, Wardell Pomeroy, a prominent
sexologist, has written that the Kinsey research uncovered &quot;many 
beautiful and mutually satisfying relationships between fathers
and daughters&quot;.
<p>
Pomeroy also, in his sex education book, <i>Boys and
Sex</i>, refers to the possibility of &quot;loving sexual relationships&quot;
between children and animals.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Children have been increasingly portrayed sexually in 
major pornographic magazines.
<p>
DR. REISMAN:  In our study conducted for the U.S. Justice Department,
particularly juvenile justice and delinquency prevention, we came
up with some pretty surprising findings on the images of children
in <i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i> and <i>Hustler</i>.  In particular, 
<i>Playboy</i> and <i>Penthouse</i> were surprising to us.  We were 
instructed to do the research because of the finding of these kinds of 
materials being used in sexual activities, sexual crimes, really, against
children.
<p>
Most disturbing was that 29 percent of the visuals --
that is, the photographs -- included some sort of nude or genital
display -- very, very surprising.  Twenty-one percent were visually
exposed and sexualized.  Twenty percent had some sort of genital
activity taking place of some type.  Ten percent involved force;
10 percent, killing or murder.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Before Kinsey, psychologists
had rejected the idea of children as sexually viable until the
age of puberty.  Earlier this century, Sigmund Freud paved the
way for Kinsey by asserting that children were sexual but that
their sexuality was latent; that is, not acted upon until puberty.
<p>
Kinsey's report radically altered this perception, spawning an
entire industry based on the notion that children have a right
to sexual relations at any age.  The Kinsey perception of the
&quot;right&quot; of children to have sex at any age has resulted
in challenges to laws protecting children from sexual exploitation.
<p>
MR. SHAHEEN:  In Florida recently, a state court judge threw out
several cases that had been brought under the statutory rape laws.
 Citing privacy grounds, the judge found that minors under the
age of 16 had a constitutional right to engage in sexual activity.
<p>
Several courts have recently held that parents do not have a right
to stop school districts from handing out condoms to their children.
 Again, you see in school districts, in courts, in the media,
the Kinsey philosophy that children should be free and autonomous
to decide for themselves what sort of sexual activity, what sort
of sexual behavior they should engage in, without any kind of
regulation or restriction from the state or their parents, has
begun to chip away at the protections that our legal system had
previously provided to children.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Some scientists feel that an inquiry of the Kinsey 
Institute is long overdue.
<p>
DR. MUIR: I have been in contact with perhaps the best known fraud specialist
in this country over a period of years concerning this Kinsey
research fraud allegation.  The person I am referring to, of course,
is Walter Stewart(?), who is well known in Congress and in the
scientific community for his work in the Baltimore case, particularly,
and in other cases.  Now, Stewart is firmly of the opinion that
there is something here that needs to be investigated and has
told me so many times.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Muir says that such an effort
may be mounted outside the United States and cites a letter by
Walter Stewart to the Canadian Medical Journal.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  What Stewart said was that he finds the evidence -- that is, 
for fraud and ethical violations in research -- compelling, since the evidence
comes almost entire from Kinsey's book itself.  He says, &quot;I
find it disturbing and believe it requires investigation.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  Dr. Muir says he hopes that Congress will investigate
the Kinsey Institute once it is widely known that children may
have been used in sexual experimentation.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  Because there
is a mess here that has to be cleared up in the backyard of American
science, and it would indeed be tragic if it gets cleared up from
elsewhere first.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Important questions need to be answered.
 Where are the children today?  How were they procured for the
experiments?  Did their parents know they were being used in sessions
with avowed pedophiles?  Where are the children of Table 34?
<p>
DR. COURT:  I am concerned about these people, who must now be in
their fifties, that they must have had some very difficult experiences
following these experiments, and it would be good, really, if
they could be contacted even for therapeutic purposes at this
stage.
<p>
I often wonder if they will come forward when we are speaking
in lectures or speaking on radio or whatever it may be.  I have
been waiting to hear, for some of these people to remember the
experience and to come forward and say, &quot;Yes, I was one of
those.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  Based on 12,000 interviews, empirical
observation, and Kinsey's own ideas about sexuality, the Kinsey
report, as it came to be known, had enormous cultural and scientific
impact.
<p>
MR. GAGNON:  You could use the findings from the survey
to counter the moral judgments of other people, and that's really
the importance of Kinsey.  As Kinsey moves the argument away from
the old kind of sterile debate about morality -- in which, of
course, there is no solution -- to a place where people can start
talking about sexuality in a different kind of way, looking to
different kinds of standards.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Kinsey concluded that
Americans' sex lives were far more varied than had been thought
and that children were sexual from birth.  But the Kinsey books
have serious flaws, as has been noted by the National Research
Council and Dr. Abraham Maslow, who warned Kinsey that sex surveys
tend to skew the data toward the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.
<p>
Because sexual manipulation of children is illegal, the Kinsey
studies have served as virtually the sole source for sex researchers.
 The Kinsey findings about children are based on interviews with
and records kept by pedophiles, which he described as &quot;adult
males who've had sexual contacts with younger boys and who, with
their adult backgrounds, are able to recognize and interpret the
boys' experiences.&quot;
<p>
DR. MUIR:  As a practitioner, a psychologist,
I cannot see that this is the way in which we collect information
about normal childhood sexuality.  To get pedophiles to go out
and do experiments on children is not how we learn about normality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Please stay tuned to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.  Did the Kinsey Institute people pay pedophiles
to conduct their studies?  After the commercial break, we'll ask
this and other questions as we continue with more of <i>The Children
of Table 34</i>.
<p>
[Commercial break.] 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i> is back.  As we continue to put Dr.
Alfred Kinsey's scientific sexual findings under a microscope,
the Family Research Council's 1994 documentary, which we share
with you tonight, reveals the fallacies Dr. Kinsey's study created.
 Amazingly, these fallacies shape sex and health education even
today. Now, more of <i>The Children of Table 34</i>:
<p>
NARRATOR:  Kinsey acknowledges that some of the experiments involved the 
use of physical force with unwilling participants.  Kinsey describes
what he terms &quot;orgasms&quot; by the children, &quot;. . .
a gradual and sometimes prolonged buildup to orgasm which involves
still more violent convulsions of the whole body, heavy breathing,
groaning, sobbing, or more violent cries, sometimes with an abundance
of tears (especially among young children).&quot;
<p>
&quot;Some of the children exhibited extreme trembling, collapse, loss of 
color, and sometimes fainting.  The males in the present group will fight
away from the partner and may make violent attempts to avoid climax,
although they derive definite pleasure from the situation.&quot;
<p>
&quot;A fretful babe quiets down under the initial sexual stimulation,
is distracted from other activities, begins rhythmic pelvic thrusts,
becomes tense as climax approaches, is thrown into convulsive
action, often with violent arm and leg movements, sometimes with
weeping at the moment of climax.&quot;
<p>
According to Paul Gebhart(?),
a Kinsey report coauthor and former president of the Kinsey Institute,
the researchers were aware that the experiments were illegal.
 &quot;We have always insisted on maintaining confidentiality,
even at the cost of thereby becoming amoral at best and criminal
at worst,&quot; said Gebhart.  &quot;An example of criminality
is our refusal to cooperate with authorities in apprehending a
pedophile we had interviewed who was being sought for a sex murder.&quot;
<p>
DR. POMEROY:  Kinsey would have done business with the devil if
it helped the research, and this is true.  The research was absolutely
paramount.  And he was astute enough to stay out of trouble. 
He got in practically no trouble, but he worked at it.
<p>
DR. MUIR: Related to that, of course, is the question, did parents give
consent to what was being done?  Nobody has indicated to us that
consent was given.  Indeed, these coworkers seemed to indicate
to us that consent was not given, and they didn't really see it
as terribly important, because this wasn't going to be particularly
harmful to the children, anyway.
<p>
NARRATOR:  There is another possibility
regarding Kinsey's data on children:  that the experiments never
took place.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  We have the other serious implication that
the data are being used as if they were real in order to generate
a whole view of child sexuality and availability of children in
sexual encounters which is based on nothing.
<p>
NARRATOR:  If that is so, then scientific fraud may have occurred.  
In either case, the reliance on reports on sexual torture of children under 
the auspices of federally supported research cries out for examination,
especially since Kinsey's research had such a profound effect
on the entire sex research field.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  I went back to
get a degree and went into the human sexuality program at New
York University, and it was when I was in that program that I
began to learn and see the indoctrination of what has been called
the Kinsey grand scheme.
<p>
Now, that term comes from Wardell Pomeroy,
Kinsey's closest associate, but I experienced it firsthand in
an international health seminar held in Holland, organized by
my professor, Dr. Deryck Calderwood.
<p>
Calderwood initiated nude-body
workshops in which he would give quasi-medical excuses for men
to touch each other's genitals and for women to interact in different
feely-touchy situations.
<p>
NARRATOR:  The Kinsey Institute has dominated
the world of sexology through the migration of Kinsey disciples
to several key centers of sexology, including New York University,
the University of Pennsylvania, and the Institute for Advanced
Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco.  These three institutions
account for the lion's share of the academic credentialing of
sex educators in the United States.
<p>
Working with the Kinsey team
was Dr. Mary Calderone, who was medical director of the Planned
Parenthood Federation of America from 1953 to 1964, before co-founding
the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States,
better known as SIECUS.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  She formed that organization
with Lester Kirkendall, another pioneering sexologist, who was
the teacher and the mentor of Deryck Calderwood, my professor.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Also involved was Kinsey's co-author, Wardell Pomeroy,
a founding member who also served as president of SIECUS as recently
as 1975.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  In terms of Lester Kirkendall, in 1985,
he made a statement in an article entitled &quot;Sex Education
in the Future&quot; that I think is worth noting.
<p>He says that
programs of the future will probe sexual expression with same-sex
partners and even across generational lines.  &quot;With a diminished
sense of guilt, these patterns will become legitimate, and the
emphasis on normality and abnormality will be much diminished
with these future trends.&quot;
<p>
NARRATOR:  The most obvious impact
of this effort is to demystify the taboos of sexuality in sex
education classes to very young children.  Many sex education
curricula now begin in kindergarten and continue through high
school, often under AIDS prevention.  The message to parents:
 If we don't begin teaching children about safe sex as early as
possible, including every variation, then they may get AIDS.
DR. REISMAN:  Mrs. Smith or Ms. Smith from somewhere in Ohio, who
goes for her three-unit training in human sexuality because she
has to teach human sexuality to the kids and she has to teach
AIDS prevention, she goes to an accredited sex educator, and she
will be trained in the Kinsey model.  That is the only model that
she can be trained in.
<p>
And as a result, then, she has to set aside
whatever value structure, whatever moral structure she has been
carrying all these years, because she has been told that the &quot;science&quot;
has proven that children are sexual from birth, that children
have orgasmic potential from birth, that this therefore can be
perfectly fine.
<p>
[From a Nickelodeon special]:
<p>
CHILD:  How can you be protected from AIDS, like when you're having sex? 
<p>
TEACHER:  Well, one of the best ways, Magic, is wear a condom,
isn't it?
<p>
MR. JOHNSON:  Yes.  The safest way is to wear a condom.
<p>
NARRATOR:  As a result, some schools, and even a documentary
presented by Nickelodeon, are instructing children as young as
8 years old in how to use a condom:
<p>
TEACHER:  You roll it
down the penis, and that protects the man when his penis is inside
the woman's vagina.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Children are also told how to perform
anal sex.  At a safe sex youth conference in New York in 1994,
children as young as 12 were given graphic brochures advising
boys to enjoy safe sex with men and encouraging girls to experiment
with lesbian sex practices that could cause sterility.
<p>
MR. EICHEL: Nowhere in the program curriculum that was developed to be the
guidelines for future sex education was there anything that suggested
sick sexual behavior, any form of sexual activity that might
be categorized, or abnormality.
<p>
NARRATOR:  The Kinsey view of
child sexuality has also been promulgated by Dr. John Money, perhaps
the most prominent sex researcher in America.  A founding board
member of SIECUS, Dr. Money has written numerous books, as well
as hundreds of papers, reviews, and textbook chapters on the subject
of sex.
<p>
In 1990, Dr. June Reinisch dedicated her book, <i>The Kinsey
Institute New Report on Sex</i>, to Dr. Money, whom she describes
as &quot;one of my mentors.&quot;
<p>
Recently, Dr. Money was interviewed
by Piedika(?), the journal of pedophilia, which is published in
The Netherlands.  The journal argues for man-boy sex and contains
advertisements for the North American Man-Boy Love Association
and other pro-pedophile groups.
<p>
Kinsey Institute associate Dr.
Vern Bulow(?) is on Piedika's editorial board, which issued this
statement of purpose:  &quot;The starting point of Piedika is
necessarily our consciousness of ourselves as pedophiles.&quot;
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  But when you look at the journal Piedika, the Dutch
journal, you will see that on the board of directors you have
people like Vern Bulow.  Vern Bulow was the president of the Society
for the Scientific Study of Sex when they formed the accrediting
committee for future university programs that give degrees to
sex educators.
<p>
Vern Bulow did the foreword for Edward Brongursma's(?)
two volumes, <i>Loving Boys</i>.  John Money of Johns Hopkins Hospital
and the mentor of June Reinisch was interviewed in Piedika, and
of course, he is one of the people saying that sex with children
can be an enriching experience and doesn't harm the child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you the 
conclusion of <i>The Children of Table 34</i> and more insights from the 
documentary's producer, Robert Knight.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> now
brings you the conclusion of our 1994 documentary, which reveals
shocking findings about Dr. Alfred Kinsey's children of Table
34.  And immediately following, we will once again speak with
Robert Knight, producer of this chilling video.  Please watch.
<p>
NARRATOR:  In Dr. Money's interview in Piedeka, he was asked about
child sexuality.  His reply:  &quot;If I were to see the case
of a boy aged ten or twelve who is intensely attracted toward
a man in his twenties or thirties, if the relationship is totally
mutual and the bonding is genuinely totally mutual, then I would
not call it pathological in any way.&quot;
<p>
This attitude mirrors
that of Dr. Kinsey, who once wrote that, &quot;It is difficult
to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning,
should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched.&quot;
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  In 1965, the Kinsey team published the book, <i>Sex 
Offenders</i>, which argued that sexual behavior was so varied that 
certain activities should not be singled out for harsh punishment.
<p>
During the past 10 years, reports of child abuse cases have soared to more 
than 2.5 million annually.  Although many of these cases have proved
to be false reports, it is clear that child abuse, and the perception
of child abuse, is a growing problem.  Increasingly, child abuse
experts are expressing concern about Kinsey's impact on the way
people view sexuality.
<p>
MR. EICHEL:  One of the objectives of Kinsey-type
programming is to change the concept of the family, and if you
think about it, if Heather has two mommies and Daddy has a male
roommate, in a way, you are denormalizing the heterosexual nuclear
family.  And if you remember from the pedophile-type statements
in the writings, for example, of Theo Sanford, he said that if
children could be weaned away from the nuclear family, they could
then form emotional attachments with others beyond the family.
<p>
So, in a sense, the systematic destruction of the concept of a
family with a mother and father, and with the family break-ups
and divorces that are occurring, it is a very opportune time.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Attempts to uncover evidence regarding the experiments
on children have been rebuffed by the Kinsey Institute.  Former
director Dr. June Reinisch, interim director Dr. Stephanie Sanders,
and other Kinsey personnel either declined or did not respond
to interview requests.  Dr. Money also declined to be interviewed.
<p>
<i>Child</i> magazine featured an article by Dr. Reinisch urging parents
to regard their children as sexually active and to promote more
sexual activity.
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  Given its critical role in overhauling
a culture that used to value and protect children above all else,
the Kinsey report is long overdue for scientific scrutiny.
<p>
DR. MUIR:  He used data from the rape of children, as we've discussed,
some as young as 2 months, to demonstrate and prove childhood
sexual capacity.  He concealed the full nature of these experiments,
and he concealed information on who performed these experiments.
<p>
He extrapolated these data to describe normal childhood development.
 He did not follow up these abused children, as was ethically
and morally required, though the identities of many of these children
are known and known today, and they still could be followed up,
and should be.
<p>
Furthermore, he shielded criminals who were involved
in this work, including one murderer that we know of, from the
police.
<p>
If I have not said enough about the need for this research
to be investigated, then I doubt if there is really anything else
that could be said.
<p>
MR. ZIMBALIST:  These questions need to be
answered:  How were the children procured for the experiments
recorded in Table 34?  Where are they now?  Most would be in their
fifties.
<p>
Also, many of the Kinsey associates themselves are still
around, but most of them are elderly.  It is important that they
be given the opportunity to shed light on what happened before
it's too late, before any more children are victimized.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back. Bob, you produced this video.  You've been 
working on this project for years.  As a matter of fact, you were talking
about it the day that I met you, about four years ago, three or
four years ago.  It's a very powerful video.
<p>
But what does the Kinsey Institute say when they're asked about this 
horrendous research?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  I am glad you asked that, because they
have finally broken their silence on it.  Dr. John Bancroft, the
new director of Kinsey Institute, has said that he looked into
the files -- which means they exist -- and he said that he thought
all the children had been molested by a single person, an elderly
pedophile, and that conflicts with what Dr. Kinsey wrote in the
Kinsey report.  So it has opened up a whole new realm of questioning.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And in fact, I understand that recently a woman
came forward and said that she was one of the molestation victims.
<p>
Family Research Council is looking for victims.  What are you
finding on that?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Well, we're hoping some people will
come forward because, actually, we want the identity of this so-called
lone pedophile, because if we nail that down, people will begin
to realize what may have happened to them so many years ago at
the Kinsey Institute.
<p>
This woman's story has checked out.  It
has an Indiana University tie, and we are hoping she's the first
of many who will come forward.  And, incidentally, her story probably
was research that was included in Kinsey's female volume, which
followed the male volume.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of
time left, Bob, but the story doesn't end here, and I am sure
<i>Straight Talk</i> is going to bring updates.
<p>
But we are looking at
congressional action related to <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.  In
fact, you may even be testifying, Bob.  Briefly, in about 20 seconds,
what can Congress do, and what is happening right now in terms
of looking into this data?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Okay.  Right now before
Congress is the Family Privacy Protection Act, which bars any
federal funding for research into using children for which parents
have not given written consent.  We're testifying to say this
is a good idea; you've got to have written consent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Really quickly.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Okay, and we hope Congress will
absolutely open the doors of the Kinsey Institute, using subpoena
power, holding hearings, whatever it takes to shed light on this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to look forward to that.  <i>Straight Talk</i>
continues after the break.  Stay tuned to hear how you can obtain
a copy of the video, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>, and information
about other important issues being investigated by the Family
Research Council and Robert Knight.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for watching <i>Straight Talk</i> and the Family 
Research Council exclusive video production, <i>The Children of Table 34</i>.
 If you want more information, the video or some information,
please call the Family Research Council at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Hope you can join us next week when we'll be talking to people who
are successfully paving the way for the country's welfare reform,
and we'll share with you how you, too, can get involved.
<p>
Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Our show this week will 
try to answer some hard questions. What happens to people if the 
government isn't the safety net we've come to expect?  What kind 
of help can the private sector really be?
<p>
The concept of real welfare reform can seem overwhelming. The 
government for many years has said that it can best care for people 
caught in tough circumstances.  But the problem with the welfare 
state is that it's people, not statistics, we're talking about. 
The state doesn't have time or manpower enough for one-on-one attention. 
When lives really change, something personal happens. It is 
individuals who actually reform the welfare state, one person at a 
time, one life at a time.
<p>
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> portrays examples of individuals like 
you and me who are making that reform a reality.  But first, let's take 
a look at the story on the minds of most of political Washington, 
yesterday's government shutdown in the name of a balanced budget.
<p>
I had the chance to speak with Family Research Council's Bill Mattox, 
who has been working on budget and tax policy in Washington, D.C., 
for more than 10 years. You won't find Bill's insights as to how this 
situation will affect our country and families in most news stories. 
Join me in questioning Bill on what lies behind the headlines.
<p>

<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are here with Bill Mattox, Vice President for Policy 
of the Family Research Council, and, Bill, as you and I know, the train 
has wrecked. It doesn't seem like Washington, D.C., is stopped, and yet 
a lot of people, interestingly enough, are saying that the train
wreck isn't about Medicare; it's not about whether or not we have
one tax proposal or another.
<p>
<i>The Washington Post</i> and Republican leadership are agreeing that 
the real issue here seems to be balancing the budget long term, over a 
seven-year period.  What do you think the train wreck says to pro-family 
America?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I think it is primarily about whether or not the President 
and Congress agree on getting a balanced budget in the next seven years. 
The Congress has repeatedly moved toward that target and has said,
&quot;We believe strongly in a balanced budget, and here's proof
in the pudding.  Here's our proposal, here's our plan; we want
to see this adopted.&quot;
<p>
The President, in recent months, has given some good lip service to this 
idea. He has not been a long-time supporter of a balanced budget, but 
here in recent months he has said some nice things.
<p>
Unfortunately, when putting-up time comes, you cannot get to a balanced 
budget unless you are willing to make some very hard decisions.  And what 
the President is suggesting is that some of the hard decisions that 
Congress has made in the Medicare realm, for example, where they are not 
allowing the kinds of increases that would otherwise occur, that are going 
to lead the Medicare program to bankruptcy, what the President is suggesting
is that those kinds of hard decisions he doesn't want to see made
and would rather not have a balanced budget if that is what is
required.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And isn't that ironic, because he campaigned
on a balanced budget, as the freshman class campaigned on, and
it seems now that whether or not we have a balanced budget is
the true sticking point.  Is that going to hold?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I think it will be <b>the</b> central question.  The big issue 
will be, how quickly will this whole matter be resolved?  I mean, I do
think we are going to see some type of stopgap measure adopted
here before too long that will get those nonessential government
services running again.  It is always kind of curious that these
programs are nonessential, and it leads me to say, Well, if they're
nonessential, why do we even have them in the first place?  I
mean, I do think we are going to see some type of stopgap measure
that will keep the government running.
<p>
The question will be, will we adopt a new budget for the new fiscal year, 
or will we instead continue to operate this year on last year's spending 
levels? Because that is essentially what is being done right now, is
that they are simply saying, We'll keep the government running
at last year's levels until we can settle this issue.
<p>
There are some advisors to the President, including James Carville(?), 
who, of course, was renowned for his insistence that &quot;It's the
economy, Stupid,&quot; in the 1992 campaign.  Carville has suggested
to Clinton, &quot;Look, don't resolve this problem.  Take this
to the voters next November and let the election of 1996 center
around the question of do you want to balance the budget on the
backs of the senior citizens,&quot; or whatever sort of spin that
Carville and company would like to put to it.
<p>
Of course, the big concern that we have is that this is irresponsible. 
This is just irresponsible on the part of those who have been elected
to govern this country, and we do not want to see an interminable
playing of politics by those in the White House or, for that matter,
those in the Congress.
<p>
We do want to see those pro-family tax cuts that, here again, both the 
President campaigned on in 1992 and the Congress did in 1994 after no 
action had been taken during the President's first two years in office. 
And one of the things that is threatened in this package is those pro-family 
tax cuts. If some type of resolution isn't made here, we could see those
tax cuts disappear, and I think that would be a tragedy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But the Family Research Council has been working on tax 
relief since the early 1980s, and ironically, the per-child tax credit,
which is about $2,500, if it had kept pace with inflation, would
be about $9,500 today, and we are talking about $500, which is
incredibly ironic.  Do you think the $500-per-child tax credit
will survive?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  We hope so.  The House and Senate leaders
met yesterday to finalize their tax plan.  The details actually
have not been released quite yet, but the early indications are
that the $500 credit has survived, that it will be the central
part of this tax package; that in fact in the first year, in 1996,
come October of next year, right before the elections occur, interestingly,
taxpayers will each receive a $125 check per child, and that in
the year following, the calendar year beginning then in 1997,
the $500-per-child credit would kick in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: From your experience -- you do a lot of original polling 
for the Family Research Council, and next week, in fact, we are going 
to hear about what you are looking at for a family issues survey of 1995
-- but from your experience on the tax issue, how do you think
average Americans, pro-family Americans, are going to respond
to this kind of cat-and-mouse game we are playing?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, there are a lot of legislators who like to pose 
these two things against each other and say, well, you can either 
balance the budget or you can cut taxes.  But, surely, if you are 
going to be cutting taxes, you could be taking that money that you 
would have raised and putting it toward deficit reduction and making
it easier to balance the budget. 
<p>
These are not, however, mutually exclusive goals, and we have said from 
the outset, &quot;Look, we believe just like the American people&quot; 
-- and you're right; the polling data is ample there to show that the 
American people strongly want a balanced budget; they do want the fiscal 
house of this government brought into order.
<p>
Look, give us less government. Give us smaller government.  Cut our 
taxes. You can cut taxes and balance the budget at the same time.  That, 
I think, is something that this town really needs to hear, because quite 
often, as you say, a lot of cat-and-mouse games are played to suggest 
that you really cannot cut the taxes and balance the budget.  It isn't
so.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bill, thank you very much for being with us,
and we look forward to seeing the poll next week.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Very good.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  After this commercial, we will be joined
by Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson, Family Research Council
analysts who devote their time to researching and developing alternatives
to America's current welfare system.  Stay tuned for this and
the chance to meet those who are making practical changes in that
system.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing welfare reform and the practical 
ways that individuals can step into the gap when the government frees 
itself from the welfare business.
<p>
Here with me now are Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson of the 
Family Research Council.  Both work diligently to investigate what 
changes need to be made within our government and our society to 
make welfare reform a reality.
<p>
Welcome, both of you.  I get to see a lot of you, and frankly, you 
guys have been involved in a big fight in the last year.
<p>
Jennifer, can government do anything right?  I mean, the secret to 
welfare reform seems to be getting the government out of welfare.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, I do agree that we need to revert from a 
government-driven system to one that is driven more by the private 
sector, by individual citizens and local communities.
<p>
In answer to your question, yes, the government can distribute some 
material assistance.  It doesn't do so efficiently.  But frankly, our 
concern is not particularly about inefficiency or about excess costs. 
Our worry is that government cannot offer material assistance and 
self-respect and human dignity at the same time.
<p>
You do rob people of something very precious. We need to allow them to 
work out problems on their own, to fend for themselves.  And you do 
damage to the human spirit when you suggest that they are not able to 
live by the same rules that the rest of us live by.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Deanna, you, interestingly enough, were a social 
worker.
<p>
MS. CARLSON: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What was government able to do?  What were you able to do?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  Well, working for a government agency is limiting. 
There are some things I could do for my clients.  I could set
up resources for them to meet their physical needs as well as
counsel them for their emotional needs.  But there comes a time
when people are in crisis situations where I felt like I had my
hands tied, and I couldn't give things to meet their deepest needs.
 Specifically, I am talking about their spiritual needs.
<p>
I remember one client I had who was severely handicapped.  She was 
three years old, and she required suctioning every 15 minutes so she
could breathe.
<p>
I went in and met with her mother a number of times,
and at one point I just realized that there was something more
I needed to do.  And so, on my own time, the best thing I did
for that family was to sit down with them one evening and to meet
with the daughters and the mother and to pray.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Not the kind of thing that you're going to get too often 
from a government service.
<p>
In your work at the Family Research Council, 
Jennifer, what would you like to see the private sector do?  Is it 
offering prayer support?  Can it offer food support?  How do you think
welfare can really be reformed?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  I think the key is to match individuals one on one so 
that we can build a personal relationship.  I am very interested in 
encouraging church members, in particular, to work one on one with 
children at risk.
<p>I think that religious activists are precisely the 
kinds of people who have the initiative and the energy and the idealism 
that will be required to do this job, because it is a big job.  But 
building relationships is the key.
<p>
We already have a very good precedent with crisis pregnancy centers. There 
are many of our constituents who are already doing this kind of work.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is probably hard for people to believe, watching, saying, 
yes, it would be great if government would be more personal.  It would be 
great if we could build key relationships.  But how do you accomplish
a shift from a government-based care system to a private-based
care system?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, I think, first, we need to look
at reducing the size of the population in need, and one of the
ways we do that is by an illegitimacy-based approach to welfare
reform.  We know that children born out of wedlock are much more
likely to live in welfare dependency, to depend on the government
for assistance, so that instead of just putting mothers back to
work, we should be finding ways to reduce the number of children
who are born to single mothers and absent fathers.
<p>
It is true that the government will always have a dampening effect on 
the kinds of private-sector remedies that are available, and so it
will be necessary to start scaling back government benefits, because
they crowd out civil society; they crowd out the traditional arrangements,
like families and churches.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think here in Washington,
D.C, I know I walk by -- I am a public transportation user --
walk by homeless people and see a lot of heartache every day.
 We know that there is mental illness, we know there is drug abuse
and chronic alcoholism.
<p>
Deanne, I am wondering, is there not a
certain number of people who really need help, who are not capable
of some of the self-help things that could be offered?
<p>
MS. CARLSON: Yes, there are people who are dependent through nothing 
that they have done, who are born in a state of dependency.
<p>
I think what we want to do is encourage individuals to decide what they
can help with.  Some people are professionals.  They are skilled
to deal with very severe situations.  But for those of us who
don't have that type of education, we each have something that
we can give to someone.
<p>
If we see a homeless person on the street
and we have not worked for a homeless shelter, we can still give
that person respect, and that starts with smiling and with saying
hi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  But for the people who are going to need a little
more than that -- because I think you are right -- you know, I
interviewed some people at a shelter not too long ago, and they
said the worst thing about living on the street is that no one
looks at you, and that was very powerful, to see these people
saying, We wanted just to be noticed.
<p>
But how does a government-private
sector world work, do you think?  Family Research Council is getting
ready for a welfare symposium December 13, Jennifer, that you
have been putting together that is going to look at private sector
initiative.  What is the key to private sector initiatives?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, Kristi, you love individuals one at a time; you
don't love collectivities.  And this is one of the reasons why
we are talking about person to person, one heart at a time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic!  And of some of the solutions that you have
seen, what strikes you as being some of the best and most powerful?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  There's a church in Mississippi that was challenged
by the governor to meet the needs in their neighborhood, and they
identified the resources that they had within their church.  They
also identified the needs of their community, and they matched
people in need with people who could provide assistance.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That kind of matching is going to be key, and we are 
looking at the building of civic virtues.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will meet a former welfare 
recipient and find out how she, through determination and the support 
of an individual willing to help, overcame her welfare plight.  Please 
stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
NARRATOR:  When thinking of welfare recipients, what image
comes to mind?  Many identify welfare with nameless, faceless
statistics -- those who are beyond help, those who do not want
help.
<p>
But our current system has failed to bring the help that
lifts people from their sometimes shattering situations.  One
major flaw:  the system seems to have failed to incorporate the
key to achieving success -- personal relationships, a one-on-one
accountability.  That is how Lisa Biondo changed her circumstances,
stepped out of those statistics.
<p>
A former welfare recipient, Lisa now supports herself and her 
16-month-old son, Dillon. Combined with her own determination was the 
friendship of Megan McMullen. With her help and inspiration, Lisa began 
to achieve the success that marks her life today.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tonight we are discussing
welfare reform and introducing you to individuals who diligently
are making a change in the current system.  Two of those people,
whom you just met in our video piece, are Lisa Biondo and Megan
McMullen.  With Megan's support, Lisa, a former welfare recipient
and single mother, has successfully overcome a difficult situation.
 I don't want to tell too much of the story.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Thanks for having me here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks so much for coming.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What was it like for you?
 Maybe you could tell a little bit.  You were pregnant.  What
did you feel?  What were you thinking at the time?  What was your
family situation like?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  When I found out I was pregnant,
I was very scared, and I turned to my mother and my father, which
they were very unsupportive of me, so I sought help through friends.
<p>
When I was seven months pregnant, I came to the Northwest Center,
and I was receiving AFDC at the time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How did you hear about the center?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Actually, I was staying at another maternity home similar 
to the Northwest Center. It was designed for a younger group, and I 
wanted to get out, so I researched some places and I came up with 
the Northwest Center and went to interview with them, and then I was 
accepted, and I had another interview with the actual house mother.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It had to be a very traumatic time for you.  What did you 
think your future would be like?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  I had no idea.  It was very scary
when you are responsible for another life, and I didn't have my
high school diploma at the time, so I had to get my GED, and I
received that after I had the baby, and I am very confident now
that I can make it in life without the support from welfare and
things like that.  I have an excellent job, and I have great friends
who have been there for me for everything.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's what I hear.  You met Megan, and was that a turning 
point for you?  How would you describe meeting Megan that day?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: Well, when I met Megan, I was not very open to talking to 
people. I didn't share too much information on myself.  And then as I
stayed there at the maternity home, we were in conversation, and
I just mentioned that I didn't have a birth coach, and so Megan
basically said she would be my birth coach, and it was just a
great experience, you know, having -- she was like a sister to
me -- [inaudible] brothers and sisters -- so this is great having
her support.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You do that for a living, Megan? Are you a volunteer?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  Yes.  I am a director of a crisis pregnancy center, and at 
the time I was not the director, when Lisa came to the Northwest Center; I 
was the program director.
<p>
She started coming to the pregnancy center because she wanted
to learn more about the pregnancy and about what delivery was
going to be like, and I guess we entered into a number of conversations
about that, and at one point she mentioned that she didn't have
anyone to go with her to the hospital that night, and she was
very nervous about it.
<p>
I just said at the time, &quot;Oh.  Well, I'll go with you.  Sure, no 
problem.&quot;
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  She didn't know what she was getting into.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You hadn't done that before?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  No, I had never done it before.  I
was very interested, and so Lisa and I started going to all of
her prenatal care appointments together and then to birthing classes,
and then we -- Dillon was expected -- what day was he expected
on?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  He was expected July 8, but he didn't arrive
until July 21.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  We were waiting for a while.  But
that night, I guess, to tell the story, we were at a party at
the Northwest Center, and Lisa kept going, &quot;You know, I'm
getting the funniest feeling.  Something is going on.&quot;  And
everyone is going, &quot;Yeah, Lisa, that's all right.&quot; 
And she said, &quot;No, really, like something strange.&quot;
 Then we started timing them.  They were about five minutes apart.
 It was amazing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So, tell me, how has this changed
your life?  You have now left welfare.  Was this a decision that
you guys talked about?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, basically, I had it
set in my mind, even from when I began receiving AFDC, I just
knew it was a sick cycle.  You get trapped in it, and I didn't
want to get trapped.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Had you seen friends or family or people around you 
getting trapped?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, I know a few people that have - you know, it is just 
the way -- they give you a certain amount of money to live on, but yet if 
you get a job, you make more than what you would normally get on a
check, and you would be ineligible, and so they basically, they
say, &quot;Well, here's your medical assistance, here's your food
stamps, here's this money,&quot; and it is very comfortable for
them to stay on it without having to go out and work.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And you didn't want to get stuck?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: No, I didn't want to -- I come from a middle upper-class 
family, and I was very embarrassed and ashamed to be on welfare.  But 
it was something that -- I used it as a stepping stone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And for you, Megan, do you see in your work a lot of people 
trying to struggle to get off?  I mean, you see a lot of people coming in, 
and the temptation must be to stay on welfare.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: Certainly. I think that quite oftentimes women are concerned 
about medical benefits, even, talking about a lot of minimum-wage jobs, you
are not getting medical benefits in order for their children and
things like that, that they feel trapped.  I think oftentimes
we are talking about young women that have second- and third-generation
welfare families, where it is everything that they have ever known.
 No one has ever talked to them about actually finishing high
school, actually going to college, working, doing things like
that.
<p>
I am seeing young women who are having their first baby
at 15, and that is not uncommon nowadays, to have four children
by 19.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you tell them?  You know, you have
some experience now to talk from, and you obviously work with
that every day.  What do you tell them when they come in?  What
can you say to someone in that situation?
<p>
MS. BIONDO: Well, basically, I have been through this so I know how they 
feel, and I have reached out and I have tried to help in my own way that I 
can.  I don't have much to give, but I try to give what I can.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You in fact invited a young woman to come and live with you.
<p>
MS. BIONDO: I did.  She was calling to the center, and I spoke
with her on the phone, and she finally came into the center, and
she didn't have anywhere to go.  Something inside of me just said,
Well, she can come home with me.  I have a very small apartment,
you know, but I wanted to provide for her.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  I gave her clothes, and she has a beautiful daughter
now, and she has everything, but I felt the need to help someone,
because I needed someone to help me.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sort of one on one.
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  And Megan was there for me, so it is like
a cycle, you know, keep it going.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of what you are seeing in your work, Megan, is 
that what is making the difference, one person helping one person 
helping one person?
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  I think, absolutely, the idea that someone who
is there at 12 o'clock at night when you call on the phone and
you're upset about something.  That makes the difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  I think to know that there is someone
out there who truly cares, who is starting to talk about the future,
to go, &quot;Well, what are your plans?  Where do you want to
be a year or two from now, and what are the plans and the steps
that you can take to be there?&quot;
<p>
I think specifically with Lisa, the big step was originally to get her 
GED and then to get some work experience and then to get a job of her own, 
which she has now, which is fantastic --
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Excellent.  An excellent --
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  -- affording her -- she has health benefits,
she has an apartment for herself, and she can afford to pay for
excellent day care for Dillon, which is, I think, two years ago,
when you were talking about it two years ago, you wouldn't have
thought that that was possible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, the Northwest Center is very well known in Washington 
for doing some wonderful work.  Everyone I know raves about it.  How could 
people get involved? Is there anything that you would advise someone in 
terms of how to be a real helping hand?
<p>
MS. BIONDO:  Well, basically, if you know someone that has reached out 
to you and expressed that they do have a problem, I would say do what you 
think that you can do to help them.  You know, there's lots of ways.  You 
can volunteer at the center.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN:  Lots of practical ways.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have very little time left.  I would love you to give the
phone number of the center before we go.
<p>
MS. McMULLEN: It is 202-483-7008.  We are located in Washington, and we 
are open to taking anyone who would like to come and help us with anything.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I have heard wonderful things.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Following this commercial break, we will be back and joined 
by Hannah Hawkins, a woman who took it upon herself to make a difference in 
her community. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Anacostia. Southeast Washington, D.C.  A neighborhood 
recently labeled, &quot;The shattered heart of the murder capital.&quot;
<p>
In this neighborhood of what seems to be made of broken dreams and hopelessness 
lives Hannah Hawkins.  She is making a difference.
<p>
VOLUNTEER: Did you get a cup?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  God put us here for a reason, and that
is to serve and not to be served, and in saying that, He never
wants us to look down on a man unless we're picking him up.
<p>
[Children playing games.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And those who volunteer with Hannah
are also making a difference.
<p>
VOLUNTEER:  That's the sounds he makes when he's mad.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Hold up nine fingers.  Now take away four.  Now, how many 
have you got left?
<p>
CHILD: Five.
<p>
VOLUNTEER:  It comes with volunteering:  giving it back.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Number one, I feel that you need, everybody needs to volunteer
in some organization, and the cost of real love -- and that's
our motto -- is no charge.
<p>
NARRATOR:  Hannah is beginning reform at the beginning, with children.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Because you're going to either deal with them here to you're 
going to be dealing with them somewhere later.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is easy to see why Hannah Hawkins has created a successful 
organization which helps the children of her neighborhood in Anacostia. 
Ms. Hawkins started the Children of Mine Center in her home more than nine 
years ago. Hannah and her center now serve 75 to 100 children a day in an
after-school program that provides an immeasurable amount of academic,
nutritional, emotional, and spiritual support.
<p>
Welcome so much. I am glad to have you and Deanna back again.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Glad to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Why did you choose to focus on the children?
 There are a lot of needy people out there.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, many years ago -- I am an activist; I am a native of 
this city, and there are very few of us that are left in the city -- I 
became a drug counselor.  I have three sons who are recovering addicts.
 I found that so much emphasis had been placed on the adult addicts,
and no one was paying attention to the siblings.
<p>
I would travel through the street, walking through the streets all hours of 
the night, coming from different meetings, and I would find children
who were out begging for various things.
<p>
Therefore, I felt as though that we had to do something.  We could no 
longer sit around the round table and discuss what was happening to the 
children and not do something for the children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That first day that you decided to have children come into 
your home, what was that day like?  Or was it a special child, when you said,
&quot;I'm going to open my home&quot;?  How did that happen?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, it is so ironic.  It just happened.  You know,
me and my prayer partner had started a Bible study group.  She
had it in her home, and I encouraged her to take the children
from out of her home because, by word of mouth, she had outgrown
her home, and I found her a place across the street from where
I lived, and in finding her a place, I found that children were
coming to me for counseling, and it just happened.  It is just
like when you fall in love.  You don't know when or where; it
just happens.
<p>
And so I found that the traveling into my home,
which I live in a very small, two-bedroom townhouse in Anacostia,
that I was no longer able to accommodate the many children that
wanted to come in.
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, other government agencies, people have come to you and 
offered to take this over or help, and you have said no federal funding.  
Why is that?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, the government agencies have not virtually come to 
offer assistance and taking it over.  They have admired me from afar,
like many people.  But I tell people that your mouth can say many
things, but your behavior don't lie, and their behavior has lied.
 They have not come forth to virtually offer me anything, and
to be honest with you, maybe it's all for the best, because some
of the services, one of the major services that we provide at
the Children of Mine Center is Bible studies, and when you are
receiving federal funding, they don't want you to discuss religion
at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As a social worker, Deanna, I know you saw
a lot of that.  What impresses you most about Ms. Hawkins' program?
<p>
MS. CARLSON:  There are so many things that impress me about your
program, but one of them is that it is in a neighborhood that
you live in and that you are meeting a need of those around you.
<p>
All of us find ourselves in different neighborhoods, with different
children around us, and I have just noticed in you a real genuineness
and wanting to reach out to whoever it is, whatever those needs
are that you have seen.
<p>
I am really impressed, too, in the fact
that you are working with children and in that investment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of the lives changed, even in a nine-year period,
what has happened to some of the kids that you have had?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, I have had them more than nine years in actuality; I 
have had them for over 10.  It is so ironic that you asked me that
question, because I always use a slogan, &quot;From little acorns,
big oaks grow.&quot;  The children are able to equate to this,
because they can see a little acorn, and then they know about
the big oak.
<p>
The children that have stayed under the umbrella
of the Children of Mine Center have grown.  I have taken them
from profanity to prayer, from crime to a normal way of living.
 And the problem -- and this is what I tell so many of my constituency,
and I try to tell society -- you know, we are so busy -- so many
of the Congressmen are so busy posturing themselves until they
don't understand that these children are no different than any
of us.  It is lack of nurturing that has occurred.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kind of homes do the children come from?  How would 
you describe their environment?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, they come from all over the city, all over the 
metropolitan area -- Northwest -- all four quadrants -- Northeast, 
Southwest, and Southeast. Some come from two-family homes.  Some are in 
foster care.  Some have been adopted.  We have adopted some of these 
children.  Some come --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Is there a common thread, do you think,
as you look at them -- two-parent, one-parent, rich or poor? 
What holds them together in your home and in your heart?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: In the Children of Mine or in their home?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In the children that you see coming in.  What do you see a 
common thread today?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, the main thing that I see, and the
most common denominator, is that consistency -- and this is what
society does not have anymore.  Look at today.  The government
is closed down.  You don't know what is going to happen tomorrow.
 Through the grace of God -- it is nothing that I am doing; it
is only through the grace of God that we are able to do this.
 It is consistency.
<p>
There are days when I am awfully tired, awfully
tired.  But I go in spite of my tiredness.  And the children see
a consistent pattern that we are there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The research has been very clear that consistency and a 
stable environment is one of the key elements that children need. 
Faith is something that government often doesn't provide.
<p>
Deanna, what do you see in the research in terms of the powerful impact 
that role models and role models of faith have on kids?
<p>
MS. CARLSON: The research has shown consistently that if you have a 
faith-based program, it is more effective than the government programs, and 
that is exactly what Ms. Hawkins is doing in her center.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The children -- I know you've got to have many different things
that you give them:  food, shelter, academics.  Academics is another
long-term skill.  What do you do for the children in helping expand
their thinking?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  Well, first of all -- and you must
understand this, and I cannot emphasize this enough -- the cost
of real love is no charge.  The children, they are very sensitive,
and I think we as adults, we underestimate the intelligence of
children.  They are just like sponges.  They will absorb anything
that you give them.
<p>
I will say to you just like I say to them
every night, &quot;Poison in, poison out.  Love in, love out.&quot;
 And that's what we try to give them:  love, consistency, understanding,
and patience.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I understand that even though there
are sometimes gang problems, crime problems in the area, that
people have been very much leaving your program alone and giving
you the space to do what you are doing.  Why do you think that
is, when so many people are talking about those kinds of gang
and crime problems in the inner cities?
<p>
MS. HAWKINS: Well, it's only through the grace of God, and what you 
must understand -- I will say to you just like I say to a lot of the 
volunteers that might want to come, and they say to me, which I laugh 
about it now, but it used to be very insulting, &quot;Is it safe to come
there?&quot;
<p>
And I say to them -- and I am going to say this to
you -- &quot;When you're doing God's will, He will put a hedge
of protection around you at all times.&quot;  They are more safe
there than they are sitting in their own so-called secluded living
rooms.  The community knows that we are doing God's work, and
that's why.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have about a minute left, and I would
love to give you the opportunity to say anything you would like
to the people who are watching about your program or the work
that you are doing.
<p>
MS. HAWKINS:  I would just like to say to
you, my brothers and sisters, today, we have so many children
that have a hole in their hearts.  Please close that hole with
love.  Take time out to reach down and pick one of these children
up.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much, Ms. Hawkins.  It has been
an honor.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you highlights
of what the Family Research Council staff is doing to ensure that
the government gives us the very best for today's families.

[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.
<p>
The FRC staff participates in many events to
promote America's families.  In fact, just last week, Robert Knight,
Director of Cultural Studies, testified before the Senate Governmental
Affairs Committee to give his insight and influence regarding
the Family Privacy Act.
<p>
<i>Straight Talk</i> now brings you the Family Research Council's Homefront 
News.
<p>

<p>
[From testimony given on November 9, 1995, before the Senate
Governmental Affairs Committee on the Family Privacy Act.]
<p>
COMMITTEE CHAIR: Mr. Knight, could we have your statement, please, sir?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Sure. I am Robert H. Knight, Director of Cultural
Studies of the Family Research Council.  I am a former journalist,
having been a news editor at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, a Media Fellow
at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University, and a Senior
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.
<p>
We appreciate your including Family Research Council in this hearing,
and we feel we are speaking on behalf of many parents all over
the United States.
<p>
In 1986, the White House Working Group on the
Family's final report included these words:  &quot;Parental nurturing
and education of the young is our most important national investment.
 It is the fundamental task of humanity.&quot;
<p>
Those words were penned by my boss, Gary Bauer, and nothing that has 
happened since has changed the truth of what he said.  It could have been 
said at any time and any place.
<p>
We often hear from child's rights advocates
that it takes a whole village to raise a child.  But parents are
indispensable.  Not even a whole village can replicate them. 
As the people most responsible for and most equipped to discern
the needs of their children, parents must be accorded deference
in all matters of education.
<p>
Children in public and private schools
are taught by dedicated professionals, but only because the parents
consent to have these professionals participate in their education.
 No one but a parent can understand how parents feel about their
own children.  And I am talking about adoptive parents as well
as biological ones.
<p>
Mother Teresa described such devotion through
a firsthand observation at her clinic in Calcutta.  She said,
&quot;I'll never forget.  I gave a child to a Hindu family, and
after a few months, I heard the child became very, very sick,
and I sent for the family, and I told them, 'Give me back that
child.  I'll take care of the sick child, and I'll give you another
healthy child.'  The father looked at me and said, 'Mother, take
my life rather than take the child.'&quot;
<p>
Like this Indian father,
most parents would lay down their lives for their children, and
they are acutely aware of this responsibility.  So decisions about
what kind of information is conveyed to children or extracted
from them are the parents' natural prerogative.
<p>
Any research methods,
including surveys, that place a barrier between children and their
parents should be outlawed.  Increasingly, parents have found
themselves fighting for their most fundamental rights against
hostile educators and government officials who honestly believe
that they, not the parents, know what is best for the children.
<p>
Such officials work overtime to acquaint children with revisionist
history, graphic sexual materials, and relativistic notions of
morality, all in the name of research and education.
<p>
Often parents are unaware of what the children are receiving.  The 
concept of informed consent is faulty, because there are too many ways 
for it to fail, as Senator Grassley pointed out.  Parents are often
not given adequate information, and a teacher may send a child
home with an announcement about an upcoming survey, but unless
the parents signs a permission form, there is no way to determine
if the parent ever got the message.  As a parent myself, I can
tell you, those messages don't always get through.
<p>
And to those who argue that written requirements are cumbersome and 
expensive, a loss of parental freedom to determine a child's education is
a far higher cost, one that is unacceptable.
<p>
There are other ways
that information can be obtained on dangerous behaviors.  Documentation
of the numbers of cases of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually
transmitted diseases, suicides, drug overdoses, and the like is
readily available.
<p>
The drive to target all teens and children
because of the actions of the unfortunate few is a manifestation
of the educational dogma that information, in and of itself, with
no moral reference, can make a difference.
<p>
But two decades of
research have shown that giving youngsters more value-free information
about sex, for instance, has not resulted in any behavioral change
at all except perhaps earlier experimentation leading to more
problems.
<p>
With the advent of Goals 2000 and its emphasis on national
standards and accountability, the role of testing is becoming
paramount.  Outcome-based education as implemented by Goals 2000
moves schools away from the strictly academic and toward the production
of certain attitudes.  Consequently, the line is becoming blurred
between what is educational and what is therapeutic.
<p>
Parents are worried about surveys for two reasons. Some questionnaires 
reveal information that is nobody's business but that of the families,
and some questionnaires convey information to the children that
the parents would rather their children were not exposed to. 
<p>
The issue has been driven primarily by sex, suicide, and drug surveys
among young teens, some of which have been politically motivated
and manipulated.  A few years ago, a national youth survey on
sexuality contained questions that were so graphic that many parents
felt they were pornographic.
<p>
Concern over research on hapless
children has been driven by revelations of abuses by federally
funded researchers going as far back as the famous studies of
Alfred Kinsey in the 1940s.  It was under grants from the National
Research Council that Dr. Kinsey collected material for his famous
Kinsey report.
<p>
In that report, 317 children were reported to have
been subjected to sexual molestation and their responses recorded
in a graph table.  Nowhere is there evidence that parental consent
was given.  In fact, no one, not even parents, could give consent
for such acts.  But that didn't stop the Kinsey scientists.
<p>
Further documentation of this shameful episode of scientific abuse can
be found in the Family Research Council's new documentary, <i>The
Children of Table 34</i>, which I am donating and submitting for the
record.  It can also be found in <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud:  The Indoctrination
of a People</i> by Dr. Judith Reisman, Edward Eichel, with Drs. J.
Gordon Muir and John Court as editors.
<p>
Now, I am not suggesting
that the mere taking of a survey is equivalent to the kind of
abuse that Kinsey recorded, just that there is a temptation to
gather information because it can be done without asking whether
it should be done.
<p>
Surveys that ask questions about suicide or
drug use can plant the idea of either activity as an option, when
a teen may never have entertained this option.  For sheer repetition
of reference, harmful activities can lose their power to inspire
natural resistance.  After all, if a teen hears about this stuff,
a teen could conclude, &quot;If we're talking about it so much,
everybody must be doing it.  What's wrong with me?&quot;
<p>
Sex surveys, in and of themselves, are objectionable when directed toward 
children, and they are notoriously unreliable.  They are slanted towards
the unconventional.  People who indulge in unconventional sexuality
or precocious sexuality are far more interested in talking about
it.
<p>
Here's the dilemma for little Susie.  She responds to a question
that asks if she's a virgin.  If she answers yes, then she is
supposed to skip through several detailed questions about sexual
activities, such as how many partners she had had.  After an exercise
like that, she may feel like a sexual underachiever for having
kept herself chaste.
<p>
Teens are very peer conscious and can feel
left out and stigmatized for having to exempt themselves from
a battery of questions.
<p>
Likewise, if the onus is on the parent
to opt a child out of intrusive experiences, the possibility for
stigma is greater than if all parents have to opt their children
in with written consent.  Those who administer surveys are more
interested in high compliance than parental input, so they tend
to be opposed to such safeguards.  But parental rights have to
come first.
<p>
Family Research Council supports efforts like H.R.
1271 to safeguard the rights of parents to direct their children's
education and welfare, and that includes how, where, and when
children are included in research.  Parents are assigned that
task by no less an authority than God Himself.  It would be the
epitome of hubris to tamper with that bond because some educational
experts feel they are smarter than everybody else. Thank you.
<p>
COMMITTEE CHAIR:  Thank you, Mr. Knight.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay tuned 
to find out how you, too, can make a difference in fighting for change 
that promotes the best for today's families.
<p>

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Please grab a pencil.  We're going to have a phone number 
for you in just a second.  I hope you can see that you, too, can be
a very important part of real welfare reform.  We need people
like you.  Please get involved.
<p>
Thank you for joining us here
at <i>Straight Talk</i>. To receive more information about welfare reform,
to find out how you can become involved in that reform, contact

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council.</i> I'm Kristi Hamrick, and we are here to present issues that 
affect your family, all American families, and the impact government
and social policies have on families today.
<p>
In fact, this week's show provides new scientific data on what Americans 
want for themselves, their families, and our country as a whole.  Tonight 
you will hear the exclusive results of the Family Research Council's 1995
Family Issues Survey, which delves into things like our current
welfare program, crime, divorce, and pop culture's influence on
you.
<p>
In fact, just yesterday, Family Research Council held a news
conference to release scientifically conducted poll data.  Although
major media from ABC, NBC, and PBS attended, these stories that
appeared couldn't cover all of what is the most pertinent about
this original work.  So, before we divulge into our findings,
let's take a look at what the newspapers and networks got to see
of our news conference as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the 
Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p><center><h4>Excerpt from News Conference</h4></center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I'm Kristi Hamrick, the Director
of Communications for the Family Research Council.  This is the
fourth annual Family Issues Poll.  Family Research Council, which
has had an interest in examining research of all kinds, likes
to participate in it as well, and sometimes I think we all know
that a number can say almost anything that you want it to say.
<p>
So we like to do our own numbers, take a look for ourselves at
where the people are in terms of their attitudes and values and
how do they see some of the reforms, from welfare reform to some
of the choices on abortion to some of the things about our culture
that really concern us.
<p>
So we have been doing polling under the
leadership of Bill Mattox, who is the Vice President for Policy,
who has been here in Washington quite a while and at FRC, I think,
10 years, and has been directing these polls.  So I would like
to invite him up to let you know where the country is today on
some really key family issues.  Bill, if you would come on up.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Thank you, Kristi. Today I am pleased to join Bob
Maginnis of our staff in releasing the findings of the Family
Research Council's 1995 Family Issues Survey.
<p>
Like other FRC polls that have preceded it, this year's survey addresses 
a wide range of questions that have cultural, public policy, and electoral
implications.  Indeed, the clear message of our 1995 survey is
that the catch phrase for the 1996 election year is unlikely to
be, &quot;It's the economy, Stupid.&quot;
<p>
Instead, many Americans perceive that our nation's most daunting problems 
stem from the fact that our nation's ship has lost its moral compass. This
is, I think, quite evident in a number of the findings of the
Family Research Council.
<p>
Kristi mentioned there was a significant
section of our poll that dealt with questions surrounding the
current welfare reform debate and, indeed, questions that I think
will become increasingly important as we see the budget battle
continue and as we see Congress increasingly move toward relimiting
government.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  We gave the statement and asked
for a comment.  The statement is:  &quot;The values promoted in
today's movies, on television, and in music lyrics do not represent
my views.&quot;  Seventy-five percent of all Americans agree with
that statement.
<p>
Now, possibly they agree -- and this is when we
asked even further about what would you do -- we found that clear
majorities of Americans would block out offensive material --
violence and sexually explicit material -- on cable television
and on computer networks.  As well, when we talk about cyberspace,
we also found, interestingly, that young women and older women
agree:  they don't want this sort of trash on our computer networks.
<p>
You know, we ask Americans -- and they are divided about this,
interestingly -- whether or not they can protect their kids from
the offensive nature of what's going on in our pop culture and
are they doing a good job.  Now, what we found is that 49 percent
said, &quot;Yes, we can protect our kids from the ravages of the
pop culture.&quot;  Forty-nine percent said, &quot;No, we can't.&quot;
 Forty-nine percent -- maybe the same first 49 percent -- said,
&quot;We're doing a good job.  We're monitoring the shows, we're
monitoring the music lyrics, and we're protecting our kids.&quot;
 But 49 percent said, &quot;We aren't.&quot;
<p>
We found that one-third
of all single moms and one-third of all divorcees say that they
can do the job.  But 61 percent, almost two-thirds, said, &quot;We
need help.  We cannot do this by ourselves.  We need possibly
government, possibly community activities, possibly even the industry,
to jump in and do the right thing.&quot;
<p>
We found that more than nine out of ten parents oppose public libraries 
giving objectionable materials such as <i>Playboy</i> magazine to young children 
without parental consent.  Then we found about nine out of ten Americans wanted
parents to have a veto power over the materials that any child
-- their child -- would take out of library, specifically because
parents are concerned about the moral guidance of their children,
and also, quite frankly, they are liable for the materials that
their child might check out of the local library.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: With that, we'll throw it open for any questions anyone may 
have. Yes?
<p>
QUESTION:  Is there a reason why you didn't focus on education
and the role of school?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, actually, we have done
a lot of education research in the past.  Last year's survey --
and this did not get the kind of pickup that it should have --
last year's survey found that younger parents -- that is, parents
of preschoolers and of early elementary school-aged kids -- tend
to support school choice to a significantly larger degree than
do parents of older children.
<p>
I think there are all kinds of reasons
why this might be so.  They may be less subtle in neighborhoods
that are -- and may have yet to even buy a house -- and since
we know that housing is quite often closely tied to school districts,
that could be part of the reason.
<p>
I think in many ways younger parents may perceive that the school can more 
likely have a positive effect on a potentially troubled child than that the 
potentially troubled child might have a negative effect on the school culture;
whereas, with older children, the opposite may be true, that many
perceive that a troubled teenager is more likely to be a corrupting
influence in a school than to benefit from some type of school
environment, having a positive effect on it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Bill Mattox 
and Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis, the two FRC staff members who spearheaded
the development and analysis of this year's poll, to bring you
the results.  Stayed tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are presenting the 1995 Family Issues Survey results
and FRC's top 10 list of findings, as detailed by our guests,
Family Research Council Vice President for Policy Bill Mattox
and Policy Analyst Lieutenant Colonel Bob Maginnis.  Welcome,
gentlemen.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  This was a very impressive product.  How long did it take 
to put together?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, we started the process back in the summer,
identifying some different questions that we wanted to ask, including
some that we have asked before in previous years.  We then put
together the questionnaire during the course of September and
worked then with our pollster in kind of fine-tuning that.
<p>
He went to the field in October, and we then spent really much of
the month since then analyzing the results, writing up the report,
getting graphics coordinated with Valerie Stambaugh of our staff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, a product like this -- we have heard of Gallup
polls, we have heard of Worthland(?) polls.  Any difference between
the poll that Family Research Council did and anything you might
see on the evening news?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: No.  We, much like they,
surveyed 1,000 Americans, randomly selected by telephone, and
asked them a series of questions that they then responded to.
 So it was very, very similar to the kind of thing that you would
see on an evening newscast.
<p>
In fact, some of the CNN polls or other polls that you might see that some 
of the networks do quite often only surveyed 500 Americans and so, therefore, 
don't actually have the same accuracy that ours would.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things I know people look at is, is this the kind of 
thing I can depend on?  We're going to talk to people later about getting
a copy of this.  But when they look at this, they could depend
on this as well as they can depend on any other numbers that they
might find?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I would say so.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Yes, I would think so.  You know, we look at polls all 
the time in writing the papers that we write, and the numbers here really
corroborate what we have seen on virtually every other national
poll.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to talk about what we've seen.
 Let's begin to count down Family Research Council's top 10 findings
in the 1995 Family Issues Survey.  Number 10:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Family breakdown and moral decline are fueling perceptions 
America is on the &quot;wrong track.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Family breakdown. So, tell me, we're talking about being right 
track, wrong track. Why do people think that?  What kind of went into the 
development of that number?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the first question in every
single poll we have ever done is, &quot;Do you think that America
is on the right track or on the wrong track?  Are we moving in
the right direction or not?&quot;  And what we found this year
is that a significant proportion of the American public -- roughly
two-thirds -- say things are headed in the wrong direction.
<p>
What was really interesting is we followed this question up with a
second question that says, &quot;Why?&quot;  Because, typically,
that right track/wrong track question, the answer to it has closely
tracked the economy, and if the economy was going in the right
direction, Americans said the country was going in the right direction.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Kind of a guaranteed connection, wasn't it?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Exactly.  This year what we found is that when we asked
people, &quot;Why are things off on the wrong track?&quot; it
is not, they think, because of economic problems -- 18 percent
said that that was the primary reason -- but the vast majority
said, instead, that the primary reason why they think things are
going in the wrong direction is because of the breakdown of the
family and the decline in values in our society.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Did you find that surprising, given the relative stability 
of the economy?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Yes, I think it really is interesting
that you have this divergence between these two questions that
had always in the past gone hand-in-glove.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In terms of what you are seeing, Bob, your area takes a look 
at a lot of crime and cultural issues.  Do you think that that underscores
the need to continue to look at those kinds of areas?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, clearly, you know, the last Presidential election
was about &quot;the economy, Stupid,&quot; and now it is really
what is happening in the cities and in the suburbs of our country.
 And if we don't do something to turn around the violent crime
epidemic, especially amongst the youth, then we are going to find
that no telling where this country is going to go.
<p>
So we have to turn that around.  That is why I think parents or single 
people throughout this country understand that we are indeed on the wrong
track.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to keep looking at what track
we are on.  To continue our countdown, let's look at finding number
9:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Adoption is viewed as the best response.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: And abortion is viewed as the worst response to an unwed
pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very surprising findings when it comes
to the issue of abortion.  We hear all the time that Americans
worldwide are clamoring for more abortion, people worldwide, but
our finding found that abortion was not the knee-jerk response
of people to an unexpected pregnancy.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Oh, no. In fact, our polling suggests that the majority of the 
American public are clearly anti-abortion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of numbers did you get on that, though?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, we asked people, we said, &quot;Look, imagine a young girl 
who is unmarried, teenager. She's pregnant out of wedlock.  What do you think 
she should do? Should she abort the child, put it up for adoption, marry
the child's father, or should she bear the child and keep it herself?&quot;
<p>
What we found is that the American public generally said adoption
is the best option.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: And that, closely following that, marrying the child's father is 
the second-best option.  And interestingly there, there were a lot
of men, both married and single, who regarded marrying the child's
father as the best option.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Many people think that men think abortion is the best option.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Oh, yes. I mean, that, I think -- I would have expected most 
men to say marriage is the last thing we want considered here.  But instead,
we found just the opposite.
<p>
When we asked, &quot;What would be the best thing that she could do?&quot; 
abortion ranked at the bottom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  When we turned the question around and said, &quot;What do you 
think would be the worst thing that she could do?&quot; a clear majority said
abortion is the worst thing that she could do in that kind of
situation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you see breakdowns in ages or by
race or anything like that, or was it primarily a break between
male and female?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, most of this kind of standard
rank order held true across virtually every demographic group
that you could find.  There were some notable differences on the
basis of gender, with men being more likely to support marriage,
women more likely to support adoption, and their second choice
-- at least the choice of single women -- their second choice
was for single motherhood.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: And then third was marrying the child's father.  But abortion,
on everybody's scorecard, ranked last.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So, ladies, there is hope for you.  Marriage was at the top of 
the men's list. Okay, let's see now finding number 8:
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: Most Americans, including rank-and-file pro-lifers, strongly 
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Strongly oppose. That's interesting, because the budget debate 
now, you would think, listening to the President and some of the Democratic 
members of the House and Senate, that people are out there saying, &quot;I 
want welfare just as it is.&quot;  But you do not find it?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: No. In fact, I think it is a reflection of some of the 
resistance to single motherhood and the perception that many people have
that government programs help to encourage illegitimacy; that
they do not want to see increases in the size of one's welfare
check if they have additional children out of wedlock.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's interesting.  Do you think that, in terms of 
compassion -- you saw people saying basically, &quot;I am concerned about
subsidizing the lifestyle,&quot; or, &quot;I think there are better
ways to be compassionate.&quot;  What did you see in the numbers?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I think one of the things that we saw throughout
this was that there is a compassionate impulse on the part of
many Americans, but there is also, I think, a recognition that
government programs quite often undercut that compassionate impulse
and encourage the kind of behavior that actually causes people
to find it that much more difficult to lead healthy, productive
lives.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Does this surprise you?  Bob, you watch the
Hill, as well as all of us.  As we are watching the whole welfare
reform debate, were you surprised to see the direction that Americans
were tilting?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  No, not really.  I think most
Americans are disenchanted with the current welfare system.  But
I was surprised that the numbers are absolutely high in regard
to especially the most religious part of our culture.  They were
saying, you know, fathers need to take more responsibility.  We
don't need to subsidize more illegitimate children.  What we need,
obviously, is to reinforce the family and reinforce marriage in
this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right, which is sort of an interesting
Family Research Council theme.  It is nice to hear that we are
consistently right on that.
<p>
We have a lot of other findings to come, but one last thing.  Do you 
think that this will be helpful in FRC's work on the Hill?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: I do, especially on the
question about the family cap, because, as you know, there has
been a debate between pro-lifers.  A lot of our friends have said,
&quot;You know, we really ought not to limit these welfare checks,
because we might encourage abortion.&quot;
<p>
Others have said, &quot;No. We've got to tackle unwed pregnancy, because 
those are the girls that are quite often having the abortions.&quot; I 
think this polling data, especially since pro-lifers --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It kinds of pulls it together.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: -- were supportive, I think, may help us to break that impasse.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Great. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more of this impressive kind of data.  We are going to continue with our 
top-10 countdown and bring you more details.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. We are in the middle of looking at Family Research Council's
scientific and original Family Issues Poll.  We are ready for
finding number 7.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Most believe that preventative
strategies aimed at curbing out-of-wedlock pregnancies are better
than those strategies aimed at promoting workfare.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So work is supposed to be better, in the eyes of most 
Americans, according to the White House, according to a lot of congressional
things.  But what you have found out was that in fact that whole
saving-sex concept ranks higher.  I found that a little surprising.
 Were you all?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I think this one really did surprise
me, because it is clear that Americans do believe that welfare
recipients, all things being equal, ought to work for their benefits.
 But when we asked them, &quot;Do you think that is the best strategy,
a remedial strategy after people are already on welfare, that
we ought to focus our attention on trying to get them off, or
should we be focusing perhaps more of our attention on trying
to prevent the need in the first place by discouraging out-of-wedlock
pregnancy and seeing if we can't keep people off welfare?&quot;
<p>
And, lo and behold, folks said, &quot;Yes, we really think this
is where our energy ought to go, in part because we think that
this problem may actually be easier to solve than the problem
of getting people off welfare once they are on.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.  It seems to be a conclusion they have come to 
without a lot of support from the media.  Certainly the workfare kinds
of ideas, from Tommy Thompson in Wisconsin to other states, get
a lot of attention, while marriage alternatives don't.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes, and I think it is important that people understand, we 
are not suggesting that we don't think workfare is a good idea.  We
obviously think that the welfare reform package on the Hill, which
includes a significant workfare package, makes sense.
<p>
All we are suggesting here is that maybe the question here is a little 
bit more complicated or a little bit bigger than many would like to
kind of limit the debate only to this safe territory over here,
talking about work, without getting into some of these thorny
issues about how do we discourage out-of-wedlock sex.  And yet
what our finding suggests is that the American people really want
a focus on encouraging abstinence and encouraging people to avoid
out-of-wedlock pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, what is interesting
about this number is it almost has implications into the title
X, which is the government's abstinence, saving sex, proposals,
versus title -- well, actually it is title X, which is the bad
side of the coin, the condom distribution, compared to title XX,
which is saving sex.
<p>
We spend one dollar in ten on saving sex
and do a lot on condom distribution, and yet this is a whole study
saying we think we need to focus our whole welfare reform even
more on saving sex.
<p>
Do you think this is a message the Hill is ready to hear?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  I doubt they are ready to hear
yet, but we clearly need to be sending a very clear message that
children, whether they are 12 -- and in some cases we have children
12 years old having children in this country, unfortunately --
or they are 28, and if they are not married, they shouldn't be
engaging in activities that are going to lead, obviously, to more
children, because children raising children is not a good idea.
<p>
But whether it is title X or title XX, our government needs to,
in my opinion, back out of the business of promoting sex and get
into the business of promoting abstinence.  You know, there was
an interesting profile --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That kind of promotion is going to be key, I think, in 
what the Family Research Council does.  But let's move on with our poll 
just a second.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of promoting sex, we are going to get back to that 
later, but right now, finding number 6:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  The religiously devout are more apt to give
and volunteer and say they would do more if government welfare
programs were dramatically cut or abolished.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In some ways, the sex number and the religiously devout number 
tie together, do they not?  People saying attitudes and the kinds
of people that we raise our children to be are really significant,
and they see the religiously devout as being good citizens.  What
did you find to be interesting about that finding?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, I think the thing that is hopeful here is that if we do
see a cutback in welfare programs, or perhaps even the abolition
of the government welfare state, we have religiously devout Americans
saying, &quot;We are prepared to pick up the slack.&quot;
<p>
What is impressive, I think, about that sort of offer, if you will,
is the fact that if you look at what individuals who are attending
church weekly are already doing, they are already giving to charities
at a higher level and volunteering in various charitable endeavors
at a higher level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is interesting, isn't it? By what amount are you finding 
the people of faith to be more involved in their community?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, what we found is that if you look, for example, at 
giving to charitable organizations, that nearly 100 percent of those 
who attend church weekly say that they made more than one gift at some point 
during the last 12 months.  For the general population, the number was in the
mid-80s.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  So the difference is not that substantial, though I suspect that 
if you were to ask the question in terms of dollar amounts or percentage of 
income or things of that nature, some of these differences would prove
to be even greater.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And it is interesting, too, isn't it, because there is a lot of 
media information out there that would indicate that people of faith aren't 
the best citizens. You certainly get that from movies like <i>Cape Fear</i> 
to whatever: when faith comes up, it's negative.
<p>
We are going to come back in a moment with finding number 5.  We are going 
to look forward to telling you that in just a second.  Please join us in 
looking at finding number 5:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  Even members of Generation X believe today's popular culture 
encourages teen sex, violence, and drug use.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Why did you find that to be -- well,
Bill, you are laughing.  You will have to tell us a little bit
about that.  But that was a very quirky number, wasn't it?  Where
did all that came into that come from?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, I will let him answer why first, because he was 
laughing more than I was.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  I am just tickled with some of our staff members who are helping 
to tell the story today.
<p>
But, no, here I think what is interesting is this:  When we asked
people, &quot;Do you think that the popular cultural influences
are positive or negative?  Do they encourage out-of-wedlock sex?
 Do they encourage drug use?  Do they encourage violence?&quot;
 I don't know that it is altogether that surprising that the general
public -- parents, especially -- say, &quot;Hey, this is harmful
stuff.&quot;
<p>
But I think it is rather interesting that those in
that 20-something generation -- 18- to 29-year-olds -- say, &quot;Hey,
we agree.&quot;  The levels of agreement are not quite as large,
but there is, nevertheless, a strong majority that are prepared
to say that we believe that these kinds of influences are negative;
that they do encourage these types of behavior; and that the values
in pop culture really don't reflect our own.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But for kids to say that, though, that seems even more 
startling, I mean that they would acknowledge, &quot;You're right. I 
watch this stuff.  I am more likely to have sex, do drugs, you know,
check out whatever the song is talking about.&quot;
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: But even when we asked the 18- to 30-year-olds, they 
came back and they told us in large  majorities that what they are seeing
on the pop culture is not reflective of who they are, of what
their family is all about.  And they are upset about that.  And
I think that that sends a clear message to our Congress that maybe
we need to consider the types of violence, the type of drug promotion,
the type of teen sexuality that is being pushed into the living
rooms of every American home today and start to rein some of that
in.
<p>
You know, what happened with Time Warner this past summer
with regard to rap music -- you know, we start to recognize that
those messages are not promoting the sorts of things that we want
healthy Americans to be all about.
<p>
So we need to be involved, not only as a government but as a people, showing 
that our pocketbook can influence large corporations that are promoting this 
stuff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Helping people make good decisions.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Hopefully.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now it is time for us to see finding number 4. Please watch.
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER: Single parents say families need help shielding their kids 
from harmful cultural influences.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is an very interesting number, and it kind
of ties into some earlier poll data from the Family Research Council
in terms of single parents seem to be the most pro-family in some
ways.  What are you finding as we are tracking single parents
over the years?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, if you look at this question,
it begins to make sense when you consider that a lot of single
parents are trying to do the work of two and cannot be there to
monitor their children's behavior at every moment.  And so when
the kids come home in the afternoons to an empty house, yes, the
chances of their getting involved in some type of incident in
the neighborhood or something are probably greater.  The chances
of possibly getting hold of some pornographic video to pop in
the VCR or something like that are greater.
<p>
So I think in many ways the lack of adult supervision is something that 
many single parents feel very acutely, and they say, &quot;Hey, look. 
We don't think that the job that we are being asked to do is one
that we can do alone.  We do need societal community support.
 We need, for example, public libraries to respect&quot; --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Be a little more discreet.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: -- &quot;yes, and respect our wishes; that we don't want 
pro-homosexual or <i>Playboy</i> or other types of materials available 
to our kids without some type of shield.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is interesting about that is the knee-jerk ACLU 
reaction to parents saying, &quot;I'm concerned,&quot; is, &quot;Look, 
it's your problem. Deal with it. You need to be the monitor.&quot;  
But with single parents, they've got all that they can do to handle.
<p>
Bob, you have been working with a lot of single-parent issues.  What do 
you see on that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, clearly, the single-parent issue
is dynamite, given the illegitimacy rate, given the whole welfare
 debate that we have today, and the out-of-wedlock birth issue.
<p>
But when we looked at the entire population, America is split
in half on can we deal with this; and parents are saying, well
-- half of them say yes and half of them say no.  And then when
we ask the question, &quot;Are you monitoring your children?&quot;
half say, &quot;Yes, well, we are watching the same television,
we are watching the music videos, and so forth.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: They are trying.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  But the other half say no, they aren't doing a very 
good job. And so we have a country that apparently is just divided down the 
middle in regard to this whole issue, and we need to pay close attention to 
it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And it is incredibly stressful for the people in that 
situation. That is the saddest thing. Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Following this commercial
break, we will be back and counting down to the number one Family
Issues Survey finding.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>, and we are rolling down to FRC's number one
finding in our top-10 list resulting from analysis of the 1994
or 1995 Family Issues Survey.  The survey experts, Bill Mattox
and Bob Maginnis, are here helping me count down.  So let's see
what our next result is as we count down to number 3:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER: Most Americans strongly support increasing tax benefits 
for families raising children and want this relief to remain permanent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I am not so surprised that people want tax benefits.
 I am a little surprised maybe by the budget debate where that
seems to be the one thing everyone is suggesting we get rid of.
 How do you think these two things come together in the budget
debate?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the encouraging news here is that people
don't just want tax relief, but they see the need for tax relief
for families with children, and of course, we have been talking,
really, till we're blue in the face, saying, &quot;Hey, look at
the way in which the tax code, over the last 40 or 50 years, has
dramatically increased the tax burden on parents.  Shouldn't we
do something with that?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kind of numbers did you get?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, what we found is that when you put
this to the American people, roughly 8 in 10 say yes, you know,
this really ought to be done.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Wow!
<p>
MR. MATTOX: What is impressive about that is that support for pro-family 
tax relief is even higher than that for the flat tax, which is something
else that we polled here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What did you find on the flat tax?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  The flat tax generally had numbers in the
mid-50s range for the entire population.  Now, among, say, Republicans,
it was in the 70 percent range.  But this number here on pro-family
tax relief was consistent in the high 70s across the board, and
again, the point there that we want to have this tax relief made
permanent, not simply some sort of gimmick that you get this year
but you don't get the following year, but instead, something that
is in the tax code permanently that solves this problem once and
for all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I think what is interesting about that
is the <i>Washington Post</i> on Sunday and other esteemed members of
the media have been indicating that we should get rid of this
tax relief; if just -- if it wasn't for that tax relief, everything
would be great with the budget.  But 80 percent of Americans say
that they want that, and they want it permanently.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you think that some of the
people who are discussing this could better connect with the public
on that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Listen to the polls.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, clearly, you know, as Bill points out, they favor permanent
tax relief.  They don't want a temporary tax cut right now if
they are going to get something permanent long range, because
we recognize we have a deficit in this country that has to be
serviced, and if we don't take care of that now, we are going
to be in trouble a few years from now.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, and I think the key message here for those who are 
trying to cut the size of government is to link those cuts in government 
spending to tax cuts and to say, Look, instead of going out and spending
money for all these programs that really aren't doing a good job,
we are going to instead give the money back to the people who
earned it and let them use it to buy their kids braces or to fund
a family vacation or to put food on the table.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is what is kind of interesting about this, isn't it? 
Families in America are really taxed.  You are taxed a higher rate when
you have small children than if you had no children, and then
later you are taxed for a marriage penalty if you are married.
 And then, frankly, your children are going to pay for the things
that somebody else chose to spend.
<p>
I mean, do you think that these kinds of numbers could indicate a stronger 
stand is possible here in Washington on this issue?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, you are right in saying that these are extremely important 
issues, because even though they don't perhaps directly influence behavior, 
they certainly do indirectly.
<p>
I don't know too many people who sit down and say,
well, &quot;Let's have us another kid, because that will give
us a tax break of X amount or whatever.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But when people see that, gosh, you know,
it really is difficult to make ends meet, it quite often does
cause them to say, &quot;I'm not sure that we can afford to send
our kid to private school.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It's a concern.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're almost there, but let's hear first finding number 2:
<p>
FEMALE SPEAKER:  Most believe that divorce laws should protect the spouse 
that wants to save the marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Divorce reform is getting a lot of interest
at the state level.  Family Research Council does not favor a
federal policy; we would like to keep the government out of that.
 But there is a lot of empathy out there for people trying to
keep a marriage together, despite all the different movie evidence
to the contrary.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Yes, well, we are approaching a 50 percent divorce 
rate in this country with every new marriage, and it is devastating what 
is going on.  As you indicate, every state in this country, or most states, 
have laws that protect the spouse that is seeking the divorce and not the 
spouse that wants to salvage the marriage.  We asked and found out that more
than half of Americans want to change that, want to turn that
around.
<p>
We also found, interestingly, that in cases where adultery
is involved, or abuse, that more than three out of four Americans
say that the spouse that is not guilty of that offense should
get the custody of the children; and, also, more than half of
Americans say that for the non-philandering spouse, that person
should get more than half of whatever is left of the couple's
property.
<p>
So they are sending a very clear message that we want
to protect people that want to keep together and keep their marriage
going, because they understand how devastating this can be to
children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In America, it would seem that the marriage
contract is the only thing that can be unilaterally exited from.
 Everything else, we have to at least sit down and have a discussion.
<p>
Very quickly, Bill, what are one or two divorce reforms that Family
Research Council favors?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, the State of Michigan is doing the very kind of thing 
that we were polling about here, which is to say that they have a piece 
of legislation before the state legislature there that says, in cases 
where a spouse wants to work things out, instead of the law tilting in 
favor of the one who wants to leave, the law will instead tilt in the 
other's favor and will require fault to be shown on their part in order
for the one who wants to leave to leave.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We could see some changes in the law.
<p>
And now, our number one Family Issues Survey finding:
<p>
MALE SPEAKER:  Like other Americans, blacks support get-tough 
measures to combat crime.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Every poll -- Family Research Council's included -- 
would indicate that crime is at the top of the things that people are 
concerned about. And yet you all found this number interesting because of 
some of the rhetoric that came out of the O.J. Simpson trial.  What
did you find interesting about this number?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, in the aftermath of the O.J., the message was 
that black citizens are not concerned about crime in this country, and that
is completely wrong.  We found in great numbers that black Americans
are very, very concerned about crime.
<p>
Specifically, they want restitution paid to the victims of these heinous 
crimes. We also found that they want criminals who are incarcerated to work.
They aren't out there to enjoy being in a health spa or watch
TV; they are there to work.
<p>
Now, part of the problem has been -- and we need maybe some legislation 
here -- is that only 9 percent of the incarcerated people in this country now 
have gainful employment where they could possibly earn money so they could 
pay restitution to the victims.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Nine percent, you say?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Nine percent.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A very low number.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, there are some reasons.  You know, after
all, most Americans who are law-abiding don't want to give up
good jobs, their good jobs, so that somebody that is a felon in
jail, so that they can earn money to pay their victims.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: But at the same time, there
should be some way in which we can find alternatives.  And there
are some that are out there today.
<p>
We also found that black Americans want drug testing of criminals before 
they are released.  Why? Because a third of all people going into prison 
committed their crimes while they were either intoxicated with alcohol or 
they were using a now-illicit drug.
<p>
So we don't want people that are inebriated or potentially drunks, and so 
forth, to get back on the streets and to just ravage our communities. 
And black Americans, after all, are the most victimized people in this 
country. Their sons and daughters are the ones that are going to jail the 
most. But yet they understand.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is interesting; I mean, the numbers would indicate that 
they have a very clear understanding of the cost of crime in their communities. 
<p>
We have about 15 seconds left, Bill. When you take a look at Family Research 
Council's crime proposals, what do you see from this poll that can help
people have a more crime-free America?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, one of the other items that we included on the poll 
questionnaire was, &quot;What do you think of the legalization of drugs?&quot;
and found that the overwhelming majority of Americans, including
once again black Americans, say we don't want drugs legalized; we want,
instead, for illicit drugs to remain off limits to young people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very timely, especially given our past surgeon general's
exit.  And I am afraid we are going to have to exit shortly, too.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> presents Gary Bauer, president of
the Family Research Council, as he shares his views today with
the American press corps.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. FRC staff every week is involved in events to promote
strong families and inform people about the status of real Americans.
<p>
Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, recently
held a foreign press briefing to share his views with an international
audience. <i>Straight Talk</i> now brings you Gary Bauer in the Family
Research Council's Home Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
MR. BAUER:  First of all, I would like to thank everybody
for coming here today.  There's a lot of news breaking in Washington,
D.C., so I fully expected to come over here and perhaps chat with
one of you.  So I am pleased that some of you could fit this into
your schedules.
<p>
I would like to just make a couple of brief comments
about American politics and about America at the end of this century
and then find out what is on your mind about things going on in
Washington.
<p>
This is sort of an ironic time for the United States.
 My oldest daughter just went off to college a few months ago,
and she spent the summer reading and re-reading some of the old
classics that she thought that she would have to be familiar with
in an American university.
<p>
One of the books she re-read was <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Charles 
Dickens. You may remember that at the beginning of the book, there is 
this wonderful line: &quot;It was the best of times and it was the worst 
of times.&quot;
<p>
I found myself thinking as I saw the book that that is a great 
description of the United States in 1995, even though it was written 
about Great Britain and France many years ago.
<p>
There are a lot of reasons that Americans can be very happy in 1995. It 
has been a very successful century for the United States.  We have 
prevailed in several major world conflicts.  I think it is not an 
exaggeration to say that we have won the Cold War, at great sacrifice to 
the American people, both financially and also with the blood of their
sons in places over the years.
<p>
The American economy goes through all the cycles economies always go 
through. There are ups and downs, and so forth.  But if I would have 
brought my Ross Perot charts with me today, I could show you an economy 
that, since 1900, has produced more jobs for more people and more opportunity
than any system in the world.
<p>
There are great medical breakthroughs, technological breakthroughs. There 
are a lot of reasons for Americans to feel good about themselves and about 
their country.
<p>
But, ironically, for about 10 years now, when the pollsters ask 
the American people how they feel, two-thirds of them say that America 
is headed in the wrong direction.  They said that when George Bush was in the
White House, and they are saying it when Bill Clinton is in the
White House.  They said it when the Democrats controlled the Congress,
and they are saying it now that my friends, the Republicans, are
controlling the Congress.
<p>
I don't believe, when they say that we are headed in the wrong direction, 
that they are thinking about the economy or about the military or about other 
issues that tend to grab the headlines.  I think Americans are making a 
comment about the heart and soul of their country, about its culture.
<p>
I think that most experts, when they try to measure a great nation,
look at the obvious things:  the size of its economy, the strength
of its military, the gleam of its cities.  That is one way to
measure a great country, and certainly by those measurements I
think the United States would have to be judged a great world
power.
<p>
But you can also measure a country by the strength of its
families, by what its culture -- the values its culture passes
on.  You can measure a nation by how many of its children cry
themselves to sleep at night.  And I think that in the United
States in 1995, today, too many children will cry themselves to
sleep because they have been abandoned by fathers who aren't there,
because they have been exploited in a number of ways.  And I think
by those measurements my country is in danger of being something
less than a great nation.
<p>
Now, politicians are notoriously uncomfortable talking about 
these kinds of issues.  They would much rather talk
about marginal tax rates and whether the food stamp program ought
to have $1 billion or $1.2 billion.
<p>
But my feeling is that these are much grander issues and much more 
important issues than the others I just mentioned, and that even though 
politicians don't talk about these issues a great deal, I believe the 
American voter is deeply worried about these things and has in recent years 
been indirectly voting on these issues.
<p>
Now, I think that fact has benefitted my party. I obviously am a Republican. 
I served with Ronald Reagan for eight years and have been active in the 
Republican Party for a long time, and I think that, generally speaking, many
voters, particularly evangelicals in the southern United States
and Catholics in the Midwest, have tended to identify these issues
of values and culture with the Republican Party and have tended,
rightly or wrongly, to identify hostility to traditional values
with the Democratic Party.  And I think, as a result of that,
the Democrats have had a very difficult time keeping otherwise
historically loyal voting blocs in their camp.
<p>
I believe that, on through 1996 and into the next century, this is going 
to be the great debate in America.  It is going to be a debate about
liberty and how you use it, the relationship of liberty to virtue,
and it is going to be a debate about the simple question of how
it is that free men and women live their lives; and that this
is perhaps one of the most important debates that any country
and any nation can possibly have.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break. Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]

as they enter their break, has been doing over the past few months
with your money.  See you then when we return with more <i>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm Kristi Hamrick, your host.  And you might say we're going 
to have a board report today on whether the business of government, which
runs on your money, has been working for the American family.
<p>
The Family Research Council works closely with Members of Congress
working to influence key decisions that affect the family, which
is that foundational unit bound by marriage, blood, and adoption.
<p>
Today we will discuss vital issues brought before the House and
Senate, such as pro-family tax relief and the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.  We will also be looking ahead toward issues in 1996
that could adversely or positively affect the American family's
future.
<p>
First, though, let's see what Gary Bauer, president of
the Family Research Council, has to say about the monumental issues
facing us this week, both nationally and internationally.  This
is his perspective, brought to you without a journalist's bias
as a filter.  Gary Bauer instead takes you straight Behind the
Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Gary, we just saw the great &quot;train wreck&quot; here 
in Washington, D.C., over the budget, and frankly, it doesn't seem like it 
was that bad.  What is your perspective on what just happened in the
budget debate?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, this is really the great untold
story.  We had all the build-up to this incredible emergency the
country was supposed to face if Washington closed down.  Washington
did close down, and I think most Americans went about their lives
pretty much uninterrupted.
<p>
Now, there was some inconvenience. If you were a tourist here, the major 
tourist attractions were closed. I saw in the paper that the Grand Canyon 
was closed. That raised some questions in my mind:  How do you close the
Grand Canyon?
<p>
But at any rate, I think most Americans still got
their social security checks, their Veterans Affairs checks, and
so forth, and I think it actually was a lesson that there is a
lot of waste in Washington that we can do without, and most of
the world and most of America really won't notice if we make those
cuts.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It has been very interesting in the budget
debate how so many people, liberal Democrats and the <i>Washington
Post</i>, are saying, really, the Republicans and the Democrats are
so close.  If we could just be reasonable over some things like
pro-family tax relief, let's just get that off the table.  What
is your perspective on whether it is reasonable to get rid of
pro-family tax relief?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  No, that is outrageous.  I mean, when you look at the last 30 
or 35 years, the average American family has had stagnant income.  Literally, 
income growth has barely kept up with inflation.  So the average family today 
is at the same place that family was 25 years ago.
<p>
But if you look at government and their growth in resources, their growth 
has been through the roof.  They've gotten more and more money from
more and more American citizens in the form of taxes each year
than they have had the year before.
<p>
The whole country is tightening their belt; Washington is on a consumption 
spree. That is exactly backwards.  The tax cut is the one thing that ought 
to stay, and the budget cuts have to be implemented.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This Friday, Gary, you are scheduled to be on <i>Larry King Live</i>, 
talking about a political roundup, and James Carville(?), the President's 
advisor, is going to be one of the guests.  In the <i>Washington Post</i> 
this week, he was saying that this budget debate is good for Democrats.
 Do you agree with Mr. Carville?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I don't agree with Carville on much, but I understand why he is 
taking that position. Unfortunately, the polling data is showing that the 
majority of Americans, probably because of what they have been told in
the media, have sided with President Clinton's handling of this
budget crisis.
<p>
Now, Kristi, keep in mind, these are the same Americans
that, one year ago, voted overwhelmingly for fiscal responsibility,
cutting down the size of Washington, for less government, less
bureaucracy, less regulations.  And now, one year later, they
seem to be saying the exact opposite in these polls.
<p>
I don't know how all that is going to play out, but I think Carville, 
unfortunately, has some reasons to crow right now that he and the other 
handlers of President Clinton have managed to position the President to
look good in all of this; but in fact all Clinton is doing is
supporting more spending, higher taxes, and all the things that
I think most Americans are against.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Obviously, Gary, the top news story this week is Bosnia.  A 
lot of the news commentators over the weekend said that Clinton can't go to 
the Congress with budget demands and Bosnia demands and expect both to be 
met. Do you think that the budget battle puts Clinton over the barrel?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I see the argument, but I don't agree with it.  The
President has made it clear he is going to send the troops to
Bosnia regardless of what the Congress does.  So it really doesn't
make any difference what Bob Dole or Newt Gingrich say about this.
<p>
Now, it is true that the Congress could cut off funds for the
troops in Bosnia.  I quite frankly think that would be a mistake
politically as well as a mistake for those men whose lives are
on the line.  Anything you do to try to get at Clinton on this
issue will be interpreted by the President and the press as cutting
out the ground from underneath the young men and women that are
going to be put in harm's way.
<p>
So I think we need to keep being critical of the President's program on 
Bosnia. I think we need to ask hard questions.  But I also think we have to 
make it absolutely clear that once American soldiers are committed that we 
will stand behind them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What pitfalls do you see for the President
and the nation in the Bosnia conflict?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, you know, Harry Truman said a long time ago, 
&quot;The buck stops here,&quot; meaning the Presidency.  Bill Clinton 
ought to be aware of the fact that it is very easy, as Commander-in-Chief, 
to commit American soldiers in all sorts of places.  It is very hard to 
extricate them with honor once you've gotten them in a fix.
<p>
If you put 20,000 or 30,000 men on the ground in Bosnia, and a year from 
now there isn't peace, then getting out of Bosnia while maintaining the
credibility of the United States is going to be very tough, and
at that point the American people, I believe, and public opinion
generally will turn on the President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the Bosnia debate, do you think that Americans 
will be more in favor or less in favor of women in combat?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think, long term, Americans are going to be in favor of the 
ability of women to join the military and serve in support positions. But
I think once Americans see young women, their daughters, coming
home in body bags, I believe at that point public opinion will
turn against this idea of complete equality in combat of women
and men.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you very much for being with us,
Gary.  We look forward to seeing you next week.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will be joined 
by Marty Dannenfelser, who knows just about all there is to know 
about congressional happenings in Washington, and he will share that 
insight with us.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As the year comes to a close, we are that
much closer to April 15, taxes, a word that can send chills down
the spine especially for lower and middle-class families, who
often bear the brunt of our country's current tax system.
<p>
Forty years ago, the average family paid one dollar in 50 in taxes;
today, it is an average of one dollar in four, and rising.  For
that reason, advancing pro-family tax relief has been an FRC goal
since its creation in 1981.
<p>
In early 1995, the House finally passed a tax relief package containing 
key elements which benefit American families.
<p>
[Scene from the floor of the House of Representatives]
<p>
CONGRESSMAN:  When we wrote the Contract with America, we said
we agree with the American people that the Federal Government
is too big and takes too much of their hard-earned money.
<p>
The average family today pays more in taxes than it does in food,
shelter, and clothing combined.  Most households have a second
wage earner, not to support the family but to support the government.
 And, Mr. Chairman, starting today, relief is on the way.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
[Conclusion of House floor scene.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The package included:
<p><ul>
<li>The $500-per-child tax credit
<li>An adoption tax credit
<li>Marriage penalty relief
<li>A credit for the care of an elderly parent
<li>Expanded individual retirement accounts
</ul><p>
With the package, the seven-year budget resolution also passed, providing 
$353 billion in overall tax relief.  It seemed that families were on the 
road to victory.
<p>
Yet the Senate soon thwarted the House attempts and
refused to pass a tax relief package until it had been amended.
<p>
One positive element remained:  The Senate did hold onto the $500-per-child
tax credit, along with several other pro-family provisions.
<p>
It was just a few weeks ago that both houses passed the long-awaited
Balanced Budget Act of 1995.  But President Clinton chose to veto
the act, which contained much-needed family tax relief.
<p>
The train wreck happened.
<p>
The country waited to see what this conflict would
produce, and on November 19, both sides eventually committed to
enacting a seven-year balanced budget plan by the end of this
year.  But the details have yet to be announced.
<p>
Congressional Republicans consider the $500-per-child tax credit a vital 
element for providing family tax relief.  Therefore, the upcoming 
negotiations, as we count down to 1996, are crucial to the future tax relief
of American families.
<p>
With us tonight is Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's 
Assistant to the President for Government
Relations, and Marie Wheat, Legislative Director for Congressman
Steve Largent; and Rick Dearborn, Senate Liaison for the Heritage
Foundation.  They are here to discuss why we need change to our
current tax system, pro-family tax relief.
<p>
Marty has been following this closely. Frankly, why is tax relief so 
controversial?  You all have been working on it.  I know, Marie, you were 
on the Budget Committee.  What is so controversial about a little tax relief?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  I think it is about the size and scope of government.
 We want families to keep more of their money, and that is what
it is all about.  We want the government to spend less and families
to be able to keep their own money and spend it the way they like.
 Parents are better than bureaucrats at raising their own children.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  I agree.  I think it just comes down to a classic
difference between conservatives and liberals, and liberals believing
in big government and the ability to spend your money, and conservatives
and families believing in the fact that, look, it's our money
to begin with, and we would like a little bit of it back.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I have been in Washington for a long time; I know you
all have been, too.  I remember when a $500-per-child tax credit
was a pipe dream. Recently the <i>Washington Post</i> said, you know,
we could really get along if we could just get rid of that $500-per-child
tax credit.
<p>
Is it in trouble?  What kind of fight is going on on behalf of tax credits?
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  I would just offer up that I think that there is a chance that 
it could be in trouble. There is always the potential that it could be in 
trouble. I am glad to see that Dole recently came out saying that he is going
to fight for $245 billion.  Armey was asked recently, well, shouldn't
we lower the family tax relief?
<p>
His answer, I thought, was kind of classic, which is, &quot;Look, I already 
gave at the Senate.&quot; I mean, these are folks that had a $345 billion 
tax package with the Contract With America and already came down $100 billion.
 So there are problems with making sure to shore up everyone else
to keep family tax relief.
<p>
But I think with folks like Phil Gramm, in a way, because of the Presidential 
context, pushing Dole more to the right, to be conservative and hold his 
ground on this, I think that should help at least guarantee some form of 
family tax relief.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Marty, you were on the Hill so
recently before joining Family Research Council.  Do you think
from your long experience that Presidential politics are making
tax relief possible?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think it helped. Certainly there is a certain 
competition for the pro-family vote, which we feel is very healthy, and in Iowa, 
for instance, the first state, the pro-family forces are very strong, and I 
think that does give incentive to all of the candidates to be strong
advocates.
<p>
But I think, as Marie and Rick have stated, this is
a philosophical divide where these people do genuinely believe
that families are better equipped to spend that money than the
government and that families can provide for family members better
than the government.  So that is really what is driving the issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And from all of you, is that a tough case to make,
that families are better at providing?  I saw a thing on CNN this
morning where two liberals were laughing as though government
day care wasn't a good idea.  What kind of a fight are you having
to make to support the family in that context?
<p>
MS. WHEAT: What you see is that it plays well outside the beltway. It 
is the CNN pundits and the people that are on the media talk shows that
think a $500-a-child tax credit is a pipe dream or something that
they want to get off the table.
<p>
But out in real America, in our district, Steve Largent's district in 
Oklahoma, it resonates. People understand that a $500-a-child tax credit 
would let them keep more of their money and help them be able to raise their
children more effectively.
<p>
And so it is playing well.  The calls we get are in support of it 
overwhelmingly. So I think it's an inside-the-beltway versus 
outside-the-beltway, and the real people know that it's a good thing.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Do the Members of Congress feel that if they give the 
administration $200 billion of this, that it is going to go to reduce the 
deficit, or do they feel that it is going to go to spend more on various 
social programs?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  We believe absolutely that it must go -- it has to
go to cut spending.  There has to be more deficit reduction; that
there is not an offset that you can make; that we have to get
the deficit under control.  And if they want to talk about tax
cuts, if they do want to talk that way, we pay for our tax cuts
-- quote, unquote.  Any of the cuts that we made, we cut spending,
if you want to get into that lingo.  I hate to digress into that.
 But if Clinton wants to spend more, let him cut more.  That's
the bottom line.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  Right.  Yes, we would say the same thing.  I would also 
piggyback on what Marie had said about family tax relief and how it resonates, 
I think, around the country. At the Heritage Foundation, we broke it down, 
family tax relief, as far as a $500-per-child tax credit by congressional 
district and also by county, and the one thing that we noticed is when
we gave that information to the press, all the local papers across
the country would literally just rewrite all of it in their columns
saying that Kenosha County receives X million in family tax relief,
and folks would write in and say, &quot;I had no idea that that
is what this family tax relief meant.&quot;
<p>
So, I mean, people outside the beltway -- you know, I agree with Marie -- I 
think understand what $1,000 more in their pocket per year means.  It
is when we get inside the beltway and everyone up here decides
that they know how better to spend everyone else's money that
we start having the problems.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you see -- some people are trying to say the freshman class 
is going to change America.  Some people are saying they're already becoming 
inside-the-beltway types.  What is your perspective?  I mean, pro-family tax 
relief seems to indicate that they are fighting strong.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: I would say -- I do the Senate side, so I have kind of -- I 
can stand back and look and see what the House has done and compare
it to what the Senate has done.  A lot of people are saying that
the Senate is kind of the black hole for the House of Representatives,
and to a certain degree, I think they are absolutely right.  I
mean, there are some solid, good freshmen on the Senate side,
but when I see what the House does, I am just astounded that,
first of all, they are doing so much in such a short period of
time that is so revolutionary, I don't think they have a chance
to, first of all, catch their breath to become institutionalized;
and secondly, when they do start catching their breath, there
is something that happens on the Senate side that monkeys up what
they have already done on the House side, so they have to come
back and try to fix it again.
<p>
And I am not trying to be down on the Senate because, day in and day out, 
that's what I work with, are the folks on the Senate side, and there are 
some great warriors over there.  But for the most part, I think these House 
guys have just been phenomenal and really fighting hard for their 
constituents.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  So many of them came here because they were
genuinely committed to change something.  They didn't come here
to be career politicians.  They came here to get a job done, and
then they are ready to go back home to their families.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: Yes.  I mean, look how many of them have already said, 
&quot;Look, I'm doing the term limits things.  I'm a citizen legislator.
I'm going to serve my couple of terms up here and then I'm going
to go back, because I have a business back home, or I plan on
doing X back home.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That does seem to me a big change in the practical side.
<p>
We have about a minute left in our show.  What would you like people to 
understand about what has been happening here in this sausage-making process 
of tax reform, in the last minute?
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  I would say call your Congressman and call your Senator and tell 
them that you want tax cuts and that it is vital and it is important.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN: I would agree, and just say we should not be spending a dime
more on any of these programs.  You are talking $12 trillion over
the next seven years.  If anything, we should be putting that
money back in folks' pockets, and I would urge people to call.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And you think we can save the $500-per-child tax
credit, as much as it is under attack by the media, perhaps, more
than -- 
<p>
MS. WHEAT:  When Members hear, they listen.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I guess the other thing I would point out -- Marie alluded 
to it a moment ago -- is that the $500-per-child tax credit and the
other family relief has nothing to do with Medicare.  Those tax
cuts were paid for early on with some of the other discretionary
spending cuts.  Medicare is a separate issue.  That is something
that needs to be dealt with but has nothing to do with the family
tax relief.
<p>
MR. DEARBORN:  No connection whatsoever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is controversial, but I appreciate your all's help on that.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss another
pivotal and historic issue, the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.
 Stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Since the Supreme Court made the historic <i>Roe v. Wade</i> 
abortion decision in 1973, few congressional sessions have been so momentous. 
But it was a tough fight for life.
<p>
Within days of coming to office in 1992, Bill Clinton signed executive orders 
liberalizing abortion as never before.  Despite his extremely pro-abortion 
policies, the pendulum has swung back a few degrees on some key abortion 
issues.
<p>
Earlier this year, Family Research Council was a leader in the
nomination fight involving Dr. Henry Foster.  On the heels of
the controversial Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders, Clinton nominated
another radical, a Tennessee gynecologist who had worked with
and on behalf of Planned Parenthood during most of his career
and was involved in a teen sex eduction project that had resulted
in even higher teen pregnancy rates.
<p>
The Foster fight came down to the wire, and only a few Senate votes held 
off the nomination. Still, Congress had had enough of the Surgeon General's 
office. After much rancorous debate, the House voted to defund the office,
saying it was too political and unnecessary.
<p>
Also at play in the budget debate, on the House side, tremendous pro-life 
gains were made in the spending bills under consideration.  Pro-family 
leaders were able to pass more than 10 pro-life-related measures, mostly
dealing with ending or restricting federal funding for abortion.
<p>
However, the biggest pro-life loss came from a Planned Parenthood
gold mine.  Title X of the Public Health Service Act is supposed
to work on reducing teen pregnancy and promoting family planning.
 But the program enacted, favoring condom giveaways and sex advice,
has instead been connected to increases in every teen reproductive
health category, from AIDS to sexually transmitted diseases of
all kinds, to pregnancy rates.
<p>
Although the GOP-headed House Appropriations Committee was able to defund the 
failed title X program and transfer the money to another program for needy 
women and children, a floor fight led to a narrow pro-life defeat, 207-221. 
The Senate also supported the controversial title X program.  And so it 
continues.
<p>
But the biggest victories this year have been in a battle that
isn't over yet.  On November 1, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly
passed the Partial-Birth Abortion Act, H.R. 1833, by a vote of
288-139.  The historic vote was the first time since abortion
on demand was legalized in 1973 that Congress voted to ban a particular
procedure.
<p>
Doctors use the partial-birth abortion procedure beginning
at 20 weeks and all the way through full term, nine months of
pregnancy.  The baby is delivered all but the head.  If the head
came all the way out, it would be considered a human being.  A
scissors is jammed into the base of the child's skull, and living
brain matter is suctioned out.
<p>
This horrific procedure is still under consideration by the Senate, with a 
vote expected at any time.  Although the outcome is hopeful, the real 
victories have come from informing the American people about what goes on 
behind the closed doors of an abortion clinic.
<p>
Abortion has always been an extremely controversial issue, and joining me 
to discuss current changes taking place in the pro-life battle is Cathy Deeds, 
Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Family Research Council;
and Congressman-doctor Tom Coburn from Oklahoma, who, along with
other pro-life Congressmen, positively impacted the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act vote.
<p>
Thank you so much for joining us. That's a little hard to say ten times fast.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  It is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was at the news conference when you unveiled
this piece of legislation, and at the time, I thought I would
love to see it pass; I don't know if it could.  And here we are
today.  What prompted you to bring this to where it is?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, first of all, I shouldn't take credit. I just
supported the effort.  I think some very thoughtful people came
up with the idea, how do we really show the American public what
abortion is?  And this particular, the worst case of abortion
-- it is all bad, but this worst-case issue is one where we can
actually show -- you can no longer deny what is happening to human
beings and human life with this procedure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you are, as well as being a Congressman, an 
obstetrician-gynecologist, so you have certainly seen many births.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: I personally delivered 3,000 babies.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Three thousand.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  I delivered seven over the weekend, this
weekend.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A hobby.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, it's not a hobby.  I am a citizen-based 
legislator, and I don't plan on being here very long, and I want to keep 
my skills and at the same time be based in my district, based on what I
do, which is a doctor.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is fantastic.
<p>
So did you find -- one thing I found compelling, if you could tell us
a little about with the child, that in these late-term abortions,
the pain sensors in the child, they are not completely developed
in a rather horrible way.  Could you tell us a little bit about
that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  Well, I think the important thing
is that this is -- even though others would want us to think that
this is a benign procedure for the infant, both in terms of the
anesthetic that might be applied and also in terms of the maldeveloped
pain fibers, that the opposite of that is actually the case, and
there has been some controversy over the anesthetic, and it is
important that women who are listening to this understand that
we can safely give general anesthesia to a woman without harming
her baby.
<p>
Some of the testimony that has been quite inaccurate
and unfortunate, that they would put forth untruths in terms of
that, could lead women to make a poor choice about needed surgery
during their pregnancy, so they should not do that.  We can give
anesthesia safely during pregnancy.
<p>
But I think more importantly is the fact that the fetus does in fact 
experience the extreme pain associated with this; that the nerve fibers 
are developed and that the anesthesia that a woman might receive locally 
has no impact at all in terms of protecting the fetus from that.
<p>
But why would somebody worry about pain if they're talking about 
terminating their life in the first place?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  And so there is all this paradox of what are we 
talking about and how do we raise the level of awareness of this human
life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Of what happens.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Of what actually happens.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Cathy, you have been working on this a lot.  What is the 
status right now?  It has obviously passed the House, thanks to the work 
of Congressman Coburn and others.  Where are we?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  What we are talking about, obviously, as we described it, is 
such a horrible procedure. I mean, we are talking about a baby who is 
partially born, and the Supreme Court never addressed that situation when 
they legalized abortion, unfortunately.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  But I think that is why you find -- I mean, we were very, very 
pleased with the House vote.  We had 288 people voting for it.  Lots of
traditionally pro-abortion members crossed over, supported the
ban, I think because of an ad campaign that we are running, really
getting the word out about what this procedure does.  They were
seeing that this is killing a live baby while it is being born.
<p>
So that was the victory in the House, and we were very pleased
about that, and it is --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now we are to the Senate.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Yes, it's coming up in the Senate very quickly, possibly
as early as next week.  So we really have been working on the
Senators.  It is a tougher battle over there, because the Senate
has different rules, and therefore, they are able to amend the
bill, and we fear amendments that would weaken or gut the bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As a citizen legislator, are you a little surprised
by the difference in the rules between -- especially when it comes
to a horrific thing like this, partial-birth abortions?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Well, I would say, as one of the freshman Members 
of Congress, I have lots of disappointment in the rules of the Senate,
not necessarily in the Senators that are supporting some of these
critical issues for our country.
<p>
But what we need to do is to change the Senate, in my opinion, and to try 
to get people that are reflective of what our society's views are today. 
<p>
The real issue is, not very many people can say that it is okay to perform
a partial-birth abortion if in fact you know what it is, and the
real issue around abortion is let's not know what it is; therefore,
we don't have to deal with it.  And that is what is so important
about this ban.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, that was what was so interesting
during the floor debate on that, where one of the first things
out was Pat Schroeder trying to say, &quot;Let's not show what
we're talking about.&quot;
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the very first vote out of the box had to be, Oh,
this is what we're talking about; these are the pictures.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  To be on the charts.  There were big charts blown up for
people that may have not seen that.
<p>
But that is what -- I mean, I just need to commend Congressman Coburn 
because he has been such a leader, but especially to have a doctor, a 
practicing doctor, up there, even though this is not, of course, a recognized 
medical procedure, especially the partial birth.  All abortions we don't
think would be recognized, but to have you up there -- and I know
you talked to a lot of Members and Senator Frist on the Senate
side.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  I think that is helpful to some of the Members.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: I think the other thing that is important, if I 
deliver a child that is 24, 26 weeks, I am obligated as a physician to
do everything I can to keep that child alive.  And we take the
same child, turn it around in the womb, and pull its feet out
and its body out and then puncture its cranium and suck its brains
out and say that never was alive.
<p>
There is a tremendous paradox. You know, the tension has to build on that, 
and that is why I am very thankful, not so much that we passed this bill, 
that the American public is now willing to look at what we really do when
we abort babies.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think that has been the biggest victory, frankly, the fact 
that we are just talking about late-term abortions. Yes, they happen; in 
fact, 77 percent of the American people think there aren't abortions past 
the first three months, the first trimester.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  We should say -- I mean, of course, we in the Family Research 
Council and all the pro-life groups, we are opposed to all abortions. I 
mean, every abortion takes an innocent human life.  This particular abortion 
procedure is so heinous, as we talked about, but it is a starting point.
<p>
As we can see, we did get an overwhelming number in the House, and
we hope, we assume, that the Senate will follow along with that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we may see a Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act
come up in the Senate as early as Monday.  What do you think,
looking to the next session of Congress, Cathy and Congressman
Coburn, what kind of pro-life activity do you think might come
up next session?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  Go ahead, Cathy.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, I mean, certainly, as the little piece mentioned,
we certainly have ongoing, unfortunately, ongoing pro-life battles,
mainly in the funding bills that fund Congress to get abortion
restrictions.  We will probably still have to continue with those,
hopefully maybe make some of those permanent, because right now
they are an annual fight, since these are annual funding bills.
<p>
I think we are talking with pro-life leaders and other pro-life
groups about looking at some other proactive or offensive-type
measures that get at the heart of the abortion procedure, other
types of limits.  We are talking about those, but definitely we
would certainly like to be more on the offensive, but we do have
a pro-abortion President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, we do.
<p>
MS. DEEDS: So we do have a difficult time.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  We also -- we have an absolute epidemic with 
sexually transmitted diseases.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, we do.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: And although there, unfortunately, are not many 
forward-looking studies on the teaching that we now teach through title X 
funding, the retrospective analysis of that is that every state that spends 
more money on that has a higher incidence of teenage pregnancy, a higher 
incidence of unwanted pregnancy, a higher incidence of abortion, and a higher
incidence of HIV infection and --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It tracks the money.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN:  What it does is it tracks a loosening
of moral values.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE COBURN: It gives a false sense of security.  The question to 
be asked is, when you go to doctors' groups who think that our policy is 
fine on AIDS, and you say, &quot;What's the best medical advice that
you would give your patient to prevent them from having a sexually
transmitted disease or getting pregnant or getting HIV?&quot;
they would say abstinence.  Why is that not our national policy
if that is the best medical advice?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is the best medical advice from a doctor, and I hope you all 
were listening. Pleased stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i> following this commercial break.  We will look ahead 
toward issues that face Congress in 1996.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I am now joined by Jacqueline Halbig,
FRC's Congressional Liaison; Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal
Studies; and back with us is Marty Dannenfelser.  Thank you for
joining me.  I don't feel like I get to see enough of you all,
because everyone is running around all the time, and we're looking
ahead, what is going to happen next?
<p>
Cathy, we haven't talked to you.  We are actually going to be doing a whole 
show on your area in January.  But you are working on some pivotal projects.
 Tell us a little bit about what you see ahead in 1996.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Right.  I see a lot in the area of religious liberty.  I think
that is foremost in Americans' minds right now.  We have a state
of religious discrimination, and Congressman Hyde and Congressman
Istook are both working toward solving that problem by a Constitutional
amendment.  I think it is going to be a very interesting first
part of 1996 in terms of religious liberty.
<p>
Also, we see parental rights, a huge issue; very important to parents to get 
the government bureaucracies to play second in terms of who should decide how
to raise your children.  That is going to be a key issue, and
I also see that in early 1996.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What is kind of ironic about the Religious Equality or Religious 
Liberty Act is that a lot of people think, doesn't the First Amendment already 
give me those kinds of rights?  What is your answer to that?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, it does, absolutely.  The problem we are seeing is that
the Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment in such
a way that the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment mandates
discrimination against religious people or religious organizations.
<p>
That is not what our founding fathers intended, and that is not
what the literal language of the First Amendment would have us
see.  But we see, since the 1950s, increasingly, a sort of trend
by the Supreme Court in this misconstruction of the First Amendment.
 So a Religious Liberties Amendment would not change the First
Amendment; it would, rather, correct these misinterpretations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Legislatively speaking, Marty, what is going to
need to happen to get this kind of religious liberties ball rolling?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, we're starting the ball towards hearings.
 There have been some hearings in the House and Senate so far,
and Congressmen Hyde and Istook have now introduced some amendments,
and they are going to be looking at hearings very soon, perhaps
before the end of the year, and then by early next year actually
moving the legislation in committee.  So we are going to have
to have a push at the grass-roots level to try to get positive
action.
<p>
But we do have some very good friends in people like Congressman
Canady, the subcommittee chairman, Congressman Hyde, and Congressman
Istook and others who are pushing for this.  So we are optimistic
about coming together and moving that legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you see a lot of support for it on the Hill?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes.  Yes, there is very strong support.  I think that 
particularly this new Congress is very committed to the idea of families 
and religious faith.  They are realizing that people's religious faith
is so instrumental in framing their values, in framing what is
best for society, and that religion should not be put on the back
burner, should not be treated unfairly vis-a-vis every other type
of expression.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is the kind of thing that comes up, just this week, a woman 
selling her son to pay a drug debt; last week, a woman cutting out a child of 
another woman because she wants a baby; and people say, how did we get this 
far? And it seems to be a lack of values and faith-based values.
<p>
Now, you are going to work on that, I know, Jacqueline, but what other
issues?  You are working on the Senate side, the House side. 
What issues are you tracking and do you see coming up?
<p>
MS. HALBIG: Well, I am concentrating on education reform as being a big 
issue in the second term of this session, and it is pretty exciting.
 We have before us -- our big goal with FRC is to repeal the federal
role in education -- and we have before us a few bills that will
tackle that.  One, in its embryonic stage, would get rid of the
Department of Education, and that is a first step.
<p>
But probably the biggest obstacle we have to this is President Clinton. 
If we can get through the House and Senate a bill that will get rid
of the Department of Education, we can pretty much expect that
it will be vetoed by President Clinton.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  But why would we want to get rid of the Department of 
Education? Some people say we need more standards, not less.  Don't we 
need a federal role?
<p>
MS. HALBIG:  Well, it's interesting.  Ever since the inception of the 
Department of Education, we have seen nothing but a decline in education. 
I mean, that is where all the studies came up that said, &quot;Oh, my 
goodness, we can't even compete with Germany and Japan anymore,&quot; and 
how interesting that that has all happened since the inception of the 
Department of Education.
<p>
So, clearly, education has declined since we have had a federal department. 
So to give power back to the local schools and parents is really where it's 
at.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I remember campaigning for Reagan in 1970-something, and we 
were talking about getting some changes in education.  Marty, you have been
around Washington, I hope, longer than me.  What do you think?
 Can we do that?  We have about 30 seconds left.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I think it is going to be very difficult to achieve those 
changes on Clinton's watch, but we have to begin framing the issues and
moving them through Congress and then explaining them to the general
public, and these things will grow as the public understands.
 A lot of this is tied together, empowering parents, not bureaucrats.
 Parental rights legislation, reform of education -- there is
so much from the philosophy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So it is a values-based approach to the problems of, hopefully, 
the next century as we are nearing that point.
<p>
We are going to plan on having shows on all of these actually coming up, 
religious liberty in particular. One last thing as we are looking forward to 
a new session. I understand that Patricia Schroeder just said that she is not 
going to be back next time, and not the biggest pro-family advocate
we have ever had. Marty, what is your one thing that you would
say about Pat Schroeder?  Oh, well, sorry, we have to go.  But
we want to hear that.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Okay.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will take a look at the 
Family Research Council's press conference that took Banned Books Week by 
surprise. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. FRC staff consistently 
is working on projects that will move the public debate beyond simple 
rhetoric. Charles Donovan, an FRC senior policy analyst, had the chance to do 
just that in a groundbreaking study that checked out liberal allegations
of book banning.
<p>
The report was released during National Banned Books Week in a September 
news conference, and it answers the question, Are classic literary works 
really being banned from libraries? Let's find out as <i>Straight Talk</i> 
brings you Home Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I am Kristi Hamrick, the Director of Communications for the 
Family Research Council, and we are very excited to have this opportunity,
as Paul Harvey would say, to &quot;tell the rest of the story.&quot;
<p>
This whole idea of censorship and banning books and some kind
of a hostile image of pro-family America, for the rest of America,
is not only laughable; it is not statistical.  I think we have
two good indications of what a pro-family America sees today happening
in our culture among the Banned Books Week concept.  We will have
some original research.  We will have some people talking about
their experience.
<p>
DR. DONOVAN: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
I don't know whether it was our decision in Family Research Council or the 
National Press Club's. Of course, we are meeting in the First Amendment 
Room this morning, which is totally appropriate.
<p>
Before I get into a little bit of my statement, which I will try to keep 
brief because we are going a little long, I will say that if the
ALA had control of the Second Amendment and not the first, every
child would have a gun.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
It is a pleasure to be with you here this morning and to release the results 
of a survey conducted by Family Research Council.  It is an 18-month-long 
project that I undertook with a colleague of mine, William T. Spont.  Our 
basic qualifications are that we love books.
<p>
We noticed a trend, based on personal observation and talking with 
booksellers in New England, whereby a continuing number, an increasing number, 
in our view, of classic works of literature are finding their way into library
discard bins, book sales, used book stores, and the like.
<p>
We had one particular case where we were in a conversation with a New
England bookseller, major bookseller, and she showed us a volume
that was obtained from a library discard.  It was a $600 book
on the commercial market, essentially a rare book which the library
had for some reason chosen to dispense with.
<p>
That and a number of other impressions about the &quot;dumbing down&quot; 
of education and potentially the dumbing down of libraries struck us with 
the idea of conducting a national survey, which is what we did.  We
compiled a list of 100 major classic books of literature.  They
span a wide variety of topics:  art, architecture, literature
-- that is to say, fiction -- science, philosophy.
<p>
We took that list and sent it to over 500 libraries across the United 
States in all 50 states.  The only libraries we excluded -- and we are
talking public libraries -- the only libraries we excluded were
the very largest urban libraries:  Boston, Detroit, Chicago, and
so forth.  We presumed, based on some evidence, that they would
have the vast preponderance of these books.
<p>
We conducted a pilot survey in Massachusetts to test the list.  We also 
sent it to a couple of very good small collections in New England to verify
that the list was an achievable list.  We found that these small
collections both had a very high proportion of the books, approximately
80 percent.
<p>
We then waited for results.  It took two mailings.
 We got 204 responses from 49 states.  We promised -- I should
mention this -- we promised the individual libraries anonymity,
first of all because we don't want to be seen as critiquing or
criticizing any particular institution; secondly is the practical
concern that we wanted to encourage their cooperation.
<p>
I want to praise the libraries for their diligence in responding to 
us. A 40 percent response rate to any mailing nationally is extremely
good.
<p>
But these are very serious people in the libraries.  They
are very concerned about their collections, and a number of them
-- and these really are getting to our results -- a number of
them acknowledged to us in writing, in written comments on the
survey, that in fact classics do tend to disappear over time.
<p>
We found that, on average, the national average for libraries
other than urban libraries was something like 36 of 100 books.
 At least six libraries told us that as a result of our survey,
they went out and purchased books which they believed were on
their shelves at one time but that had disappeared.
<p>
Now, our basic point is not that there is book banning with respect to 
classics. In fact, this illustration of what is happening to classics 
illustrates how you can use the term &quot;banning&quot; quite loosely. 
We would not apply the term &quot;banning&quot; to these books.
<p>
What is happening -- we think it is of much more significant social
interest than many of the other controversies about literature
today -- is what we would call disappearing books.  In fact, we
think it would be more appropriate to have a disappearing high
education in the humanities week in the United States than to
have controversies week-long about whether or not public libraries
should buy Madonna's <i>Sex</i>.
<p>
In any event, let me give you a couple of examples. Einstein. Fifty-four 
percent of the libraries had Einstein's major work on relatively.  A 
similar proportion had Darwin's book on evolution, <i>The Voyage of the HMS 
Beagle</i>. The major works by Kepler on Copernican astronomy, 30 percent. 
Russo's <i>Social Contract</i>, one of the most important bases for the 
understanding of social policy in a democracy, under 50 percent.
<p>
What is happening to these books?  A variety of things happen to them. 
They deteriorate over time.  Books break down; they are discarded.  Some 
are not recognized by librarians as being important to the culture or
as being commercially valuable.  They are put on the discard or
what they call the deselection list.
<p>
Some are stolen. We have one incident with respect to the information raised 
by Focus onthe Family that was a case of theft.  Theft does happen.
<p>
So we concluded in our report that classics are especially subject to
deterioration; that in a time of constricted library budgets --
and I don't know whether they are constricted or not; it is a
point of fact that many libraries say they are -- it makes the
most sense for libraries not to discard some of the most important
works in their collection.
<p>
We recommend a number of steps be taken to reverse this.  First would 
be what we are doing here this morning, more media attention to the fact 
that there is a dumbing down of our libraries taking place.  And we also 
recommend what many librarians told me that they -- and we surveyed many 
of them by phone -- what they really find valuable.  They prize a cooperative
spirit in the community.  They see themselves as servants of the
community.
<p>
The vast majority of librarians are not presenting
<i>Playboy</i> to children, and they have no apologies about it.  They
are not buying it, or if they are buying it, they are putting
it on a reserve shelf.
<p>
So the vast majority of librarians we talked to are very concerned 
about this problem.  They want citizen cooperation. They love people 
who come in and who love books, and they rely heavily not on academic 
groups but on individuals who are simply widely read, many of whom -- 
one librarian told us he dealt with his classics problem by a fellow in 
the community who just loves philosophy.  He said, &quot;Well, go into the 
shelves. Tell me what I've got; tell me what I'm missing.&quot;  The gentleman
came back and gave him a list of major works in philosophy that
were missing.  He went out and bought them.
<p>
This is the way libraries are meant to work: to use all of the expertise of 
the community, to be sensitive to the values of the people in the community,
to make cooperative decisions.  And I want to say in closing that
most libraries do a very, very good job.  Most parents are very,
very concerned about their children.  Most of us, nearly all of
us, are concerned about educational quality.  If we are concerned
about those things, we will not complain about parents who care.
 We will do more to restore and strengthen our library collections.
<p>
Thank you very much.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight we're going to ask some tough questions about sex and sexual 
politics. Does it matter whether people engage in heterosexual or homosexual 
sex? What does the research reveal?
<p>
Family Research Council examines a broad spectrum of issues
that affect families today.  One of the most controversial is
homosexuality.  Today homosexuals and lesbian activists are a
powerful force in government and in the media worldwide.  At the
heart of the debate is an effort to change the historical definition
of family, from that foundational unit bound by marriage, blood,
and adoption to any kind of relationship.
<p>
Tonight's show will focus on the current status of the homosexual agenda. 
In particular, we will look at the United States armed forces, which was 
highlighted in a key court battle just yesterday.  But more about that 
later in the show.
<p>
First, let's hear what Gary Bauer, president of the
Family Research Council, has to say about another critical issue
featured in the news during the past few weeks:  Bosnia.  Could
President Clinton's peacekeeping mission shape the world's future
in a drastic way?  Gary Bauer provides you with his perspective,
unedited by the media, as he takes you behind the headlines. 
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This week one of the biggest news items is Bosnia.  What 
pitfalls do you see for the President and the nation in the Bosnia conflict?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, you know, Harry Truman had said a long time ago,
&quot;The buck stops here,&quot; meaning the Presidency.  Bill
Clinton ought to be aware of the fact that it is very easy as
commander-in-chief to commit American soldiers in all sorts of
places.  It is very hard to extricate them with honor once you've
gotten them in a fix.
<p>
If you put 20,000 or 30,000 men on the ground in Bosnia, and a year 
from now there isn't peace, then getting out of Bosnia while maintaining 
the credibility of the United States is going to be very tough; and at that 
point the American people, I believe, and public opinion generally will 
turn on the President.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that this will bring the
women-in-combat issue to a head again here in the United States
debate?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  It will raise the women-in-combat issue again.
 I have noticed that almost every press story filed in the last
couple of weeks manages to show a woman in uniform.  I think,
if you have women in the service on the ground in Bosnia who end
up dying in combat or dying in accidents or become the targets
of terrorists, that you could have another whole debate in the
country about the appropriate role of women in combat, which is
a debate, I think, that is long overdue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of the Bosnia debate, do you think that 
Americans will be more in favor or less in favor of women in combat?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think, long term, Americans are going to be in favor of the
ability of women to join the military and serve in support positions.
 But I think once Americans see young women, their daughters,
coming home in body bags, whether it is in Bosnia or the Middle
East or some future conflict that we are not aware of, I believe
at that point public opinion will turn against this idea of complete
equality in combat of women and men.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Another big news item internationally is Ireland and the 
divorce debate. What do you think will happen to Ireland now that they have 
approved divorce by a very narrow margin?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, if I were Ireland, I certainly would hesitate before I 
would go down the road that the rest of the West has taken in the last 30 
years. No-fault divorce was hailed in the United States 20 years ago as a 
great advance.  What now we know looking back on it is that no-fault
divorce has resulted in a lot of abandoned women and children.
 And it is harder to get out of a contract with a lawn service
company than it is to get out of a contract with your spouse.
<p>
I think Ireland made a mistake.  That was a very narrow vote.
 The other interesting thing about that vote is that every major
political party in Ireland, every major newspaper, supported liberalizing
the divorce laws.  And yet with all of the establishment saying,
&quot;Vote yes,&quot; only barely half of the country voted that
way.  Half of the country had no representation whatsoever.
<p>
So I think there are still a lot of traditional-values people in
countries like Ireland, certainly here in the United States, and
I think that we still have a chance of seeing a rebirth of traditional
values, in contrast to the vote that took place.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Family Research Council released a poll where the number 
one finding was that people believe that because of the moral decline,
the country is in real trouble.  There is a very tragic story
about a woman who sold her son because of a $2,000 drug debt.
 What do you think this situation says about the direction America
is headed?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, this is the outrage of the week,
right?  I mean, almost every week, there is some horrific story
that, just a few years ago, would have been unimaginable.  The
week before this, it was the story out of Illinois about these
thugs literally cutting a baby out of a woman that they murdered.
 Before that, you had Susan Smith sending her children to the
bottom of the lake.
<p>
You know, people come with all kinds of explanations.
 Some people say it's government programs causing these things.
 Other people say it's heartless social policies, or it's poverty
or whatever.  I don't believe it's any of those things.  I think
it is evidence -- all these things are evidence of a country that
has drifted away from its basic belief in God and from a basic
embrace of traditional values.
<p>
Now, when a culture does that, all through history, whether it was ancient 
Rome or ancient Greece or America in 1995, there's a terrible price to pay, 
and we're paying that price now.  Hopefully, Americans will see these things
and rethink the trends of the last 30 years.  But for now, we
are going to continue to reap a terrible whirlwind of tragedy,
family breakup, and horrors that we are already beginning to see
on a daily basis in the newspapers.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Anthony 
Falzarano, a former homosexual who has devoted his life to ministering to 
the homosexual community.  Stay with us as Anthony brings us his perspective
on the cultural struggle taking place.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  For thousands of years, homosexuality has been discouraged
in cultures the world over.  Experience, common sense, and considerable
medical evidence show that homosexuality is immoral, unhealthy,
and destructive to individuals, families, and societies.
<p>
So why is America seeing homosexual activism on so many levels?  Why
are homosexuals featured on network TV comedies?  Why are homosexuals
featured on news broadcasts and in newspapers and magazines all
over America?  Why are they so loudly pressing for gay marriage,
gay adoption of children, gays in the military, and special civil
rights?
<p>
The short answer is that this did not happen by accident.
 Gay activists have waged a 40-year campaign to change the culture,
aided by a willing media.
<p>
In 1948 and in 1953, Alfred Kinsey released his famous Kinsey reports on 
male and female homosexuality. Kinsey made the case that homosexuality was 
widespread and not much different from normal sexuality.
<p>
In 1950 the first American homosexual activist group, the Medishien(?) 
Society, was formed. Citing Kinsey and producing many unscientific but 
well-publicized studies about homosexuals, activists began working to change the
moral consensus about homosexuality.
<p>
In the 1950s, UCLA psychologist Evelyn Hooker did three studies comparing a 
group of 30 homosexual men with 30 heterosexual men.  Although that study 
showed clear psychological differences, gay activists and the media have 
misreported the studies as showing that somehow homosexuality is normal.
<p>
The next big steppingstone came in 1973.  After a campaign of intimidation,
the American Psychiatric Association removed homosexuality from
its list of disorders.  The gay lobby within the APA is now trying
to criminalize psychological therapy for those seeking to leave
the lifestyle.
<p>
At the same time, aggressive lobbying extended to more than just organizations. 
It became political, at the grass roots, city by city, state by state. Sodomy 
laws have been swept from the books in more than 25 states.  Gay rights laws
have been passed in nine states and in more than 100 cities. 
Gays are bringing court cases seeking to adopt children, to marry,
and to serve in the military.
<p>
MILITARY OFFICER:  The military's policy on homosexuality does a great 
injustice to the thousands of military personnel who are highly trained, 
dedicated, loyal, and who also happen to be gay.  This policy must be changed 
now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In all of these efforts, activists have employed
a flood of bad studies which we can only call gay science.  Here
are the claims:
<p><ul>
<li>Ten percent of the population is homosexual.
<li>Homosexuality is genetic.
<li>Gays comprise a third of all youth suicides.
<li>Gays are a major target of hate crimes.
</ul><p>
Although none of these has been verified by reliable science, media 
reports have persuaded many people that they have.
<p>
Last week an activist group -- Parents, Family and Friends of Lesbians and 
Gays -- launched a $1 million advertising campaign to vilify people who 
oppose the homosexual agenda.  The TV ads feature scenes of gays being
beaten, with the image changing to the face of Pat Robertson,
Jerry Falwell, and other opponents of homosexual activism.
<p>
The intent is to say that anyone opposing gay activism directly causes
hateful physical attacks on gays.  The intent is to silence all
critics.
<p>
Homosexual and lesbian activists have made it clear in
recent days that they are in this fight to change the world --
from one that values and cherishes home, family, and heterosexual
marriage as the cornerstone of society to one that says anything
goes.
<p>
With us tonight is Anthony Falzarano, executive director
of Transformation Ex-Gay Christian Ministries.  Anthony himself
has been transformed after rejecting a long-time homosexual lifestyle,
and he is here to bring you his testimony and practical insights
regarding today's homosexual community.
<p>
Thank you very much for joining us, Anthony.  You are working with an 
excellent organization and running an excellent group here in Washington, 
D.C., that works with homosexuals, talking to them about what's true. 
There are a lot of messages out there.  What do you see as some of the
biggest pieces of propaganda in the homosexual debate today?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Oh, the number one piece of propaganda that is being
pushed on America today is that people are born gay and that there
is a genetic predisposition to homosexuality, and that is not
true.  There is nothing out there, Kristi, that proves that. 
There is not one bit of information.
<p>
I am a former homosexual. I was gay for nine years until I came to Christ 
and got help from a national organization called Exodus International, and
they helped me leave the gay lifestyle behind successfully.  I
am now married and I have two children, and I have been married
for 12 years, and I am living proof that you are not born gay.
 We are currently helping about 6,000 former homosexuals within
the ex-gay network.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And from your experience both inside and out of the lifestyle, 
do you see an aggressive, or more aggressive, push today, or have you seen 
an accumulation of efforts to bring us to the place where we are, especially 
like, for example, in the military?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, the gays in general, they are highly organized.  They 
are much more organized than the church in America.  They are much more 
organized than our government.  They are real grass roots.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Why is that?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, it's real simple.  They don't typically
have wives and children to go home to at night, and they can work
14, 15 hours a day, and they are very organized and very determined,
and they are fighting for their lives right now.
<p>
In the military, with the Clinton Administration now, they are just getting 
license to push homosexuality into the military.  They have been in the
military for years, and they have been underground, thank God,
but now with the Clinton Administration they are just coming out
of the closet in the military, and we are heading for a disaster.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You actually were part of some of the efforts to
talk to the American Psychiatric Association.  Do you see that
as being in recent history one of the more disastrous changes
that took place?  Because what it said was, We're going to now
say that this is just a normal condition.  You actually went there
recently.  What has been your involvement with that, and what
have you found?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, what is really under attack
is authority in this country.  Basically, the American Psychiatric
Association, in 1993, was lobbied by the gay activists, the insurance
industry in our country, to push homosexuality out of the DSM-III,
which is the official digest of psychological disorders.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What's in it for them, though?  Why do you think they would 
do something like that?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's real simple.  Basically, if they want gay rights, 
and if they can erase from the books that homosexuality is a neurosis, 
that it is a disturbance, then they can claim that they actually are a 
minority, that they are actually born this way, and, as if you are a woman 
or a Jewish person or a Catholic, that you should be able to be protected
under our Constitution.  That is their motivation.
<p>
What happened was, the reason the American Psychiatric Association was 
lobbied by the insurance industry is because if you go for sexual 
reorientation counseling, it takes six months to two years to walk out of 
homosexuality successfully, and we are talking maybe $100 a session.  You 
are talking about $10,000 by the time somebody walks out of homosexuality.
<p>
If they give gay affirmative counseling, that is six or seven
sessions with a psychologist or a psychologist --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To tell you that you're fine.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: -- to tell you you're fine, there's nothing wrong with you; 
you went to the gay lifestyle.
<p>
Well, that happened in 1973.  Now it is blowing up in the insurance industry's 
face because now, before somebody dies of AIDS, they are spending about 
$250,000 a patient before this person dies of AIDS.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When you're looking at talking with a person who is in a 
homosexual lifestyle, in particular, I understand you are talking about 
sexual identity disorder, that there are roots to homosexuality and lesbianism 
inside of a person in their life.  What is sexual identity disorder?  What are 
you seeing?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  Well, 80 percent of the people that come
to Transformation Ministries in Washington, D.C., have been sexually
molested and/or raped as children.  We see that.  We take an informal
poll every six months, and the data is accurate.  It keeps coming
up constant, somewhere between 70 to 80 percent.
<p>
We see the male homosexual did not bond with his father.  We see the lesbian 
did not bond with the mother.  So we see non-bonding with the same-sex
parent over and over again.  We see high levels of divorce, high
levels of alcoholism, very, very dysfunctional family situations.
<p>
I don't know why this is not being reported to the media, other
than there is a 6,000-member gay journalists' organization now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  You know, the gays are in control in Hollywood; they are in 
control of television; they are in key positions at the <i>Washington 
Post</i> now; and they watch everything that is coming into the newspaper 
or television and radio, and they are editing it out.
<p>
A reporter from the <i>Washington Post</i> came to our ministry six years 
ago. He wanted to do a story on us.  After the meeting, he said, 
&quot;This is fantastic. This is news.  We're going to do a story in the 
<i>Post</i> on it.&quot;
<p>
He calls me the next morning.  He says, &quot;Anthony, 
I hate to tell you this, but we can't do the story.&quot;  And I said,
&quot;What happened in the last 12 hours?  You were so excited
last night.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: He said, &quot;My editor's a lesbian, and she killed the 
story.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There is a lot of one-sided telling of the story of
homosexuality and lesbianism as we have researched, at Family
Research Council, the literature.  One of the big projects that
we did was the Ten Percent Project, which took a look at the research,
the good research which said 1 to 2 percent of the population
was gay at best compared to 10 to 20 that the homosexuals were
talking about.
<p>
One of the things that is missing today, though, is an analysis of the 
good scientific data on homosexuality and lesbianism.  What are you seeing? 
I know we are seeing a repetitive message that it's genetic.  What's your 
answer to the &quot;it's genetic&quot; statement?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO:  It's an absolute lie that comes from the pit of hell. 
Basically, we are seeing many people come through Exodus and walk successfully 
out of a homosexual disorientation.  We see them going on to marriage.  We see 
them having children.  We see them out of the lifestyle 10, 15, 20
years.  I have been out of the lifestyle totally now for 12 years.
 I mean, it's doable.  It's hard.  It's the equivalent of coming
off of heroin.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What does it take?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: I mean, you are really turning your life totally over to 
Jesus Christ to realize that you need this higher power -- and I call
my higher power Jesus Christ -- to walk successfully out of a
lifestyle that basically permeates your entire being.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it is more than like a 12-step program.  To leave the 
lifestyle does require that looking outside of yourself.
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes, finding out the root causes, what happened to you as 
a child; putting together a puzzle of dysfunction in your early upbringing;
finding out what happened with the relationship between you and
your same-sex parent; submitting your fleshly addictions.  Many
homosexuals are addicted to pornography, masturbation, promiscuous
sex.
<p>
I mean, I had a guy in the ministry who had sex with over
5,000 partners, and he was 32 years old.  Now, that is an extreme.
 Many people that come to Transformation and Exodus-type ministries
have never had a sexual encounter, just suffer with the fantasy
and pornography part of it.
<p>
We help all kinds of people.  We help people who are prostitutes, who are 
homosexual prostitutes. But what we see over and over again -- sexual 
addiction, sexual molestation early in youth, and we see brokenness with 
the same-sex parent and great, great dysfunction in the family unit, the 
upbringing.
<p>
And the devil is attacking the family.  He is trying to destroy
the family now, and we must keep our families together.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And that's at the heart of it, isn't it?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's an attack on the family. Today it would seem
that what we are doing is we are looking at redefining the family
to include anything that a person might be involved in.
<p>
But for someone that wants more information about your organization, could
you give us a couple of phone numbers?
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Yes, absolutely. I think the Exodus number will be appearing 
on the screen. But we are in San Raphael, California, the national ministry 
called Exodus.  It is area code 415 454-1017.  Transformation in Washington
is area code 202 371-0800.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And for someone who wants a little bit more information, Anthony, 
what would you say to the person who is -- we've got just a couple of seconds 
left -- who is considering a homosexual lifestyle and wonders if they're
gay?  In 15 seconds, what would you say to that person?  &quot;What
if I'm gay?&quot;
<p>
MR. FALZARANO: Don't believe the lie. Yes, you are struggling with a 
homosexual disorientation. But think of yourself as a man or woman struggling 
with homosexuality disorientation; don't think of yourself as gay.  There is 
quite a distinction between being homosexual and gay.  Homosexual means I 
suffer with this. Gay means coming out of the closet.  Before you come out
of the closet, get some help from Exodus International.  You don't
have to be gay.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for being with us, Anthony.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss a pivotal
and possibly historic event which occurred just yesterday as the
Family Research Council presented evidence denouncing the involvement
of homosexuals in the military in a court case.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  December 5, 1995, could be recognized
as a significant date in the battle over homosexuals serving openly
in the military.  On this date the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>
was heard before the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond,
Virginia.  Family Research Council was granted permission, in
an unprecedented decision, to present oral arguments along with
the Justice Department in this case over the dismissal of Navy
Lieutenant Paul G. Thomasson, a self-identified homosexual.
<p>
LT. THOMASSON: This policy that tells gay and lesbian service members
that they can go in harm's way for their country but that they
can't &quot;come out&quot; and try to dispel the stereotypes or
overcome the prejudice with which they suffer is absolutely inimical
to the very Constitution that they've all sworn to defend.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  He is one of several servicemen who has highlighted
problems with the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; standard.
<p>
Within days of coming to office, the Clinton Administration began
promoting homosexuals and lesbians for open service in the military,
despite a long military history that barred such service because
of its impact on military order and effectiveness.
<p>
In 1993, Congress passed a clear law that prohibited homosexuals and 
lesbians from serving.  But the &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations were written to implement the law, and they made the standard
unclear, some say deliberately so, to encourage lawsuits that
attack the law itself.
<p>
ACLU SPOKESWOMAN: For over two decades, the ACLU has worked in the courts to 
bring about change in our nation's policy on the service of lesbian and gay 
Americans, and for the past six months, the ACLU Washington office has played
a leadership role in working with the administration and Congress
to develop a plan that would usher in a new day of freedom for
these service members while ensuring the readiness of our nation's
defense.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Family Research Council was allowed to
testify after arguing that the Justice Department was not going
to uphold the law, which would be their traditional role, but
instead, they were going to argue that the vague standard, &quot;don't
ask, don't tell,&quot; would fulfill the requirements.
<p>
That would mean that both the plaintiff, Lieutenant Thomasson, and the 
Justice Department would essentially be on the same side.  And so the
Family Research Council stepped in to make the case for the legal
standard.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  I was pleased with essentially what
Professor Woodruff said, because he really set the agenda straight,
and that is that there is a distinction between what the directives
say and what the law says.  The laws are very clear in regard
to this whole issue that homosexuals should not serve.  What the
directives have done, what the Clinton Administration has done,
is contrary to what the American people have long wanted, and
that is to not allow homosexuals to serve.
<p>
And so I feel very good that Professor Woodruff really drew the line in 
the sand for the American people today, representing not only the American
people but the United States Congress.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Each side says that they are confident that they will be the 
victor.
<p>
REPORTER: Are you going to appeal if you lose?
<p>
LT. THOMASSON:  We're not planning to lose.
<p>
FEMALE:  And that's why I'm very confident that
the government side will win, because the implementing or the
augmenting argument from FRC will be helpful in that regard.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And both sides agree on one thing:  No matter which
way the ruling goes, this pivotal case will move on to the Supreme
Court.
<p>
With us now are two individuals who have been at the forefront
of the battle against homosexuals getting involved in the military
in service.  I would like to welcome Lt. Col. Bob Maginnis, a
policy analyst with the Family Research Council, and Melissa Wells-Petry,
an attorney for Family Research Council who has represented FRC
in several court cases.  Thank you so much for joining us.
<p>
You all were obviously both in Richmond yesterday.  What is so pivotal
about this particular case?  Why does this one matter so much?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, this is the first time an amicus, such
as us, was allowed to argue in federal court to point out the
obvious, that the Clinton Administration is not enforcing the
law that passed Congress back in 1993, and that is ludicrous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I used to actually be a reporter covering the courts.
 I've never seen an outside amicus of any kind be allowed to speak.
 I don't know.  Melissa, you're an attorney.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: It's a very unusual situation.  It does happen, but very 
unusually. And there are a lot of unusual things about this case, not to
mention what you brought up in the beginning, is that essentially
the homosexual activist community and the Clinton Justice Department
are taking a united front, and they are going into court and saying
the policy allows homosexuals to serve.  And, actually, the law
does not allow homosexuals to serve, and it has been our role,
it has fallen to us say, &quot;What part of 'No' don't you 
understand?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, when the law was written, Congress was, in
essence, attempting to make it clear after Bill Clinton came to
office, &quot;You're talking within days of getting here about
gays in the military; we're saying that open homosexual service
is a problem.  Here's the law.&quot;
<p>
Why did it even go this far?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, back in the summer of 1993, President
Clinton, as you showed in your video, announced his policy from
the stage at Fort McNair.  It was don't ask, don't tell.  And
then when the law took effect, the law basically took the longstanding
bar against homosexual service and it just codified it; it made
it a law.  And the distinction between what Clinton said at Fort
McNair and what the law says are really night and day in terms
of who should serve.
<p>
The Clintons have created special classes of homosexuals, those homosexuals 
that will remain, quote, celibate and those homosexuals that engage in what 
homosexuals do. And the law doesn't talk about it.  It says all homosexuals 
are homosexuals.
<p>
I think what you're really seeing here, Kristi, is just a basic
power grab by the Clinton Administration.  Now, it's not the first
time that this administration has tried or actually has put itself
above the law.  But, really, what you are seeing here is you are
seeing a situation where the American people and Congress said,
&quot;No, it is a very bad idea to put homosexuals into the military,&quot;
and the Clinton Administration is so committed, for reasons best
known to itself, to that agenda, to putting homosexuals into the
military, to enlarging the homosexual agenda in our nation, that
now there is this power struggle.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And there's a power struggle.  You know, Congress passes 
laws. The President is supposed to faithfully execute them.  If he
doesn't do that, what do we do?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Who does?
<p>
Bob, you were in policy at the Pentagon and had a long military 
career as well and worked on the policy of gays in the 
military. Some people are going to say, &quot;There have always been 
homosexuals in the military.  Why not have open homosexual service in the
military?&quot;
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  No.  Well, Melissa and I were a small group of people 
that essentially did most of the background work on the President's group 
that worked in the Pentagon on that. There are a lot of reasons, and we 
discovered many of those during the course of that six-month study.
<p>
Clearly, there are cohesion reasons.  There are military readiness reasons.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, explain cohesion for a second.  I don't think people -- 
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  It is what keeps units working, keeps them
fighting together, trusting.  You know, you have to trust the
person in the foxhole with you, in the tank, in the airplane,
to do the types of things and not to be sexually aroused if you're
the same gender under some pretty intimate types of situations.
<p>
We heard from thousands of people when the Army went out and asked
old soldiers and present-day soldiers, &quot;Tell us, have you
ever had a problem?&quot;  And we heard a lot of problems out
there, current and old problems, about homosexuals that were,
quote, in the closet but were discovered to be doing things that
really undermined the trust and confidence you have to have in
one other.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And this is a fact in particular, isn't
it, when you have someone who is in authority over younger men,
in particular?
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Absolutely.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And I think it's very important to point
out that the fact, whenever you have a rule, whatever that rule
is, there are a certain number of people who don't abide by it.
 There are a certain number of people who evade it and therefore
don't bring the problems that the rule was designed to address
necessarily into the situation.
<p>
But it's a whole 'nother question to say, What would the military be like 
if we removed that rule totally, took all the brakes off, took all the 
restraints off? You cannot compare an army where a few soldiers are breaking
and evading the rules to an army that has no rules.  So that analogy
just breaks down analytically.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're going to have more time to talk later.  But the military 
traditionally has said, We want you to not be sexually active with each other, 
men and women, man and man, however you want to do it.  You have found
that to be disruptive now sometimes even with women in the military.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Absolutely.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Very clearly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tell a little bit about why the military says to
the people involved in it, Don't sleep together.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, I can tell you that I did some -- and I can't give 
you details -- but investigations during Operation Desert Storm in
Iraq and Saudi Arabia, where we had relationships among soldiers,
some of which were senior, which are the ones I investigated,
which in some cases didn't happen but they were alleged to have
happened, and you go down and you talk to the soldiers that are
under this supervisor, this senior person, and there's a lot of
backbiting, there's a lot of distrust, finger-pointing, and just
morale bottoms out.  They don't trust this person because they
think they're off sleeping with the commander or whatever.
<p>
MS.HAMRICK: Right. Sexual politics.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  It's really a loyalty question.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to get more into that.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i> following this commercial break.  We'll hear
more about yesterday's court action, more about these kinds of
sexual politics.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I am joined once again by Bob Maginnis and Melissa 
Wells-Petry, both of whom attended and were active in the recent court case, 
<i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. Welcome back.
<p>
Family Research Council is not my first job. I have been in many 
different work environments where there is sexual harassment, in particular 
one where the boss was sleeping with different women in the office.
<p>
It seems to me simple to understand that the same reason I don't want an 
army that sleeps around is the same reason I don't want that going on in my 
own office or the kind of pressure that -- who gets promoted, the people 
who sleep or don't sleep?  What are you seeing, Melissa?
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Well, it should be simple to understand, especially when we 
feel that way about the normal work environment, and there is absolutely
nothing ordinary about being in the military environment.  This
is an organization that has a sense of togetherness, physical
and emotional, that really has no parallel in the civilian world.
<p>
And when you are talking about the remarkable dynamic of sexuality,
it really begins to involve people's, not only their full attention
but their loyalties.  And inside the armed services, one's loyalties,
every soldier's loyalty must be to the mission, not to some little
intrigue that is going on inside the company.
<p>
That is the seed, that pernicious seed, that begins to flower into what 
Bob said was this breakdown in morale across the board.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What have you seen, Bob, in your experience?  You've done a 
lot of investigation.  When there are homosexuals serving in a unit and
they haven't told per se but there's a knowledge that they are
gay, what is happening?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS:  Well, there is a common knowledge amongst especially the 
young, enlisted soldiers when you have especially, say, a sergeant who 
everybody suspects is gay, but the seniors can't quite catch this person in 
the act, and they won't acknowledge it.  And so it has created a level
of tension which is just -- you could break it like you're breaking
ice.  You know, it just shatters once it is discovered, because
everybody knew it.  But it is terribly devastating.
<p>
Any sexual issue -- because most of what I investigated were sexual issues
for senior officials, and I saw a lot of them -- and, invariably,
you would talk to the people and they would tell you what was
going on and how this was dysfunctional.  It was just like the
coffee(?) talk.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  See, that's what is so artificial about a policy that 
focuses only on when you tell.  That's completely fake, because -- let's face 
it; let's have some common sense here -- the difference between a homosexual 
who is unknown and one who is known, that state of affairs can change in the 
twinkling of an eye.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And that state of affairs is very transient, depending on 
the opportunities presented, the emotional appeal that is involved in a 
situation, and so on. So we are talking about the Clinton Administration basing 
a policy on something that not only is fake but is like ephemeral.  It
goes like that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's a trust level, too, isn't it? I mean, basically, we're 
saying I will identify myself by the way in which I will have sex and say that 
I will never have sex. Isn't that what we're asking people to say?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, we are.  We are essentially --
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Well, under the Clinton regulations, right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Under the Clinton regulations.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: They are asking -- like Thomasson yesterday.  They are 
saying, &quot;Why in the world didn't you ask him whether or not he was
going to remain celibate?&quot;  Now, he didn't say anything about
that in the testimony, but that is essentially the expectation.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY:  But I always find it amazing that celibacy,
which is frankly out of fashion everywhere in public policy --
you can't get anyone -- in fact, people are suing if you try to
include an abstinence-related protocol in your sex education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And suddenly celibacy is in vogue among homosexuals in 
the military?  You know, in every program that has to do with sex, the last 
thing that they are factoring in is celibacy or abstinence.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes. Our Federal Government just spent $400,000 to do an ad 
campaign that is going to advise you to use condoms.  But in the military, 
apparently, no one is going to have to.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: Yes. Oh, yes. Celibacy is in vogue there, yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And yet the military provides pornography to the soldiers and 
homosexual pornography now.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: That is a new development.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you think of that?
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: We checked.  About two weeks ago, we went to the 
Pentagon, and we looked at what pornography was on sale at the Pentagon
bookstore.  Now, there are only nine different books of heterosexual
pornography -- there were some empty spaces, so we assume there's
more -- and there were two for homosexual pornography.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
LT. COL. MAGINNIS: There were sales at the Fort Myer post exchange for 
homosexual flags and bumper stickers, and so forth, to identify yourself.
<p>
Now, this is under the Clinton Administration policy that says homosexuals 
aren't supposed to be serving, and yet you have, at taxpayer expense 
subsidizing this stuff, no taxes being charged for the sale of it, and it's 
out there.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: And, of course, it is broader than just -- I mean, when you 
begin to talk about pornography, you are talking about impacting on
the whole --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The whole sexual climate.
<p>
MS. WELLS-PETRY: -- moral and social climate of command.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. This isn't going to go away, and we're going to have 
to have you all back. When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at the Family
Research Council's effort to show that the media does not always
present the facts.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back.
<p>
The Family Research Council's director of cultural studies, Bob Knight, 
has been involved in the media for many years, working at one time for the 
<i>Los Angeles Times</i>. In a 1993 Accuracy in the Media press conference, 
Bob presents some facts regarding the homosexual agenda and how the media 
presents it to the public. Let's take a look at his insight as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> brings you Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
<center><h4>Segment from Accuracy in Media Press Conference<br>
June 1, 1993</h4></center>
<p>
MODERATOR:  Our next speaker and I have something in common.
 We both come, figuratively, out of the belly of the beast.
<p>
Bob Knight was a former editor of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. I 
formerly was a correspondent for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, so we 
know the media from the inside out.
<p>
Bob is now director of cultural studies at the Family Research Council. Bob?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Well, the reason we are here today and here to see the video is 
because the media has been omitting what's really important.  They have
done this on a number of occasions.  But in all my years in journalism,
I never saw an issue treated so dishonestly as I have the gay
issue.  And it is what is omitted that bothers me.
<p>
You know, you can pick up the <i>New York Times</i> and the <i>Washington 
Post</i>, and I think the information there is reliable.  But it's what 
they're not telling you that is significant.
<p>
They didn't tell you, for example, that Roberta Achtenberg was an attorney 
for the bath houses in San Francisco at the height of the AIDS epidemic. 
In 1984, the Public Health Department tried to close those bath houses
because they knew they were a breeding ground for AIDS and were
taking the lives of hundreds, if not thousands, of young gay men.
<p>
She was an attorney for a group of bath house patrons and managed
to keep them open.  I think this action may have contributed to
the loss of life of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of men.  And
yet the media didn't think that was worthy of reportage.
<p>
Similarly, the way they reported on Roberta Achtenberg's role in 
persecuting the Boy Scouts was curious.  They said that right-wing 
opponents had accused her of punishing the Boy Scouts and being against
the Boy Scouts' policies of excluding homosexual scoutmasters.
<p>
This is full public record.  She has been doing it for years.
 She has made no secret about it.  And yet it is left up to debate
whether she actually did it or not.  It almost seems as if her
critics took it up, and yet there is ample opportunity to document
her attitude on the issue.  That was never done.  It was left
as a cloud.
<p>
I will give you a personal example of media bias.
 When I was at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, somebody had written a 
story about gay cruising in Laguna Beach, California, which is a gay
mecca much like Key West.  The gist of the article was that gays
had changed their cruising methods.  They weren't frequenting
the parks as much.  They weren't hitting the public restrooms
as much, although some still were.
<p>
This story went on for 80 inches, which is typical for an <i>L.A. Times</i> 
story. Our motto used to be, &quot;Get it last, make it long, get it 
right.&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, anyway, I got hold of the story.  I was editing it, and I
said, &quot;Wait a second.  You know, in this entire article about
gay cruising, you never mention AIDS once.&quot;  And this was
when AIDS was really taking off.  It was the most obvious topic
in the gay community at the time.
<p>
And I asked the editor, I said, &quot;Why aren't we mentioning AIDS?&quot; 
And he said, &quot;Well, we just didn't think it was relevant.&quot; 
AIDS not relevant to a story on gay cruising and whether there's a change 
in habits? Come on.
<p>
This is why we are here to see this video today.  The
media has been systematically excluding information about the
homosexual lifestyle, about the politics surrounding the issues,
about almost everything associated with the issue.
<p>
Another prime example would be the idea that gays are born that way, that 
there are genetic studies that indicate that you are born gay and there's
nothing you can do about it.  The latest study that was touted
was in the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i>. It was by two 
researchers, Drs. Bailey and Pillard(?), and they had done a study of male
twins previously.
<p>
I remember the <i>Washington Post</i> headline.  It
was something on the order of &quot;Study Indicates Lesbianism
Has Genetic Origin.&quot;  What they didn't report was in the
very same edition of the <i>Archives of General Psychiatry</i> was an
article that reviewed all the current literature on the issue
by two doctors and psychiatrists, and they concluded:  &quot;At
present, there is no evidence to substantiate a biologic theory
of homosexuality.&quot;
<p>
Further, they said, &quot;Efforts to do so seem to be more driven by lack 
of satisfaction with the current psychosocial explanations than anything 
else. There is no new medical evidence that is solid to suggest that it is 
biological.&quot;
<p>
But this is typical.  An authoritative article goes unnoticed;
one that supports part of the gay agenda gets heavily publicized.
<p>
What you are about to see on this video is what did not get publicized
in Washington.  I have heard people in the media try to say that
what you see on the video is just on the fringes of the march,
that it really didn't represent what went on that day.  But we
had people out there.  They were all over the mall, and they said
this stuff happened everywhere.  If you were in Washington that
day with your kids, you couldn't avoid seeing obscene acts committed,
anti-religious imagery, topless lesbians, any number of bizarre
sights that were carefully hidden from the major network shows
and from major print media.
<p>
So I think the report, that group out of California that did such a fine 
job with their first gayagenda film and their second, which deals with the 
homosexual agenda in education, have done -- if anything, they have surpassed
themselves.  This is a dispassionate look at what really occurred
that day in Washington.  It deserves to be viewed by every American
so they know exactly what the homosexual agenda is about.
<p>
Thank you very much.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight we're talking about an issue which has touched each and every 
one of us:  divorce.  As rampant as divorce is across the nation, it is a 
topic that is rarely discussed, perhaps because of the emotional chord of 
regret, heartbreak, and disillusionment it strikes.
<p>
Tonight <i>Straight Talk</i> confronts divorce head-on.  We're going to ask, 
What impact has it had on society?  Why has there been such a drastic rise 
in the divorce rate over the past three decades?  And, most importantly, is 
there a way to curb this damaging cycle of family breakdown?
<p>
First, let's hear from Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's
Assistant to the President for Government Relations.  After years
of working on Capitol Hill, Marty provides a unique and insightful
look into issues before Congress which affect our nation.
<p>
I had the chance to discuss some of the most current Hill wars with
Marty, so let's see what he has to say, without media editing,
as we take you behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are here today with Marty.  Thank you
so much for joining us.  Marty works on Capitol Hill for the Family
Research Council.  And this last session of Congress was historic,
because for the first time since 1973, we saw an actual limitation
on abortion -- not all the way through yet -- the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act.
<p>
Marty, what has it said about Congress today that they are looking at 
banning a procedure that might end a child's life when they are pulled 
into the birth canal and killed moments from birth?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think that this issue was chosen very strategically, 
and it was a very good decision to use legislation like this that focused 
on a particular procedure and forced people to deal with the reality of 
abortion. So many times in the past, the pro-abortion side has been able to 
engage the argument on cliches, and so on, of keeping the government
out and that sort of thing, and not focusing on the child.
<p>
So it is very important that people understand what is going on,
and as you pointed out, most people don't realize that late-term
abortions are a reality.  They believe that they are only in the
first three months and even only for hard cases -- life of the
mother, rape, incest, perhaps a few other hard cases -- and it
is much broader than that.
<p>
This bill is going to land on the President's desk, and the indications 
are that he will veto it.  But it will help to point out that he does have 
a very extreme position that is in line with the most extreme advocates of 
abortion on demand in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that will hurt the President if he vetoes 
the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think it will.  I think he is probably falling
back on his friends at the major networks to try to put the best
spin on it, and he will say that there wasn't the appropriate
health exception, and of course, we all know that the health exception
they're talking about is a license for abortion on demand.  It's
a definition of health that encompasses any possible social or
psychological circumstance.
<p>
But the President will try to project that he's just so concerned about 
women's health and that he signed such a law in Arkansas, and if only 
that could have been there, he would have signed it, but in fact, his 
allies all know that that was a gutting amendment which the Senate defeated, 
and it remains to be seen.
<p>
I think the grassroots pro-family and pro-life movement know that that is 
extreme, and they are really catching on and getting the word out.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It seems to me that the best thing that happened in the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act debate was that we talked about what's 
actually happening in abortion clinics.  What do you think the take-home 
message is for pro-life Americans as they have seen some success, even
if the President does veto it?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think that the educational issues are very important, 
that it is important to talk directly about the issue, let people understand 
what the realities are, and to use this legislation as a focal point to
show that the license for abortion in this country is so broad
and so extreme that it really needs to be addressed.
<p>
It is an uncomfortable issue for many people.  They would rather not deal
with it.  But this is the type of issue that causes them to take
a second look.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There has been a lot of attention on Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
on his high negatives, on possible ethics problems.  Is his persona going to 
be a problem for Republicans as they are dealing with the budget debate?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think it is causing some problems in that it really 
has emboldened the Democrats.  They feel that they have him on the
run a bit, and that once they start digging into even this limited
ethics probe that is now in place, that it might open the door
for a wider probe.
<p>
I think they do have to be careful, though, if they start down this 
road and seem obsessed with this, that their candidates are not talking about 
the issues; that it could have a backlash.  But right now it does seem to 
have energized them, and some of the comments, particularly the reference to
the treatment on the airplane back from Israel and how that might
have impacted on decisions regarding the budget, have been unfortunate
and probably overstated.  I don't think that that really had anything
to do with the decisions on how that budget was handled.  I think
that was the way things were going anyhow, but it is unfortunate
that the Democrats and some of the media had an opportunity to
cast it in those terms:  He shut down the government because he
was mad at the President type of argument.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Representative Enid Waldholtz, a Republican of Utah, is sort 
of struggling with her own values issue right now.  Her husband is going to 
be indicted, and she came forward recently and said, &quot;I'm innocent and
I'm not going to resign my seat.&quot;  What impact do you think
that is going to have on what is going on now?  Any at all? Is
this bad for the GOP or is this just bad for Representative Waldholtz
personally?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, it is certainly problematic for her personally. 
There are some out there now who are starting to make the charge, &quot;Well, 
look at these hypocrites. These were the family values candidates, and 
they're hypocrites.  Some of them have had troubled marriages, there are a 
few divorces, and in one case the spouse of one of the members admitted to 
being unfaithful.  And yet they are trying to say that this somehow
suggests that there's a values problem for that member of Congress.&quot;
<p>
So these are very curious charges, and what people stand for is
not really related to perhaps potential failings of a few members.
 You have to look at the broader issues.
<p>
The same people who are trying to zero in on this are trying to ignore some 
of the other issues that the Senate Banking Committee is now looking at 
and gross inconsistencies in who knew what about Whitewater and related
issues, and many of the people in the press who are looking at
every little iota they can find about Newt Gingrich are very anxious
to avoid the issues of who might have obstructed an investigation
of wrongdoing, and so on, within the administration.  So there
is a double standard that has been there for a long time, and
this continues to be a problem.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, we appreciate taking your time from up on the Hill. 
Thanks so much for being with us today.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  It's a pleasure to be here. Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we'll be joined by Bill 
Mattox, Vice President for Policy at Family Research Council. He will 
bring us his perspective on divorce and how it will affect almost 1 million 
children this year.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[From marriage ceremony segment]:
<p>
MINISTER:  In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
and what God hath joined together, let no man put asunder, and
you may now kiss your bride.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Today, when people think of marriage, all too often the next 
word that comes to mind is divorce.  The 50 percent divorce number comes 
from a yearly comparison of the number of new marriages to the number of 
divorces. Overall numbers are not as bleak.  The fact is that one-quarter
of all those who have ever been married will also be divorced.
<p>
Still, divorce links all American lives because, directly or indirectly,
we have all been affected by it.
<p>
MALE INTERVIEWEE: My parents got divorced when I was real young.
<p>
FEMALE INTERVIEWEE: My parents were divorced when I was 10 months old.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, the prevalence of divorce may be the factor which creates 
the acceptance and understanding of this phenomenon, one which leads
to an increase in child abuse, juvenile crime, sexual promiscuity,
teen male suicide, and even more broken homes.
<p>
Divorce, amazingly enough, also increases one's chances of health problems. 
The <i>American Journal of Public Health</i> found that either the breakup
of one's marriage or the divorce of one's parents significantly
reduces the average lifespan.  Divorced men who don't smoke have
only a slightly lower risk of dying from cancer than those who
smoke a pack of cigarettes a day.
<p>
Considering how divorce negatively impacts so many lives, it is interesting -- 
and disheartening -- that the divorce rate has tripled over the last 30 years.
<p>
MALE INTERVIEWEE: I just think it's a product of our society in general.
<p>
FEMALE INTERVIEWEE:  I think there's a lack of commitment, that
marriages are easier to get out of, and there's just not the commitment
to the family that there used to be.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But, as the people who have watched the breakup of their own 
homes or the homes of loved ones can tell you, it's not easy to save a 
marriage. There are no easy solutions to this epidemic problem.  But the
research agrees with those who have struggled through:  it is
worth the effort.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  With us tonight is Bill Mattox, Vice President for Policy with 
Family Research Council.  Bill has been examining the divorce issue for years 
and has been widely published on the subject of divorce effects on the very 
young, seen not too long ago in the tragic suicide death of singer Kurt
Cobain.
<p>
Bill, welcome.  Thanks for being with us again on <i>Straight Talk</i>. 
You have been tracking the impact of divorce for a long
time.  What kinds of trends are you seeing, especially over the
last 30 years?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, in terms of the actual prevalence of divorce, the 
divorce rate peaked in 1981 and has kind of plateaued since that time. 
We have seen a slight decrease since that time in the number of divorces 
in each year.  But it is still a very, very serious problem, and especially 
when you look at this from a historical standpoint, comparing the prevalence 
of divorce today to two or three generations ago.  Many, many more people 
are affected today; many more children are affected today than ever before.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When a lot of the movie industry in the 1960s and
1970s very much glamorized divorce and glamorized let's get out
and be all that we can be, and now we've kind of seen what we
are in divorce.  What impacts happen to the people who actually
divorce?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, you know, this is really one of the
most interesting things about this subject, though it is a sad
note, is that if you talk to a lot of that 20-something generation,
those kids 18 to 30 years old that we have been polling in several
of our public opinion surveys, you find that concern about this
issue is greater among that group than among older Americans,
and I think part of it is because many of them have grown up in
an era where divorce was commonplace, where it was at one point
glamorized.
<p>
And yet they have seen the negative fallout and have experienced 
that firsthand, either in their own lives or perhaps in observing 
the lives of their friends.  And it is not a difficult thing to 
convince them that this is a serious problem and one that really 
ought to be addressed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I think one thing that I found interesting.  Family Research 
Council is getting ready, under your leadership, to do a state-by-state 
divorce stats release -- it is going to be coming soon -- that, state by 
state, the statistics are different.  What did you see in that?  I found
that very fascinating.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  It is interesting that there are some significant differences 
between different states and, indeed, different regions of the country.  Oddly 
enough, you can reasonably predict the divorce rate in any part of the country
by knowing the number of days out of the year that a woman can
wear a bathing suit.  Now, I am not suggesting that there is a
correlation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Oh, my goodness!
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But, basically, if you think of the sunbelt region, which 
includes, of course, the Bible belt, what you find is that divorce rates
in that part of the country are dramatically higher than in the
Midwest and Northeast.  The mountain states in the Far West tend
to have higher divorce rates, as well.
<p>
There are some important reasons for this.  One is that divorce rates among 
Catholics, Jews, and Mormons tend to be significantly lower than among 
Protestants, and so --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And they're in the northern regions.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Especially in the Northeast and Midwest, you have
a high Catholic population.  So part of the reason why you have
higher levels of divorce in the Bible belt than in, say, states
like Massachusetts -- I mean, get this.  Teddy Kennedy's home
state is number one in marital stability, and Donald Trump's,
New York, is tied for second.  Who would have ever thought it?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fascinating.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  So the prevalence of a Catholic population is a major 
predictor here.
<p>
But perhaps an even more significant predictor of differences in divorce 
by state is the degree of social integration; that is, how rooted are the 
people living there in a larger community.  And what you find is that in 
areas of the Northeast and Midwest where you have had families that 
have lived in this area, in this neighborhood, for years and years and 
years, the communities are more stable. When couples go to marry, their 
families know each other.  There is a wide circle of people who can advise 
them about whether or not they're compatible and also a wide circle of people 
who can hold them accountable, to say, &quot;Look, we're counting on you
to make this marriage work.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: When you see marriages in less stable areas, more transient 
areas --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Like Washington, D.C., or Los Angeles, or commuter
towns.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Exactly.  What you have -- a lot of military
towns see this quite dramatically -- what you have, then, is situations
where people are quite often marrying without knowing a lot about
each other.  They quite often have dissimilar backgrounds, and
they do not have the community surrounding them to both advise
them and hold them accountable, which is so critically important.
<p>
And, indeed, this is, I think, one of the very important functions
that churches should be providing and, indeed, in some areas are
serving to provide, because we know that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: More counseling, more accountability -
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Exactly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A discussion of what you're getting into.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right, because of the one things that we do know that
is rather encouraging in terms of the relationship between religion
and divorce is that those who attend church on a weekly or even
more frequent basis have dramatically lower divorce than do those
who attend less frequently or not at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Let's go through just a couple of quick things on that. 
There were an interesting series of dynamics on, if these things are in 
your life, you are less likely to divorce.  What are a couple -- five,
ten -- things that you see with that?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, sadly, even though a lot of young people who have gone 
through the divorce of their parents are worried about this, quite often 
they are at higher risk of divorcing themselves, partly because they 
haven't seen good role models in their own home.  And again, this is why
the role of the community is so important, and the role of churches,
to model good marriages, so that those who haven't seen it at
home can at least know what it is that they are striving for.
That's a significant predictor.
<p>
The age at which one marries often has a significant effect. The younger --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We were talking about this the other day.  So the 
50-year-olds and the 18-year-olds, they've got different sets of resources.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: That's right.  Those who marry in their teens are
at greater risk, in part because the maturing process has not
quite often taken full root, and so the marriages are more fragile.
<p>
Generally speaking, if you can make it through that first eight-year
period, that is when most divorces occur, is during the first
eight years of marriage.  There is also, then, a kind of upturn
when men and women hit mid-life crisis in their forties and whatnot.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  But if couples can make it through those kind of critical 
early years, then the chances of long-term success are much, much greater.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, I think what was interesting -- now, obviously, I just 
want to state Family Research Council would not want a battered woman or 
someone in a domestic violence situation to continue to be injured.  We 
are talking about marriage-strengthening patterns and things that
are generally true.
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Oh, no question, and I think this is a very, very important 
point. If you look at public opinion data about adults, say, a year, two 
years, three years after the divorce has occurred, quite often what you find 
are folks who have very serious regrets, who believed that -- they believed
this lie, that divorce was going to be liberating; it was going
to make their lives easier.
<p>
And yet what they discover is that quite often they have merely exchanged 
one set of problems for another.  And many of them, at that one, two, three 
years out point are saying, &quot;Gee, we wish we had tried harder.  We
wish that we had given it a better shot, because maybe we could
have worked something out.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, as a person who married later, I can definitely say dating 
can be not all it's cracked up to be.
<p>
But marriage provides a lot of benefits that I was not aware of.  We were 
looking at the video piece. Health benefits. What are some of the 
surprising collateral benefits of marriage?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  It is interesting, and I guess the important point there to make, 
as well, is that the health benefits, though they are present for both men and 
women, they are especially present for men.  Men benefit significantly from
marriage in any number of different ways.
<p>
As you pointed out, there is a lower correlation for things like lung cancer 
as well as stomach cancer, less alcoholism, less depression -- all sorts
of health benefits that are associated with stable marriage. 
And it comes in part from the fact that they've got someone to
help encourage them to adopt good health patterns, to regulate
their diet, to encourage them to exercise, that kind of thing.
<p>
And there is a certain stability that comes into their lives that
isn't always present in cases where one is living alone, especially
if they are still dealing with the emotional fallout of a divorce
or a painful marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, it is funny. I saw Zig Ziegler speak, a motivational 
speaker, business leader, talking about how men who were kissed on their way 
to work made more money than men who were not, which was an interesting 
statistic.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But I appreciate your being with us, Bill, and I would
encourage people to call Family Research Council for more data
on this.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we continue
to discuss divorce.  We will talk to some people who are practically
examining this issue state by state, and we will examine some
proposed changes in legislation which discourage an &quot;easy
out&quot; of marriage.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would now like to 
welcome Larry Huff, Director of State and Local Affairs for the Family 
Research Council; and two individuals with whom Larry works closely:  Randy
Hekman, Executive Director of the Michigan Family Forum, and Dennis
Mansfield, Executive Director of the Idaho Family Forum.  Gentlemen,
welcome.
<p>
Randy, you have had an interesting career.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: That's true.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You have been a judge, a father of nine, lots of --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Not nine, just 12.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Just 12!
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  We've got to get that number right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Gosh, I demoted you.  I have to -- and as a judge, what
can you tell us about how no-fault divorce has affected us as
a culture?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, as we've already heard from Bill Mattox, it has 
impacted lives, certainly mothers' and fathers', but especially kids'. 
Seventy percent of children that are currently in juvenile facilities 
today have come from broken homes.  In fact, most of the people that a 
juvenile court judge -- and that was the kind of judge I was for 15 
years -- are from families where there has been divorce, or no marriage 
in the first place, but most of them divorce.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
And you are in Idaho; you are in Michigan.  What prompted you all to say, 
&quot;Divorce reform is something we're going to take on&quot;?  Because 
it is certainly not the thing that is on the top of a lot of people's
lists.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  It really isn't.  In fact, if you were
to go through most of the state legislatures, you'd find that
most people would look at you, and they would say, &quot;Well,
why do you want to get rid of no-fault divorce?  Why do you even
want to engage in the debate over this?  It seems like you're
looking for an issue.&quot;  And that has not been the case.
<p>
We think the issue is already out there.  It's on every street corner,
it's in every broken family, it's in every bottle of booze; that
there's a divorce that is sort of divorcing, in a sense, the physical
from the spiritual across our culture, and it's happening family
by family.
<p>
So our thought was, if we were really to deal with the social ills 
that are involved in Idaho, which is a very conservative,
very pro-family kind of state that still is seventh in divorce,
along with Alabama, then we'd better engage in the debate now
and in essence be a point person on it.  So that's why we jumped
in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are you seeing nationally, Larry?  Family
Research Council is taking on a divorce reform project.  But why?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  I think it is largely due, Kristi, to the fact that
there is just a recognition across the country increasing that
families who stay together are a model for a prosperous society
and virtuous society, and that that is the model that works, and
a recognition that with the breakdown of families comes the breakdown
of America, and it's beginning to impact more and more lives,
and when things impact us personally, I think it moves us to want
to make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I want to ask you all, a lot of people, they think, 
Yeah, divorce is bad.  Okay, what are we going to do about it?  Okay, 
try harder.
<p>
But you all are doing some things, some real things, to change how 
divorce works in America.  Please describe that.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You see, back in the late 1960s, early 1970s, folks thought, 
well, you know, there is such acrimony in our courtrooms, and we have such 
a problem with divorce.  People are showing up.  They want to get a divorce,
and one of them has to pretend that they've been wrong or done
some sort of faults.  Let's eliminate that charade.  Let's just
have no-fault divorce, which means that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But they had to do that why?  Because you couldn't get a 
divorce --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You couldn't get a divorce without showing some
fault.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  So the husband or the wife would admit to fault. They said, 
&quot;Let's do away with that.&quot;
<p>
Well, we now have no-fault divorce, which means that either party can get 
a divorce from the other party for any reason at any time. What that means 
is that it is legally easier for a person to divorce their spouse, even if 
they've been married for 20 years, than it is to fire someone that you hired 
last week. There is no legal way to stop that party from leaving.
<p>
The net result has been significant injustice for parties.  It has resulted
in women, particularly, losing major economic strength.  In fact,
one study shows that women lost like 72 percent of their income
following divorces.
<p>
No-fault divorce actually also hurts existing marriages. You don't 
really want to invest in something unless you feel that it is going to 
be worth my investment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  But you can't hold onto your spouse. They can turn away and 
walk away for any reason at any time. Why invest in that marriage? 
As a result, existing marriages are hurt through no-fault divorce.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So how will we change that?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Well, we're hoping in Michigan -- in fact, there is a
bill in the legislature in Michigan -- and our hope would be that
early next year we are going to see the first state in the Union
to reverse no-fault divorce.
<p>
What it would do, it would allow divorce based on mutual consent; that if 
both parties truly want the divorce, fine.  But if only one wants it -- the 
husband wants out so he can marry a new model, for example -- he can't just
walk away and get that divorce automatically.  He will have to
prove fault against that spouse of his or else get that spouse
to agree, and for both of them to agree, and basically, there
is going to be a financial transaction at that point to get --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: And that's the way it ought to be.  The man that deserts the 
person that he has committed his life to and the children that they have 
spawned through that relationship, it seems to me that he ought to own up to 
that commitment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So we are talking about a two-tier system.  If we
both agree, we both sign out, we're out.  If we don't agree, then
there's going to be some money changing hands.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Well, if they don't agree, there is going to have to be a showing 
of fault under those circumstances.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  I would shy away from calling it a two-tier system.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Okay.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  I would say, more importantly, that it
is the logical consequence of a covenant relationship; that we
have covenanted together to be one, and we're going to march ahead,
and if you want out, well, you know what?  There's a price for
everything, and that price may be that you just don't have an
easy out, whether it's the husband or the wife that leaves.
<p>
And in fact, what we're doing in Idaho is we're watching Michigan,
and we're hoping that, depending upon the movement of the governor
and the legislature in this, that would see Idaho, Washington,
Oregon, and other states come up, but we are definitely ready
to roll on this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So there are a lot of states watching what is 
happening there?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, there are other settlement formulas that are out there, 
aren't there, Larry, some saying that if there is a divorce that 
children's standard of living cannot change?  What are some of the other
options that people are looking at in a divorce formula?
<p>
MR. HUFF: There are a lot of disincentives built into divorce in 
different fashions, and what we found is that actually a lot of those end
up trying to reform marriage laws instead of reforming divorce
laws, and creating different types of marriages and this kind
of thing, and giving the courts a lot of latitude dealing with
what happens to the kids, and some of that is positive and some
of it is not.  But what we really want to focus on again is instituting
justice back into the divorce laws.
<p>
The number one product of government should be to produce justice, and that 
is just not happening in our divorce laws.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So what does the opposition say? It sounds reasonable.  You 
know, divorce is the number one impoverisher of women and children.  So why 
would I not be in favor of this?  And I'm sure you're not going to tell
me that your whole legislature is saying, &quot;Yes, let me sign.&quot;
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, a lot of them are.  Frankly, legislation doesn't
happen -- with all the possible things to enact into law, legislation,
even if there is general agreement, doesn't happen unless the
heat is turned up a little bit and the public seems to want it.
<p>
Frankly, the biggest obstacle is the public is just getting aware
of what this issue is, and so part of our job is to inform the
public, and the media has been helping us in Michigan to do that,
and I'm grateful for this program to do the same.
<p>
But the only opposition that we have seen, frankly, has been a number of 
family lawyers.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Interesting.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: They are earning their keep with no-fault divorce, and they may 
have some concern that if things change, maybe they'll have a hard time 
earning their keep.
<p>
It is interesting that back when the law changed in 1972 from fault to 
no-fault, the lawyers opposed that change, as well.
<p>
Interesting -- the feminists -- there are many feminists,
believe it or not, who favor a return to more of a fault system,
because women typically -- again, men get really beat up by no-fault
divorce as well, but a lot of women do, especially those that
have custody of the children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And get exchanged for the trophy wives.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  That's right, and they end up -- no-fault divorce says, Hey, 
we're just going to be even split, everything right down the middle.  But 
the typical woman earns 75 cents on the dollar for every man, and so 
following that divorce, that is why women's income plummets, typically.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And the man's generally goes up, I think, what, 40 percent?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  Well, that's one study.  I've seen other studies suggest
that it's even or it may even go down a little.  Nobody really
wins big time through divorce; few people do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Right. But nobody gets hurt like the children.
<p>
MR. HUFF: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk a little bit more about
that in just a moment and, Dennis, hear more about what is happening
in your state, as well.
<p>
Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i> following this commercial break. We will hear more about 
the tragedy of divorce, both nationwide and state by state. Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Tonight we're talking about divorce and the 
crippling effect it has on individuals, as a nation and as a whole.
<p>
I am joined once again by Larry Huff from the Family Research Council, 
Randy Hekman of the Michigan Family Forum, and Dennis Mansfield of the
Idaho Family Forum.  Welcome back.
<p>
Larry, when we're taking a look at divorce, it's hard not to look at 
children. It's not just about a man and a woman.  There are, a lot of 
times other, other people involved.
<p>
What have you seen when it comes to divorce reform?  Are children going to 
be better off?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Well, we think they will, Kristi, because, as you mentioned, in 
the wake of these breeches often lie kids with broken hearts, and
the opponents of moving back to a system that requires more justice,
these opponents say, &quot;You know, if you do this, you are going
to reinstitute bitterness and acrimony back in the process.&quot;
<p>
I think that's just really a naive view, because when people get
divorced, unfortunately, there's going to be bitterness there,
and what we have now is that bitterness is transferred to the
custody battles, and in those custody battles the kids are often
the ones that just really get hurt and get caught in the vise
between this acrimony that is there between the parents.
<p>
And so we believe that settling this issue at the beginning of the 
divorce proceedings will really take some of the pressure, at least in
the divorce process, off of the kids.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In a fault system, will the parent found at fault have 
fewer, perhaps, privileges in terms of the children?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  I really think that changing it more back to a fault system 
will actually give more clout to the more innocent party.  See, under 
current law -- just think through with me for a minute -- under the current 
law, where you can leave your spouse at any time -- let's take a classical 
example. The man does leave his wife and children that he has been married
to, say, for 15 years.
<p>
Right now, she is required to negotiate with him. He already has what he 
wants, which is the divorce. And so she needs to come to him and say, 
&quot;Look, if I can't have you and the family back together, at least give 
me the house, enough money to survive this experience, and custody of the 
kids.&quot;
<p>
And he could come back to her and say, &quot;Hey, look.  Don't
push me too hard or I'll go for custody of the kids.&quot;  And
I have seen illustrations of that in real life.
<p>
If we change the law like we're hoping to do in Michigan, he does not 
automatically get the divorce he wants.  He will be required to negotiate 
with her.  And again, she can say, &quot;Look, if I can't again have
the family together, at least give me these three things.&quot;
 He will have to pay a higher price, you might say, to get out
of the commitments he has made.  And that's justice.  That's the
way it ought to be done.
<p>
Now, let's not sound sexist here.  Often -- in fact, I have some 
illustrations where men come home from work and are aghast.  Their wife, 
their children are gone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. It happens.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  The divorce has been filed.  Next thing they know, they're 
obligated to be paying child support.  Wife is now living with her boyfriend 
with the kids, and he has to subsidize it and gets to visit with his kids at
McDonald's every other week.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's sad out there, especially for people who don't want 
the divorce.  What if you don't want a divorce?  Can this change result in no 
divorce?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: I think what it really does, it results in the opportunity
for discussion, because right now, when that spouse leaves and
the divorce papers are sitting there on the table and the husband
comes in from a camping trip and his kids are gone or the wife
comes -- there is no discussion.  You know, that decision has
been made.  They're out the door.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: What we're hoping for is that there's an opportunity to 
come back to not necessarily a rekindling of that spark that happened
but at least civil discussion that may ultimately lead to reconciliation.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  You know, it could be done, though.  There's a group
called Retrovive(?), which is a Catholic-oriented group.  These
consist of folks who have been to the brink of divorce.  Many
of them have been through divorce and have worked themselves back
together, the word &quot;rekindling.&quot;  I mean, they have
rekindled the relationship; they are more in love now than they
have ever been.
<p>
They then mentor other couples whose marriages are on the ropes, and 
they have an 80 to 90 percent cure rate, believe it or not.  That is an 
amazing --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is a phenomenal --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  And they're around the country. It's a big group.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  And even those that aren't in an official capacity -- my wife 
and I have poured ourselves into two families, one that was divorced for nine 
years, the husband and the wife.  They remarried and they have had now five 
years of marriage that has been outstanding.
<p>
Another that was separated, husband and wife, for a year and a half.  We met 
them through a series of Providential occurrences, acted as agents to bring
them back together.  They've been married now for two and a half
years.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Great.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the things that we have seen here at Family Research 
Council looking at the data is partnering troubled couples with healthy 
couples --
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- that that is a tremendously successful thing to do. And 
there have been even discussions of requiring some counseling in a 
no-fault/fault situation. Is there consensus for that, Larry, on a 
national level?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: For requiring counseling?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Yes.  There are a number of states introducing divorce reforms 
of all types, and the most popular divorce reform is to require counseling 
both on the front end and what they call so-called reality therapy for 
those who want to divorce.  Before you get a divorce, you just need to 
understand some of the implications.
<p>
The one caveat that I think we all have a consensus on is that we want 
that to be done -- we think it is a good thing to provide it, as long as 
it is done by people who are in the business of counseling; that is to say, 
private-practice people, the church, people like that, not government 
counseling. We don't think government counseling is the proper solution.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. The government's good at taking your money,
but saving your marriage?
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  No, not good.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  It's just not under their purview; it is just not a
positive thing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And wouldn't there need to be a bias in favor of saving 
the marriage?  I think one thing I am concerned about is, in the 1970s and 
1980s, there was a bias toward counseling to get out.  You know, &quot;You're 
right; you're stressed.&quot;
<p>
MR. HUFF: Self-actualization.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Right.  Really, no-fault divorce has that same bias.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  We give all the legal clout to the party
that wants to break the relationship now and no legal clout to
the party that wants to preserve the relationship. It shouldn't
be that way.  If marriage is that important to our culture, which
it is, if anything, the presumption should go the other way. 
We need to change that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think it takes too much to the therapeutic 
state of mind that we would require counseling? Are you at all 
concerned about that, that we're a little -- are we headed into 
psychobabble land?
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  Well, no, I don't think that's the case, but I do think 
that it goes back to the issue of communication.  For example, we were 
talking earlier about communities who have made a decision in our clergy 
to come together and say, &quot;This is our basic understanding of the
covenant of marriage.  Let's have counseling before marriage.
 Let's have counseling before a divorce.&quot;
<p>
What these covenants have been -- in fact, I think the entire state of 
Michigan may ultimately move towards that.  Isn't that right, Randy?
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: They're looking at it, yes.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  In fact, the clergy are coming down there and saying, 
&quot;Look, you cant' leave me, as a Methodist, move over to that guy who 
is a Presbyterian and get married without going through this type of 
pre-marriage counseling.&quot;
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  That is not legislatively induced.
MR. MANSFIELD: No.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  And they've done it in communities -- Peoria, Illinois; 
Modesto, California; Louisville, Kentucky; certain communities -- all 
the religious leaders of all denominations have come together and said, 
&quot;Look, we can agree on two things. We think marriage is great; we 
think divorce is bad.&quot;  And so let's just commit that we will not 
intentionally marry someone in our churches, our synagogues, whatever, 
unless these folks have first gone through four months of premarital 
counseling, mentoring with an experienced married couple, some premarital
testing, maybe some conflict resolution discussion.
<p>
It has been amazing how the numbers of divorces, like in Peoria, have 
gone down 20 percent from the year they instituted this, and stayed
at a lower level, and in other communities that have done it.
 We're thinking of doing that for the whole state of Michigan,
by the way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fascinating.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN:  But again, totally outside of the legislative control.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There has to be that private-public partnering.
<p>
MR. HEKMAN: Oh, absolutely, absolutely.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD:  We really view it as two rails on a road that brings the 
locomotive of our culture down in a quick way.  One is law, one is culture. 
Our belief is that if we can help encourage the clergy to realize that those
two things are true -- marriage is good and divorce is bad - 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: -- and then have accountability with it, the locomotive that 
we have sort of attached our culture to can have a smooth trip.
<p.
Right now, I am telling you, there are all sorts of curves and problems up 
ahead, and we've got to take a leadership position.  Quite frankly, the 
legislative leaders and federal leaders are not even talking about it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: No, they're not.  And I was wondering, Larry, on a state 
level, are there some states that are not interested in this at all?
 I mean, you look at a state like Nevada.  They make a lot of
money from the divorce machine.  I mean, they practically advertise
it.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Well, it is easier to get a divorce in Nevada than
in any other state in the Union, and the divorce rate in Nevada
is higher than any other state in the Union.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: An interesting connection.
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Yes, there is a nexus there. And, yes, I think that we have a 
ways to go in shaping a consensus that justice needs to be reinstituted. 
I mean, some folks still are just not interested.  But again, I think there 
is an awakening, and I think folks are beginning to perk up and say, 
&quot;Wait a minute.  We have a responsibility here.&quot;
<p>
I mean, again, healthy marriages are the basis of civilization, and it has 
been so for centuries, and just a recognition that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And is &quot;justice&quot; the word for it?  Is that the 
phrase that you are taking forward?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  I think it really is. Yes, it is.  I mean, again, we want people 
to recognize their duty and their responsibility, and the law is a teacher, 
and the purpose and the product of law should be justice, and that's what
we must reinstitute into the divorce process.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That seems to have been almost the unspoken thing, that the law 
became the enemy of marriage rather than the advocate of it.
<p>
MR. MANSFIELD: I think you're right.  Also, I think that in what Larry has 
talked about regarding justice, that needs to be the point of discussion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk more about this.  When
we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at the Family Research Council's
efforts to shed some light on an interesting and possibly criminal
issue related to the famous Kinsey sex reports.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The Family Research 
Council's Director of Cultural Studies, Robert Knight, has been 
investigating the famous Kinsey reports and, with the supportive work from 
Dr. Judith Reisman, wrote and produced a documentary which provides shocking 
evidence that the Kinsey Institute could have ben involved in the sexual 
abuse of children as part of the famous Kinsey human sexuality studies.
<p>
Just last week, Bob was asked to participate in a news conference called
by Congressman Steve Stockman.  It was an attempt to spur the
government to further investigate those possible criminal allegations
involving Dr. Kinsey or other sex researchers working with him.
<p>
Let's take a look at Robert Knight's insights as <i>Straight Talk</i>
brings you Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
[From a press conference held December 7, 1995, on the Child 
Protection and Ethics in Education Act of 1995]:
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE STOCKMAN: Today we are going to be dropping a bill that 
asks that Congress to look into whether there was any violation of the 
law regarding a study by Kinsey.
<p>
I as a public servant have no greater duty to this country than to protect 
the most innocent, and that's the children.
<p>
We are not accusing anybody at this point of anything. We are asking 
merely that we look into the study to see if there was any criminal 
activity.
<p>
What I as a government official would like to do is to find out if the 
government was involved in molesting or manipulating poor, young children for 
the benefit of so-called pseudoscience.
<p>
We are not here to ask for anything more than to look into whether criminal 
activity may have been taking place.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Hi.  I'm Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies
for the Family Research Council, and I'm writer and director of
<i>The Children of Table 34</i>, which is a half-hour documentary video
that we just released that exposes the use of children in these
sexual experiments.
<p>
It is founded on the work of Dr. Judith Reisman, who has been courageously 
trying to uncover this mystery for more than 15 years, or about 15 years. 
I mean, talk about tenacity. Dr. Reisman has been at it for more than a decade, 
and she has been ignored.  The scientific establishment has chosen not to
take up her case, and it is time they did so.
<p>
This bill, the Children Protection and Ethics in Education Act, merely asks 
Congress to let some light into the Kinsey Institute and try to determine
what happened to these children about 50 years ago in Alfred Kinsey's
famous sex studies.  He has clear tables of data revealing systematic
molestation of children.
<p>
Most recently, because of statements made by Dr. John Bancroft, current 
director of the Kinsey Institute, we have reason to believe that what Dr. 
Kinsey wrote and what the current Kinsey Institute is saying are quite at 
odds. At the very least, we have a scandal of accuracy, and at worst, we
have a scandal of criminal molestation of children in the name
of science.
<p>
We are asking Congress -- and we commend Representative Stockman, who 
is bringing this forward, along with 41 of his colleagues -- to do 
something that should have been done years ago.  Dr. Reisman pointed it 
out, that there really is no statute of limitations on crimes of this 
magnitude.  The Nuremberg laws were clear. You can't sweep something 
under the carpet for 50 years and hope it stays there.  The truth 
eventually will come out.
<p>
We have high hopes that with Congress now opening the door, and perhaps 
with some cooperation from the Kinsey Institute, we can get to the
bottom of this.  I have more hope for that than I did before,
because Dr. Bancroft broke silence on the topic.
<p>
I just mentioned earlier that he said there was a problem with the data. 
Specifically, Dr. Kinsey wrote that there were nine pedophiles who 
collected the data on the children.  Dr. Bancroft now says there was one
elderly pedophile, now dead, whose name he refuses to reveal.
<p>
We are asking Dr. Bancroft to come out with this man's name. 
Surely, if you can uncover priests molesting children, oh, 10
years ago, 20 years ago, you can uncover the name of a guy who
was supposedly responsible for much of this research 50 years
ago.
<p>
It may lead to the unraveling of the mystery.  It may tell
us how the children were obtained for the experiments, where they
got them, whether parents gave permission, where the children
are now, which ones of the children are in need of care.  This
is a traumatic experience these children went through if in fact
the data is accurate in these tables.
<p>
So Family Research Council commends Representative Stockman, Dr. Reisman, 
and everybody who is trying to get to the bottom of this, and we wish for 
a speedy resolution of this problem.
<p>
Thank you.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
One week ago today, the most exceptional minds on welfare policy and 
the most successful front-line workers met together for the Family 
Research Council's &quot;A World Without Welfare Symposium.&quot;  The 
purpose of this extraordinary event, put together by FRC policy analysts 
Jennifer E. Marshall and Deanna Carlson, was to talk about a world without 
the failed safety net of government but with the loving support of a 
dependable community. If you have ever asked yourself, &quot;Is there a way 
to help people really do better?&quot; please stayed tuned.
<p>
But first, let me share with you an insightful conversation I had with one
of the key symposium speakers, Dr. Virgil Gulker.  Dr. Gulker
is the founder and president of Kids/Hope/USA, which is a revolutionary
volunteer service model that helps people get involved in the
lives of needy children and families.  He has also authored several
books about real volunteerism, written from hard experience after
founding Love, Inc., an international network of over 300,000
church volunteers.
<p>
Let's hear Dr. Gulker's perspective on one-on-one support rather than 
anonymous welfare subsidies.  It's a story you're not likely to read in a 
lot of media outlets, as we take you behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're here today with Dr. Virgil Gulker.  Thank
you so much for being with us on Behind the Headlines.
<p>
Your program, Kids/Hope/USA, is revolutionary.  How did you get started in 
this kind of unique partnership program?
<p>
DR. GULKER: I had done a lot of work with church volunteer programs, because 
I just have the absolute conviction that within the larger Body of Christ
we have the most awesome potential to get to children and families.
 When I researched Kids/Hope/USA, however, I found that there
were some changes in program models that we had to look at; that
the experts I had talked to had very clear feelings about what
the local church could do.  Virtually everyone said, &quot;Get
these folks to come alongside young children at that time in their
life when their values are being formed, their self-esteem is
being developed.&quot;
<p>
Yet when I went to the churches and asked hard questions about what a 
program model could look like, the pastors were saying, &quot;Virge, 
please don't set up another agency or program.  You need to do this. You 
need to help us reach these children and families.  But we have so many 
agencies coming to us already, saying, 'Give us your money, give us your
prayers, give us your best volunteers,' and somehow that is going
to build up the church.  In reality, it's not building up the
church; it's weakening the church.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: My own church has caring ministries, a person who makes sure 
that you get a meal if you're sick or a ride to the doctor if you need
one.  It's a volunteer program.  Are we talking about a formal
volunteer program that is overseen in the church?
<p>
DR. GULKER: What I offer a church is a system that will show them how to
recruit, train, supervise, and affirm their members specifically
for relationships with at-risk kids who are identified within
the local elementary school.
<p>
We are not putting together a pool of church volunteers; we are putting 
together those individuals from your church, for example, who really catch 
the vision for a child.  And it is really a manageable vision.  We're not 
saying we want 20 or 50 hours a week.  We're saying, &quot;Give us an
hour a week for at least a semester, and you can change the life
of a child.&quot;
<p>
We are getting reports back from teachers and school personnel that are 
so extreme, I don't even dare to put it in our literature, because no one 
would believe it.  These teachers are saying that after two sessions with a 
church volunteer, they see significant academic and behavioral improvement 
in these children.
<p>
And I think it is important for the listeners today, too, to recognize 
that for so many of these young children, especially elementary school 
children, that the primary need is not food or clothing.  Those needs may be 
present, but the primary need is to have someone come alongside them and 
affirm them; someone to say, &quot;Billy, Judy, Samantha, Jasmine, you have 
value. I care about you. I love you.&quot;  And the best way to express
that love is just to put an arm around the child and be there
for them.  The results are incredible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So what the church does is a local church says, &quot;We have 
a concern for children,&quot; and they would choose a neighborhood school, 
I am assuming --
<p>
DR. GULKER: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- a single school, an elementary school generally --
<p>
DR. GULKER:  Yes, right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And then you come in and say, &quot;All of you in
this church who are concerned about the children in the school
that is your community program, community school, we're going
to help you help these kids.&quot;
<p>
DR. GULKER: Right. In fact, we actually get involved a little earlier than 
that. Once they express interest, I don't ask them to make a commitment to 
do it.  I ask them to form an exploratory team.  We gather some folks
from the church and community and, together, we look at two questions:
 One, does the church have access to these children?  And to find
that out, we need to go into the elementary school.
<p>
I wish you could go with me on some of those visits to school as the 
principal, teacher, social workers, et cetera, sense that this collection
of people might be coming into the school to help them love the
children.  It is amazing what an impact that has on them.
<p>
The second question for us is, does that church have the commitment
and the capacity to do this kind of work?  Because we are not
just asking them to collect food baskets; we're looking for some
long-term relationships.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you define commitment and capacity?
<p>
DR. GULKER:  For me, first of all, it means finding
out whether or not a church really wants to pull this off.  Again,
because we're dealing with relationships, we dare not engage a
child if we're not serious about maintaining it.  I don't want
a church member or a church coming back saying, &quot;Well, Virge,
you didn't tell us that these kids don't smell so great,&quot;
you know, or that they're coming from homes where there's dysfunction
and so forth.
<p>
I had to find ways to really prove commitment and
capacity, and what I look for are a number of things:  One, I
want them to pay a part-time director.  Now, in churches that
ranges from a reasonable wage to a nominal fee for a church member.
 We always want someone from that church to direct the program
so we can develop and maintain relationships.
<p>
There is a modest budget that we ask the church to provide, and many 
of those line items can fit within the existing budget.  I ask, also, 
for a fee for my organization.  It is based on church size.  It ranges
from about $2,500 to $8,000 depending on the size of the church.
Right now we are working in churches ranging from about 150 members
to 3,500.  We are working experimentally with an inner-city church
with 30 members, and for them that fee is less.
<p>
Another commitment criterion for us is the willingness of the pastor to 
be one of the volunteers.  I cannot exaggerate the importance of a pastor
who puts his rear end on that little chair next to that child.
 The school and the church know at that point that they are committed.
<p>
We want a minimum of 10 volunteers who can go into the school.
 We recruit those volunteers plus substitutes; also, one prayer
partner for every adult-child relationship.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Earlier, you said that your program costs each church that 
participates a fee.  What does your program provide to the churches for 
that fee?  I am sure it doesn't underwrite the whole cost.  But what
would they receive?
<p>
DR. GULKER: It is generally about a third of what we need to set up a 
program in a church. But for that money, we offer the presentations to 
appropriate church audiences; we work with that exploratory team; we 
train the leadership team, the director; and then we provide the training 
through a Christian child psychologist for the volunteers who go into the 
schools.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The statistics on father absence in the inner cities
and in homes across America are brutal.  Clearly, this is a tremendous
social pathology.  Because of that, do you see a need for more
male volunteers?  Are you seeing the problem of father absence?
<p>
DR. GULKER: Our request now as we go into churches is that 60
percent of the volunteers be men.  I have nothing against women;
I married a woman.  But the reality is that I am so convinced
that Christian men can be God's gift to this culture if they are
willing to respond.
<p>
As we have men going into the school coming alongside these children, 
the children at first are mystified. Some of them, candidly, have no 
idea what a father model is like.
<p>
One school superintendent who reads to all of the kindergarten students 
in his district reported recently that after reading a story in a kindergarten 
class, a little girl came up to him and just looked at him very quizzically, 
and finally she said, &quot;So this is what it's like to have a daddy?&quot;
<p>
I don't know that the men in our audience, for example, know that if they
make that connection, they will never be the same, absolutely
be changed, guaranteed.  We will train you at two levels:  first,
relationship building, and second, the specific methods and materials
for working with that child.
<p>
Teachers who refer students are giving us, first, a list of positive 
characteristics of this child, because that is what the relationship will 
build around.  We need a specific objective for the child, plus we need 
periodic progress reports so that we know if we are proceeding in that child's 
life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What would be an example of an objective for a child?
<p>
DR. GULKER: Aside from relational issues, a child may need help
in learning simply to read or to read with greater proficiency.
 We have had a number of children who don't know how to spell.
 We get second and third graders who cannot read, and again, if
they don't master that skill soon, they are not going to make
it.  The probability of welfare dependence, unemployment, drug
usage, all of those personal and socially destructive behaviors,
increase in a much greater level for these children who are not
mastering those skills.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How does a volunteer achieve relationship objectives? Is 
that accomplished by then just showing up?
<p>
DR. GULKER:  A quick story.  One of our volunteers, who is
one of the wealthiest people in her county, was matched with a
child who is from one of the poorest families.  The teacher said
to her, &quot;Betty, this child has lots of needs, including some
academic.  The primary need is for someone to let him know that
he has value.  Simply by being with him, by being a kind adult
role model, you are going to communicate that to him.&quot;
<p>
Betty noticed that her little boy needed shoes, and she said to the
teacher, &quot;May I buy these shoes?&quot;  The teacher said,
&quot;Please don't do that because it is going to have a devastating
effect on the family if you do that.&quot;  Betty could buy this
boy a shoe store; she is that wealthy.  Yet she needed to understand
that the boy's greater need was for love.
<p>
I talked to her recently, and she said that as she entered the school 
recently, the boy saw her at the end of the hallway, and he threw his arms 
open wide, and he began to run down the hallway shouting her last name:
 &quot;Mrs. Matthews, Mrs. Matthews!&quot; to love her, and when
he approached her, he just wrapped her in the biggest hug.  She
was impacting his life, because suddenly he felt good enough about
himself to accept her love and return that love to her.  It is
amazing how quickly that happens.  Children are wonderfully resilient.
<p>
We get terrible referrals sometimes:  the mother of a third-grade
boy who, after having another baby this past November, went to
court, decided she didn't want the third-grader anymore, and gave
him away.  He is now living with his grandparents, and we have
a man working with him.
<p>
I think it is important for us as Christians to recognize that Christ can 
use us to be the redeeming factor in the lives of these kids.  Without our 
involvement, we will lose a generation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, we will bring you the 
highlights from the Family Research Council's symposium, &quot;A World 
Without Welfare.&quot;  You won't want to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are bringing you a one-of-a-kind welfare symposium, 
where those who are tackling our current welfare problems all over the 
country gathered to strategize on the kinds of changes needed to help
broken lives.  Let's take a look.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: We do have quite a lot of work before us before we can say the 
phrase, &quot;World Without Welfare,&quot; and mean more than the title of a 
one-day symposium. This day will be devoted not only to arguing that the 
welfare state needs new limits but to outlining what will be required
of us, and social conservatives in particular, if we are to realize
those limits.
<p>
We are asking for a return to the vision of our founders, and the fact that 
calls for relimiting government and rebuilding civil society should sound so 
radical to our modern ears is really a testimony to how far wrong we have 
strayed, especially in the last 30 years under Great Society programs.
<p>
One of the founders' most important insights is that the freedom of 
individuals and the vitality of communities are not competitive but 
intertwined, and that assumption has staked out a large plot of common 
ground to be shared by conservatives of all stripes.
<p>
Of all the speakers here today, Dr. O'Lasky is probably the one who needs 
the least introduction.  His work has dramatically redefined the terms of
the national welfare debate.  Please join me in welcoming Dr.
Marvin O'Lasky.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
DR. O'LASKY:  Thank you all very much. Thank you, Jennifer.
<p>
Let's start out by thinking about all the people here who are not only 
well intentioned but also intent on seeing good results, who understand 
the difference between effective compassion and what is well intentioned 
but often does exactly the opposite of what it sets out to do.
<p>
The essential problem of the welfare system now is that sometimes it 
succeeds in keeping people fed, but it kills dreams.  It kills the helping
dream of many Americans.
<p>
There is good news around the country. Folks here in this room who are 
doing it know it, that we are recovering the lost tolls of charitable success. 
We are seeing a new great cloud of witnesses emerge.
<p>
We are living in an era with many heroes who, I should say, are ordinary 
people who become heroic as they show through hard suffering with, that the 
American dream of compassion is not dead.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. We are showing you some 
highlights from last week's World Without Welfare Symposium.  Now we have
the chance to hear from Dr. Virgil Gulker, whom I spoke with earlier
in the show.  He has more to tell us about the need for volunteers
to touch the lives of those trapped in poverty.  But it's not
as hard as you might think.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995.]:
<p>
DR. GULKER:  I want to thank Jennifer E. Marshall and the Family Research 
Council for convening this very singular gathering.  I know of no other 
similar gathering that I have heard of or attended around the country. I 
think they are giving us an opportunity to discuss the critical issues
facing all of our communities, the church, and especially the
poor.
<p>
I look at the 350,000 religious congregations in this country
-- average membership roughly 100 people per congregation -- and
I think of what those 35 million Christians could accomplish.
 Their potential is awesome.  Yet I hear so little about the role
the church and its members can play in this process of reaching,
reconciling, and healing lives.
<p>
The experience of Love, Inc., says very clearly that there are Christians 
in every community who are prepared to help, to give hope, to share love, 
if they are approached, if they have the appropriate training, and if
they are affirmed for that relationship.
<p>
As Jennifer said, what I learned with Love, Inc., through the 300,000 
volunteers was that we don't need heroes.  We need very simple, very basic 
people, people like me and like many of you, who are prepared to come
alongside someone who needs principally love, nurture, and affirmation.
 The church is that sustainable local organization.
<p>
If we can give them an infrastructure, a personnel department designed to
link their members with children and families in the neighborhood,
we can change the lives of the church members and the lives of
those people.  The church simply giving out food or money or clothing
is not going to make it.  That is the same kind of commodity distribution
that the welfare system has tried for so long, and it has not
worked.
<p>
We are the Body of Christ.  We have the most awesome potential
not just to share Christ but to share that transforming, reconciling
message that can change and empower lives.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Tonight's show gives you some highlights of
FRC's &quot;A World Without Welfare&quot; Symposium.  We now hear
from Don Everly, founder of the Commonwealth Foundation and the
National Fatherhood Initiative, as well as Robert Woodson, founder
and president of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise,
dedicated to empowering low-income families.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: The panel he will moderate includes spokesmen from both the 
think-tank world and the grassroots, and together they will explore what 
we might be able to do to foment a new social revolution, even while 
recognizing the limits of New York and Washington to address matters of the
heart.
<p>
So please join me in welcoming Don Everly, who will make
a few introductory comments, and then we will hear from our panelists.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MR. EVERLY:  I wanted to talk -- actually, being the wrap-up panel, we 
probably carry some obligation to try to tie together the day.  Actually, 
the interesting discussion this morning about libertarianism versus 
traditionalism sort of centered on an idea that I think is actually very 
important.
<p>
There are very important arguments to be made within public policy. There 
is also very important work to be done beyond this more sterile and
fragmented debate about the actual cause and effect of the rise
of the central government and what you can actually expect if
the central government pulls out, and that is to promote social
change by nongovernmental means.  It is sort of libertarian means
to traditionalist or moral ends, if you will.
<p>
I asked that the panel be entitled &quot;Building a New Social Movement,&quot;
or I would actually prefer &quot;new social movements,&quot; plural,
because I think social movements are very different than political
movements.  They tend to be very dynamic and grassroots and independent
often of political and policy affiliations, and I want to talk,
just to set the stage for discussion, about a few of those things.
<p>
But I ask that we consider this whole question of how we, as we
are moving into this very critical period with government retreating,
can actually conceptualize and try to implement broad-based social
change through social movement. So I really compliment the FRC
for stepping into this important arena.
<p>
So I think, having set the stage, I am going to encourage the panelists 
to move in any direction they wish with this, but the suggestion was that 
we use this panel to kind of talk about how we might work as leaders
-- moral, spiritual, social, community leaders -- to orchestrate,
direct, summon forth the kind of social change on a society-wide
basis.
<p>
I will first make the introductions very briefly, just
by giving you my own personal perceptions of these very distinguished
people.
<p>
Bob Woodson really is the founding father of the American
neighborhood empowerment movement and has brought more insight
to the changing concepts and techniques of how to reclaim neighborhoods
and empower people and empower families as well as anybody and
been a voice for that, bringing into our public debate a concern
for the empowerment of neighborhoods and families.
<p>
Moving along, Ronald Moore -- and again, you have his bio with you -- I 
have been hearing so much about the program in Mississippi, as I am
sure you have, Faith and Families, and we are very, very eager
to hear about the innovative work that is being done there to
sort of throw public leadership behind the importance of churches
in providing community-based charity.
<p>
But let's start with you, Bob, and we'll move right across the table.
<p>
MR. WOODSON: Thank you. Since I run an organization that conducts 
conferences, I will take seriously the charge to be brief.
<p>
The National Centers aids low-income people in 38 states to achieve 
greater independence and self-sufficiency, and we do this by going around 
the country and studying not dysfunction of low-income people, but we 
study their capacities and their strengths and identify them as the
experts, and we have learned some things out of that experience
that I will share with you that will constitute my remarks.
<p>
But I think [there are] some principles that should guide our work.
 Bill Bennett, not too long ago at a conference, said that liberals
look at low-income people as a class of victims and conservatives
tend to look at low-income people as aliens.  I think this is
true, that some of the principles that we follow, that we find
very useful, and that the goals should be not to protect people
but to give them the capacity to protect themselves.
<p>
The second principle is the low-income neighborhoods over the past 30 
years have seen $5 trillion worth of poverty programs parachuted into
their communities by professional providers, with the requirement
that they participate.  Now I am witnessing conservative paratroopers
strapping up, prepared to parachute in, with an emphasis on what
we as outsiders can do for those people inside, and I think this
needs to be rethought and challenged.
<p>
The other principle that we can do is that we need to be careful to strip 
labels from people. I think it is possible to be appalled at one group 
attacking another group because of their race or their religion.  We ought
to be upset about that, without having to identify the race of
the villain or the race of the victim.  We ought to be against
violence and insensitivity and bigotry, regardless of the perpetrators.
<p>
Another point that I think would be critical, and that is to not
just offer charity to poor people but use the considerable political
and economic strength of churches and church-goers and others
to remove the kinds of government barriers that prohibit faith-based
organizations from properly serving their own peers.  I think
professional credentialing is the primary barrier that low-income
providers have that is enshrined in state and local and federal
policy; that certification is not synonymous with qualification.
 It is elitist, and those elitists are not just liberals.  Poor
people have to confront conservative elitism, too.
<p>
And so, therefore, if conservatives really wanted to make a difference 
in terms of empowering people, they should work as we have done with the 
National Institute of Justice, Clint Boleck(?), World magazine, and 
Christian broadcast, when many of the groups that we help have transformed
the lives of thousands and thousands of hard-core drug addicts
by using Jesus Christ and the gospel.  But yet they are confronted
with state policies that require them to have master's degrees
as providers.
<p>
But yet it is very difficult to get conservative politicians interested 
in such an issue, and therefore, I think a group like this and others 
ought to look at ways that they can mobilize to remove the barriers.
<p>
The other thing we can do as a principle is to look upon some of these 
local providers not as objects of our charity but teachers of us, because 
many of them have overcome some of the greatest difficulties that life
ever serves up.
<p>
Secondly, they do not believe in rehabilitation. Rehabilitation attempts 
to restore you to what you were before. Grassroots people do not believe 
in rehabilitation. They believe in transformation.  They don't want the 
person to return to what they were before; they want them to return to a 
new person, to become a new person.  They are the experts at this, and 
there is a lot that we can learn.
<p>
I would like to see scholars sit at the feet at some of these experts, 
question them, explore with them how they were able to do what they do, 
and make low-income providers the experts.  It is quite possible today 
for people to be experts on poor people, be they left or right, and never
talk to a single poor person.
<p>
The other thing that I think you can do is to stop studying failure and 
study success.  Conservative scholars look down their nose at capacity 
studies of poor people. This ought to change.
<p>
And finally, I think that we need to remove the barriers that separate 
people across the divide, that we need to disaggregate poverty. Some 
people are poor because of external circumstance.  For people like that, 
a helping hand is all they need.  But the kind of poverty that troubles 
most of us is caused by moral and spiritual crisis, and that can be saved 
not by some outsider coming in offering a helping hand, but that outsider
should strengthen local providers.
<p>
What I find troubling about a lot of mentoring programs, it assumes 
that people, institutions that are indigenous to those communities do not 
have the capacity to heal.  So, therefore, I think, before you rush to 
recruit volunteers to go into low-income neighborhoods and reach out for a 
child, you ought to first determine whether or not there is a local antibody
that is resident in that neighborhood that is already doing that,
and what can you do to strengthen that local antibody to reach
that child.  Because sometimes, if I were to come into your home,
walk past you to tutor your child, take them to the zoo, and then
buy them shoes, what does it do to your relationship to your child?
<p>
So let's not assume that all low-income people are not responsible
parents or there are not institutions indigenous that could play
a constructive role. I will end on that.
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>.  We continue
to bring you the Family Research Council's World Without Welfare
Symposium.
<p>
Now we will hear from the Reverend Ronald Moore, who
pastors two churches and is the field coordinator for the Mississippi
Faith and Families Program.
<p>
Then FRC's Jennifer E. Marshall, the symposium's creator and organizer, 
will give her insight into the day's successes and our welfare state's 
future.
<p>
[Segment from FRC Welfare Symposium of December 13, 1995]:
<p>
REV. MOORE: Good afternoon.
<p>
So many times, we are concerned about being politically
correct.  Since I'm a Baptist preacher, I don't have to worry
about that.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
If I was an atheist this afternoon, I would tell you that man perhaps 
crawled up out of a slime pit; in his crawl, he lost his tail; that man 
wasn't created, he evolved. But I am not an atheist; I am a Baptist 
preacher. So God created man.
<p>
If I was Black Muslim today, I would tell you to put all
your faith and trust in Honorable Elijah Mohammed.  But my Bible
tells me that my Savior was born in Bethlehem. Elijah Mohammed
was born in Georgia.
<p>
My Bible tells me that my Savior would die one Friday afternoon on a 
cross. Elijah Mohammed died in a hospital. My Bible tells me that my Savior 
would get up the third day morning. Elijah Mohammed has been dead a long 
time. He hasn't gotten up yet.  So all of my faith and trust is in Jesus 
Christ. I believe that Jesus Christ changes lives.
<p>
A few years ago, before Kirk Fordice was elected governor of Mississippi, 
many people were wondering, what are we going to do about this decadent 
mess that we have in this state.  We are the poorest state in the Nation.
 We have the highest rate of unemployment.  We have the highest
rate of teenage pregnancy, and we have more children being born
out of wedlock than any other state in the Union.  So we've got
some problems.
<p>
But finally, our governor, after riding through our state, looking at this 
decadent mess that we have, going from housing complex to housing complex, 
going from community to community, just threw up his hands and said, 
&quot;Listen. Government created this mess.  Maybe government can help fix 
it, but not alone. Government can only help.  But this problem has to be 
turned over to an entity that has been empowered to change not just conditions
but change the lives of individuals.  This needs to be turned
over to an entity that doesn't just treat the effects of problems
but can treat the cause of the problems.&quot;  He asked the local
churches to become involved in the lives of welfare recipients.
<p>
You know, we have spent, someone said earlier, over $5 trillion
in this war on poverty, and in Mississippi we have had every job
training program that you can imagine. We have had every food
program, every program that you can imagine to help the homeless
and help children that have been born out of wedlock, and we're
still in the same condition we were in some 15 years ago.
<p>
So what needs to be done?  Well, first of all, we realized that we had
to get the churches involved, that we needed some positive grassroots
action from the local level to engage the lives of these AFDC
families.
<p>
The governor of our state asked all of our churches -- we have 5,500 
churches in Mississippi -- to adopt at least one welfare family.  We 
have 55,000 AFDC recipients in Mississippi, and out of that 55,000, if you 
were going to see the profile on a particular family, you are probably 
going to find out that these families, 80 percent are African-American 
mothers. You are going to find out that they read perhaps on a sixth, seventh, 
or eighth grade level, and most of them have four to five children, and
they haven't worked in the last 10 or 12 years, and they have
all been on AFDC all of their lives.
<p>
So he realized we had a problem and realized that we needed to work with 
these AFDC recipients. So what must we do?  Well, we asked the churches to 
become involved. We asked every church to adopt a family.  And in Mississippi,
we have the only state-church-family partnership right now in
the Nation.  The program is called Faith and Family.  We ask that
each and every church would adopt one family that has been referred
to that church by the state.  Each and every family is an AFDC
family.
<p>
We ask the church to adopt the family, determine the needs
of that family, and address those particular needs.  Each and
every church has some idea of how they are going to address a
particular need of a particular family because those families
are normally centered around that church.  Normally, the church
members are aware.  They know these particular individuals.  And
the churches are only interested that can provide that one-on-one
intervention.
<p>
In Mississippi we have case workers that work for the state. Each case 
worker has about 250 clients that they simply call up and say, &quot;How 
are you doing?&quot; and they hang up the telephone.  We want to reverse 
the ratio. Why not, instead of having one case worker to 250 welfare clients, 
give one church with 250 members one AFDC family?  And you have 250 people 
seeing about one family.
<p>
We have been able to change some things with
that, because we have jobs programs in our state that have spent
$300,000 to $400,000 and have yet to put anybody to work.  We
have other programs that have worked with the poor, that have
worked with the homeless, and we have seen no results of their
work, basically because they have been trying to work with individuals
from the outside, and the church is able to work with them from
within.
<p>
We don't want to change just the condition; we want to
change the person, because if you change the person, the person
can change their own conditions.  When you walk into housing complexes,
you can walk in some apartments, in one apartment, walk into three
others without ever going outside, because you have people who
live there who don't care.  They have no hope, they have no responsibility.
 Since there is no responsibility, there is no sense of accountability.
 So we realize that there has to be a great change.
<p>
So as the church adopts the family and begins the program to change the
life of this family, to upgrade this particular family, to change
their life from a life of dependence upon the government to a
life of self-sufficiency, they move through that with a series
of courses.
<p>
Each and every church has gone about doing this differently.
 Some of them have taught basic hygiene, grooming, preparing resumes.
 All of this is taught, however, from a Biblical perspective.
<p>
In the past, in our jobs programs, they have been able to go to
school, sit there for an hour to hear what the teacher has to
say, and leave.  They go back the next day and the next day, and
they are in the jobs program some 10, 15 years, and they never
find a job because no one has really met the total needs, or the
real need hasn't been met.  So we have been able to address the
real need of the family.
<p>
This has really upset a lot of people because they really don't 
understand the concept of what we are trying to do in Faith and 
Families. No one is trying to proselytize families.  We are trying to 
take them and ask the church to find out what their needs are, introduce 
them to a divine entity. Hopefully, they will accept that.  If not, teach 
them other life-coping skills that this family can leave a life of 
government dependence to a life of self-sufficiency.
<p>
And it is so simple.  It is simply going back to the basics, because, you 
know, you have young ladies who are on AFDC, who have never worked.  She 
becomes 18 or 19. She has a child.  She moves out of the home of her mother, 
moves into an apartment, and she is asked to take care of that apartment.
 She receives a welfare check of $96 a month, a utility voucher
of $86 a month.  She is given a Medicaid card and given $306 of
food stamps and said, &quot;Listen.  Live your life.&quot;
<p>
We put her in that apartment.  We expect her to take care of it.
 But she doesn't know how to wash dishes.  She doesn't know how
to comb a child's hair.  She doesn't know anything about proper
grooming.  She knows nothing about health and proper hygiene.
<p>
So, consequently, when that child leaves home, he goes to school
and he tears up the classroom.  Consequently, when she leaves
home, goes to try to find a job, she will go into the person's
office who is going to hire her or interview her with five or
six earrings in her ear, six or seven in the other ear, an earring
in her nose, with braids all in her hair, because she has no concept
of what proper grooming should be like.
<p>
So we are asking the churches, have asked the churches, and the churches 
are doing this.  We are just simply going back to basics.  We'll teach 
them how to say, &quot;Yes, ma'am&quot; and &quot;No, ma'am,&quot; 
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; &quot;No, sir,&quot; how to carry yourself, how to
dress properly, how to spend your food stamps.  And, finally and
hopefully, we try to get them to accept Christ or try to get them
to change their total concept of the religious community.  Hopefully,
they will join the church.  But we cannot proselytize.  If they
decide to, that's fine.  If not, we don't worry about that.
<p>
But the state, the church and family working together, we have been
able to take girls who have never worked in their lives, who have
been parts of other jobs programs, who have worked with those
programs who have not been able to find employment for them. 
We have been able to put each and every one of these families
to work.
<p>
In the state of Mississippi now, we have about 190 churches
involved in Faith and Families over this one-year period.  Out
of that 190 churches, we have a total of about 200 families involved.
 At this particular time, eight families have been moved totally
off of welfare; another 55 are about to come off of welfare. 
We have another 206 churches about to enter the program.
<p>
If we can take every church in Mississippi and adopt five families,
we would have half of our AFDC population off of welfare and into
a work environment within a one-year period.
<p>
And not only that; we are addressing the residual effect of what has 
happened, because when you train the mother to go home and train her 
children -- and, interesting enough, what is so good that our church 
members have been able to see, we have been able to see a young lady that
we have taken into the church and train her in life-coping skills,
teach her how to take care of herself, and go back home with her
and watch that young lady take Clorox, take detergent, and clean
up that filth that she had been living in for the last 10 or 15
years.  It is remarkable how, when that change takes effect in
her life, that she will go back,and instead of passing the telephone
from apartment to apartment, she'll take sheetrock and nail it
up to the wall, take masking tape and mask it, paint the house,
because she realizes, she has learned that she needs to be responsible,
that she has to be accountable; that if she wants to go up, she
is going to have to be able to change her attitude.  And we have
been able to do that with each and every family that we have adopted.
<p>
The state's role in this program is simply to refer families to
the churches and to offer the ongoing technical assistance.  The
case management entity stays involved, because they are the advocate
for that particular family.
<p>
Now, one problem with our program, and you might find this in your state. 
There is a huge welfare bureaucracy in Mississippi, and they have tried 
everything that they could do to tear down Faith and Families, because the 
case workers feel that they are going to lose their jobs and that the
churches are going to become case managers.  The social workers
feel the churches are going to become social work entities.
<p>
So, a few months ago, they started sending us families with sixth,
seventh, and eighth grade educations, and everybody was saying,
&quot;Listen.  There is no way you're going to be able to place
these people.  They can't do anything.  Most of them can't read,
they can't write, they don't know how to talk.  What are we going
to do with them?&quot; And our governor was a little worried about
that.
<p>
Within the last month, we put together a database of about
15,000 families in Mississippi.  Each of these 15,000 families
have a specific need, and that need is they need domestic workers.
 They need someone to come into those homes that can wash dishes,
that can clean floors, that can wash the windows, that can take
care of children, and we're going to refer these sixth and seventh
and eighth grade clients; we are going to train them and refer
them to those people who need domestic workers.  Domestic work
in Mississippi is not like it was 40 years ago.  Domestic workers
make $250 to $350 per week.  Most of them have medical and dental
coverage.
<p>
What I am simply saying is, every individual can find
work, and whenever they find work, there is a sense of dignity.
 It develops dignity, it develops accountability,   it develops
responsibility, and their moral and their ethical lives are changed,
and I am not talking about a temporary change; we are talking
about a permanent change.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MR. EVERLY: Very good.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: I just want to close by saying that I think, in
the end, we are going to adopt our answers by default, because
there is no alternative strategy, and at the moment we really
sort of have two competing alternatives.  Either we create an
underclass and we treat them as wards of a custodial state and
we just spend lavishly to keep them comfortable while we ask them
to leave us alone, or we can begin restoring functions to neighborhoods
and communities and to churches.
<p>
I think the fate of our experiment with self-government really depends on 
our capacity to begin renewing a sense of responsibility but across all 
income brackets, coupled with a renewed commitment to our founding fathers' 
faith that all men, every single one is created equal to live up to those
responsibilities.
<p>
[Applause.]

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
<p>
Tonight <i>Straight Talk</i> is celebrating Christmas with you, sharing 
the sights and sounds of the holiday season throughout our Nation's 
Capital. It's easy to forget sometimes that Washington, D.C., is a city
of many people with lives and families and special traditions
of their own.
<p>
We will be showing you how a very special organization
makes a difference in the lives of children who are not fortunate
enough to share Christmas with their parents.  These are the children
of adults who are incarcerated.
<p>
And we have a surprise guest, Dr. James Dobson, president and founder of 
Focus on the Family, a best-selling author and psychologist, and a man who 
has been a powerful voice for family, reaching millions every week.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Phil Olsen, the Family Research Council's
Vice President for Resource Development. In his many travels across
the United States, Phil has had the opportunity to talk to Americans
face to face, building relationships on behalf of FRC.  But his
career, like his brother, Merlin Olsen, began on the football
field as an award-winning athlete.  His work with children's sports
camps and charities led eventually to Family Research Council.
 So join me as Phil Olsen shares his experiences through the eyes
of a caring citizen, not a politician, as we take you behind the
headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are very excited that Phil could join us today on Behind 
the Headlines.  Phil, you and your staff travel around the country.
 You meet a lot of people, real Americans.  At this time of year,
what is uppermost on people's minds?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, Kristi, we do get the opportunity to travel quite a 
bit. As you know, we have a field staff that represents the Family Research 
Council, and we have the opportunity to travel around the country and meet
with our donors and our supporters, and it is truly a phenomenal
opportunity for us to get a chance to meet these people.  And
there are a number of things on their minds.  They are very concerned
about the direction that America is headed.  They are very concerned
about the impact that decisions that are being made here in Washington,
D.C., will have on their families.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, Family Research Council, under your staff, does a poll 
of the people who support us. What did they say were their top concerns in 
the poll that you all did this year?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Actually, we did a poll earlier this year, in January and February, 
and it is important to us as an organization that is representing families in 
America to find out what families in America think are important, the
issues that are important to them.
<p>
We were interested to discover that, this year, the most pressing issue on 
people's minds has been education, you know, what is going to happen in 
terms of the education of their children.  And parents are very concerned
about the Federal Government's intrusion into the education of
the young.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Any surprises in the poll as you were taking a look at it?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Not really. I think that issues that are important to America -- 
sanctity of life, abortion, pornography, health care -- a lot of these are 
near the top of that list, as well.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Phil, you have had a very broad career:
 one of nine; you were a football player with the L.A. Rams and
with the Broncos; you have worked for network television.  You
have spoken, you have worked with kids.  You have seen people
who are very wealthy, people who are very poor.
<p>
What common themes, though, do you see?  Are these people facing the same 
kinds of problems on the different ends of the spectrum?  What are people
really struggling with?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  I think we all face the same problems. I mean, some might have 
more money than others, and maybe the ability to buy some success or to buy 
some relief, but I think, in the final analysis, Kristi, we are all faced 
with the same challenges, and that no amount of money, no amount of
power or prestige or opportunity can really make up for failure
in the home.  No success really can make up for failure in the
home.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Is that what is driving people, a concern
over the success or failure of their homes?  Is that the kind
of common challenges you are seeing?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I think so, and I think that people -- unfortunately, too many 
people -- are listening to the messages of our culture, and our culture 
does not tell them the truth.  And I think that there is a lot of 
frustration there as people chase solutions that they think are going to 
provide them with the kind of happiness and satisfaction they seek, only
to find, when they get there, that there is nothing there but
an empty bag.
<p>
I think there is a lot of frustration, a lot of disappointment, in our 
society, and I think that that is another reason why people are coming back 
to issues that affect the family, because they realize that in the final 
analysis, they need to protect their family.  They need to protect their 
children. They need to try to create a situation and a circumstance where 
they can provide for the needs of their children without the fear of
intrusion from the outside.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: There are a lot of people out there who may be in their 
sixties and seventies and eighties who would define themselves as liberals 
or moderates, or on all different sides of the political spectrum.  Are you 
finding that, though, the presence of children and people kind of grappling
with home failures are bringing them back more toward a conservative,
pro-family side?  As you look at our constituents, have they come
from a lot of backgrounds to a pro-family perspective, or have
they always been there?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  I think that's a good point. I think that our constituents 
are across the spectrum.  I mean, you find them in every walk of life 
and in every financial circumstance, and I think that is one of the 
things that excites me, that we don't represent a small group of 
constituents out there; we represent Americans who, across the board, 
believe in the same kinds of things that we do.
<p>
We are talking about traditional Judeo-Christian values. We are talking 
about the values that have proven themselves over time.
<p>
One of the things that excites me about being involved
here with the Family Research Council, Kristi, is the fact that
every time we embark upon a research project, or every time we
validate research that has been done by others, it tends to validate
Biblical principles, principles that have been proven over thousands
of years to work.  And that is an exciting thing for me.
<p>
I think that our constituents out there are coming to realize the very
same thing.  They know what works.  They know what doesn't work,
and too many times out of bad circumstances or bad experiences
where they have seen things that have happened either in their
family or in other families.  It only brings back even that much
harder the message of the importance of protecting their family
and their children and their future.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: If you would describe a pro-family American, how would you 
describe that person? What are they like?
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Well, that's an excellent question. I think that to me a 
pro-family American is just that; he is pro-family. He is focused on 
the welfare of his family and of other families as well.  I think that 
these are people that we are seeing out there, and most of them are not 
only interested in what is best for their family but in trying to do 
things that would benefit other families, as well.  And so I think that 
that, maybe in a nutshell, would capture that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Phil, we thank you so much for being with us in Behind the 
Headlines and look forward to seeing you again.
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I thank you, Kristi. It has been great to be with you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, we will be taking you on a 
Washington, D.C., Christmas journey, and we will also be joined by Prison 
Fellowship's Mark Morgan, whose Angel Tree organization is brightening the
lives of many, many children, especially during this holiday season.
 Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Christmas scenes.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  All over the Nation, families celebrate Christmas
and the holiday season with their own unique traditions.  But
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> would like to 
share with you a glimpse into the many celebrations throughout 
Washington, D.C., as we take you on our own special tour of Christmas in 
the Capital.
<p>
[Christmas scenes.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Each year, the National Christmas tree lighting ceremony, 
which originated on December 24, 1913, draws people from around the world. 
<p>
Christmas and the holiday season have special meaning to each of us.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: Christmas is a time for me and my family to get together and
come across the oceans and see how everybody has grown over the
year.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas means a time of the year in which
everyone develops a sense of joy and happiness and finds pleasure
in doing for others to a degree to which afterwards you might
regret, but in any case, while Christmas is going on, it's a great
time.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Good will to your fellow human being and an
extra day off of work.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas means time with my family and my friends and just 
a moment to reflect on life and be thankful for what I got.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: Christmas means to me sharing time with my family, going to 
church, and buying lots of gifts for my kids.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE:  Christmas to me is a time of giving and have thanks. Christmas 
is every day.
<p>
INTERVIEWEE: It means the spirit of giving, and we are celebrating the 
birth of Jesus Christ, and that is what it should be about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ministries and outreach programs throughout Washington, 
D.C., help create some extra special Christmas memories in many lives.
<p>
[From Angel Tree celebration segment]:
<p>
SPOKESMAN: Angel Tree is a wonderful ministry of Prison Fellowship 
Ministries. It gives moms and dads that just happen to be away from their 
boys and girls at Christmas and who are in prison, it gives them an 
opportunity to fill out an application and to ask nice people, like the 
Congressional wives, if they wouldn't please buy a present for you so that 
you know that your mom and dad that can't be with you love you very
much.
<p>
And so that is what Angel Tree is all about.  These presents
are from your father or your mother that can't be here today,
and it says that your mom or dad loves you very much and that
Jesus Christ loves you very much, and we hope that this makes
your Christmas just a little brighter.
<p>
[Gift-giving segment.]
<p>
SPEAKER: So who did Jesus come for?
<p>
AUDIENCE: Everybody.
<p>
SPEAKER: All people, everybody from every land.  And whose Son is he?
<p>
AUDIENCE: God's.
<p>
SPEAKER: The Son of God.  Very good.  And that is the true Christmas 
story.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  With us tonight is Mark Morgan, the National Project 
Coordinator for Angel Tree Ministries of Prison Fellowship,. We just caught 
a small glimpse of how this ministry is impacting children's lives, and
Mark is here to tell us more.  Welcome, Mark.  Thanks so much
for being with us.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Thanks, Kristi.  It is great to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I hope by now that everybody has seen this little triangle 
somewhere in their church or in their community. But in case they 
haven't, what is Angel Tree?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Angel Tree is a gift-giving program for the children of 
prisoners at Christmas time.  It is an inmate-initiated program, where 
our local staff people all over the country take applications into
federal and state institutions and in some places county jails
and give those applications to inmates who fill them out, give
us the name, age, birth date of their children, and we pass those
out by location, almost by ZIP code, even, to churches and groups
in the community where the children are living.  So even federal
inmates, say, in Washington State, their children living in Georgia
will be served by people living in Georgia in that area.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it got started -- inmate initiated.  Someone said at one 
time, &quot;Wow, I wish somebody could give a present to my child&quot;?
 How did it get started?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  It started 14 years ago by a lady named Mary Kay Beard who 
was herself an inmate in the Julia Tetwiler(?) prison in Alabama.  She and 
several other women were incarcerated, and she noticed that the women 
were stockpiling like little soaps and toiletries, shampoos and things, 
that churches and volunteers would bring into the prison, and these women 
would stockpile them and then at Christmas time gave those as Christmas
gifts to their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Wow.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: And when Mary Kay was out and now working as the Prison 
Fellowship area director in Alabama herself, she and another woman said, 
&quot;We've got to do something for the children of prisoners at 
Christmas time.&quot;
<p>
So in two malls, one in Montgomery, Alabama, and one in Birmingham, 
Alabama, they set up an angel tree and put paper angels, cut out in 
the shape of angels, on the tree with the names of about 500 children in 
the area, and then people, passers-by in the mall, would come and take the 
angel off. And so that year, over 14 years ago, 566 kids got gifts from 
their parents in prison on behalf of church volunteers and also passers-by 
in the mall.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Community and --
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Community members.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, today, though, you are serving up to a million?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  We think there are nearly a million children who
have parents in prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is amazing.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Prison Fellowship volunteers and churches and organizations 
across the country this year will minister to over 470,000 children,
we think, who have parents in prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I was very intrigued, reading a little bit about the program, 
that if your father was incarcerated or your mother was incarcerated, you 
have a six-times-more-likely chance to also go into a life of crime,
and often beginning in the third grade.
<p>
I hadn't thought of it like this before, but are you at Prison Fellowship 
looking at Project Angel Tree as a way to turn children from a certain path?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Definitely.  Angel Tree is merely just a present
-- it is more than just a present under the tree, but it starts
out as a present and it becomes a year-long involvement in the
life of that family through the volunteers in the community that
are getting involved through Angel Tree.
<p>
We see Angel Tree as being a foot in the door for year-round ministry to 
these families. Because the children are likely to end up in prison, many 
of the inmates who are in prison there now say that they also had
a parent or a sibling in prison.  And so we see a huge cycle of
crime, and we are trying to break that family cycle and get in
and close the gap that is caused by the incarceration; also make
an impact on the child's life.
<p>
We are doing more than just Christmas Angel Tree. We are now involving 
kids in other projects throughout the year to try to make an impact.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The first time I heard about Project Angel Tree was on a Dr. 
James Dobson -- and we get to meet him a little bit later in the program 
-- on a broadcast where they said, &quot;We need more presents.  We
have a tremendous shortage.  Mail little Walkmans to the Angel
Tree headquarters.&quot;
<p>
I mean, the coordination for prisoners and volunteers and delivery, that's 
a lot of people.  I mean, how have you guys handled the growth from 500 
presents in a mall to a million children today?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Well, it is a logistical challenge, and we --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Nightmare?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Not a nightmare totally, but it is a great challenge for us. 
If it were not for over 14,000 churches and some 75,000 volunteers that
get involved in this program -- we think it is the largest program
of its kind that is ministering to children of prisoners involving
so many people, nearly a million volunteers a year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How do you get hooked up, though, because you all -- now, 
do all the names come to Prison Fellowship?  You are the disseminators.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Right.  We have an office in almost every state,
and they receive the applications, and then they recruit churches
throughout the year, and volunteers, radio stations, businesses,
Christian Bible studies, and so there is a large group of people
that are offering throughout the year to get involved during the
Christmas season, and then we provide them with training materials,
a video tape about the program, the posters, and all the materials
that they need to run the program, and then they call -- 
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Then do a lot of these people stay involved throughout
the year?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  They do.  They are now getting involved in the families 
throughout the year, not only just buying the gift and bringing it back 
and delivering it, by either having a party that we saw in the video or 
delivering door-to-door to the families.
<p>
When you deliver door-to-door or bring them into a church through a 
church party, you've got an instant contact and you have been face-to-face 
with them, and then it is easy to continue ministry by sending birthday 
cards or providing food to the families during the holiday times when it is 
tough.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I know some friends of mine, and I have heard this story
regularly.  They are getting in their car, and they are driving
to deliver some gifts, and it is getting a little scary.  And
then they get there, and the reception that they receive is so
amazing.  I mean, is it the kind of thing that some of the volunteers
are having some adventures in trying to deliver this?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: We see that a lot of times.  There are some children that 
live in areas of town that you normally wouldn't go into.  But we call
ahead to the families.  We ask our volunteers to check, to pick
a time that they know is going to be a lot better, maybe on a
Saturday morning when there is better daylight, and they go to
the families.  They are knocking on doors and they don't seem
to see any response.  But then you look up and see coming out
of the second-floor window all these faces peering out, looking
for you, waiting for you to show up, and then running down and
receiving you.
<p>
When you take gifts in to these families, often they have no tree. If 
they do, it's a Charlie Brown Christmas tree, you know, the typical very 
small tree, and rarely are there any gifts under the tree, and so we 
also try to provide care-giver gifts, whether it is just a food basket or 
something.  But we really see that these people want us to come into 
their homes. They don't trust anybody. Nothing has ever been done for 
them, many times.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  And so it is great to see somebody caring for them and actually 
smiling and saying that they love them and giving the gifts on behalf of 
the incarcerated parent and in the name of Christ.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you kind of had an experience like that.  You were trying 
to find a house, and it was a little bit tough.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What happened?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I was with a friend of mine from work with Prison Fellowship, 
and we had decided to deliver gifts in Southeast D.C.  We went across 
the bridge into Anacostia, and it was after a time that I had personally 
been a victim of crime, and I was a little wary of going into the area we 
always hear about being the crime capital.
<p>
And as I approached the house, there were four young guys standing there, 
but they were really strong looking and had their hoods pulled down over 
their heads and their coats really wrapped around tight, and they asked us
what we wanted and what we were doing there, and I said, &quot;Well,
we're here to deliver gifts to Robert's family.&quot;  And these
kids -- they looked like men -- they immediately melted into teenagers
and into children, and they said, &quot;That's us.&quot;  The
oldest kid said, &quot;That's me.  That's my family.&quot;  And
so they took us into the house and we sat around and passed out
the gifts and mentioned that we really wanted to come in at Christmas
time, and it was just an amazing story.
<p>
But you see these kids that are putting on a strong persona and are --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And they're kids at heart.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  They are truly kids, but because Dad is not there, they are 
having to defend the family, and they are watching their home front, and 
so it is something we have to be careful of.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What is the 800 number, very quickly, for people who want to 
get involved?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: It is 1-800-398-HOPE.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  398-HOPE.  Great.  We are going to be looking forward to 
hearing more.  Please join us after the commercial break as we continue to 
hear about the Angel Tree program and Prison Fellowship.  We'll let you know 
what you can do to help touch the lives of those who are incarcerated and 
the families they left behind.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I am joined once again
by Mark Morgan of the Angel Tree Ministry of Prison Fellowship,
an organization which gives hope to prison inmates and their families.
 Welcome back.
<p>
We were talking a little bit through the break about Prison Fellowship, 
and frankly, you know, you look at Angel Tree.  It is a program that is going 
to give gifts to the children of prisoners.  But, you know, every year, there 
are so many people you could give to.  Why would you give to those families? 
Why target those children?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  Well, a lot of times I, myself, wonder why would we want to 
do something for an inmate specifically. But these people are people who have 
been, whether it is circumstance or by choice, they have chosen to be part of 
crime, and they are now part of that, but their families are suffering, and 
there is a huge number of children in this young children demographic
now, this wave that is coming, and if these children fall in the
footsteps of their parents -- our prisons are overcrowded now
-- there is not going to be any place for these kids, and we want
to get involved before they get involved in hurting others who
are victims, you know, to victimize others, and we also want to
get in there and just share love with them to change them, to
get them involved in a better way of life.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I think what is kind of ironic, statistically speaking, is 
just today in the <i>New York Times</i>, for example, they were talking 
about the ending of one crime wave, the beginning of another, as the baby
boomers have gotten older, and maybe they don't want to run and
climb in and out of windows so much.  The crime rate has gone
down, but they are predicting a massive increase of crime as the
children of the baby boomers hit the teen years, a 21 percent
increase among youth crime, which is frightening if you think
about children on street corners.
<p>
But my question is, have you seen through this project any of these children's 
lives changed? Are you seeing children getting involved in ministry, children
frankly having a relationship with the faith community and with
a personal faith that is changing their lives?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: There are churches and groups that have adopted their Angel Tree 
families and are involved with them year round.  They are now involved
in the churches, and we have quite a few Angel Tree recipients
now who are actually involved as Angel Tree volunteers themselves,
who are going out and ministering to others in their own peer
group to share how the ministry and how Prison Fellowship and
Angel Tree has touched their lives.
<p>
We even have -- one of my favorite stories is of a camp that has sponsored 
Angel Tree kids for the last five or six years now up in Maine.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  There are children from New England that
get to go each year, and one of the children's names is Bo Price.
 He was a camper for several years as an Angel Tree child.  He
got involved, volunteers were involved in his life.  His grandmother
and he were involved very heavily in the church they went to that
ministered to them, and he ended up being the top student in his
school and is probably going to be involved as a camp counselor
at this camp in the next year or so.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is fantastic.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: So he has turned his life around.  We got in at a
time where he was young enough and it was a time where we could
minister to him.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And vulnerable.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And ready to be reached out.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Definitely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What about to the people in prisons? I mean, I am
assuming it has to touch the children.  But does it make your
ministry into the prisons work better?  It certainly is a practical
step to show them that you care about them and their families.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I mentioned earlier that Angel Tree is a foot in
the door for year-round ministry for the families.  But it is
also a foot in the door in the prison systems for us as Prison
Fellowship, started by Chuck Colson over 17 or 18 years ago now --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Very impressive.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: -- has grown in the prison system.  But inmates are still 
wary of going into the chapel programs and into any volunteer-led programs 
sometimes. But when an inmate finds out that his kids have received gifts
from Prison Fellowship, that somebody has actually done something
for their family, has actually dared to go into the area where
they live, has dared to cross the threshold of their home, has
gone in and given gifts to the family and spent time with the
mother or the grandmother, whoever is taking care of the kids,
many inmates just say, &quot;I can't believe you actually did
something for me.&quot;  And they are more open and receptive
and will then go into the Prison Fellowship Bible studies or marriage
seminars where their marriages can be restored.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Is this one of the biggest doors that you have?  I mean, 
Prison Fellowship works certainly one on one in the prisons and in Bible
studies and in a lot of practical things to show people that there's
a life for them beyond the bars.  But are you finding that Angel
Tree is one of the better ways to get through to their own heart?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  It sure is.  In a sense, it is a cup of cold water
presented in Christ's name to the families, to the inmates.  Even
the volunteers that get involved really see how easy it is to
be involved in ministry.  And because of that, more and more inmates
are getting involved in the prisons, in the Bible studies.  The
church behind the walls of the prison is growing, and that is
great, because there needs to be a place of comfort and rest for
inmates behind the bars, because there is a lot of stress and
struggles for them.  But also for the families, it is a great
ministry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are seeing statistically -- at Family Research Council, 
we like statistics -- that father absence is one of the key sources of a 
problem in the child's life, not that they don't need their mother, but 
there generally is one care-giver, and the dad is missing.
<p>
How has Angel Tree helped fathers maybe re-engage in the child's life?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: We are working more and more to do that, because when 
inmates are released from prison, they go back into their homes, into 
their families, and want to immediately assume the role of father again. 
However, their children, if they have boys, those boys have assumed that 
responsibility and that role.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: And even the mother who is working and holding down two or 
three jobs is taking care of the family, and all of a sudden, the father 
wants to come back in and assume his responsibilities.  There is a lot that
they need to know, and through some of our other programs, through
Angel Tree and some of the communications we are getting -- we
have a booklet that we give to the prisoners when they fill out
their applications.  We are using those as tools to try to train
the parents, you know, to parent from prison.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ah, that is fascinating.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: So there is an area of parenting from prison that the inmates 
need to assume their responsibility, and Angel Tree is a chance for them 
to again be a steppingstone into the family again, to bridge that gap, to 
speak to their children through a gift and through a note written on their 
application saying that, &quot;Just wanted you to know that&quot; --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That I have been thinking about you.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: -- &quot;that I'm thinking of you, that I haven't forgotten 
you.&quot; And a lot of times the kids will say, &quot;I told you my daddy 
wouldn't forget me,&quot; or, &quot;I told you my mom wouldn't forget 
me.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, in addition, for those people who get involved,
a gospel message is given with each gift.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Right. Angel Tree is different than other Christmas gift-giving 
programs in that it is done in the name of Christ and in the name of an
incarcerated parent.  Some of the materials we have developed
through American Bible Society have been -- as a gift from them,
they gave us Scripture pieces to give to all of the Angel Tree
children, the care-givers, and also the inmates this past year,
both in English and in Spanish, to those families that we have,
and they have allowed us to print on the inside just an easy step-by-step
tool of what is Angel Tree. It is the Christmas story.  These
different pieces -- there are three of them for the kids that
are age-appropriate.
<p>
But it also gives us a chance to share the Christmas story and what is 
the Christmas gift and to lead them in a knowledge of what Christmas is all 
about, that Jesus was given as a Christmas gift, and that He is love, and we 
try to introduce love into those facilities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: These children don't get to see a lot of that, do they?
<p>
MR. MORGAN: No. As I said, the kids on the street that I ran into and other 
families that I have delivered to and that I have been involved with, even
the kids who come to some of the camps that we are having Angel
Tree kids at, there is such a solid, Don't mess with me, this
is who I am, this hard outer shell, but after just a couple of
kind words and a little trust-gaining, they just melt, and they
are so eager for love and eager for a positive role model, because,
as you mentioned, Dad or Mom is gone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: After five and seven years of working with this on the outside, 
on the inside, what has surprised you about this ministry?  What do you think
people need to know?  Maybe they didn't expect this.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: I am amazed at how Angel Tree has grown on its own.  It is 
not a program that we can even really control or manage because the
word of mouth on the inside of the prisons has just grown that
this is a program you can trust in; they're going to work and
do something for your kids.  And also, on the outside, more and
more churches are getting involved.
<p>
But as we see the number of children rise, there are, as I said, nearly over 
a million children of prisoners, maybe 2 million, we think, that we need to 
minister to.  And so, more and more, we need more and more churches and
volunteers and groups and organizations to be involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It has got to be kind of scary for a guy -- he is in prison --
or a woman, thinking that his children are going to totally forget
him.  I would think the fear level would be high.  Just as a practical
matter, I was wondering, after Angel Tree, do you see more children
coming to the prisons?  Do you see a physical connection made
through the gift connection?
<p>
MR. MORGAN:  We have, and a lot of churches are providing transportation for 
the family to the prisons to reconnect that group there so that they can do 
that, and also, you mentioned something else, if I can backtrack just a 
little. At Christmas time, the suicide rate is very high in prisons.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: It is a lonely time during the holidays for inmates.  And so 
Prison Fellowship and Angel Tree provides a link to their families and gives 
them a chance -- because a lot of inmates have expressed that they are 
worried about their families during the holidays.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And I can imagine why, yes.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: They are depressed and lonely, and then they are thinking 
of their families.  And so --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Let's make sure you give the 800 number one more time.
<p>
MR. MORGAN: Sure. It's 1-800-398-HOPE.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Okay, 1-800-398-HOPE. Please stay tuned for more <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Following this commercial break, 
we will hear from Dr.James Dobson, who, through his ministry, Focus on the 
Family, has impacted thousands of lives.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.
<p>
Just recently, I had the wonderful opportunity to speak with Dr. James 
Dobson of Focus on the Family.  Dr. Dobson and his staff are touching 
lives all over the United States through his ministry, which helps people 
strengthen their own families and deal with the struggles of family life.
<p>
Dr. Dobson is also making an effort to be a good influence on government, 
advocating a pro-family agenda through his daily radio show and 
publications. They reach millions every week.  Now let's hear what Dr. 
Dobson has to say to us.
<p>
Dr. Dobson, it is a privilege to be with you today. You come to 
Washington regularly, and I know you have been involved here for years, 
back in the 1970s and the 1980s in the foundation of Family Research 
Council. Why are you here in Washington, D.C.?  Why are you involved?
<p>
DR. DOBSON: Kristi, I come here because so much of what happens to the 
family is linked to what government does.  I wish that were not true. I 
really wish government would stay out of the family.  But they don't,
and as a result, the policies of government are very, very important
to the stability of the family, first of all, financially, of
course, through the way the family is taxed, but then now the
moral issues, you know, of abortion and the possibility of gay
marriage and other things.  All of those kinds of policies are
being discussed -- parental consent for abortion -- many, many
things that we care about, and there is only one way to influence
that system, and that is to come here.  So that's what brings
me to this city.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Some of the media elite are trying to insinuate that 
the family values issues in the next election have run aground a little, 
that it maybe is the economy. You look at the polls recently in terms of 
the numbers on the balanced budget, and they are saying, &quot;We want 
our programs more than our tax cuts.&quot;
<p>
Do you think people are losing interest in things like partial-birth 
abortion and the family tax cuts? You know, is the media elite correct?
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  No.  I think that is the message the media elite would like 
people to believe, and frankly, that is what both political parties would 
like people to believe, even the Republicans, if you listen to them. They
want to talk about money, as though that's the only thing that
Americans care about.  They want to talk about taxation and about
deficits and about reorganizing government and about long-term
debt and interest rates and that sort of thing.
<p>
Well, those things are important.  You know, the economy is important to 
the family, too.  But there's a whole lot more that's out there.
<p>
What this city does not know, Kristi -- and I know you are aware of this
-- but what this city doesn't know is that there are multiple
millions of people out there who are not represented by the <i>Washington
Post</i> and not represented by the <i>New York Times</i> and the media 
establishment, who are just good people trying to raise kids and trying to 
maintain family life, and they are very alarmed by what is happening to
their children, by the influences of Hollywood, by the rock music
industry, by the filth that's out there, by the violence that's
all around them, by the drugs, by the gangs, by abortion, by all
these moral issues that are there.  And they are really waiting
for politicians, somebody, to step forward and speak for them
and their concerns.
<p>
Their greatest concern is not the country. Their greatest concern is their 
own little family.  And so the larger financial issues are important, yes, 
but they don't represent all of the concerns that are out there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right now on Capitol Hill you have this clash of the Titans in 
the budget project.  We have soldiers possibly going to Bosnia any day now
and people shipping out all the time.  We have Medicare debates
going on with this whole discussion that we are trying to steal
from the elderly.  And it's Christmas time.  I mean, that's a
lot to be throwing at people at Christmas time.
<p>
What is your sense? You talk to more people probably than most of us in a 
year, in the mail and in your conversations.  Are people feeling overwhelmed
by all these crises in government?  Do they want to see resolution?
 Are they looking for something different at Christmas?
<p>
DR. DOBSON: I really believe that most people are not terribly concerned
about crises in government.  They are concerned about crises in
their private lives.  They are concerned about how to keep their
family together, how to get through tomorrow, how to pay the Christmas
bills, and how to keep their kids moral and how to protect their
family from the influences of a culture in the wake of a moral
free-fall.
<p>
That is what is on people's minds.  Yes, they watch to some degree what 
CNN says and what they hear from this city, but it is much more personal 
than that.  And I think, this Christmas, people feel the way they have -- 
I am generalizing, but the people I know and that I hear from feel the way 
they have for many, many years.  They are looking to put meaning into 
Christmas. They are looking to get in touch with their kids and their families
and to add the spiritual dimension.  And this city is sort of
important but sort of &quot;out there.&quot;  That is at least
my impression.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It is out there, actually.
<p>
DR. DOBSON: That's right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You've got a big schedule.  I just wanted to ask you one 
last question.  When you go home to Colorado Springs, what do you hope 
you were able to accomplish here today, during Christmas time?
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  Some of the meetings that I am having today are frankly 
confidential.  I have been asked not to talk about them, certainly not 
in advance. But I can just tell you there are some high-level meetings 
that deal with the pro-life agenda and how to advance it, how to protect 
that little unborn child.
<p>
Now, we just recently had a wonderful experience, of course, on Capitol 
Hill with the passage of the partial-birth abortion ban bill, which would 
ban that horrible procedure where little children, little babies, full-term, 
viable babies are killed in a horrible way, and we are very grateful that 
that legislation passed.  But that is only the beginning.  We've got a lot 
more work to do.  So that is the primary thing I am here working on
on this trip.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks for standing up for life and thanks for being with 
us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.
<p>
DR. DOBSON:  Thanks for having us.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> brings
you some holiday cheer from the Family Research Council staff.
 Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. FRC staff works very 
hard for today's families, and we very much value Christmas in this 
important family season.
<p>
Tonight let's hear from some of the Family Research Council staff
as they share the meaning of Christmas in their lives and some
of their own special holiday plans.  Please watch with me Home
Front News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
FRC STAFFER: What Christmas means to me?  Well, Christmas means to me a 
time of getting together with family, celebrating the holiday, spending 
time with your loved ones.  But most of all, Christmas is remembering why 
we have Christmas.  It's the birth of the Christ Child sent here
to save us from our sins and to take us to heaven.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Family, being together with the family and sharing and caring.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: To spend some time with my mother, which it has
been a long time since I've had Christmas with her, so I will
spend some time with my family and have fun.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: My family used to always get together, and my dad used to 
always read the Christmas story the night before, on Christmas Eve, and
we would always get together with our family on Christmas Day.
 So family is the main thing of Christmas for me, and snow, too.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Instead of doing gifts for each other, we're going
to go and -- and, as a matter of fact, our families, instead of
buying gifts for us, they're going to send us the money, and then
we're going to find a place that is really special, and that's
going to be our Christmas.  So that's kind of special.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: Christmas means that I get to go home and spend time with 
my family, and it means that I can eat my grandmother's cooking,
and it means that I get to go to my home church and I get to visit
with the people there and hear my minister speak, which is something
that I have missed since I have moved here.
<p>
But Christmas also means that there is going to be peace that whole day, 
and that it is so quiet, and that maybe it will snow.  And what I'm going
to do that is really special this year is I'm just going to sit
down and enjoy my former home with my parents.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: I think the thing that comes instantly to mind is family, you 
know, being around family and having them near to you at that time of
the year.  It is particularly important to have them in a group,
and I think the other thing, the second thing that I think about,
obviously, is that it's to celebrate the birth of Christ, and
that's important to me.  So those are the two things that come
to mind.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Just to always remember the spirit behind
Christmas.  It is the birth of Christ.  It is not the sharing
of presents or the Christmas tree or the lights or the cookies.
 It's that Christ was born and it's a time to celebrate.
<p>
FRC STAFFER: I guess Christmas to me means, it definitely is the meaning 
of eternal life for me.  Without Christ coming to Earth, we wouldn't
have eternal life, and that is the meaning of Christmas to me.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  My family.  Going home and just being with my family.
 I mean, that is really what it means to me, and all of my cousins
getting together and everybody just hanging out, and that's it.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  It will be just a chance for everybody to get back
together from all over the country, from both coasts, and come
back to the heartland.  And I miss the snow.  It's going to be
a white Christmas there.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Christmas?  This Christmas I'm going to go to Tennessee and 
spend it with my family.  And, also, what Christmas means to me is I think 
about people in other countries that can't celebrate it because they don't 
Jesus and never heard of Him.  A lot of them are my friends on the other
side of Planet Earth.  So I think about them during Christmas.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Christmas is the coming of the Savior who saves
us from our sins, you know, and to save us all.  What does it
say in the carol?  To save us from Satan's power when we had gone
astray.  Tidings of comfort and joy.  Is there anything better
than that?
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  Well, I will be celebrating Christmas
with my two little girls, Miosh(?) and Kianshay(?), and now since
my mother has passed, it means a lot, because I usually spent
Christmas with her.  But other than that, it's just a happy celebration
day for me.
<p>
FRC STAFFER:  This Christmas I am going to visit my
family in the Middle East, so I will be much closer to where Jesus
was born, and I am really looking forward to being with them after
having not seen them for so long, and looking forward to being
in the kind of land that Christ was born in 2,000 years ago.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> is looking at the industry behind the get-rich-quick fantasy,
gambling.  It reaches farther than most of us are aware, touching
many lives, and it leaves behind not a trail of sparkling lights
and wealthy patrons but the darker side of our culture:  crime,
broken dreams, and dying economies.
<p>
Stayed tuned for the insights of those fighting this billion-dollar business. 
You may be surprised by what happens to those cities and states that embrace 
the dream that gambling offers.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Marty Dannenfelser, who spearheads FRC's 
government relations strategy.  After years of working on the Hill, Marty's 
contact list reads like a who's who of those congressional leaders who are 
changing government as we know it.
<p>
In recent weeks, the battle for controlling the future direction of the 
American government has been fought over the budget. Join me as Marty 
Dannenfelser shares a perspective gleaned from the closed meeting 
rooms where tough negotiations have been taking place, Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're talking about the budget today, and it's kind of 
interesting.  Lately, reports of the budget negotiation are a little bit 
like the weather.  You know, they are very vague and there's a large room 
for error.  And, day after day, we come in and see that there's a budget 
negotiation but nothing has been decided, and yet government continues. How 
is it possible for us to have no budget and yet have government?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, the Congress traditionally passes a budget
each year, but that budget is really only a blueprint.  What really
affects what gets spent is what is known as the appropriations
process, and if they do their job the way they are supposed to,
they should pass 13 appropriation bills every year that fund the
entire government.  Usually there's a few agencies in each bill
that are funded, like the Department of Health and Human Services,
Labor, and Education, for instance; three very big departments
are funded in one bill.  Department of State and others are funded
in other bills, foreign affairs in some other bills, and so on.
<p>
So those appropriation bills are generally moving forward.
A few of them have been vetoed by the President; two or three
of them have been stuck in Congress.  So when they don't pass,
they have kept many of the major services in those bills funded
by what is known as a continuing resolution, which is a bill that
allows funding to continue, usually at a lower level than what
it would otherwise be funded at through the appropriation bills,
usually the lower of what either house has passed or last year's
level, whichever is lower.  But they can construct that however
they choose.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So then we have the budget, which is sort of a blueprint 
of what it is that we can spend; and then we have appropriations bills, 
which are kind of like checks that we write out; and then a continuing 
resolution, which authorizes spending at last year's levels?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: For the most part. There have been a number of programs 
that the House, in particular, has voted to zero out that are still being 
funded at 75 percent of last year's levels.  Now, that may be about to
change, because the House in particular and Congress in general
are now talking very seriously about targeted appropriations,
which I think is a very good idea, to get the President's attention
in the overall budget negotiations, that things like Americorps
will be zero-funded.  The idea of paying volunteers just should
not be done.  It just does not make sense at a time when you've
got these huge deficits.  But that's one of the President's pet
programs, but I don't think the general public is clamoring for
the Federal Government to pay volunteers when there are millions
and millions of volunteers around the country doing things to
help people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the media is encouraging everybody
to hang tough, you know.  Don't compromise.  Let's take these
disagreements out on the campaign trail.  And we hear talk that
we could just continue funding the government with continuing
resolutions and then debate it all out during the election.  Is
that a good idea?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  No, not really.  I think that keeps things largely 
on automatic pilot.  I think one thing that the voters said in 1994 is 
they wanted change; they wanted things to be done differently.  And to 
continue largely the status quo would not be what the voters want.  So I 
think that they need to start getting more serious about the process.
<p>
One thing in terms of what you said about the budget.  If they want to 
make substantive changes in law -- for instance, the family tax relief
that we have been very strongly advocating -- they do need to
pass some separate bill so that can be part of a larger budget
package, what they call a budget reconciliation package.  And
we hear so much about entitlement spending.  If they want to do
anything to stop or reduce the level of automatic spending, they
need to pass a law to change it.  Otherwise, that automatic entitlement
spending will continue.
<p>
So that is why a budget reconciliation bill is important if you want to 
make those kinds of fundamental changes.  But the things that the people 
in Congress can control are the purse strings and the annual appropriations. 
That is where they can really control it if they stick to their guns.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it seems that, every year, you have to fight the budget 
process two times:  one, to fight for the budget, which is the blueprint;
a second one to fight for the actual spending.  Is that the way
it works?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes. You can pass what is called a budget resolution, 
which sets -- it is a blueprint. But in order to enforce those areas of 
agreement, you need what is known as a budget reconciliation bill, 
which actually changes the law in the important areas to effect those 
changes. Then you carry them out throughout the year through the appropriations 
process in terms of the spending levels.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Although the President and the Congress seem to be winning 
at different points, is there a danger that the public says, &quot;A pox 
on both your houses; we don't want anything to do with either of you in the 
next election&quot;?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, they have been getting pretty frustrated,
I think, with the people in Washington, both at the executive
level and the congressional level.
<p>
We have had the phenomenon for many years, though, of many people saying, 
well, they hate the Congress but they love their Congressman.  That changed 
a little bit in the last election cycle, but it would be a very
interesting question to see how it plays out in this year.
<p>
It is really a matter of framing the issues, because people overwhelmingly
want a balanced budget, but then again, the President senses there
are certain programs that they don't want to see cut, and in fact
what Congress is proposing does not cut some of those programs
but does in fact reduce the rate of growth in the programs, such
as Medicare and Medicaid.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So here we are having a little bit of fiscal constipation, 
you might say, and we wonder what is going to happen.  Could that energy 
be redirected so that we have a third party?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Possibly, but I don't think the history of third 
parties in our country has been a very good one.  There have been a 
few that have been fairly competitive, but I think that most people 
sense that it is the two major parties that are most likely to elect 
their candidate, and ultimately, you have to impact those parties and 
get their attention.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Initially, the pollsters and the pundits said that 
President Clinton finally looked Presidential.  Now they think that 
Congress is doing a little better.  Is President Clinton the winner in
this budget debate?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think right now it has become more equalized. For 
a while, I think Clinton was winning. The Republicans let the debate get 
off of the big-picture argument about balancing the budget and into some 
of the specifics that Clinton wanted to talk about, Medicare and education 
and some of those types of things.
<p>
I think the tax relief issue, too, has not been emphasized enough, 
that families know that they are being squeezed, and one of the reasons 
they are being squeezed is by over-taxation.  So the idea of family tax 
relief needs to be promoted, that this is really part of the package, and 
they need to make that point more effectively.  There are some very
good charts that are put together that show how every state and
families in each state will benefit.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  About a week ago, President Bush gave an interview where he 
said that his one regret or miscalculation, you know, the biggest one that 
he had, was in deciding to go ahead and raise taxes after that &quot;Read
my lips:  No new taxes&quot; promise.
<p>
But Bill Clinton ran on middle-class tax relief.  The Republicans were 
very clear two years ago that they were here to fight for tax relief. 
Could they make a mistake, all of them, if they neglect pro-family tax
relief?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, I think there's a tendency sometimes
when people are in Washington for a while to start listening to
this inside-the-beltway chatter, particularly what you might call
the media elites.  And you're right; the media elites never like
tax relief, and they have no identification with family tax relief.
<p>
I just heard about one of the economically oriented groups that
did a focus group in Michigan, and one of the things that was
most clear was that the people wanted the tax relief, and I think
that people have seen that.  As you noted, President Bush and
some others have seen that, particularly when people have been
promised tax relief or that there would be no new taxes and then
the politicians went back on their word, they really do react
adversely to it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  There are a lot of different budget items on the table. 
Who has more to lose if these promises aren't kept?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  I think the President has more to lose,
because he is much more visible to the country.  The members of
Congress have their individual constituencies.  They have a better
opportunity to talk one on one with their constituents and to
show them what they are doing.
<p>
So I think that the risk is really for the President, and if there is a 
down-turn in the economy, we could have something of a recession -- and 
we are starting to see a great deal of uncertainty in the stock market, 
and so on -- the President is the one who is going to be held accountable.
 He tends to  benefit from economic growth whether or not he is
responsible for it, but he also is the one that is held accountable
if things start to go downhill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, you are up on Capitol Hill every day, and it has been 
a tough year for the people up there.  They have worked practically through 
Christmas. They closed and opened on the same day the next session.  Tell
me, what is the mood up there on Capitol Hill?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think they are getting their breath a little bit. 
I think they worked really hard, you know, and an intense schedule
during the first year, and I think the fact that they have now
had a little bit of time to be with their families, to be back
home with their constituencies, I think some of them are going
to be refreshed, and I think you are going to see them come back
with a renewed aggressiveness, particularly with this targeted
appropriation strategy that I think is going to be the main focus
of particularly the House people.  They see that as the lever
to really get Clinton's attention in the overall budget negotiations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So they have a renewed aggressiveness.  For what?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  For getting spending under control, basically
Congress saying, &quot;We're going to balance the budget, with
you or without you, and if you're not going to cooperate in a
larger budget agreement, then we are just going to target the
appropriations.  We are going to fund those things that the public
really wants and that we feel are important, but we are not going
to target the nonsense like Americorps paying volunteers and Goals
2000 to intrude on local education and things like that.
<p>
So I think once they start doing that and they let the President know
they are serious, he is going to have more of an incentive to
negotiate with them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you very much for being with us, Marty. We 
appreciate your time.
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Thank you. It was a pleasure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, we'll show you a side of 
the gambling industry you probably haven't seen and present a roundtable 
discussion with those who are fighting the billion-dollar business state 
by state. Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Gambling segment.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Atlantic City and Las Vegas.  These cities invoke images and
sparkling lights, slot machines, poker tables, and money, money,
money.  In fact, these two cities for years have been the premier
meccas for those hoping to win the jackpot of their dreams.  Yet
currently 25 states are battling to get a piece of the action
by legalizing or expanding gambling in their own communities.
<p>
The gambling industry promotes itself as pure entertainment, as
well as a provider of economic development and tax revenue increases.
It may all sound like merely fun and games, but studies indicate
the contrary.  Each year, Americans lose more than $35 billion
in gambling.  Low-income families spend five to ten times more
on lottery tickets per capita than middle-income homes.  And among
those who bought the tickets, few were winners.  They lost three
times as much to gambling than those in the upper income brackets.
Compulsive gamblers had an average gambling debt of $43,000,
and to pay for those debts, 85 percent have stolen from their
employers.
<p>
Personal debt and embezzling are not the only things
that follow the gambling industry.  For example, over and above
the monetary costs that individuals and cities suffer, Gulfport,
Mississippi, saw at least 200 percent increases in rape and robberies,
as well as drastic increases in burglary, larceny, and arson.
<p>
With all that in mind, is the thrill of the jackpot worth the
chilling consequences gambling brings to a community?
<p>
To answer that question and many others, in our next segment, <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i> presents a roundtable discussion
involving Family Policy Council leaders from several states battling
the gambling industry.  They are concerned about gambling's impact
on individuals and communities.  The Family Policy Councils work
to research key issues, such as gambling, and inform their states'
representatives and citizens of their findings, which touch the
lives of families, sometimes very negatively.
<p>
So please stay with us as we begin this engaging discussion.  You won't want 
to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back.  We are here with some of the leading experts 
on gambling, especially at the grassroots level.  They have been working on 
it for years, a very impressive roundup here at <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. But first I would like to introduce to you 
Larry Huff, who is Family Research Council Director of State and Local 
Affairs.
<p>
Larry, you have been working with these gentlemen and, I know,
have become an expert in your own right on gambling.  First, who
are we talking to today?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Okay, Kristi.  This is Paul Scianna, president of the Missouri 
Family Policy Center. To my left is David Zanotti, president of the 
Roundtables of Ohio. Michael Geer is here beside you, president of the 
Pennsylvania Family Research Institute.  And beside Michael is Mr. Bill 
Brooks, president and executive director of the North Carolina Family
Policy Council.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thanks so much for being with us today. You all have come 
a long way, I know.
<p>
Frankly, though, just to start off, what's wrong with a few lottery 
tickets?  Why are you all upset by a little bit of gambling? It doesn't 
really hurt anybody, does it? Don't hit me.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Kristi, in short, I think the problem is that gambling in the 
long term has very negative impacts on two main fronts:  one, economically,
and two, socially.  And I think that is the problem that is being
borne out again and again in studies that we see, is that in spite
of all the projections that are made about the good things that
gambling will do for a community, the long-term impacts again
are very detrimental to the economics of a city and to the city's
social problems.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And is it to the economics of a city, or are you 
seeing it to the economics of the state?  Where is the breaking point? 
Does it stop at the border of the town that has brought gambling in, 
or does it spread out further? What are you all seeing?
<p>
MR. GEER:  I think it really spreads across the state.  But, you know, there 
was a late state senator from Pennsylvania, Alphonse Deal(?), who said that 
gambling takes the clothes off the backs of the children in his district and
the food off of their table.
<p>
So when we talk about economics, whether it is in city or a community or 
across the state, the real impact is on the very lives of children and of 
families in those communities; and as lawmakers in our state of Pennsylvania
who are considering the possible expansion of gambling, they have
to recognize that if they allow that, they are going to be taking
the clothes off of children's backs and the food off of their
tables.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But how has that happened?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, it happens in a number of ways.  Number one, those who 
directly involve themselves in gambling, it is just not a winner's kind
of activity.  Gambling happens -- the reason why these businesses
exist is to take the money out of people's pockets.  So instead
of a husband or a wife or a father going down and spending their
money to buy food or to buy clothing for their family, they will
be spending it on a get-rich-quick idea, going down to a casino
or buying lottery tickets or whatever.
<p>
And it is proven time and time again, although there are some people who win, 
far and away, most people lose, and it can be an addictive behavior that 
will lose significant amounts of money and again take the money away
from them.
<p>
Additionally, then, it goes beyond that to take money out of other 
businesses in the community.  They call it economic development, but 
what has been shown in community after community where they do have legalized 
gambling -- casinos or riverboat casinos -- is that the other businesses in 
the community dry up. They go out of business, and that means jobs for 
people, and those jobs are lost, and again, those families go hungry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, I am a former Pennsylvanian.  My parents are still
there.  There has been a lottery there for a long time, a lot
of corruption that we have seen time and time again.
<p>
MR. GEER: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The balls injected with water or fluid. What
are some of you guys seeing?  I mean, it would seem like gambling
doesn't bring a clean sheet of money in; it brings a lot of dirty
money in with it.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Well, Kristi, one of the most interesting arenas of 
corruption when it comes to gambling is political corruption. In fact, 
it is probably the most dominant and the least talked about form of 
corruption.
<p>
The casino industry has become a major political funding machine in the 
United States of America, and what they do is they use their influence once
they get into a state to then begin to manipulate the legislature
according to their own whims and wishes, which is very dangerous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How do they do that, though?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Political contributions, and that has been --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So legal manipulation.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Absolutely, the legal manipulation. But what ends
up happening is situations like you have in Atlantic City, where
it starts legally, and then, the next thing you know, you have
a mayor being dragged off to prison because of the fact that it
gets illegal pretty quickly because of the influence peddling
that accompanies these large contributions.
<p>
But back to your earlier question. There are two basic themes about 
gambling, particularly about casinos, which is the rage right now, and 
that is, number one, casinos don't work.  I think everyone around the 
table agrees. They don't work as a means of economic development. And 
secondly, casinos cannibalize local economies.  They simply destroy 
human beings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, some people would say, though, you
set up a casino, you get the tax revenue, you have people there
using the dry cleaners, shopping at the grocery store --
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: No, that's not true.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  -- and it doesn't bring business in?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: No. Statistically, in fact, Robert Goodman, a professor from 
Massachusetts University, has a great new book out called <i>The Luck 
Business</i>, where he documents over 20 years of research.  Historically, 
this is the third wave of gambling in the United States.  And it helps, I 
think, to go back to a little bit of history.
<p>
Gambling has been here since the time that the boats first got here in the 
1600s. It had its first wave until about the Civil War, where the culture 
basically had enough of gambling and began to outlaw it at the state level.
<p>
The second wave began in 1931 when Bugsy Siegel succeeded in Nevada,
where he launched the first casino enterprise.  And it stayed
that way until 1976, with only one state in the Union having casinos.
Then in 1976, when Atlantic City came forward, this began the
third wave, which we are in the heart of.
<p>
After 20 years of experience from 1976 until 1996, what we now have is 
enough documentation to find out that casinos don't create jobs.  They 
actually destroy jobs.  In Atlantic City, within 10 years of the time that 
casinos came, one-third of all the restaurants were out of business.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, why is that?
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Because the casino is like a giant sponge.  It sucks up the 
revenue. It sucks up the local dollar.  It sucks up the family.  And it 
leaves nothing in its wake but destitution.
<p>
MR. GEER:  They compete with the local restaurants.  For example, many casinos 
use as a draw to get people into their establishment low-cost dinners or 
oftentimes free drinks or low-cost drinks, to the point where they are not
only -- I mean, they are competing with the local restaurants
for their own business as well as then cleaning out the wallets
of those people who come in there who have no money to spend anywhere
else.  They can't buy a shirt at a department store or go get
a cup of coffee at the local diner.
<p>
So it is not only in Atlantic City but in Mississippi, in Illinois, you see 
these restaurants drying up, and other establishments as well.
<p>
MR. HUFF: With the advent of legalized gambling in Atlantic City in the last 
25 years, they have gone from something like 2,100 businesses outside of
the gambling arena to like 1,100 businesses.  So we have about
reduced in half the number of businesses that are really putting
back into the economy instead of sucking out of the economy. 
Those legitimate business have been cut in half since gambling
came in in 1976.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: You know, and Dave mentioned that gambling has been around since 
the boats got here. But I find it rather interesting that the Virginia House 
of Burgesses, which was the first representative body of the new world, among 
their first orders of business, they passed stern laws against gambling,
drunkenness, idleness, and immorality.  And so it has always been
here, and we are talking about the impact that it is having on
families.
<p>
The majority of Americans approve of some form of legalized gambling, 
but they don't want it in their own backyard. So if it's in some distant 
city like Las Vegas or Atlantic City, it's okay, but they really don't 
want it in their own backyard. And one of the reasons why is when you begin 
to increase the access to gambling, the folks who gamble the most -- 
statistics -- there is a U.S. Government study that shows that lower income
people lose, on the average, three times more as a percentage
of their income than do middle and upper class people.
<p>
So for a middle-class person who could afford to travel in years past
to Atlantic City or Las Vegas, their gambling money was discretionary
spending money.  For the folks who are gambling today and buying
lottery tickets -- which, again, lower income families buy five
to ten times more lottery tickets than middle-income families
-- for them, this is not discretionary spending money.  This is
just as likely to be food money, clothing money, their rent money,
or whatever.  And so you have a desperate person in an act of
desperation.  Once they lose this money, they only find themselves
in a more desperate state.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So it's a tax on the poor, basically.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  It is.  It is the most regressive tax on the poor in 
America's history.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Yes, there are cases, studies, in Massachusetts, for example, 
in some of the poorest neighborhoods that show that families making less
than $10,000 a year are buying more than $2,000 a year in lottery
tickets.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  So it's a very regressive tax. And, also, back to the point 
that there's only a certain amount of money in circulation in an economy. 
A good example of what Michael Geer was talking about is, down in Virginia,
a border state to North Carolina, where they put the lottery into
effect back in 1988, the retail markets in the southeastern corner
of Virginia, down in Virginia Beach and all that area, which is
a pretty large area, over a million people, the retail merchants
saw their sales just plummet.
<p>
So they asked their local Economic Development Board to do a study, and they 
came back and they said, &quot;You've lost $430 million in a three-year 
period.&quot; They were able to, at that particular point, put the numbers 
on that.  Once the lottery or gambling becomes integrated into the
economy, then it's much more difficult to go back and establish
a base line and see what the effects are.  But in this particular
instance, they were able to very well document the loss to the
local retail merchants.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we haven't even talked about the implications of crime 
yet on the community.
<p>
When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to look at more of 
the cost of gambling to a town, to a city, to a state. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. We are looking at the issue of gambling and its tremendous 
negative impacts on a community, on a city, on a family.
<p>
Larry, you've got some interesting information there, taking a look at 
gambling.  What do you have for us there?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Yes, Kristi.  The attorney general of the state of
Maryland, just in October of this year, last month, just released
a report measuring the impact that gambling would have on the
issue of crime, and I want to read you a brief quote.  He said
this, quote:
<p><blockquote>
&quot;The impact would be this.  Casinos would bring
a substantial increase in crime to our state.  There would be
more violent crime, more crimes against property, more insurance
fraud, more white collar crime, more juvenile crime, more drug-
and alcohol-related crime, more domestic violence and child abuse,
and more organized crime.  Casinos would bring us exactly what
we do not need, a lot more of all kinds of crime.&quot;
</blockquote><p>
And again, this is the attorney general of the state of Maryland, who 
based this -- this is the executive summary of a long study that they
had done there in their state, with scientific measurable outcomes
on the impact that gambling has on communities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And do we believe that?  What's your perspective?  Do you 
think that crime really is a variable?
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  I think that crime definitely is a variable.  It increases 
crime. Some of the attorneys general around the country have said that. I 
think in Connecticut the attorney general up there a number of years ago 
made some very definitive statements about that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And yet crime is not our only problem.  When we are talking 
about crime, we are talking about an industry that sucks people into 
itself, and we have pathological gambling, compulsive gambling.  What are
you all seeing on that?
<p>
MR. HUFF:  Kristi, I think again what is happening is you have people -- as 
we said in the last segment, it is a regressive tax on the poor, and when 
folks are already having a difficult time, and then they get into gambling 
as a regular habit, that puts them in a more desperate situation, and
being in those desperate situations, then they are more inclined
to be involved in desperate behavior. So I think it is just a
regression all the way from tantalizing involvement to seeing
the roots of that fleshed out in crime.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Kristi, in Ohio, our attorney general serves with our governor 
on a coalition to prevent casino gambling from passing on a statewide ballot
initiative.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: And we have been battling that since 1989.  We are looking at it 
again this year.
<p>
When you talk about crime, you have to understand that gambling
is an addictive form of behavior.  Everybody knows that.  Not
everybody gets hooked, but the percentage of people who do exhibit
the same criminal tendencies as other people in addicted forms
of behavior, and that especially applies to matters like property
crime.
<p>
Crime in Atlantic City went up 300 percent with the advent
of casinos.  Now, they can blame it on people, but I've got news
for you.  The correlation just is not there.  When you have a
situation where people need money to take care of their fix, they're
going to hit property crimes; you're going to have petty crimes
and this sort of thing, the aggravated personal -- these are very
much in-your-face crimes.
<p>
The other form of crime that is very aggravated with casinos and with 
expanded gambling is embezzlement, the white collar crime, where people 
who are law-abiding, decent, middle-management types suddenly, because 
of their fix, start stealing from their employer.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: My understanding is that you also see, maybe through some 
of the crime issues, a decrease in property values in the areas surrounding 
casinos, even stretching 10 miles and 20 miles out away from that facility.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: That's an excellent point, and it is almost never brought up
in the debate.  That is the fact that when a casino gets in or
riverboats get in your backyard or back puddle, depending on what
it might be, suddenly the crime factor drives tax rates up because
of enforcement, which drives property rates down.  So people that
were sitting in cozy little suburbs suddenly find a new reason
for flight, and their property values go down.  So a casino in
your neighborhood could be a disastrous idea.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the issue, I know, that you all are looking at on a state 
level, people are fighting the tax issue, and yet there is a direct 
correlation between the influx of gambling and the increased cost of law 
enforcement and prison kinds of monies.
<p>
Does this resonate with the lawmakers you are talking to at all, that 
you are going to be caught paying more in police protection, more in 
prisons, more in property crimes?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, it really depends on what is influencing the
legislators.  I mean, many of them are willing to look at the
debate and to understand the facts and to understand the empirical
evidence, as David has pointed out, and everyone else here, about
the reality of it.  Many of them, though, are influenced by political
contributions and other things that tend to blind them, if you
will, purposefully, to some of these factors.
<p>
But studies have been done in Alabama and in a number of different states, 
in Mississippi, in North Dakota, that indicate that, for the amount of tax 
revenue that comes into state or local officials, to the tax coffers,
they are spending more in terms of dealing with the compulsive
gambling.  When you have embezzlement, you have a situation where
there has to be money involved in that, or the social costs in
terms of helping those who are compulsive gamblers themselves,
a psychological addiction, as well as the cost of adding additional
policemen.  There is not a city that has allowed casinos in it
that has not had to significantly beef up their law enforcement
staff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. GEER: Nobody wants more policemen if the reason for more policemen is 
because they have more crime, and that is what this will invite.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And the costs don't always balance out, do they?  The costs 
to a community in lost property values and increased crime.
<p>
MR. GEER: Well, again, these studies indicate that actually more money is 
spent in tax dollars than they bring in, and so it is a loss.
<p>
MR. HUFF: I think the perfect example of that is in Mobile, Alabama.  Mayor
Mike Dow, who was in favor of bringing gambling in because he
thought it would enhance the economic situation in Mobile, commissioned
a study of 41 social service executives, and they found that the
impact on the cost for the city of Mobile would be $15 million
for one city alone in social service costs to counter the problems
that gambling would effect.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: This brings back up, Kristi, the issue of good public policy. 
It is not good public policy for any government agency to advocate that 
people throw their money away.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: It is just not healthy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That sounds logical to me.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: It is just not healthy, especially then when you consider 
the incredible costs that accompany this kind of compulsive behavior.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  And that is one of the ironies, too.  Many times
gambling is sold on the back of school kids.  The first thing
they will do is tell you that the lottery is going to benefit
education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: And the national study shows that states that earmark some 
or all of their gambling revenues for education, less than 4 percent of 
the education budget goes towards schools.
<p>
Just last year in Missouri, less than 2 percent of the state's education 
budget came from gambling revenues, and we have the lottery and riverboat 
gambling. That amounts to a little bit less than $5 per month per student 
enrolled in public schools in grades K-12, and there is a tremendous price
tag that comes along with it.
<p>
I would just like to revisit a second this issue of the crime, because 
the industry does talk about the fact that the crime rate does not increase. 
See, they talk about in terms of crime rate, and that is the amount of 
crime per person coming through, and they say if you have an influx
of a large number of people anywhere, crime will increase.
<p>
One of the things that we have seen in Missouri is, for instance,
the little town of Branson that has a population of 33,000 people
has an influx of 6 million tourists a year, and their crime rate,
which is the incidence of crime per the number of people coming
in, has not substantially increased at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And Branson is a family town, country music and --
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: Yes.  So it is not the quantity of people coming through 
as much as it is the quality of the people that you are attracting.
<p>
The New Jersey Crime Commission said, after reviewing all the statistics,
that, in their opinion, it was inescapable that casino gambling
is a magnet for street criminals.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I was interested, when I was a reporter and Indiana 
was looking at a lottery, I asked one of the state officials if they were 
going to have a state fund for compulsive gamblers.  Since we say, well,
we'll have a drunk driving program, are we going to have a state
compulsive gambler program?  And he didn't answer my question.
<p>
But what are you finding at the state level?  Who helps these
people?
<p>
MR. GEER:  Well, that's really kind of one of the unfortunate
things, at least in my view, in terms of how this fight has gone
on, because there are compulsive gambling organizations that have
arisen that are helping those people who are caught in addictive
gambling.
<p>
In Pennsylvania, though, what they have done is struck
a deal with those who want to bring casinos and say, &quot;You
just give us a million dollars a year and we'll keep quiet about
opposing this.&quot;  And so they, in the interest of wanting
to help people, they think if they get money in that they are
going to be able to help people, and yet they are not standing
in opposition to this.
<p>
You know, as we talk about all of these statistics that are out there, 
I think it is the anecdotal things that we hear about.  I don't think 
there is any of us that does not know someone, somewhere, who has been 
caught in the web of addictive gambling, whether it is a businessman who 
might be listening to this who knows one of their employees who is 
embezzling. I talked to one in Erie, Pennsylvania, who had a woman who 
worked for him for many, many years.  She got caught in embezzling and
then ended up having to be fired.
<p>
So there are many people who hear these statistics, and they think, 
Well, it's not going to affect my family.  But the reality is that it 
will. And so all of us who hear these things have to realize that these 
are real people who are getting caught in this.  These are real damages
that will be caused to my communities, and I'm going to have to
stand up and stop it.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: You know, Michael, the thing that a lot of people aren't 
seeing now but are going to see more and more of is the issue of how this 
affects my family, my children, because statistics show that where casinos 
are, kids start showing up, and gambling is on the rise with those young 
people.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Some of the statistics that we have seen, for example, in 
Atlantic City, there was a survey that found that 25,000 teenagers or 
minors were ejected from casinos in a single year, and 230,000 were denied
admission.
<p>
If gambling is there in a community, the teenagers will want to take 
advantage of it, just as they see their parents setting an example 
and gambling themselves.  If the state is saying it's okay, then to 
teenagers, yes, that's okay; the state has said this is a fine thing for 
us to do.
<p>
And when you get down to the level of how it impacts families, it really 
destroys families. We have several chapters of Gamblers Anonymous in North 
Carolina, not started because we have gambling in North Carolina legally,
but from people who have moved down from states that have gambling,
and they have set up Gamblers Anonymous chapters because that
is the only way that they are able to continue to deal with the
problem once they recognize that they are compulsive gamblers.
 They have to be in a support group to be able to deal with that
problem.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, there's a lot of human destruction
going on out there in the name of good government.
<p>
When we come back, <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i> 
is going to talk about some of the gambling initiatives at the local level
in each of these states.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. We are talking about gambling and the tremendous impact
it has on families at the state and local level.
<p>
Larry, you have worked on a lot of these gambling issues.  Where is the 
fight now as we are looking at it?
<p>
MR. HUFF: Well, Kristi, clearly, with lotteries in 37 states and casinos 
in 23 states and initiatives in a host of other states to bring the same 
to their own state, it is clearly on the state level.  I mean, there is a 
big push to legalize casino gambling probably more than anything else in
almost every state in the Union.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: They came at Ohio in 1989 in the legislature and their 
attempt failed.  In 1990 they went to the ballot and got beat two to 
one, thumped royally.  They came back again twice in the legislature,
and now they are back again with another ballot initiative for
1996, again riverboats.  The proposal changes a little bit every
time.
<p>
But, really, what is happening in the country is the evidence
is beginning to crest against them.  They have probably hit their
high-water mark, provided that citizens are not intimidated by
their big revenue and their big sales pitch.
<p>
You know, there is gambling in 23 states as far as the casino type, but 
there are only 10 states that have it, aside from the Indian reservations,
which is now a federal issue.  So they need more states, but they
are having a tough time to get them.  Since 1994, they have been
getting beat up on the ballot regularly.  So citizens are beginning
to have an impact, but they've got to get involved.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: And it is important, too, that you look at the standpoint 
that, up until now -- and the information, as Dave said, is becoming
more and more readily available, and it goes against the industry,
because states have been in this very unique position of having
to both promote and regulate gambling.  They have become so dependent
upon the revenues that they have had to promote it; by the same
token, they have had to regulate it.  And so the evidence as it
begins to mount now is going to begin to show that the decisions
that they have made in fact have cost them more money that they
make them.
<p>
It is like nutritionists say that you could eat celery
and that you would actually burn up more calories chewing and
digesting celery than what you would get nutritionally from it.
And that's the same thing with gambling.  It looks like the coffers
are full, but in the end the states are going to starve to death
if they continue to rely upon it for revenue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is astounding.  So, basically, the money -- it is 
all administrative, all, who knows, corruption, whatever, all legal fees, 
and very little in actual revenues.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA:  It is the social costs associated with it as well.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: And it is important to note that, again, it is the money 
that it sucks out of the economy that would be spent on bread and milk,
on carpet, on furniture, on refrigerators.  Anyone who owns a
small business in the retail side, anyone who is in the restaurant
business, and certainly anybody who has an employee base of manufacturers
should fight this thing tooth and nail because they are a massive
loser, a massive loser.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead.
<p>
MR. GEER: And this is not a little boy crying &quot;Wolf!&quot;  I 
mean, there is evidence.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI: Certainly.
<p>
MR. GEER: This book is full of the evidence of every community that has 
adopted these, with all of the promises that were made of economic 
revitalization, and it has not worked.  And it is those businessmen, those 
businesswomen who own the restaurants, who own the refrigerator/appliance 
stores or the clothing stores, (who) are the ones who are paying the
price now.
<p>
As for those communities that don't have it, those people need to step up 
to the plate and say, &quot;We're going to fight this with our dollars, 
with our influence, and get involved.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the book again is <i>The Lucky Business</i>, for 
those of you just joining us, with Robert Goodman.
<p>
So it is not the savior of a city?
<p>
MR. GEER: Not at all.
<p>
MR. BROOKS:  You know, Kristi, one of the things that we have seen in 
North Carolina, for example, as the evidence has been presented -- David 
was talking about how it takes a lot of money to sell lies, but in our 
case, all we have been able to do is to actually present the evidence
to legislators and to others who would listen on the gambling
issue, pointing out how it impacts the poor, it harms the poor,
it creates compulsive gamblers, and it destroys retail businesses.
<p>
I was testifying before a Senate committee a couple of years ago,
and back in the gallery were sitting all the convenience store
owners, and they were there to testify in favor of the lottery
bill.  Well, when I presented the evidence that I shared a while
ago about Virginia, there was this little buzz that started back
in the back of the room, and after the meeting I was able to give
them more information.
<p>
They came back this time in our legislature and were against. They 
had taken a position actually against the lottery privately. Publicly, 
they had set their numbers so high as to what they had to get to sell 
tickets, so they knew nobody would buy it.
<p>
So that was an interesting case of where a group of retail businessmen 
actually looked at the numbers and said, &quot;Yes, this is really 
true,&quot; and they checked with their cohorts in Georgia on the other 
side of us and in Virginia with the convenience store people, and they 
found out, yes, this is a real revenue loser for our businesses.  So that 
is the kind of thing where just getting the information out to people and
letting them see what the facts are can really make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Has the Federal Government saying that gambling
on the Indian reservations and all these newly discovered tribes
looking for newly discovered gambling licenses, has this impacted
you all negatively as you are looking at the gambling issue? 
In some ways, the Federal Government seems to have thrown its
weight in that area on the behalf of the gamblers.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Yes, we have seen the situation develop in North Carolina 
where we've got one tribe who is looking for recognition.  They happen
to be a tribe that is located, if in fact they are a tribe, right
on I-95, halfway between North Carolina and Florida.
<p>
MR. GEER: Just coincidentally.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, coincidentally.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: Between New York and Florida.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BROOKS: But we have the Cherokee Indian Nation in western North 
Carolina, and we are somewhat perplexed as to how federal law deals with
this whole area, because federal law says that the Indians can
do in a state what the state allows.  Well, we only allow bingo
in North Carolina for charitable purposes.  Well, they have been
running bingo for years, but now, all of a sudden, they have decided
that they are going to put in casinos, and they simply have gone
in and put in two casinos.
<p>
I have been out there and looked at them, and they are the same kinds of 
casinos they have in Cripple Creek, Colorado, and some of the others. They 
have all the games and the one-armed bandits, electronic now -- there is 
no arm. But they are basically doing what we think is in violation of
the federal law, and there is a real squishy area there as to
who prosecutes.  The North Carolina attorney general says it is
not his responsibility because it's a federal law.  But yet, then
you rely on the federal district attorneys to prosecute, and so
far we haven't seen anything coming out of this administration
to indicate that they are going to do anything about it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is not surprising.
<p>
MR. SCIANNA: This is also a tool that the industry uses against states as 
well. They pressure states and say, &quot;If you don't bring gambling in, 
then some Indian reservation will have it, and you're going to lose the chance
at getting the revenue as well.&quot;  And it is just that pressure,
that extra lever that they use to pry it in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So we are probably going to see a more federalizing, then, 
of the gambling issue, perhaps.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  Well, the Indian question is going to have to be dealt with, 
because as the waves of gambling go, historically, once you hit the high-water 
mark, then you see things begin to roll back.
<p>
What is tragic, absolutely tragic, is what our government, with our tax 
dollars, has permitted to let happen to the Indian people.  I mean, we thought 
what happened to them the first time around was bad.  Look at what we are 
doing to them this time.  It is a disaster.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is very disappointing.
<p>
MR. ZANOTTI:  And it is all going to come back, because the 
negativities of gambling will cycle.
<p>
There was an instance just in northern California. You all probably heard 
about the Pomo Palace incident on an Indian reservation just a few months
ago, where they ended up in a shooting war for 11 days, I believe
it was, or 11 people were seriously injured.  They were up and
down the streets just like in the wild, wild west that started
out over a fist fight, which started out over an election over
who would control the Indian casino, the Pomo Palace.  People
ended up dead and wounded in the streets over this matter.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Amazing. You know, obviously, we are going to have to
keep watching this.  It is not going to go away.
<p>
I would like to thank my guests for being with us today.  Please stay

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> takes a look at 
issues involving what some in our country see as the greatest tragedy we 
have allowed to permeate society since slavery, the sorrow of abortion. 
<p>
The pro-life movement held its annual March for Life on Monday, January 22, 
coinciding with the anniversary of the infamous <i>Roe v. Wade</i> Supreme 
Court decision. It's a case which tears the heart of our Nation in two. 
Since then, the pro-life and pro-abortion movements have been bitterly
locked together hoping to influence government and impact the
lives of Americans in the struggle.
<p>
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> will bring you guests who are taking a look at 
where our country has been and currently stands in this abortion battle.  But 
the conflict goes much further than official Washington, and so we will be
talking with the new wave of pro-life activities.
<p>
But first, <i>Straight Talk</i> would like to show you some of the March for 
Life participants, who are rarely allowed to express their views in the media. 
We hope to show you some faces that look familiar, because they are
the faces of your mother, your sister, or your neighbor, someone
who has an opinion with whom you can identify and not be embarrassed
by the radical tirades so often portrayed in media coverage.
<p>
Let's hear why these individuals marched for life, reasons you probably
won't read in the newspapers or see on broadcast news, as <i>Straight
Talk</i> takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>

<p>
[March for Life segments follow:]
<p>
MARCHER:  I don't know if I can, but I had two children out of wedlock, 
and it was my choice, and my husband and I now are proud parents because
we chose life and not abortion, and I'm sorry.  And my husband's
here for a personal reason from an older experience, and we just
think that if we could get everybody to listen to us and to know
that conception is the time that life begins and that it's not
later on, and these partial-birth abortions are the worst thing
I could ever imagine or think of.  There are plenty of us out
here who would adopt babies and who would take babies and who
can't have them, and that's why we're here, just to be heard.
<p>
MARCHER: We're hoping this makes a big impact on all the politicians
that are against the new bill that they're trying to pass.
<p>
MARCHER: Just not enough education for women, and that's why they make
the choice.  The doctors don't tell them enough and nurses don't
tell them enough, and they don't have enough education to know
that they're killing somebody and not taking a bloody mass out
of them.
<p>
INTERVIEWER:  What do you see as a viable alternative to this, to 
abortion?
<p>
MARCHER:  Lots of women who are raped decide that that's what they want 
to do because it was under such a vile circumstance.  But if you can just 
hang in there for nine months, just for the baby, and give enough of that 
of yourself, there's plenty of people out there who would adopt babies. I 
know there's lots of kids in foster homes now, but the problem is trying to
be solved, and there are responsible people out there who would
love to have the children.
<p>
I guess the most beautiful choice would be to raise your child, no matter 
what circumstance the child was conceived under.  Children just bring a 
great joy to your life, and I can't explain it.  You have to -- I don't 
know -- if you're a mother, you know.
<p>
MARCHER:  This is an issue that affects so many women, and what we believe is 
that, in the situation of a crisis pregnancy, the solution is to eliminate 
the crisis and not the child.  Abortion has not been the solution for women
that NOW and other so-called feminists claim it has been, and
we're here to say that you can choose life and be there for both
the woman and the child.
<p>
INTERVIEWER:  What do you see as the alternative for women [inaudible]?
<p>
MARCHER:  All kinds of situations, solutions: helping them through legal 
means, keeping their jobs, child support enforcement, getting the men in on 
this, you know, because they're half responsible, aren't they?
<p>
MARCHER: I'm here because I wanted to speak out against abortion.  I think 
that it's wrong, and I came to speak to our Congressman about it, but
I was really disappointed about the way it turned out.  The march
is going better, though.  It is more positive, and I think it
is lifting everybody up.  It's really great.
<p>
MARCHER: I'm definitely in support of getting rid of abortion.  I don't 
think it should be an option that is supported by our country.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: What do you see as alternatives [inaudible]?
<p>
MARCHER: That we should educate young women and young men of how to protect 
themselves from getting in a situation that might cause an abortion.
<p>
MARCHER: I think adoption is a good idea.  If you can't take care of the
child, I'm sure there's somebody out there that would really like
to.
<p>
MARCHER:  I'm here today because I'm on the battlefield for
life.  I am adamantly against death by abortion, and it's a life-and-death
issue.  You can't deny it.  If there's life in the womb, you have
to go in there to kill it, and that's what these abortionists
do, and they say, &quot;When does life begin?&quot;  It doesn't
matter.  They don't go in there and kill the life until the life
is there.  So, basically, it is a life-and-death situation.
<p>
The definition of abortion, according to Webster's dictionary, is
the termination of a pregnancy resulting in the death of a developing
human.  If there's death, there had to be life, and if there was
life and now death, it's murder.
<p>
The basic thing is that all women know, when they have sex, that they have 
run the risk of becoming pregnant.  They should be ready to accept the 
responsibility for their actions.  We have alternatives of adoption, we have 
crisis centers.  Every archdiocese of New York, especially our Cardinal
has said, Any woman that becomes pregnant, we will take care of
you, and if you don't want the baby, we will put it up for adoption.
 And a lot of the other bishops have said the same thing.  The
alternative is there.  You accepted the sex situation.  You're
pregnant; accept the responsibility.  Be a human being.  Don't
kill the human being within you.
<p>
MARCHER:  I'm here today to march for life because of the sanctity and the 
beautifulness of life, and I'm so glad to see this huge crowd.
<p>
MARCHER: We are here, the marchers, because we do not agree in abortion, 
and so we would like to see the laws changed so that abortion would be 
stopped and outlawed in our land, because it is murder.  No matter how
small that little fetus is, it is a human being, and they have
not been given a right to live.  Their right has been snuffed
out before they even get a chance to protest.  People are taking
their rights from them, and as I said, they are humans.  They
are gifts of God, and they have every right to be born.
<p>
I do not wish any person, woman, teenager, that has had an abortion, I
do not condemn them.  God loves them as well as He does everyone
else.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
begins our discussion about abortion and where the debate
is taking place today.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: <i>Roe v. Wade</i> has got to go, hey, hey, ho, ho! <i>Roe 
v. Wade</i> has got to go.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  January 22, 1996, marked the 23rd anniversary of a decision 
that became one of the most famous and controversial court cases in our 
Nation's history, <i>Roe versus Wade</i>. Jane Roe, a pseudonym for Norma 
McCorvey(?), challenged Texas' 1857 statute making abortion illegal, and 
she won, bringing us to what pro-life advocates battle against today,
the legal authority for women to abort unborn children.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS:  Holy Mary, mother of God, pray for us sinners
now and in the hour of our death.  Amen.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To remind the Nation of this landmark decision, thousands of 
pro-life activists from across the United States marched from the White 
House to the Supreme Court steps, hoping to stir the hearts and minds of
our country's leaders and citizens.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: Mr. Policeman(?), tell me why unborn babies have to die.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Included in this year's March for Life was Norma McCorvey
herself.  Just a short time ago, Ms. McCorvey rocked the pro-abortion
movement by denouncing her 1973 decision and by announcing that
she had embraced the faith of so many of those who had prayed
outside the clinic doors she had helped open.
<p>
Has this stand against abortion forced women and men to consider the 
ramifications of abortion?  Or has the Nation accepted abortion as a 
viable means of birth control?  The 1996 March for Life participants don't
think so and, in marching, are sending their message loud and
clear to a nation and a world.
<p>
[March segment]
<p>
MARCHERS: Pro-choice, that's a lie.  Babies never choose to die.
<p>
MARCHER: I love you, Mom.  Thanks for saving me.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you could see, this year's March for Life was extremely 
successful in bringing individuals from across the Nation.
<p>
So to fill us in on why the pro-life movement is not giving up in the 
face of a pro-abortion Presidency and the liberal elite, we are talking to 
Cathy Deeds, Deputy Director of Government Relations for the Family Research 
Council, and Frederica Mathews-Green, a syndicated columnist and author of 
<i>Real Choices</i>. Welcome.  Thanks so much for joining me.
<p>
Frederica, you've been looking at abortion -- I read a very interesting 
article of yours in <i>Policy Review</i> -- as a societal issue, and I found 
it interesting about your background that you were involved in Feminists for
Life, which to some people is probably a little bit of a non-sequitur.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  A contradiction in terms, that's right.  Well,
one of the reasons I came to Feminists for Life was that, 20 years
ago, I was a feminist for abortion.  So I have had a complete
change-around on the issue, and because of that, I am particularly
interested in persuasion and in helping people to turn around
and to begin to envision America without abortion.  We don't have
to go on with the status quo.  So I'm more concerned with that
than with politics, which kind of represents the two arms of the
movement, I think.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's true.  What accomplished your change on the issue 
of abortion?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I read a description of an abortion in <i>Esquire</i> 
magazine, of all places. A doctor had asked to observe an abortion when a 
friend did one, and he described the woman lying on the table, and the 
doctor took the needle and stuck it into her abdomen, and then he began
to see how that the needle began to jerk and shake as the baby
died.  It was such a horrifying description to me, and at that
time I thought it was just a glob of tissue.  It never occurred
to me there was actually a baby in there fighting for its life.
 And that turned me around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And that is pivotal, and we got to meet you. In your book, 
you were talking about why women were choosing abortion and why they were 
then, some, choosing not to have abortion.  As the pro-life movement kind 
of assesses where it is, what is moving the discussion from abortion to life?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I think that, paradoxically, one of the good
things that happened was that we had some losses.  I know this
sounds ironic, but I think that the fact that the Casey decision
was in some ways a setback for the pro-life movement, that we
had Bill Clinton elected President, that we took some punches
in the last few years, has allowed our friends on the pro-choice
side to begin to examine their own ambivalence.  And we're starting
to see this come out in some magazine articles and some other
places.
<p>
And as they begin to look at their ambivalence, they begin
to admit what I had to admit, that it actually is a child, and
is this really what we want?  Do we want an America where a million
and a half unborn children are being killed every year?  That
begins to open doors toward finding some solutions, I think.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You are noting ironically now that we have the most
pro-abortion President in the history of America, signing on the
anniversary of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, within days of his being sworn in,
a series of executive orders to take abortion even further.  And
yet abortion numbers have been going down.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN: Abortion numbers have gone down just very slightly, 
and it's one of those things you don't want to make too much of because
there are so many factors that might be influencing this.
<p>
One of the most hopeful, I think, is that polls done recently of teenage
kids say they're choosing abstinence at a much higher rate than
ever before.  The rates of children that are in high school that
are having sex before marriage are dropping and dropping.  Who
knows?  Maybe they are just coming to their senses.  But I would
certainly hope that that is one of the factors.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And then, hand-in-glove with the societal changes, we see 
change, Cathy Deeds, up on Capitol Hill.  Cathy has been up there for
quite a while.
<p>
The strategy on the issue of abortion in in some ways a hostile 
legislating environment has been interesting. It has not been a 
straight-up, let's-go-for-the-constitutional-amendment approach. 
How would you describe the strategy today as it parallels
and tracks the sort of change in abortion attitudes in the culture?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, I think we have a unique situation in the 104th
Congress because we have a pro-life Congress.  The majority of
the Congress is pro-life.  That has not been the case for years
and years.  So there are some things we can do because of that.
<p>
The problem is, as we have been talking about, we have a pro-abortion
President.  So although Congress may pass very strong pro-life
bills, they will not get past this abortion President.  So we
really have to look at issues of consensus.  There are many issues
like federal funding, for example, that the majority of people
oppose their tax dollars being used to fund abortion, those kinds
of things, and Congress has passed some of those measures this
year, and a few have gotten to President Clinton when it's in
another bill.
<p>
But I think if we look at issues in this current political situation, 
where we have the majority of the people, that's a possibility.  But it 
is a difficult situation.  We have a pro-abortion President who will veto 
a straight pro-life bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So in some ways a growing legal availability of
abortion has created some discomfort and led us to some consensus-possible
ground on partial birth.  The Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act --
Cathy, we want you to give us an update on that -- was fascinating
because people who had never cast a pro-life vote in their entire
lives said, &quot;I'm not in favor of taking children who are
viable outside the womb,&quot; which would be the majority of
those children who are pulled from the womb, a Metzenbaum scissors
stabbed in the base of their skull, and living brain tissue extracted,
killing them, and then removing the child.  And a lot of people
cast a vote for life on that.
<p>
Cathy, what is the status of that bill?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  Well, we talked about that a little bit on this
program a month or so ago, and yes, it's very exciting that the
bill was passed overwhelmingly in the House and in the Senate,
by a narrow margin, but it did pass.  The Senate added some minor
amendments that we were able to support, but therefore, the House
and the Senate have two different versions of the bill, so it
has to be worked out, and most likely the House will take the
bill up again and then it will go to the President.  I am sure
of the timing, maybe a month or so.  And, of course, he has vowed
to veto this bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  It is just incredible to think -- I mean, we have done a 
tremendous, I think, education campaign.  A number of people have seen the 
ads that actually depict this procedure.  We have talked about that, 
actually seen what's happening.  This is a partially born child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is right.
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  The Supreme Court never addressed the issue of a partially 
delivered baby.  Clearly, most people think that is wrong, and as you said, 
so many entrenched typically pro-abortion members supported a ban on this.  
And yet President Clinton, who is such an extremist on this issue, is still 
going to veto this.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Right.  You know, the majority of Americans are not even 
aware that abortion can take place after the first trimester.  They think 
that it is only in that first three months, and they are appalled to know 
that there is no legal reason why you can't pull a nine-month child out and 
kill them.
<p>
What other kinds of consensus, Frederica, do you see as possible
as you look at the way that society is going on abortion?
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  I think one of the things that is starting to
emerge is the voice of women who have had abortions who are experiencing
terrible grief.  I believe you will be talking about that later
in this show.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  But if you have had 33 million abortions now, I 
believe, in America -- and because of the repeat factor, I am not sure exactly 
how many women that involves -- but that millions and millions of women who 
have been told that abortion was a gift to you; it's a blessing; you
should rejoice; you have no right to sorrow; you have no right
to grieve -- and they grieve in silence, but you can't keep that
inside forever -- and I am seeing a rising tide of abortion grief
breaking forth as women talk about it.  I think this may become
a really overwhelming force.
<p>
So this is something that again will continue the change in the public feeling 
about abortion.  One of the problems we've had is, we've been saying, 
&quot;It's a baby,&quot; and they're saying, &quot;No, it's a woman's 
right.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes.
<p>
MS. MATHEWS-GREEN:  When women start saying, &quot;No, it broke my 
heart,&quot; that shoots that argument apart.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I want to hold up Frederica's book, <i>Real Choices</i>.
It's the kind of book that you have to encourage people to read,
because it's the heart behind the event.
<p>
It is interesting that when I was a reporter, I interviewed a psychologist 
who was not a person of faith at all, who said that he got involved in 
post-abortion counseling because women were testing as having been sexually
violated when they reported having had an abortion experience,
women who had not been raped, not been molested, and yet this
abortion was a violation of them.
<p>
Cathy, we don't have a lot of time.  Any other bills besides partial birth 
that we need to be watching?
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  There's a number of funding restrictions that we're trying 
to get enacted that are, unfortunately, bottled up in some of the 
appropriations bills that are stalled in the Senate or that the President 
has vetoed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So people need to be writing --
<p>
MS. DEEDS:  So we are working on that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have to encourage people to get some pluralized(?)
sentiment in letters and read the book.
<p>
MS. DEEDS: And also, you know, we are somewhat discouraged on the federal 
level at times with a pro-abortion President, but certainly efforts could
take place on a state level, and the state legislatures are restricting
abortion funding, and there's lots going on at the state level.
So people can watch that, too.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That will be fantastic.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we speak to an attorney
who represents those whose lives have tragically been affected
by the malpractice of abortion doctors.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would
now like to welcome Helen Donovan, an attorney who represents
individuals and their families who have been severely affected
by the mistakes which are sometimes fatal made by abortion doctors.
 It is a whole new kind of malpractice suit, and thank you so
much for joining us, Helen.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I have seen some of the different random cases.  I think
one of the big differences now is this is not random at all. You represent 
one of several attorneys in a national perspective who are saying there 
are malpractice issues taking place here, and there is something we need 
to be looking at.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: They are taking place all over the country.  Ours is a small
firm, Amshoff, Donovan and Smith, and we represent women all over
the country.  There are attorneys in every state who are representing
women, but our goal is to more or less go out there and say, wherever
you are, we would be willing to look at your records and see whether
you may have a legal claim.  We don't take cases unless there
is merit to them, meaning there was malpractice, there was negligence,
there was a lack of informed consent, there are real damages.
<p>
There are many women out there who, unfortunately, have been violated
somehow, but they may not have a case.  But I think everyone would
be surprised at how many thousands of women there are out there
who do have real legitimate, alive claims, in the sense that they
meet the statute of limitations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In terms of malpractice issues and abortion, do you find that 
that as a surgical procedure, given that I know your firm initially just 
looked at malpractice in general and now is looking at some of this 
specifically, is there a higher rate of incidence in abortion cases, in 
abortion practices, than other kinds of surgical procedures?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I think it would be hard to say that.  One of the problems with
the whole abortion issue is the statistics and reporting.  We
know there are deaths out there, and we know they are not reported.
We know there are sterilizations, as in life-saving hysterectomies,
that don't go reported, in all different ways of reporting, whether
they don't get reported to the vital statistics bureau or whether
they have no requirement to report them at all, you know, they
are a clinic or a doctor's office.  So it is very hard to say.
<p>
Because the procedure is so underregulated and there are many
physicians who are operating, you know, like they moved to a new
town, changed their name, and got their license renewed, I would,
in general, say that there are more complications.  Some of them
are uninsured.  Many of the physicians are uninsured, so they
just can push the woman out and that's the end of it, and they
know that she's not going to come back to their clinic when she
starts to have an emergency situation.  She is usually going to
go to the hospital.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are the typically kinds of injuries that you are 
seeing? Or maybe it is not typical. But what is kind of the breadth of 
injuries?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, there is a range.  We see some conditions where the 
woman started to hemorrhage a couple of days after the abortion.  She ended
up going to the emergency room and they did another D&amp;C on
her.  Very traumatic for her, probably not a big-time case.  She
may have had retained parts.  That is very common.  She may have,
unfortunately, passed the head of the baby in the toilet.  She
is certainly traumatized by that, but it is going to be difficult
sometimes for us to find a doctor to say, &quot;Yes, that was
a breach of the standard of care, equals negligence; you've got
a malpractice case.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: And the other gamut would be death.  There are numerous 
fatalities out there, and those occur in hospitals as a result of clinic
abortions and as a result of doctor's office abortions.  Doctor's
office abortions and clinic abortions kind of get mixed together,
because many places the people presume that's an abortion clinic.
You know, it has the names on it like a clinic.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.  It has kind of the look of the traditional clinic.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  It is listed under &quot;Abortion services&quot; in
the Yellow Pages.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: It turns out that it is actually operating as a doctor's 
office, which means it doesn't have to meet any of the state requirements 
for an ambulatory surgical facility if that state has a regulation
that says abortion clinics and/or ambulatory surgical facilities
will have the following services available.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So they're sort of making it appear they have one set of 
services and having a completely other set.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, it's a doctor's office, so it has nobody measuring the 
standards or anything like that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So what kinds of cases are you looking at, then,
in terms of that?  What are some of the horror stories you have
seen with your own eyes?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN:  Well, certainly we have a number of death cases on our docket, 
and I am reluctant to talk about our cases before there is a judgment or a 
settlement; one, because we never want to be accused of taking our case to 
the media.
<p>
But I do look in the papers and track as many other cases
as I can, and I am sure many people are familiar with the recent
conviction of the New York physician who killed a woman.  Well,
he had five -- his license was already revoked and he was appealing
it, so they still let him practice medicine, and he had numerous
other violations, and he is one who had changed his name and moved
to a new part of town.
<p>
I just heard of a terrible situation in Florida where apparently a 
girl may be facing a number of amputations because of complications.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  She was a diabetic or she had a circulation problem 
following the abortion?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I am not familiar with all the facts.  Actually, a news source
called me and asked me about that one.  Numerous young girls die
from abortion.  In Chicago, a 13-year-old; Alabama, 18-year-old;
Houston, Texas, 15-year-old and immigrant.  And that is also very
common.  Young girls who are very afraid, who aren't going to
ask lots of questions, and who also may not have a good understanding
of their own medical history.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Who probably wouldn't know the questions to ask even 
if they asked a lot.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Right, or maybe they don't understand the informed consent 
form, but they're not going to ask, &quot;Yeah, I'd like to really talk
to the doctor about this informed consent form.  I'd like to have
him explain to me what perforation means or what hemorrhage means.&quot;
You know, they are not going to go into the details that that
might require.  Or if they do ask, they are going to be told,
&quot;Oh, don't worry about those.  That never happens.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What have you seen in terms of jury reactions and
judge reactions to the emotional trauma issues?  I mean, so often
pain and suffering is the jury button to push, it would appear.
So for a person who did pass a head, did pass limbs, and was
traumatically faced with the fact that there is a person inside
myself who has died and I am very traumatized by that, are juries
and judges at all empathetic to that for these women?
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: I think it varies.  There are some precedents where women 
who did pass the baby afterwards did recover for emotional damages,
and that would be sort of strictly emotional images.  There are
other cases where that gets no sympathy.  I would say that judges
and juries vary as Americans vary, and it is very difficult to
predict in any case how it is going to go.
<p>
Many people have no sympathy for the woman who chose an abortion, 
regardless of the fact that this is medical care provided in their 
community, and it is obviously substandard, and you would think that 
everybody would be just as concerned about this procedure as any, but --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of time yet, but have the feminists
and some of the liberal women's organizations come alongside you?
 I mean, this would seem like a women's health issue; yet my understanding
is that women have distanced themselves from it.
<p>
MS. DONOVAN: Well, I would say that the radical feminist movement would 
like us to just shut up and go away.  We are often portrayed as just
harassing doctors and clinics and things like that, which is hardly
the case.  We cannot afford, both money or resource-wise, to prosecute
any case that is not meritorious.
<p>
So we hope in the long run they will see that they have as much interest 
in protecting women from unsafe clinics and doctors as we do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you would.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will be talking to a man who took
it upon himself to help women in crisis pregnancies.  Please stay
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Tonight we are talking about abortion and its 
effects on individuals' lives, and I am joined by Woody FitzHugh, a golf 
professional who has a testimony of his own and decided to given women a 
viable option to abortion.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Thank you, Kristi.  Nice to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thanks for being with us.
<p>
You have been interested in the pro-life movement for quite a while, but 
how initially did you decide to get involved in creating an alternative? 
We will get into what the alternative is in a second.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Okay. Well, the transformation in my life I owe to two 
people who inspired me.  Firstly would be Jesus Christ and secondly is
my wife, who has stuck me all these years and been very supportive
in everything I've done.
<p>
It was actually in 1994 when, as Bill Clinton became President and he 
signed a fetal tissue research bill on June 10, I just had a furious 
feeling towards him and I wanted to something to help the situation, 
and I began studying about the situation and found out that it seemed 
to be considered by most people to be a women's issue.  We all know, 
if you think about it, that it's not just a women's issue.  There is a 
man involved every time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: So I felt like I could do something, and I wasn't going to 
go shoot a doctor or anything, so I felt like as I grew and matured as
a Christian that that is when I felt like I heard from God in
not to be a fanatical way but in my own spirit that I ought to
do something to help this situation, and that is how the idea
came about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And the idea was -- now, to go back to your man comment 
for a second, did you feel like, look, I don't care if I'm not allowed 
in here, that I want to get into this issue?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Absolutely.  I feel like this is the most
heinous crime that has ever befallen this country, and there has
to be something done to stop it.  We are losing babies every 20
seconds.  We are losing entire generations at a time, and there
seems to be no one out there standing up and saying, &quot;Hey,
this is really wrong.&quot;  I mean, I know there are many of
us who are, but according to, if you read the liberal media and
what not, they have control, and so you very seldom hear anything,
and I just felt a great desire to get involved and do what I could.
<p>
I mean, I am one person.  I am not an expert, as the other panelists
were, but I felt a desperate need to do something.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In fact, you are a golf professional, and you have a long 
history in sports.  And so what did a sportsman decide to do?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Well, I was at a golf tournament at the time it happened, 
and I had a revelational experience in which I felt that the best
thing for me to do was to be an open home in which the women could
come as an alternative to abortion and be protected, have shelter,
have services rendered to them, have a Bible study perhaps or
some kind of a training program, job training and some nursing
care, and so that is how the idea began, and two years later --
we actually purchased the house on January 22, 1994, the anniversary
of <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, and now we just passed our second year, and we
are very close to opening the doors.  About another week, we will
be letting the girls in.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And what is so fascinating about your story, Woody, is 
that -- I mean, here you are, a man in your community that has been 
involved. You took your own money and you bought a house to make a place 
for women and their children, which is pretty amazing.  I mean, what has 
been the reaction of the community to your gesture to reach out to these 
women?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: We have had so much support from really everyone that
it has been a wonderful experience from the very get-go.  We have
had laborers, construction workers, wanting to help, donating
their time, helping to build the entire house.  We actually had
to renovate the entire house.  It was an 1891 hotel which was
very dilapidated at the time that we took possession of it, and
so it needed all kinds of work, and the volunteers just came from
all the churches and all different kinds of walks of life, and
laborers, and we have doctors now who are going to deliver the
babies for free; we have nurses who are going to go check on the
girls; we have just support from every angle, and it has been
a wonderful thing.  It is very exciting to see it unfold.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And where will the girls come from?  How will girls
hear that this is a home that they can come and live in -- right?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Right, absolutely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And stay and get some training and some support, and you 
don't throw them out when they have the baby; you are going to help 
them segue into the community.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Absolutely.  We have job training, as I said, and they 
will be learning to do some kind of vocational skill, and we will allow 
them to stay at least six months after the pregnancy comes to term, and 
we will do that to help get them back on their feet, because the worst 
thing to do is just to shelter them until the baby is born and then say, 
&quot;Thanks a lot. See you.  Next girl, come in.&quot; We want to make a 
change in their lives.
<p>
We want to save the children, and we want to give them a good start in 
their lives beyond the time that the baby is born.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.  How will girls come to you?
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH: Sorry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And we want to give a phone number, too.
<p>
MR. FITZHUGH:  Yes.  The girls will come to us from the various pregnancy 
centers as well as from any church counseling.  Pastors, if they find out 
that a girl in their church has gotten pregnant, they will send them to us. 
And, basically, crisis pregnancy centers throughout the area.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: This is very exciting.  For anybody that wants more information, 
they can call us at Family Research Council.  Thank you so much, Woody,
and to all my guests.
<p>
When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at what Gary Bauer, president 
of the Family Research Council, has to say regarding the abortion issue 
in his speech given to those involved in this year's March for Life.  Don't go 
away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. We now bring you
a portion of the speech given at the March for Life Rose Dinner
by Gary Bauer, president of the Family Research Council.  Gary
presents thought-provoking insights into the abortion debate.
Let's take a look as <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you our Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>
<p>
[Segment from March for Life Rose Dinner follows:]
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you very much.
<p>
I want to talk to you this evening not only about the direct subject
of the sanctity of human life but also about our country and the
relationship of the sanctity of human life to America and to its
future.
<p>
I fell in love with America a long, long time ago, as
I know each and every one of you did, too.  And so it's worth
it for us tonight to think about our country and about its hopes
and dreams and about its fears and nightmares.
<p>
You know, there's that great old book that I am sure all of you are very 
familiar with, <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i> by Charles Dickens, and you may 
remember that the book begins with that wonderful line, &quot;It was the
best of times and it was the worst of times.&quot;
<p>
Now, the line was obviously written about England and France many years 
ago, but I believe it is a perfect description of America in 1996.
It is the best of times, and it is the worst of times.
<p>
You know, there are many ways that you can measure a great nation.  You
can measure it by the strength of its military or the growth of
its economy or the gleam of its cities, and by those measurements
the United States is a great nation.
<p>
But you can also measure a nation by how many of its children cry themselves 
to sleep at night, and the fact of the matter is that tonight in America 
too many of our children will cry themselves to sleep.  Too many children
abandoned, too many children without a father's arms to comfort
them.  Too many children already exploited through pornography
or slaves to drugs or sexually abused.
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, by those measurements, the United States is in danger 
of becoming something other than a great nation.  And to top it all off, 
1.6 million of those children, this year and every year, will not
even make it out of the womb alive, and by that measurement, we
are in danger of becoming something less than a great nation.
<p>
I believe there is a sense in the United States today that we
are all one wrong turn away from a disaster.  And so what in the
world happened to this shining city upon a hill that the founding
fathers wanted and tried to give to us?
<p>
I think the first thing that happened is that we forgot God, and having 
forgotten God, we have unleashed the hounds of hell on our streets and our 
neighborhoods and our communities.  How ironic that that would happen here,
of all places.  Every one of us has in our pockets, or you ladies
in your purses, money that says, &quot;In God We Trust,&quot;
and the phrase has become as cheapened and as devalued as the
money it is printed on.  Lincoln called us the almost chosen people.
<p>
But to listen to the experts today, you would think the greatest
danger facing America is that men and women of faith like you
may actually go into the public square and assert God's word on
issues like the sanctity of human life or what it is we owe to
those who are more disadvantaged than us, and I am here to tell
you tonight, ladies and gentlemen, that unless you go into the
public square, America will not survive in the next century.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
The second thing that has gone wrong is that we have neglected
and failed as a culture and a society to pass on the great traditions
of our culture to our children.  We could spend all evening talking
about that issue alone.  Our children sit on the shoulders of
giants.  And yet the research shows that most American young people
have no idea of the sacrifices that have been made for the liberty
that they have today.
<p>
I think the third thing that has happened is that we have allowed 
Washington, D.C., and the people in Washington to become our masters 
instead of our servants.  And I don't point to any particular party; I 
point to both parties.  It's time for us to remind both parties that our 
liberty comes from no man; it comes from God.  It doesn't come from the 
President of the United States; it doesn't come from the Speaker of the 
House. It comes from God, and it is guaranteed to us by the original
contract with America, the Declaration of Independence and the
Constitution of the United States.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
The fourth thing that has happened -- and perhaps this should be at the 
top of the list, because all of these really are related to one another
-- is the issue that brings you here every year, that in this
country we have allowed the sanctity of human life to evaporate
and slip through our hands, and we pay the consequences every
day, not only in abortion but in city streets that we are fearful
to allow our own children to walk on.
<p>
Now, it is impossible to come to Washington, D.C., and have a dinner like 
this and not have a speaker like me turn to the question of politics.  And
so I know in an audience like this that there are both Republicans
and Democrats, and I want you to have patience with me because
I am going to insult you both.  Let me begin with the Democratic
Party, because that is the one that is easier for me to insult.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
You know, I grew up in a Democratic home, a blue-collar family, and 
whether you are a Democrat or not, you have to concede that the Democratic 
Party, over the years, has been the party of the little guy.  They were 
there at the beginning of the civil rights movement.  They were there to 
build a safety net for the poor in the United States, and they deserve great 
credit for being there for the little guy and when working men and women 
were organizing in the factories of America.  It is a great history and 
tradition that the Democratic Party has.  But on this issue, they have 
abandoned the littlest guy of all.
<p>
Let me share some letters with you. Here's a letter written back in the 
early 1970s. &quot;While the deep concern of a woman bearing an unwanted 
child merits consideration and sympathy, it is my personal feeling that 
the legalization of abortion on demand is not in accordance with the values 
which our civilization places on human life.  Wanted or unwanted, I
believe that human life, even at its earliest stages, has certain
rights which must be recognized:  the right to be born, the right
to love, the right to grow old.&quot;
<p>
Now, that couldn't have been said better by Nellie Gray or Jim Dobson. 
That was written by Ted Kennedy in 1971.
<p>
Here's a telegram in 1977, an open letter to Congress: &quot;As a matter 
of conscience, I must oppose the use of federal funds for a policy of 
killing infants.&quot; The sender of the telegram is referring to the 
effort in Congress at the time to subsidize abortions, and he called it 
killing infants. Was that written by Jesse Helms?  No, that was a telegram 
sent by Jesse Jackson on September 6, 1977.
<p>
Here's one written in 1986: &quot;In my opinion, it is wrong to spend federal 
funds for what is the taking of a human life.  It is my deep personal 
conviction that abortion is wrong.&quot;  Signed by then Senator Al Gore,
now the Vice President of the United States, who is sent by President
Clinton all over the world to promote abortion on demand.
<p>
And speaking of President Clinton, here is a letter in 1986 signed
by then Governor Bill Clinton:  &quot;I am opposed to abortion
and to government funding of abortions.&quot;
<p>
What happened to these men between the time that they wrote these letters 
and today is that they sold their souls for political gain, and they ought
to be ashamed of themselves.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
Now, what about the Republican Party?  Well, all during the 1980s, the 
Republican Party provided the leadership for the pro-family and pro-life 
movement, and I was proud to serve in the Reagan Administration during those 
years. But having said that, I also don't have to remind you that there
are some party leaders, some pollsters and pundits in the Republican
Party walking around with their finger up in the air trying to
figure out which way the wind is blowing and ready to sell you
out on this issue.  And it just doesn't come from those in the
liberal wing of the party.
<p>
So I am here tonight to say to the National Democratic Party and to the 
weak-kneed Republicans, of which there are some, that if neither of you 
know how to turn saving babies into a winning political issue, the American 
people may eventually decide that neither of you deserve to be the governing
party of the United States.
<p>
[Applause.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break. Stay tuned to 
hear how you can get more information regarding the current pro-life movement

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at Congress 
in 1996 and asks, with the budget in limbo, are you getting all the government
you're still paying for?
<p>
With the primaries already under way and members gearing up to defend their 
seats, what issues will be at play?  Tonight's guests give us their predictions. 
You won't want to miss hearing their inside perspectives from those
who work closely with Congress on both the Senate and the House
sides.  And you will hear from one freshman Congressman from the
class that the media tells us is terrorizing the politicians living
inside the beltway.
<p>
But first, <i>Straight Talk</i> invites you to hear from Gary Bauer, 
president of the Family Research Council.  A political veteran, Gary not 
only shares with you some of his predictions on the 1996 issues; he offers some 
hope for the future of the American family.  There are steps we can take to make 
a difference.
<p>
Although Gary is seen on various newscasts and quoted in many
newspapers, for the full story, <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind
the Headlines.
<p>

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, Gary, we are in an election year, and it is always
interesting how the way people campaign isn't the way they necessarily
govern, and there is always new information coming out.  What
do you see in the budget debate this year that sort of highlights
that phenomenon?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  You know, this is one of the serious problems facing the 
country, because I think the American people, by and large, have concluded 
that Washington doesn't speak the truth; that the politicians in Washington, 
D.C., play fast and loose with the facts, and now we have some recent 
evidence that I think is pretty disturbing.
<p>
Both sides in the budget debate were assuming and predicting that the Medicare 
Trust Fund would run a surplus last year.  The estimates were it would be as 
high as $4.7 billion.  Now that the Medicare debate is over, we discover
that instead of a $4.7 billion surplus, there was a $35 million
deficit.
<p>
Now, clearly, the Clinton Administration had to know that by the time the 
debate was going on.  These figures come in every month.  Right about the time 
the debate would have been at its peak, the Clinton Administration had to know 
that this massive deficit was going to appear, and yet they did not announce
it until after the debate was over and, not coincidentally, their
side had won.
<p>
So I can certainly understand the cynicism level that you see among the 
American people, which is a very disturbing thing for a democracy when, 
particularly, citizens and young people decide that they can't trust those who 
would lead them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have seen that people mean a lot of things when they talk
about balancing the budget, and in the same way they have meant
a lot of things when they talk about being pro-family.
<p>
You wrote a book that deals with that, Gary.  Tell us a little bit about it.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, I just got real tired of people who believe
in traditional values being smeared and stereotyped as being bigots
or extremists or radical right or Christian right, all these terms
we hear thrown around.  I look at the agenda that we believe in
and that most of the people who support us believe in, and it
is a pretty mainstream agenda.
<p>
So we decided to write a book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, in which we 
would describe what America would look like if my side won, if we were the 
Hollywood movie producers, if we were running the school boards and had the 
White House and the Congress and the university presidencies, and so
forth.
<p>
I think the America that I describe in that book is an
America that 80 percent of the American people want; that is,
a country with safe streets and schools that work and traditional
values and kids who are being raised the right way again.
<p>
Our hope is this year that a lot of people will read that book and
it might help provide some context for them as the debate goes
on in 1996.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of my favorite things in this book
is the yes or no questions at the end that really help people
understand exactly what is happening.  Why did you put those in?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, one of the hardest things to pin down is an
American politician.  I don't know if many of our listeners have
ever written to members of Congress or not, but if they have,
they will find that almost no matter what position they take,
the member of Congress, when he writes back, seems to find some
way to actually agree with them even though, when you look at
the voting record, they are voting against many of the things
their constituents are writing about.
<p>
What we try to do in this book is, as you point out, at the end of each 
chapter, give a couple of questions that a citizen can ask somebody running 
for school board or for Congress or the Senate or for the Presidency
that are very clear, have yes or no answers, and leave very little
wiggle room, as we call it in Washington, D.C., for a politician
to be able to deceive or to get around the truth.
<p>
And again, our hope is that a lot of citizens, armed with these questions 
and with the facts, will be able to make more valid judgments about
who is speaking for them and who is not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ironically, right now, Hillary Clinton also has a book out, and 
she's on the author's circuit.  Yet her vision of family is very different
from the vision you describe.  How is that impacting you?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, there is a really telling quote in Hillary Clinton's
book that you really have to think about, and as we all thought
about it, it became more and more disturbing.  Mrs. Clinton says
in her book, &quot;There is no such thing as other people's children.&quot;
<p>
When you read the book, you discover that what she means is that
she has a vision that government ought to play a major role in
the raising of children, whether it is government day care or
government intervening in education or government making judgments
about what should or should not be taught, and so forth.
<p>
Our vision is diametrically opposed to that.  We believe that parents are
the first and most important teachers that a child has; that they
bear the ultimate responsibility for what those children ought
to be taught.  And so we kind of welcome the fact that Mrs. Clinton's
book is out at the same time as ours, and quite frankly, I would
be quite happy if I could engage her in a debate about American
families and American children and the proper way to go.  Kids
don't need more bureaucrats in Washington; they need more people
who love them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Doesn't government have a role?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, certainly there are things that government can do
to make family life easier, and we can probably all tick them
off fairly easily, whether it is lowering taxes on families so
that hard-working mothers and fathers can keep more of what they
earn or something like educational choice, which would enable
parents to choose the schools they want to send their children
to.  So there are things that are reinforcing to what the average
mother and father is attempting to do.
<p>
The problem comes up when government attempts to replace those parents, to 
have a bigger role than the parents or the family has in the nurturing of 
those children.  We have 100 cases of that, examples of that.  We look
at programs like welfare, which might have been very well intentioned
but in fact have in many ways destroyed the inner-city family.
<p>
So a lot of what government does ends up being very hurtful, and
many of the good things that government could do to help families,
it just doesn't do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you hope to accomplish with <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I realize Americans are busy.  There are 101 challenges and 
time demands, and so forth. I would be happy if I could just get a large number 
of average Americans to read this book, have a better sense of what the 
pro-family movement is all about, and perhaps be just a little bit more 
educated when they look at public policy issues and look at those who are
attempting to get their votes.
<p>
You know, with all the influences that are on us, all the paid advertising, it 
is tough to know how much influence a book like this can have, but I know that
Dr. James Dobson of Focus on the Family has set a goal of distributing
a million copies of this book by the end of the year, and I think
if that actually happens, it could have a major impact on the
public policy debate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Dr. James Dobson has partnered with you, and Focus on the Family 
has published <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, hopefully, to put forth a positive 
image. Do you think that this book could help with the cynicism that is really 
rampant in American politics today?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Cynicism is really a killer in a democracy.  People have got to have 
some degree of faith in their government, in those who would govern them.  I am 
an optimist about the ability to reform Washington and to turn the
country around, and so if <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i>, if that book
in some small way gives people a sense of how things could be
better, then I think it would be a very positive contribution
to the debate this year and beyond.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for being with us today, Gary.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> begins
our discussion of the congressional year ahead.  Please stay with
us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. To begin our look ahead at what Congress has in store for 
1996, I am joined by Bret Bernhardt, Legislative Director for Senator Don 
Nickles; Marshall Wittmann, Director of House Relations for the Heritage 
Foundation; and Marty Dannenfelser, the Family Research Council's Assistant 
to the President for Government Relations.
<p>
Welcome to the show, gentlemen. Predictions are such a fun thing to do. It 
is the beginning of an election year, and yet the end of the legislative 
session.
<p>
Let's just kind of go around.  Marshall, what do you see as sort of 
the top five, top ten issues that you think are going to be really hot in 
Congress?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, I think the main issue is going to be the
divisions between Clinton and the Congress, liberal versus conservative,
on every issue, I think, coming down the pike.  Congress will
try to remind the American people that Bill Clinton is a liberal
and they are conservative.  So you are going to see issues like
immigration, you are going to see issues like tax limitation and
the balanced budget amendment be revisited in the House of Representatives.
Education may be another issue.  Another key issue will be the
partial-birth abortion veto, which has already passed the Congress.
We expect Clinton to veto it.  There may be an override fight.
<p>
But every issue, you will see Congress reminding the American
people that Bill Clinton is no conservative.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And who is going to win that?  I mean, I think we have seen 
that Bill is pretty good when it comes to telling that kind of story. 
How do you think they are going to be able to play the game?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, the ultimate decision will be made by the American 
people in November when they vote in the election, and I think that they
will be the major arbiter of who wins this fight.
<p>
The past year we have seen the first skirmishes in trying to make 
government smaller.  Now, Clinton might have won the first round, but I 
think the most important round will be fought in November.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Marty, what do you think?  You have been on the Hill a long 
time, and welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. What do you see as moving 
the Congress forward in 1996?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think we are going to see some continuing focus 
on the budget, balanced budget.  With the governors' recent conference, there 
seems to be a renewed focus on a possible balanced budget agreement that
would be between the President and the Congress.  So I think that
is going to happen.
<p>
The question of what is going to happen with family tax relief is of great 
concern to Family Research Council, and some other policy matters that are 
still unresolved. We have had the Labor-HHS bill stalled in the Senate. We 
have some important pro-life concerns on that legislation.
<p>
I think Marshall is right that there are going to be some bright lines drawn 
between the President's rhetoric and his true positions on some issues.  The
challenge in some cases is going to be getting these through the
Senate.  I know Bret is well aware that there is quite a challenge
on the Senate floor with the amendment process and the lengthy
debate, and so on, that it is much easier to control the process
in the House and get some very stark legislative proposals brought
up, and certainly the partial-birth bill moved much easier in
the House than it did in the Senate, but it has passed both and
will be onto the President's desk sometime soon.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, Bret, I do want to hear your predictions as well, but 
the bright line -- they always say it is a little harder to draw a
bright line in the Senate than the House.  Would you agree?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: Yes, I think that is right.  In the Senate it
takes roughly about 60 votes to get something through that is
very controversial because of the filibuster that is able to be
done by the Democrats in the Senate.
<p>
I think you will see -- and I agree with what Marty and Marshall have said 
here -- that in the Senate you will probably -- and I would imagine the 
House to a great degree, also -- moved as consensus items here initially,
and as we have seen with the welfare with the governors having
put together a consensus bipartisan-type package, that will probably
begin moving here fairly soon, and that could be then the sparkplug
that then gets the budget negotiation ignited again.
<p>
And then later on we will move into some areas in which we define the 
Republicans' agenda and get us ready for the elections in the fall.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, you are nonpartisan, of course, Marshall.  However, in 
terms of defining the Republicans' agenda, that is a lot of items on
the table.  How would you define it?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, you know, one thing we have to make clear is that Bill 
Clinton wasn't exactly telling the truth when he tried to cast himself as 
Ronald Reagan in the State of the Union address.
<p>
What will happen is that there will be a number of issues.  It might be 
through the appropriations process, where we try to show that Bill Clinton
is on the side of big government, and Republicans and conservatives
want smaller government.  It might be on the issue that Marty
touched upon, family tax relief.  And it might be on these important
social issues such as the pro-life issues.  It may be on the issue
of racial preferences.
<p>
So there will be a number of issues that will come down the pike, I expect, 
this year that Congress will try to make that distinction, because, as we know, 
Bill Clinton is a very good talker, but you have to look at what he does and
not what he says, and Congress will be trying to point that out
to the American people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, it is very ironic. In one week he makes a very wonderful, 
warm speech, and in another he brings us back Dr. Henry Foster in a program that 
won't talk about teen sex, just teen pregnancy, which was a tad surprising.
<p>
But tax relief, everybody from the <i>Washington Post</i> to the <i>New
York Times</i> tells us that we could all get along without tax relief.
Is that your assessment, Marty?  Is tax relief holding us up
on the budget?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, we don't believe it is holding us up. The 
question is, with those people who want to get rid of tax relief, is their 
agenda to really reduce the deficit or is it to have more money available 
to spend on more social programs?  I think that the answer is the latter, 
that they really want to use that money to spend it.
<p>
There is some talk of trying to separate the two, do the budget reduction 
first and then come back to the tax package.  But I don't think that is 
likely to happen.  I think that, particularly in the House, the leadership
is committed to doing that as a package if there is to be a package,
and there has been discussion on the debt limit bill of at least
doing a first installment of family tax relief and probably at
least capital gains reduction of some sort.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, a lot of people are reporting that there probably will 
not be any budget agreement made, that we will just live on continuing
resolutions, spoon-fed every now and then, until the election,
and then that will be one of the shining lines drawn.  Do you
all agree with that?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: I think that if that is the case, if we don't get a budget 
agreement, we will continue on in that process.  But I think, as I said 
earlier about the welfare agreement being the catalyst for producing a 
budget agreement, you could have a situation where you will have room for 
a tax cut, and if you get in the area of $150 billion, say, we have
plenty of room for the child tax credit, capital gains, and a
few other items that we have had in the contract and other items
we have been pushing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the new kids in town, sort of courtesy of Mr. Forbes, 
has been the flat tax.  Does this draw any lines for us, or do you think the 
welfare reform, the pro-family tax relief, and some of the other thing -- 
immigration -- will supersede?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: I think the flat tax will be an important issue in the 
election.  I don't expect that Congress will overhaul the tax code this 
year.  But what the flat tax points out is how much money has gone from the 
family in Washington, and you have all these special interests in Washington 
who play the tax code, except Mom and Dad back at home at the kitchen table
don't have those lobbyists at Family Research Council fighting
them.
<p>
But what the flat tax does is draw that distinction between
those for big government and those for smaller government.  And
I think that will be debated.  It will be the great debate of
1996.  But I don't think there will be any congressional action
other than hearings.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think the flat tax is as big an issue, like devolution 
was, like let's make government smaller, let's make the tax flatter?  Does it 
have that kind of power?
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT:  I don't think it does as much as smaller
government.  We tried this in 1986, and a lot of blood was let
in coming up with that 1986 package.  It started out as a flat
tax, and look what we ended up with.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BERNHARDT: So I think there is a lot to be said. It is going
to be a long ways before we get to an actual flat tax.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you see, Marty, as you kind of look at the war of 
the issues?  Where do you think pro-family Americans are really going
to be looking?
<p>
MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, I think a lot is going to really focus on the 
cultural agenda, what are our children learning, what kinds of influences 
are affecting them in society, what kinds of dangers are they exposed to 
in the area of crime and drugs and things like that.
<p>
I think there is still very deep underlying concern about issues like that, 
and I think families are going to look to see what is the government doing 
to make the world and the country a safer place for their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Can they offer anything?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Government?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: For the family.
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: What government can do is get out of the way. So often 
government makes decisions, whether it is in terms of Goals 2000 education, 
whether it is in terms of the tax policy, where they tell moms and dads what 
to do, how their children should be educated.  In large part government needs
to stop being an obstacle to families, and over the last 40 or
50 years we have seen that time and time again, whether it is
values or economic issues like taxes.  Government steps upon the
territory that should be the preserve of the family.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are kind of coming to the end of our time.  Marshall, 
we wanted to ask you quickly, I think it was very much a surprise to people
yesterday when Pat Buchanan actually won in Louisiana, and by
no small margin. What is your assessment of that?
<p>
MR. WITTMANN: Well, more than anything else, it underscores the volatility
of this election period.  We saw that in 1994; to some degree
in 1992.
<p>
The other interesting part is the role that social conservatives
played in that vote.  If you look at the vote, the reason that
Buchanan did so well because of the strength of social conservatives.
So people of faith and family are having an impact and will have
an impact this year, and those people who ignore them do so at
their peril.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And I don't think that is a surprise to any of the people 
here. Thank you for being with us.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we discuss a children's
issue that has a lot of parents worried:  education.  What do
the upcoming semesters hold for America's students?  After this
break we'll find out. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. I would like to
welcome guests who have the inside track on our country's educational
issues:  Amy Myers, Press Secretary and Government Relations Director
for the Eagle Forum; Hans Meeder, Professional Staff for Long-Range
Policy and Planning from the Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee; and Jennifer A. Marshall, Education Policy Analyst
for the Family Research Council.
<p>
Thank you for joining us.  Thank you for having a smaller title.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
We are taking a look at all the issues coming up in 1996.  We have looked 
at the Hill. But education is very near and dear to a lot of people's hearts.
Hans, why don't we start with you?  Where do you see education
issues going in 1996?
<p>
MR. MEEDER:  Well, I think that the key that we are going to have to work 
on in 1996 is that President Clinton is continuing to have a barrage of lies 
about what creates quality solutions for our children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Give me an example.
<p>
MR. MEEDER:  Well, he basically has created a Goals 2000 program
to basically have federal control over curriculum content and
the direction of education reform.  They continue to put money
into programs like the Title I program and Head Start, which are
30 years old, have been reformed five or six times, and still
the studies show that they have no lasting impact on our children
for good, and if anything, they might actually perpetuate some
bad practices.
<p>
And yet, at the same time, what we see really works
for kids at the local level are parental control and involvement
over education, strong local commitment and flexibility, and a
strong focus on academics.  It is really not that complicated.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So how do we get there?  Give me a quick one on
how we get there.  Then, Amy, we are going to ask you.  How are
we going to achieve it?
<p>
MR. MEEDER: It is not one silver bullet that will fix it, but the first 
step that we are going to work on is identifying how many federal programs 
are out there, what the federal role really is, and then start a process 
of trying to turn back as much control locally as possible.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amy, what do you see?  We are looking at education in 1996.
What is going to come up?
<p>
MS. MYERS: Well, I think you will see a lot of issues that come up.  Whether 
or not they go anywhere, we will see.  The House of Representatives tends to 
be a little bit more favorable toward parents and local control, whereas the
Senate is still a little bit behind schedule on that.  And, of
course, you have President Clinton, who thinks that only Washington
knows how to control education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MS. MYERS: I think through the appropriations process we might see the 
defunding or cutting back on a number of programs that a lot of 
conservatives feel are detrimental to the --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: How about Goals 2000?  A lot of concern for that.  Do you think 
we will see a cut in Goals 2000?
<p>
MS. MYERS:  Well, we did see a cut in the House version of the appropriations 
bill, which was zero funding. In the Senate version it was fully funded. So 
we probably will not see Goals 200 eliminated.
<p>
It is a two-fold process. You eliminate funding as well as repeal the law. 
Goals 2000 does not have a lot of money in it compared to other programs. 
However, it does have a lot of the federal strings.  I think that is what 
is most concerning to a lot of American families.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: To have you do this analogy quick for me, Jennifer, you said 
one time that if you look at every educational dollar, the government throws
in a few pennies and then controls the spending of the rest.
How does --
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  That is right.  It is something like on the order of 6 
to 7 percent of the Federal Government contributes to local education; 
yet I don't know how much percentage of the actual mandates and regulations 
are actually coming from the Federal Government. So you can tell that they 
have really got the beast by the nose.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It has been kind of interesting because
some states have said, &quot;Okay, we won't take that federal
money,&quot; and I am sure parents in those states initially think,
you know, we've lost all this money, when they have lost a fraction
of what it takes to run local schools.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: That is right.  Something like $2 per student per year, 
something that you could buy a sandwich with at McDonald's, and what you 
have to do for that money is form a state school improvement panel,
form local panels, revise your curriculum, submit proposals to
the Secretary of Education, for $2 per student.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That is amazing.
<p>
MS. MARSHALL: Ridiculous.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you think is going to come up in 1996?
<p>
MS. MARSHALL:  Well, we hope that there will be a great discussion on the 
federal role in education, and we are especially looking forward to 
consideration of the back-to-basics bill, which would shut down the Department
of Education and block-grant those programs for a period of four
years.
<p>
What we would really like to see, and this would mean an
end to the federal role in education, would be a tax cut at the
end of that time to return the money to the people who are putting
it in the pot right now, so they could run education at the local
level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Hans, what does your organization see as
the likelihood of that?  Do you think long term -- even in 1996,
short term -- we could see the end of the Department of Education?
I have heard its death knell before.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Well, the thing that we have to realize, most Americans 
don't really know the difference between -- I hate to say this -- but
between local, state, and federal involvement, and that is why,
when the President starts talking about extreme cuts to education,
which, at the most, we are talking about one-half of one percent
of national education spending, is what we are talking about reducing
at the federal level, but when he starts throwing that kind of
talk around, people get very nervous, because most people are
very supportive of education in general, and we have seen polling
that shows that of the general public, only about 19 percent right
now support eliminating the Department of Education, and almost
80 percent oppose it, and a lot of it because they don't understand
what the Department of Education at the federal level really does.
<p>
We feel that in order to do it successfully, we have to undergo
a very big education effort to show people the massive proliferation
of programs.  Just to let you know, the Department of Education
itself has about 250 education programs, maybe a little bit more
than that.  But we are in the process of identifying several more
hundred education programs already spread across the Federal Government.
<p>
What our members don't want to do is get rid of a couple hundred
programs and an agency and yet still have the Federal Government
very involved in education, and then we all think the problem
is solved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Because they have put those programs maybe under 
Agriculture or under another department.
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Same thing, but just a different way of paying for it.
<p>
MR. MEEDER: Hundreds of programs have cropped up over the last 40 years. 
Basically, any Congressman or Senator that wanted to say they were for 
education created a new program, and we have multitudes of Indian ed programs, 
science programs. Unfortunately, very few of those programs are really 
focused on basic academics, the reading, math, and science, and many of
them are just kind of special interest buyoff programs.
<p>
So we feel that before we can really move on restructuring the federal
role, we have to know what is out there and then educate the public
on that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, Phyllis Schlaffly has been a real leader in that. 
I mean, she has worked very hard on education issues. What is her 
perspective on the back-to-basics approach?
<p>
MS. MYERS:  I think that we and Phyllis have said that the back-to-basics
approach is a good step in the right direction.  It does not eliminate
the federal role in education; however, it does definitely move
us toward that direction.
<p>
We don't think that there is a constitutional role for the Federal 
Government to be involved in education, and that is how we would 
eventually like to see things end up.  Given the current Congress and the 
current President, we don't see that as a realistic goal in the 104th 
Congress.  You don't have a Senate that will do anything and you don't 
have a President that will sign it.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's the hard part.
<p>
MS. MYERS: Yes. But we would like to see an end in the federal role in 
education, and just to add on to what Hans had said, I know that their 
committee has shown well over 660 programs throughout all of the agencies
in the Federal Government that are involved in education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One thing we know about government is it grows.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
Thanks so much for being with us.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear from one of the 
freshman class of lawmakers, Congressman Dave McIntosh. Please stay 
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I had the opportunity to speak with an influential 
House freshman, Congressman Dave McIntosh, Republican of Indiana.  Let's 
hear what he has to say about our country's year ahead.
<p>
Thank you very much for being with us today, Congressman McIntosh. You 
have been one of the most influential freshman Congressmen, and as
you look at this year ahead, what do you see coming up on Capitol
Hill?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  I think it is going to be a year
of challenges.  I represent Indiana, so I like to use the movie
Hoosiers as an example.  I think the freshman class are the small-town
team, the myelin players, and we are in the big leagues now for
the championship.
<p>
All the press is saying, &quot;Oh, they're bound to fail, they're bound 
to buckle and give up on their principles.&quot; But we are at halftime, 
and we are reassessing where we want to go, and everybody knows the 
fundamentals are there, and if we stick to what we told people we cared 
about in the last election, it will carry us on to victory, ultimately, if 
not before November then after November, because I think the American people 
want to see the changes that they voted for in the last election, less
government -- and even President Clinton has agreed with us on
that -- but even more than the budget and the tax issues, which
I think are important, they want to see a reaffirmation of the
family and of faith as being important in our public lives.
<p>
And so you are going to see next year a renewed effort to focus on
those issues and say it is time that we have a constitutional
amendment that will allow school prayer, that will allow freedom
of religion in our public lives.  It is time that we look at our
welfare program, not just as a budget matter but as a program
that is devastating families and driving people to divorce, driving
young children into a terrible family situation, and we have to
fundamentally get rid of that system and change it.
<p>
The other one that I am going to be looking at is the marriage penalty 
that is not only in our tax code but in also a lot of government pension
programs and benefits, where they tell somebody, &quot;Look, if
you were only divorced, you would be getting more money.&quot;
And to me that is just wrong to say to people, &quot;Because
you are married, you are going to be penalized.&quot;  It undermines
the family and the basic institution of marriage in our community.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Are you concerned that the budget debate will have
a negative effect on family issues?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think what you are seeing now is the freshmen who 
were new to Washington -- and I have enjoyed getting to know my colleagues.
They are so committed to the principles that they believe in.
A lot of them were not politicians.  You get people like Steve
Largent, who was a football player and had never run for office
before, did this because he believes in the future of the country.
That is typical of a lot of our colleagues.
<p>
They are determined to not back down on our promises, and what I think we need 
to do is say, &quot;Look, the President has stopped us from getting
to a balanced budget, but now we can get some of the things done.&quot;
The rest of it, we need to go back to the American people and
say, &quot;We took it as far as we can.  Give us another round
of support and we can, to use the Hoosiers analogy, we can win
the game in the end.&quot;  But it is going to take the support
of the people and the voters and people to get involved next year.
<p>
One of the things that I tell folks at home in Indiana -- because
they will come up to me and say, &quot;Hang in there. You're doing
what we sent you to.&quot;  I'll say, &quot;Thank you, and I need
you.  I need you to help me build support in the community, to
get out there and ring doorbells with me, talk to people, and
let the community know there is a plan to get us back on the right
track where we restore families, build strong communities from
the bottom up.  But it is going to take everybody, not just 40-some
members of the Congress or 200-and-some members of Congress but
everybody in the country to do that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The media and the people inside the beltway have really 
demonized the freshman class and blamed them for the impasse in the budget 
debate. What is your perspective on that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think, ultimately, that is a convenient excuse for 
people. There is one thing that has happened.  The media and the people in 
Washington don't really know what to make of the freshmen, because we are
not willing to paper over the differences and say we are balancing
the budget when we know we are not.  We are saying, &quot;At least
let's be honest.  If we're only getting half a loaf, let's tell
people that.&quot;
<p>
And so it has been hard for them to figure out how to work with us as a class. 
But I think, ultimately, you had Presidential politics coming into it. President 
Clinton, I think, did not want a balanced budget, so he vetoed the effort
we had.  Senator Dole, President Clinton views him with suspicion
because he is running for President.  And there were some larger
forces involved in it.
<p>
But, ultimately, we need to say, let's get what we can.  But if it isn't the 
real thing, if we haven't really balanced the budget, haven't given the 
families their tax cut, let's not paper that over but take it to the voters
in the election next year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, it has been interesting watching the budget debate. 
There have been a lot of kudos coming to the freshman class as having really 
advanced the discussion of a balanced budget, and then you have the 
<i>Washington Post</i> and the <i>New York Times</i> and the pundits on 
Saturday and Sunday morning saying, &quot;You know, great advancement of the 
issues, but if you could just get rid of those tax cuts, we would all
be on the same page.&quot;  What is your response to that?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: It is typical Washington, actually.  What has 
happened is, as the negotiations have gone, spending keeps going up every
step of the way, and what they are saying is, as you take more
and more for Washington's budget, let's get rid of the provisions
that help the family budget.  Put aside your tax cut that allows
the average family to get something out of this balanced budget.
<p>
We did some studies in my home town in Muncie on what the typical
family would benefit from the tax cuts.  They make about $25,000.
Oftentimes both parents will be working.  They have two kids,
and they would pay about a third of their money in taxes, either
to the Federal Government, to the state, or to local property
taxes.
<p>
If we had a $500 tax credit, instead of paying a third
or roughly about $8,000, they would only pay $7,000, and that
is a huge difference.  That is $1,000 that they don't have to
turn over in their paycheck.  It is a pay raise that they see
right away that, each week, adds up, and eventually, they are
able to save for their family and be able to have a better lifestyle.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Looking at all the issues on the table - we have
tax cuts, welfare reform, school choice, religious liberty --
what is your perspective on what the top three issues really are?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  I think you are going to see at this
point a balanced budget, an honest balanced budget, with the family
tax cuts, a religious freedom amendment that says we need to have
the ability to have prayer in school.  We need communities to
be able to have a creche scene at Christmas.  Our faith is important
to us, and you see that a lot in the freshman class, where people's
personal faith is what guides them, and they bring that forward.
<p>
And then I think the third major issue is in education.  A lot
of us would like to get rid of the Department of Education, certainly
get rid of Goals 2000.  But, fundamentally, on the positive side,
what we need to do is say that parents and communities can do
a much better job than bureaucrats in Washington, and we need
to allow parents to have the ability to guide and control education.
<p>
They are the ones who teach the values at home.  They are the
ones who need to have a school system that reinforces those values.
And working together with good teachers, we will be able to teach
our young people so they can be good citizens.
<p>
But if you have this Goals 2000 where you are not really teaching them, 
you say it is okay to misspell words - we are going to let you be creative
-- or you teach them values that are just wrong and simply not
what parents would want their kids to have, then the education
system doesn't work for us.
<p>
So those are the three main areas I think we are going to focus on.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What do you think is the untold story of the freshman class?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: A lot of us would like to get rid of the Department 
of Education, certainly get rids of Goals 2000.  But fundamentally, on the 
positive side, what we need to do is say that parents and communities can
do a much better job than bureaucrats in Washington, and we need
to allow parents to have the ability to guide and control education.
They are the ones who teach the values at home.  They are the
ones who need to have a school system that reinforces those values.
And, working together with good teachers, we will be able to
teach our young people so they can be good citizens.
<p>
But if you have this Goals 2000 where you are not really teaching them, 
you say it is okay to misspell words - we are going to let you be
creative -- or you teach them values that are just wrong and simply
not what parents would want their kids to have, then the education
system doesn't work for us.
<p>
So those are the three main areas I think we are going to focus on.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, what are you looking forward to in 1996?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think it is going to be a year where, in reality, 
we are ahead at half-time.  The President has said it is the end of the era
of big government.  Families count.  I am not sure he means it
totally, but he has said that and, basically, delivered a State
of the Union speech that could have been Ronald Reagan's.
<p>
I worked with Ronald Reagan for a while.  Probably the difference is 
Ronald Reagan would have meant it.  But it is nonetheless a consensus
now that we are moving in the right direction.  I am optimistic
that on some things we will be able to pass them in Congress and
the President will sign them.  Other things, I think, we will
have to once again, as I said, take it to the election.
<p>
But I have a lot of optimism about that, because I think you are going
to see a lot of people who started to get active in 1994, were
never that political, realize that the future of the country is
going to be at stake, and it is one of those times in our country's
history where we can renew government and set it on a new course.
<p>
The other thing that I am looking forward to is actually in 1997,
and it is not political at all.  It is the national Promise Keepers
meeting.  We had a regional event in Indianapolis at the Hoosier
Dome there, and you had 60,000 men coming together and reaffirming
their faith.
<p>
What I tell people is, this is a revival that can happen in our country. 
It is not government, it is not politics, but it is real because it is 
people in their own lives and in their own communities.  What we can do 
in government is make sure we stay out of the way, that we don't block that 
from happening. And I think that is going to be an exciting event for the 
entire nation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: At the end of 1996, after the election, will the story of 
this year's Congress be one of further realignment in a pro-family 
direction or of a swing back to the way that it has been, a little more 
politics as usual?
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: I think it could go either way at this point. I 
think the fundamentals are there.  You have good leaders who stand up for 
family values. But the real critical decision is going to be on election day,
and I certainly hope that we have further realignment in a pro-family
way.  I think you will have a lot of politicians talking about
it.  The challenge will be to get people who say, &quot;That's
my first priority, is the family and reestablishing the family,&quot;
so that we can really realign the priorities here in Washington.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Congressman, thank you very much for being with
us.  Best of luck to you, and we look forward to seeing what comes
ahead.
<p>
REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH: Thank you very much.  Congratulations
on all the good work you all do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at what Gary 
Bauer, president of the Family Research Council, has to say on CNN's 
<i>Crossfire</i> almost one year ago regarding an issue which continues to 
permeate our country's political world, abortion.  Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. Gary Bauer has often had the opportunity to appear on
many network news programs, and it interesting to see that Gary
was fighting the same battles regarding the abortion issue on
CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> during an appearance almost one year ago. So
let's take a look at a brief news clip as Gary presents some thought-provoking
arguments. <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from CNN Crossfire, March 23, 1995, follows:]
<p>
MODERATOR: Gary Bauer, as a Democrat, I certainly
wish you every success in saddling the Republican Party with your
views on abortion.  But isn't Senator Specter right in saying
that you will help reelect President Clinton if you insist on
pushing the Republican Party to adopt your views?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Right.  Well, in all due respect to Senator Specter, whom I have
worked with on many occasions, including the confirmation of Clarence
Thomas, which I hope you are still very proud of, sir, I think
that Arlen Specter is wrong about that.
<p>
The great growth in the Republican Party since 1980 has been based on 
Reagan Republicanism. That is not a fringe.  It means small government, low 
taxes, a strong defense, family values, and the sanctity of life.  That's
the kind of Republican winning all over this country.  That's
the formula for victory.  That little office over at the DNC that
Lynn Cheney(?) talked about is an office that would love to see
us abandon that winning formula.
<p>
MODERATOR: Well, why not be just a little bit cynical?  I know you might not be 
up to this, but there are a lot of Republicans who would like the pro-life
forces within the party to just be a little bit cynical, a little
bit strategic, and lie low for a bit, as some are doing, as Ralph
Reed does on alternate weeks, and wait until -- you know, organize
your forces, as you do, and then wait until you have a Republican
President and a Republican Congress, if that happens, and then
pop back up and say, &quot;Now here we are.  Now let's call in
our chips.&quot;
<p>
MR. BAUER: You know, Mike --
<p>
MODERATOR: Wouldn't that be a cleverer strategy?
<p>
MR. BAUER: No.
<p>
MODERATOR: Since you must admit that abortion is more controversial within 
the Republican Party than small government, low taxes, and all those
other things you listed.
<p>
MR. BAUER: I think the American people are sick of clever. I think I may 
be unusual in Washington, D.C., but I don't believe in stealth candidates. 
I believe that candidates win when they state what they believe and state it 
with conviction and stick to it regardless of polls.  That is what worked 
for Ronald Reagan twice, and I believe that Ronald Reagan, four months
ago, won his third landslide victory when candidates that ran
on all of his philosophy swept into office all over this country.
<p>
Mike, I want to be really clear about this.  I believe the Republican
Party ought to have an open door to anyone who wants to walk in
the door.  But the party has to stand for something, and I believe
at that core --
<p>
MODERATOR:  Why should anyone vote Republican who believes that a woman's 
right to choose is important as you believe that a fetus' right to life is, 
if the Republican Party platform says that abortion is murder and should be 
illegal with no exceptions?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, the fact of the matter is that 60 percent of the 
American people in a poll just this week by the <i>Washington Post</i>, not 
a conservative newspaper, found that Americans either want, in the case of 27 
percent of them, an end to all abortions, or in the case of 33 percent more, 
restrictions on abortion.  You can win an election with that 27 percent and
the 33 percent that believe abortion on demand is a mistake and
needs to be restricted.
<p>
The fringe here is the position that the Senator takes, which is no 
restrictions at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with us to 
hear how you can get more information on Gary's book or the issues
affecting you and your family in the upcoming year.
<p.
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us at <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. If you would like to receive a copy of Gary's book, 
<i>Our Journey Home</i>, or more information about our guests or the topics 
discussed, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will be celebrating Valentine's Day with a new slant
on what many consider to be true romance: abstinence.  Saving
sex for marriage seems to be an increasing trend, and we will
meet some people who will explain this not-so-old-fashioned phenomenon.
We hope you will join us again as we continue to bring you perspectives
not often seen in the media and exclusively seen here on <i>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight's
<I>Straight Talk</I> celebrates Valentine's Day by taking a look
at romance with a newly rediscovered twist.
<p>
When you think of romance, you may think of flowers, candlelight
dinners, and late night walks with that special someone.  In recent
years in our culture, it also means a night that ends with a sexual
encounter.  All too often this sexual experience takes place between
two people who don't share a lifetime commitment to marriage.
<p>
It may seem harmless, but tonight we'll talk to those who
don't think so as they share their personal experiences.  <I>Straight
Talk</I> will discuss the wave of abstinence that is sweeping
the country among teens and young adults who are looking for love
in all the right places.
<p>
But first, we invite you to hear from Gary Bauer, president
of the Family Research Council.  Gary has experienced many elections
throughout his years inside the beltway, and he shares with us
his views on the Iowa caucuses and how the results indicate what's
ahead in New Hampshire.  Although you've heard a lot of predictions
by now on what will happen between now and Super Tuesday, when
the Republican nominee will probably be known, Gary brings a unique
perspective from the pro-family frontlines as <I>Straight Talk</I>
takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thanks for being with us today on Behind
the Headlines.  It was interesting in the Iowa caucuses how prior
to the election everyone said that Dole had to have 30 percent
to survive.  Then he gets 26 percent, but it's the great unreported
story.  What's your take on why Dole's showing -- a poor showing
-- of 26 percent is so un-talked about?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I think, first of all, Kristi, the thing that
strikes me once again is just how bad the conventional wisdom
in Washington, D.C., is, and I say that as a person that obviously
works in this city and has been here a good long time, but the
pollsters and pundits, even those on the conservative side, really
get out of touch with the grassroots.  I think everybody thought
that Dole would do quite well in Iowa.
<p>
He did win, but it is, I think, an extraordinary warning
to his campaign that 26 percent of the vote in, what, his third
or fourth campaign in Iowa -- this is not a sign of strength.
Someone said &quot;many more victories like this, and he'll be
limping into San Diego.&quot;  So I think it is a sign that the
Dole campaign has some real challenges ahead and that he has to
deliver a much more aggressive and a much better message for the
future than he has been able to deliver so far.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Pundits agree that the race was for number
two.  Dole appeared to have one locked up; the question was how
big was his margin.  And then Buchanan wins the number two spot,
and nobody wants to talk about it.  Why do you think that is?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, Washington and the press corps generally
has an aversion to Pat Buchanan that is, I think, pretty obvious
to even the untrained eye.  It reminds me of this same aversion
that they had to Ronald Reagan.  People forget, you know, the
Reagan presidency was tremendously successful, and he is a beloved
figure in many ways now, but back in 1976, when he was taking
on Gerald Ford, people laughed at Ronald Reagan.
<p>
He was considered to be unelectable.  The Washington establishment,
including a good number of conservatives, thought that he was
splitting the party.  He was losing a lot of money.  He was in
debt.  He lost the first five primaries.  Even when the public
began to respond to him and he began to have success, Washington
and the press corps was in denial about him.  They still couldn't
believe that the American people responded to his message.
<p>
I was struck by the fact that Buchanan and Alan Keyes, the
only two candidates really aggressively promoting a pro-family
message, that if you put their two votes together in Iowa, they
would as a team, they would have won the Iowa caucuses.  So once
again, I think the message out there is that people are hungry
to hear about these issues and hear about them in a very articulate
and heartfelt way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  CNN reported in an exit poll that 42 percent
of the people who voted for Pat Buchanan said that conservative
values were the reason they chose him.  What do you think that
means for conservative issues as we watch this electoral cycle
unfold?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I think that if the party doesn't get the message
now, they'll never get it.  What these voters want, these new
voters that have poured into the Republican party in the last
15 years, is a candidate who is willing to speak with as much
passion about the right to life issue, about the family, about
protection of culture, et cetera, as much passion about those
things as they do about flat taxes and the budget deficit.
<p>
So far, a lot of Republican candidates have only talked about
the economic matters and then almost as a throwaway line have
said, &quot;well, yeah, and I'm pro-life,&quot; and so forth.
That might have worked 20 years ago in the Republican party.
It doesn't now.  People are hungry for this message, and I think
Buchanan's success will force the entire party to fashion a message
better than they've done up until now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How do you interpret Alexander's third place
win and the fact that he leaped over both Forbes and Gramm?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think Alexander is benefiting from sort
of the fact that he's not the other guys.  He hasn't engaged in
a lot of negative advertising.  He has conducted a pretty upbeat
campaign, and if voters got turned off by one individual or another
-- certainly many got turned off by the incredible negative advertising
Forbes has done -- Alexander was a place that they could turn
to and not really worry about being embarrassed about their vote.
Whether he has legs to make it through the next six weeks when
there is an incredible number of primaries and you really have
to start delivering a vision for the country is unclear at this
point.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I was watching the pundits yesterday, and I
very much agreed with one who said that Forbes' fourth place showing
indicated that money can't buy everything.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Yes, you know, the Family Research Council doesn't
endorse candidates, but I must admit that personally I was pleased
to see that a candidate can't do well just because he can write
unlimited checks.  That is a disturbing thought to me, that somebody
can take $20 million or $30 million and buy a Senate seat or buy
a governor's race or buy the presidency.
<p>
I think at the end of the day the American people will want
more than good advertising.  They are going to want to know that
the candidate shares their values, and serious questions arose,
on the social issues about whether Steve Forbes shares those values,
in the last three or four days of the Iowa caucuses.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Here at the Family Research Council media office,
we get normally at least 100 calls a day, often more, and in the
last week the number one question asked of us, for you, Gary,
is how do you interpret Gramm's plummet so that he took only a
five place position in Iowa?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, if I was happy to say that you can't buy
the presidency, I was also very sad to see Phil Gramm's fall on
these hard times, as he clearly has in Louisiana and Iowa.  Senator
Gramm is a good and decent man.  I think that he probably miscalculated
about where the center of gravity is in the Republican party.
Gramm led the way defeating national health care.  He deserves
great credit for that.
<p>
He has been incredibly articulate on economic issues, but
I think he didn't understand or has not understood up until now
that on these social issues you have to address them.  You have
to convince the voter that you are committed to these things,
that you are willing to do something about them, and his inability
to do that opened the door for Buchanan and some of the other
candidates.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  One of the themes that the media has not reported
and almost ignored exclusively is the common man theme of working
class Americans concerned for their families.  How will they support
them?  Where is the money going to come from?  Buchanan's numbers
show that in the last three primaries, but particularly in Iowa,
the majority of his supporters, almost 90 percent, made under
$70,000.  How do you interpret the common man theme in this electoral
cycle?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think there is.  You know, the Democratic
party demagogues these issues.  They take working men and women
who are really hurting, and they try to play class warfare over
it, and they try to suggest that a few more government bureaucracies
and a couple thousand more bureaucrats will make it all right,
and we all know that is foolish.  It hasn't worked.
<p>
But there are some in my party that are kind of cavalier
about this sort of issue.  They sound like they don't really care
that America's basic industries have had to downsize in the last
20 years, and they act sort of neutral over the question of whether
American companies start building their plants in places like
Mexico and China and so forth.
<p>
I grew up in a blue collar family, and I know how those people
think, what they strive for, what they care about.  A lot of those
people play by the rules.  They are the backbone of the country,
and I hope my party will fashion a message for them that is attractive.
I think Pat Buchanan is doing that, and I think that is why in
Louisiana and Iowa he did so well among voters making less than
$30,000 a year.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Everyone is packing up and leaving Iowa today,
heading off to New Hampshire and around the rest of the country.
We should know in the next six weeks who is going to be the leader.
How would you advise candidates about getting legs, building
legs, taking their campaigns forward?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think for all the candidates the basic
message is this:  that the American people are interested in smaller
government and lower taxes, traditional values, the sanctity of
human life.  Mold those things together.  Put together again the
Reagan coalition that really won three landslide elections, two
Reagan elections and then George Bush on Ronald Reagan's coattails
in his first race.  Put that coalition together again, and that
is 55 to maybe 59 percent of the American people.  That is a majority
in any race, and it is the road to victory for the Republican
party.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, thank you so much for being with us today.
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <I>Straight
Talk</I> discusses the new sexual revolution.  Stay with us to
hear why teens are committing themselves to abstinence.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  In the beginning of the sexual revolution,
our cultural leaders, from liberal university professors to movie
stars, first questioned marriage, said love should be free, said
we didn't need that kind of commitment.  But free love turned
out to cost everything, from dreams of growing old with one faithful
partner to sometimes life itself.
<p>
So our society went looking for band-aids to cover the symptoms.
Sometimes a temporary fix came in new drugs for the latest twist
on sexually transmitted diseases, like chlamydia and syphilis.
Then came AIDS.  Now they are pushing condoms, saying sex should
be safe, but safe sex can be risky to your health and your heart,
and so the pendulum swings back.  Generation X polls indicate
a new revolution, a time for a love that is real and lasting and
pure, a love that sees sex as a celebration of two lives shared
together forever.
<p>
Are these ideas controversial?  They are the foundations
of Family Research Council's Save Sex for Marriage campaign, which
featured young adults who have committed themselves from this
day forward to save sex for a lifetime love in marriage.  The
campaign appeared in national magazines such as <I>Rolling Stone</I>,
<I>Seventeen</I>, and <I>Teen</I>, and the response isn't what
you may think.
<p>
Many young adults called and wrote FRC actually thanking
the pro-family organization for speaking for the growing number
of people who don't want to be a statistic of one night stands
and broken dreams.  Relationships are very important to the generation
which best understands the tragedies of divorce, fatherlessness,
and abandonment.
<p>
Today not everybody is doing it.  There is a resurgence toward
abstinence, in part because it is easy to see that so-called safe
sex isn't safe and it isn't enough.  In fact, in a recent survey,
84 percent of sexually active teenage girls said that the topic
they most wanted information on was how to say no to sex without
hurting the other person's feelings.
<p>
Research also indicates that the sexually active struggle
with the untold story of emotional ties difficult to break, and
in a sexually predatory environment, many people are looking for
a way out, as well as a way to tell a real love from a line.
<p>
Among America's youth, virgin is no longer a dirty word.
The new sexual revolution isn't about sex at all.  It is about
saving it.
<p>
As you can see, a whole new sexual revolution is afoot, and
to help us understand why, I am joined by Juliette Pierce, an
abstinence educator who created her own successful program called
Choices from the Heart; Mike Griffin, a high school teacher who
has implemented abstinence education for students at Bishop McNamara
High School; and Gracie Hsu, a Family Research Council analyst
who has studied teen sexuality and written a number of pieces
redefining today's sexual attitude.
<p>
Welcome to the show, everyone.  Thanks so much for joining
us.  I am in very sacred company here, the experts.  You all have
been looking at issues of teen sexuality for a long time, and
we were talking before the show started.  I had a sex education
program where we had to learn how much it cost and where we could
buy it and had pop quizzes on that kind of thing.  I imagine that
you all wouldn't want to see that taught in some of the programs
you are working with.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  No, you would not be getting that in Mr. Griffin's
sex ed course.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What would I be getting?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Well, I am teaching at a Catholic school, which
focuses on a lot of things from the Catholic teaching, but even
more specifically to the sex education issue, you get a values-based
curriculum.  The kids need to know the plumbing of sexuality in
the body; more importantly, they need to know how that relates
to their life.  Oftentimes kids do know some of the plumbing,
but when it comes to choices, they do not know them.
<p>
I'll give you an example.  The other day in my class, I had
a freshman who was telling us the ABCs of the female reproductive
cycle, and when asked the question &quot;how long is the entire
woman's menstrual cycle&quot; gave me the answer of four days.
Now there is a good chance from the numbers that this kid may
be sexually active, which, as I said to the girls in the class,
is a bit scary, that the kids do know the plumbing, but they don't
know the values, and they don't know some of the moral issues
that lay at the heart of human sexuality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you find that as well, Juliette?  You were
working with AIDS and HIV teaching.  Did you find as you were
looking at the mechanics of disease and sex that values was totally
missing?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  I did.  In fact, I talked to a group of youngsters
about don't you want to be involved with someone who loves you,
and the response that I got was what do you mean love?  I don't
want anyone to lie to me.  It was as though they would be insulted
if someone insinuated that there was love involved, because then
they would realize that that wasn't real at all, and they would
prefer the person be honest with them.  So there was a real lack
of values involved.
<p>
So what I try to do with Choices from the Heart is to talk
to them about why it is they choose to be sexually involved. 
What is the reason behind it?  So let's not treat the symptoms
by giving them ways to protect themselves, but let's talk about
how they can really do some introspection, look at the motivations
behind why they are sexually involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What would you say are the top one, two, three
reasons why kids are having sex and having it very young these
days?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Well, I can tell you that I've gotten a separate
set of responses from males and females.  From the females, the
answers range from trying to lay a foundation for a relationship,
trying to solidify a relationship, peer pressure, and then thirdly,
just wanting to feel grown up, and that was the way that they
were doing that.
<p>
The males, on the other hand, had a whole separate list of
responses.  Their responses ranged from peer pressure, feeling
like they were left out if the fellows, quote, unquote, knew that
they were not sexually active, to, you know, the whole idea of
being able to conquer someone and what that is about for them,
and then, lastly, probably just wanting to be involved in a relationship
and making it something that was very special between themselves
and that other person involved.
<p>
But if you will note from those top three responses, there
are very few areas where the males and females agree on the reasoning,
which was a real red flag to say to them, look, there are two
separate agendas being promoted here.  You know, who do you think
is going to win when both people have an agenda and they don't
share the same goals in being sexually active?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Common sense relationship skills.
<p>
Gracie, there is a lot of discussion on abstinence programs,
and we are certainly talking to two people who know how to run
a good one.  What does the research show about how do we help
kids restrain their sexual impulses?
<p>
MS. HSU:  Well, the number one reason why kids become sexually
active is because they don't have a good support base, or at least
that support base is collapsing.  So, of course, the best prevention
is to have two parents in the home who love the kids and who will
raise them with an expectation that they will save sex for marriage.
But beyond that, if there is sex education in the schools, which
we don't completely come down on, but if there is, then we want
it to be in abstinence-based programs, because those programs
have shown to work.
<p>
In complete contradiction, the contraceptive-based approaches
actually show that there is more sexual activity, more exposure
to sexually transmitted diseases, and an increase in teen pregnancy,
and that is not what we are looking for.  We are looking for success,
because what contraceptive programs do is that they make equivalent
not having sex the same as having sex as long as you don't have
any of these outcomes, and we know that when you have sex, even
if you don't get pregnant or get an STD, that you are going to
be suffering long-term with broken relationships, in marriage,
with a more difficult time to have sexual satisfaction, things
that really do impact kids' lives on a long-term basis.
<p>
But if I could just give a little pitch to some good abstinence
programs, for example, Best Friends, right here in the city, has
just done a recent evaluation, and it showed that only 1.1 percent
of all the girls that have been through this program have gotten
pregnant.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And this is a relational program, where you
pair girls up with an adult to provide a little more support.
<p>
MS. HSU:  Right, and there is also the positive peer pressure
that comes about, because they will say I'm your friend, and you
cannot do this, and I will hold you accountable.  And that's really
what this is all about, and we would like to see that kind of
thing replicated, because it really has to do with positive relationships.
If they have a good father figure, you know, or a good mom who
is willing to lay down the rules and hold them accountable, then
you know that you are going to have a far better -- not just in
terms of being abstinent, but a better kid in terms of character
development, being able to have self-control and self-discipline.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the people on the left say that the
reason why kids are getting pregnant is they just don't know enough
about condoms, and they are going to hand them out everywhere
we go; we're going to make them free; we're going to subsidize
them.  Ironically, we spend about $10 for every condom-based program
to any $1 or less than $1 on abstinence.  Do you find that kids
have heard of condoms?  You know, have they heard of contraceptives?
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, definitely.  Let me say one thing.  Teaching
in a Catholic school, there are a lot of things that may be different,
but in terms of teaching this issue, I don't think what I'm teaching
is anything different than could be taught in a public school,
and make no mistake about it:  from dealing every day with teenagers,
promoting condoms as well as the abstinence message sends a double
message.  You can't have it both ways.
<p>
I had one of my students last year who, when I described
Joycelyn Elders saying we want to teach abstinence but we also
need to teach them what to do in the back seat and that is using
latex condoms, you know, they said to me, they said, &quot;Mr.
Griffin, what are they saying?  They are saying on one hand, you
should be abstinent and wait until you're married, but on the
other hand here's a bunch of condoms.  You know, what are the
condoms for, to abstain with?&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
And the kids ask the questions.  We need to, as adults, realize
that they need some guidance, and that's why I could not agree
more with what Gracie said.  As a teacher, I know that ten times,
maybe a hundred times, more important than what I do is what goes
on in the home, and that's where the public schools might take
a lesson from the Catholic schools in which our job is to support
what the parents are being taught, and the parents want values
taught.
<p>
They don't want to turn their kids over to sex educators
and health educators in the public school who have their own agenda
and their own set of priorities for these kids.  They want values
taught to them, and even if parents may not have made all the
right choices themselves, they want something different for their
kids, and they want some help.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Juliette, you work with some kids that are
really troubled.  If the home is broken down, what do you think
a person like yourself can tell them?  We have about a minute
left.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  What I do is I talk to them about what their
goals and aspirations are.  What is it that they would like to
see in terms of their life, and then let's talk about the choices
that you're making right now and how that plays into your ability
to realize those goals and dreams and aspirations.  So even if
their home life is such that they really can't see any support
or reinforcement, but I'm saying to them I know that's what you're
seeing, but what about your life?  You have some degree of control,
and let's talk about how you can make the best choice.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  These are exciting programs.  Please join us
after the commercial break as we continue to discuss why young
people need to hear that saving sex is the best way to save themselves
from physical consequences and emotional heartache.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <I>Straight Talk</I>.  I am
joined again by two people who offer more to teens than the choice
of using or not using a condom, abstinence educators Juliette
Pierce and Mike Griffin, and we are joined by Rob Anderson, a
medical technician and body builder who was featured as a model
in the Family Research Council Save Sex campaign.  Thanks so much
for joining us, you all.
<p>
These guys are some professionals, Rob, but I know you work
with kids regularly and have used body building even to help meet
people and as an inroad.  What do you find when you're talking
to kids really helps them say I want to take control of my sex
life, as well as my physical life and my mental life.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, the thing I've found most important
is developing a relationship with the kids, getting to know them,
and I think the most important thing is credibility.  When they
know that you've taken a stand and that you have made a commitment
to abstinence and that you are doing the same thing that you're
talking to them about doing, they really appreciate and respond
to that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you find that it has called a more open
communication maybe than you were initially comfortable with to
kind of take that stand?
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, yes, it got real open.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
I really had no intentions of ever modeling for a poster
promoting abstinence or anything like that, and you know, when
people who knew that I took that stand asked me would you do that,
I thought, my goodness, but the opportunity presented itself and
I said if I'm really going to take a stand, I might as well take
the stand.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.  Very visible, too.
<p>
In your work, do you find people like Rob who stand up and
who is an athlete, does that make a difference when you see other
people, other adults, taking a stand?  Juliette, what do you find?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  It makes a tremendous difference, because I
can tell you that in the earlier part of actually introducing
Choices from the Heart, I felt like I was the lone voice crying
in the wilderness, and there were so many people who felt very
passionately that I was wasting my time.  So to see someone like
Rob say that, you know, I believe in this enough to go public
with it and to talk about it is very important, and I think youth
can identify with someone who they know is not too old to have
any fun.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.  Or want to, anyway.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Exactly, exactly.  And they say if this person
has made this decision, then maybe I should think again about
the choices that I've made.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Great.
<p>
Being in a faith-based school, Mike, I wonder if it is different.
Probably people assume there are lots of role models around.
What has helped support your efforts?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Well, it is definitely role models, and Rob
won't be leaving the studio today until he agrees to come to Bishop
McNamara to talk to my kids.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But, yes, they need role models, and they do sort of assume
-- you know, we were talking before the show; a lot of people
assume Catholic school, all of a sudden these kids will have gotten
this education already, but they need role models, too.  They
need people who will walk the walk, and that is one of the things
that I have found helps the effectiveness of my program.
<p>
Some days I'll walk in there and I feel like I am fighting
every single cultural attitude out there, but the one thing that
I have is I'm walking the walk, and I can tell them this is what
I stand for, and kids today, if they need anything, it's someone
who will stand up for something.  In a society where so often
they see people bend their own morals just to fit whatever they
want to do with their life or their particular immediate goal,
to see someone who will stand up for values is something that
they will take with them forever, and that will make a difference.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We've been talking a lot about saving sex and
abstinence, and I think we have to emphasize that we are not talking
about people who maybe have never had sex.  We're talking about
people making a decision from today forward.
<p>
Rob, when you're talking to kids, do you see a lot of kids
discouraged, you know, saying I'm sorry, I had sex; I can't do
what you're doing; it's too late for me.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Oh, yeah, definitely.  I've seen a lot of
kids like that.  I went to one group downtown, and this one girl
said, you know, &quot;I understand you're telling me that I have
a choice, but sometimes you get in situations where you don't
have a choice,&quot; and I was just devastated.  I mean, I didn't
feel like I could say anything.  But talking to those folks, I
always try to emphasize that it is from this day forward.  A commitment
to abstinence, like you said, isn't -- you can't commit to the
past.  You can only commit from this day forward, and hopefully
I can be encouraging to folks that way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Juliette, what do you say to the kid who says
&quot;look, I can't do it; it's too late for me&quot;?  What's
your response?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  Well, I tell them from my own personal experience.
I tell them that at 22 I came to the realization that, you know,
I was tired of having my heart broken, and I realized that there
was a direct correlation between the amount of involvement that
I had in a relationship and my ability to recover after the relationship
was long over.
<p>
So what I do is I share with them that this is something
that you can do, and what you have to do is really make a decision
and then look at your lifestyle, look at the company that you
keep, look at the choices that you are making, and let all of
those things correspond or reinforce your decision to be abstinent
from this day forward.
<p>
So that means that if you are involved with someone and that
person has not taken the same stand, then chances are that that
relationship is going to go through quite a bit of tension, because
you are going to be fighting against, you know, someone who wants
to be involved with something that you don't.  So I encourage
them to involve themselves with individuals who are of like mind
so that they are already lessening the chances that they will
be faced with compromising situations, and to think through a
date.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, right.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  So if it means that John can't walk me to the
door tonight because long good-byes lead to early good mornings,
then John can't walk me to the door.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's right.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  And try not to spend a lot of time alone with
that person, because you know that chemistry alone is going to
cause you to interact with one another, but if you are in the
company of others and everybody is on the same page regarding
their commitment, then chances are you're not going to be involved
in those compromising scenarios.
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, I have to say, in talking with my students,
some of the most powerful and persuasive moments when I can see
the benefits of abstinence come from those who may have been sexually
active.  I was in my classroom the other day, and I felt like
Rob; I felt like I wanted to break down when one of my 16-year-old
students looked at me and said, &quot;you know, being involved
in this game and in this lifestyle, sometimes it's gotten to the
point where I'll be talking and a boy will be talking to me, and
I'll even in the back of my mind ask myself, you know, why is
he messing with me?  Why is he even talking to me?  What's he
got on his mind?&quot;
<p>
I thought how sad to be 16 and so cynical, but how realistic,
too, and what the kids need to see is, as you said in the opening
piece, the sexual revolution, all of these great rewards that
are supposed to come from this type of living and from this activity
just don't cut it.  They don't happen.  They don't make it.  So
sometimes those kids who may have been in this situation can be
really powerful.
<p>
So I try to bring some of my seniors, maybe who have been
sexually active and who as a result of the course have chosen
abstinence, come back, talked to the younger kids, and tell them
I know, I've been there, and I can see why that's a lie; that
lifestyle, and those goals, and those promised rewards don't end
up materializing.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  The other piece of that, too, that I want to
add is that there's a misconception that intimacy means physical,
and one thing that I reinforce to them is you can be intimate
with someone and hold their hand, because intimacy is your willingness
to commit to knowing what's going on in my heart and what's going
on in my mind, and if you are willing to do that, then you can
look at me, and I'll feel as close to you or even closer than
if we were actually physically involved.
<p>
So let's look at what intimacy really is and the commitment
that it takes to get there and not just reserve it for something
that is physical, because truly that is where we have missed the
boat.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And in taking marriage out of the equation,
we've lost the fact that sex is the culmination of an intimate
relationship, not the evidence of it.
<p>
We don't have a lot of time left, but one thing that we've
looked at, and I wanted to see if you all agree with us.  So much
discussion of AIDS and death and the down, how sex can kill, as
the Family Research Council has looked at data, we've said, look,
it can't be all about death.  We're not telling them don't get
a disease.  We're telling them there is something good out there
if you have the skills and the self-confidence to wait for it.
<p>
Let's go around quickly before we get to the end.  Rob, what
would you tell kids in terms of why it's a joyful, enjoyable thing
to wait, rather than just the AIDS.  I mean, we know sex can kill.
What don't we know about how good it can be to have a more stable
relationship?
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  Well, I'd say that I waited, and it was worth
the wait.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
I just got married this December.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Congratulations.
<p>
MR. ANDERSON:  And that commitment to save sex for marriage
is now a new commitment to stay committed to my wife for the rest
of my life, and I would just say that that commitment just yields
peace in my heart from knowing that I'm not bringing a whole lot
of baggage into my marriage relationship, and my virginity was
a gift to my wife on my wedding night, and it was a blessing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.
<p>
Mike, what would you say, the positive side?
<p>
MR. GRIFFIN:  Yes, that's why I get really personal with
the kids.  I tell them, you know, the reason why I'm waiting is
so that when and if I get married I can look at my wife and say
I loved you even before I knew you, and I committed myself, and
if I want to go all the way with marriage, I want an all-the-way
way to celebrate it, and that is through sex in marriage, and
the rewards will come after that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That's fantastic.
<p>
Juliette, what would you say, the positive?
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  I would let them know that the choices that
they make today will give them the ability to make choices in
the days ahead, but if you don't make the right choices now, then
you don't have the ability to make the choices in the days ahead.
So to draw the correlation between the right now and then, and
every young person has goals and aspirations.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Oh, yes.
<p>
MS. PIERCE:  No matter what they are or how bizarre they
may be, they all have them.  And wouldn't it be great to know
that all of those possibilities are available to you and that
absent of something tragic, you have the ability to live out those
dreams.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I hope that people will call us to hear more
from you all.  Thank you so much for coming.
<p>
When we return, <I>Straight Talk</I> will bring you some
individuals who have committed themselves to saving sex for real
love.  They have their own unique reasons and experiences, and
you won't want to miss them.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <I>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</I>.  I would like to welcome some
very special individuals to our show, Kate Gilchrist, a young
woman who, although formerly sexually active, has committed herself
to saving sex for marriage, and Maggie Kuhn and Scott White, each
of whom are waiting to share themselves with their lifetime love
in marriage.  Thanks to you all for being here.  We really appreciate
your time.
<p>
We see a lot of discussion, especially in the world of numbers,
about Generation X and what people think and what people feel,
but you're the people everybody is really talking about.  How
do your peers see sex?  Do they think it's insignificant whether
or not sex takes place, or are they concerned about issues of
the heart?
<p>
Scott, how about you?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  I think a lot of kids think that sex is just
something that they can do in high school that there really aren't
any consequences with what happens afterwards.  They really don't
see the long-term effects of maybe a pregnancy or maybe an STD,
but it really just depends on what circle of friends that you
get into, with some kids getting involved with different things,
where you see some that completely stay away from sex and that's
not even an option, but other people just think of it as a casual
thing on the weekends.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that most people, Maggie, appreciate
the consequences?  Are they thinking about AIDS?  Are they thinking
about anything?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I think a lot of time people, especially high
school students, are just so excited about the freedoms that they
have in high school.  It's just getting older and knowing that
you're your own person.  I think a lot of times people don't really
think about the consequences, because they're so caught up in
doing what I want to do, and they don't really think about whether
or not this is what they want to do.  They're thinking about,
you know, what's great for right now, and they're not always thinking
about the long-term consequences.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think, Kate, that there's not enough
information out there, or do you think it's the way it's told,
or do people need more of a personal approach, someone to come
alongside.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I think that there is plenty of information
out there, and I think that it is an individual's own choice.
I think it is a lot the age that you're at in high school.  You
go through, like, this rebellious stage where it is easy to just
totally go against your parents, even if they talk to you about
it all.  I really don't think that a one-on-one would work.  I
think it really just depends on the individual itself, because
I know that I wouldn't have accepted a one-on-one from anybody.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What helped you make your decision to say from
this day forward I'm going to save sex for marriage?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I got sent away to a program for two years,
and I realized that God had really just taken me out of the whole
situation that I was in and placed me in a place that could just
help me get my priorities straight again, and when I was able
to come back home I was so different that I did not want to even
resort back to sex, because I realized how much God had just done
for me when he pulled me out of that whole situation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So in your circumstances, it would have been
faith that made a key difference.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  Yeah.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Among your friends who are saving sex, what
do you think is making a difference?  What's helping people make
that kind of decision?  Scott, what do you think?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  I think that a lot of kids, really, they don't
want to see sex as -- it's the ultimate gift that you can give
your husband or your wife, and that's just something that you
can really -- that's the one thing that you can hold onto and
that nobody else can take away, and it's really your decision,
because a lot of things in this world, you really can't count
on, and that's one thing that you know that you can have and that's
going to be your decision to give up or not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What about you, Maggie?  What do you think
is helping people when they make a decision to save sex?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I think it's very much a personal conviction.
I think you hear so much about sex in our society.  It's so common.
It's just something you have to decide on your own, and I think
for most of my friends and for myself, I think it's just having
faith in God's plan and knowing that sex is perfect when it's
within marriage, and you just have to wait, and you know, it's
hard to wait, because we're all human.  We want immediate answers,
and we want immediate intimacy, and sex seems like such an easy
way sometimes, but really it works in the opposite direction,
and when you really wait, sex is just created for marriage, and
that's how it's the best.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you all are talking about a lot of people
have to make up their own minds, but Scott, you're on a council
in your high school to kind of bring some abstinence-based programs
in. Do you think a peer group approach works better?  What motivated
you?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  A lot of kids -- the council is just a student
advisory council, and they're basically what Fairfax County, which
is the high school system I go to -- they're using that as a forum;
they're now using abstinence as an option, whereas before it was
more geared toward safe sex.  Most people are just really -- the
approach they are trying to do is just a peer-based group, and
they are trying to use peers as saying, look, this is going to
be an option instead of just worrying about safe sex, or no sex
at all.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you guys think about the culture that you
live in, you know, the movies, the music, is any one thing more
difficult to take than any other?  Where does the most pressure
come from in terms of kind of saying, hey, it's no big deal, have
sex, whatever?  Maggie, what is your impression?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I can't really single out one specific type of
media or one specific area of our culture.  I think it's all over,
and that's what is so overwhelming is that it's not just one area.
It's not one thing you can turn off.  It's everything.  It's
in music.  It's in television.  I mean, you read about it all
the time, and that's what is so overwhelming is that our society
just -- it's just common.  You know, having sex before marriage
is seen as totally normal, whereas saving yourself until you're
married is just -- well, it's not spoken of, really.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It really isn't, is it?  Kate, now that you've
made even a chance of plan, are people respecting your change?
Are they saying great job?  What's the response of people?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  A lot of people at my high school -- it's
a public school, you know, not a lot of Christians around there
-- they don't understand why I can't have sex, as long as when
I get older it's not as it is now, you know, just a lot of different
people and stuff, and people at my church and at youth group where
we go to, they really accept it and they just think that it's
great, and I'm really affirmed by that, and there are people at
school that, you know, they're, like, that's just amazing that
you can do that, you know.  It's hard.  It seriously is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Where do you think some of the biggest pressure
comes from, if you kind of look -- is it the whole pile-on of
the culture?
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  I think it's everything.  I think that there
is a lot of peer pressure in the schools, and not only in the
schools, in the music that you listen to.  I know I listen to
a lot of R&amp;B and stuff, and every song that you pretty much
hear, every slow song, is about, like, somebody's legs or having
sex with somebody, and seriously it is, and it's just like, whoa,
what does that put in my mind, and t.v. shows like <I>Melrose
Place</I> and <I>90210</I> and just shows like that.
<p>
I mean, it's just like relationship, relationship, having
sex with one person and another.  It's just crazy stuff, and it
just all really just fills up your mind.  I think it's how much
you accept it and how much you watch that stuff.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sure.
<p>
MS. GILCHRIST:  Like, I just choose not to watch those t.v.
shows.  One, my mom won't let me, but, two, I just choose not
to, because I see a reason why.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How can any of you defend yourself?  You've
made a decision.  You know, what do you do to defend yourself,
maybe, from the culture or even from the peer group that might
say, you know, hey, it doesn't matter.  Scott, what can you do?
<p>
MR. WHITE:  Well, I think it's really like Maggie said before.
It's a personal conviction, and that is just the basis, I think,
of my walk and knowing God's plan for me.  He knows that whatever
happens, if I'm supposed to get married or not, that He has just
called me, and He has just said I'm not supposed to have sex right
now, and that's just one of those things that you just kind of
take to heart and you just really think about, that you don't
really have -- that is not an option for me right now to worry
about.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We have very little time left.  Maggie, I'm
going to let you close us out.  What advice would you give someone
who is kind of struggling right now?  How would you encourage
them to make the kind of decisions that you three have so courageously
made?
<p>
MS. KUHN:  I would just say to just step out for a second,
step out of your life and look in and look at what you're doing
and really, you know, question your actions.  I think so often
people just act without thinking, and when you really get down
to it and think about having sex before marriage, it honestly
doesn't make sense.
<p>
I just think so many people if they just took a step back
and actually looked at what they were choosing to do, whether
it be just like a quick decision or even if they think, okay,
well, I really love this person, I think they really need to just
stop and think about what they are deciding and remember that
sex is a lot more than a physical thing.  It has emotional ties.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  It's really personal.
<p>
Thanks a lot.  Thank you for joining me, and when we come
back, there will be more <I>Straight Talk.</I>
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>.  FRC staff is often asked by the media to
present their views on issues affecting families today.  In December,
Cathy Cleaver, FRC's Director of Legal Policy, gave her view on
the increasing cyberporn threat.  So let's take a look at an excerpt
from an <I>NBC Nightly News</I> cyberporn story as <I>Straight
Talk</I> brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from <I>NBC Nightly News</I> follows:]
<p>
MS. PAULEY:  A different kind of government shutdown in the
news tonight.  What happens when smut and freedom of speech collide
on the Internet?  Today Americans who use the CompuServe on-line
service found they were subject to another country's rules.  Here
is NBC's Fred Francis[?].
<p>
MR. FRANCIS:  Because CompuServe has a global reach, it says
it was forced to block -- some say censor -- access to 200 sexually
explicit discussion groups on the Internet to appease a German
prosecutor who found the material pornographic.
<p>
In the dark alleys of cyberspace, where pedophiles can prey
upon very young children, it is common on the Internet for sexual
predators to roam free.  This man was charged and convicted for
luring children through the home computer.  Even adults are often
enticed by raw and raunchy pictures and text.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  It's going to take laws like Germany has, saying
we are not going to tolerate child pornography; CompuServe, stop
serving it to your subscribers on a silver platter.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  <I>Straight Talk</I> continues after the break.
Stay with us to hear how you can get more information regarding
the issues and trends affecting you and your family.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <I>Straight
Talk from the Family Research Council</I>.  If you would like
to receive more information about our organization, tonight's
guests, or the topics discussed, call us at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will be discussing one of the hottest family
issues nationwide and in Washington, D.C., parental rights.  What
are parents privy to and excluded from when it comes to their
children's lives and sometimes life-changing decisions?  We hope
you will join us next week to find out as we continue to bring
you a unique pro-family perspective not often heard in the media
and exclusively seen here on <I>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</I>. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. 
I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> asks who 
holds the right to raise our nation's children today.  Inherently it is 
the parents' rights to decide their children's upbringing and education, but 
these essential rights are being challenged across America.
<p>
For example, just last summer Mr. and Mrs. Raymond Earls[?] were refused the 
right to the results of AIDS tests and cervical cancer tests given to
their 13- and 15-year-old daughters.  Who held back those results?
The same Georgia middle school that condoned a counselor driving
the girls to a health clinic during school hours where they were
tested, given condoms, and prescriptions for birth control pills
without their parents' knowledge.  We will find out why this scenario
is becoming increasingly common and how some are attempting to
combat increasing government control over our children's lives.
<p>
But first, let's hear about the current buzz in Washington and
across the country about the first Republican primary.  I had
the opportunity to discuss the Iowa and New Hampshire results
with Family Research Council's Bob Morrison, who is special assistant
to Gary Bauer.  Bob provides insights into what the primaries
mean to you and what they could mean to our country's upcoming
elections.  With Super Tuesday just around the corner, you probably
won't read Bob's perspectives in your local newspaper or hear
it on your favorite newscasts.  So stay with us as <i>Straight Talk</i>
takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, thank you so much for being with us here on Behind the 
Headlines. A lot of attention is being paid to Iowa and New Hampshire right
now.  Is that attention deserved?  Historically, have these states
been make or break?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Sure they have.  They are very, very important throughout 
their history.  It is a way for a system that has grown large and unwieldy 
to sort of break it down into a manageable size, Iowa being part of the Midwest, 
New Hampshire representing sort of the flinty Yankee tradition.  They are 
still states where you can do politicking on a retail basis, at least
until this year, where it wasn't always a question of how many
ads can you throw up on television but how many people can you
meet in lodge halls and church basements and high school auditoriums.
How many people can you just go to a meeting among farmers? 
So both states are manageable, and that is why they play a critical
role.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think there is something special in
the mix of midwestern practicality and family values and the northeastern
frugality that makes it really important that we be in those two
particular states, or do the candidates really illuminate themselves?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Well, there is a conservative bent, in that sense.
In the Republican caucuses and primaries in those states, there
is a tendency toward a more conservative side, which the Republican
party has seemed to represent over time.  In the Democratic party,
that is not necessarily the case.  In the Democratic party, some
notable liberals have done well in Iowa and in New Hampshire.
So those are critical points.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How have they evolved in importance?  Well, in this year in 
particular we have had what is called a front-loading of the primary and 
caucus system, so that candidates have really been out there campaigning 
furiously for well over a year.  Some of those candidates who announced
for president in the Republican side announced six months to nine
months earlier than they typically did in years past.  There is
going to be a fury of campaign primaries -- mostly primaries from
this point on -- between now and the end of March.
<p>
So it is very possible by mid-April, by tax time, we may see a winner emerge
who has amassed more than half of the delegates that are necessary
to be nominated on the Democratic side and on the Republican side.
Now it is assumed that President Clinton has no opposition, no
declared opposition, that they will just sort of routinely go
through the motions and he will wrap up the victories he needs
to assure his renomination.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One rather schizophrenic criticism of the process is that on the 
one hand Iowa and New Hampshire make really liberal Democratic choices and on 
the other hand very conservative Republican choices.  Is that fair?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  The activists in both parties tend toward being liberal
in the Democratic party and conservative in the Republican party.
That is the tendency.  Now we all know that there are well-known
conservative Democrats:  Governor Casey of Pennsylvania, Sam Nunn
of Georgia.
<p>
There are conservatives in the Democratic party; there
are liberals in Republican party:  Arlen Specter, Governor William
Weld.  So to the extent that these folks still get elected in
various offices, you cannot say that the parties are monochrome,
they're all one thing or all the other.  But this is the first
opportunity to bring out some of those seething activists who
have been waiting to get in there and pitch in every four years,
the people who may have a terminal case of Potomac fever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Every political year, people like to complain about
the limited choices available to them, and yet the political process
does seem to continue.  How have some of our greatest leaders
fared in the Iowa and New Hampshire process?
<p>
MR. MORRISON: They are relatively modern vintage, so basically Ronald 
Reagan, as I mentioned, did not do well in Iowa in 1980, came smashing 
back to beat not only George Bush but Bob Dole and a host of other
contenders in 1980, and Reagan was basically the man to beat after
the New Hampshire primary.  In 1984, the New Hampshire primary,
the Republicans, Reagan was just renominated.  There was no contest
really.  But for the Democrats it was a very big fight, and that
is when Gary Hart came forward.
<p>
As far as presidents who have been elected, as I mentioned, Reagan did 
well in New Hampshire. We also had Carter doing well in the Iowa caucuses. 
Carter came on to win the New Hampshire primary in 1976.  Bush, of course,
coming out of New Hampshire in 1988, captured the nomination and
went on to win the election.
<p>
A key New Hampshire contest was four years ago for Bill Clinton.  Bill 
Clinton was in serious trouble in his candidacy.  There were stories about 
draft evasion. There were stories about womanizing.  He was in very, very 
serious political shape, but he was able to score a number two slot.  He did 
not win the New Hampshire primary.  Neighboring Senator Paul Tsongas,
former senator from Massachusetts, actually won, but this is that
expectations game.
<p>
Clinton was able to come up so close to Tsongas in New Hampshire that 
he virtually came out and proclaimed himself the comeback kid and 
essentially was able to reenergize his campaign coming out of New Hampshire. 
In a short period of time, people thought that Clinton had won New Hampshire.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Prior to the influence of Iowa and New Hampshire, most political 
candidates were chosen by party bosses in the back room.  Now we have this
more democratic approach, Iowa and New Hampshire, I think, very
powerful in that.  Are we better served today by electing our
candidates in primaries or by the old system?
<p>
MR. MORRISON: If you had a national primary, then the other things that 
people don't like, the concentration on money, would only be that much
more intense.  You would have to raise huge amounts of money to
mount a campaign nationwide.  Even as we have it, with what's
left of Super Tuesday, several southern states holding primaries
on the same day, as we come out of New Hampshire you are going
to see that a lot of people have to raise a huge amount of money
very quickly.
<p>
The odds will then tend to favor those who have already raised a huge 
amount of money. President Clinton obviously is in good shape for 
fundraising.  Senator Dole is in good shape for fundraising.  But it 
is not absolute.  The interesting thing is what these states do in spite of 
big money, and the example that we have this year is the fate of Senator Gramm.
<p>
Senator Gramm once said that he had the best friend in politics that you 
could have, ready money, and he had said that you needed to have $20
million to even get into this game.  He didn't even get to the
first primary, and that's not the only time that has happened.
Texas Governor John Connelly, former Secretary of Treasury, he
raised a massive amount of money in his campaign -- I believe
it was close to $10 million -- back in 1980, and yet Governor
Connelly did not survive this Iowa and New Hampshire winnowing
process.  So basically what Iowa and New Hampshire do is not so
much to give us the nominee but kind of tell us who has been culled
from the pack.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Well, Bob, as you and I are sitting here talking, people 
are actually voting in New Hampshire. So when the people are watching 
this <i>Straight Talk</i> episode, already the results will be known. What 
would you tell those people who are already aware of what happened?  How 
could they interpret the events?
<p>
MR. MORRISON:  Well, just basically don't lose heart,
be engaged, make your wishes known.  If you are happy with the
outcome, stay with it.  Encourage other people.  We have had too
much disaffection and cynicism in our political system.  It is
not an ideal system, but as Winston Churchill said, democracy
is the worst system except for all others that have been tried.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being with us on <i>Straight
Talk</i>.
<p>
MR. MORRISON: My pleasure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> delves 
into why parents' rights to make and influence key decisions in their 
children's lives are slowly diminishing. Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am now joined by Cathy Cleaver, Director of Legal Policy 
for the Family Research Council.  Cathy's extensive research into
the parental rights issue has led her to some interesting court
cases currently being battled across the United States.  Also
joining me is Paul Webster, a legislative assistant to Congressman
Steve Largent of Oklahoma who introduced the Parental Rights and
Responsibilities Act of 1995.  Welcome, both of you, to the show.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Cathy, you have been tracking this issue for a while, and 
for others it might seem self-evident. Okay, we care about parents. We 
think they should be in charge of their families.  But what has brought us 
to the point where we are actually looking for legal outcomes?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, we are just recently seeing an increasing, I feel, 
arrogance on the part of government in protecting children from their 
parents. We have seen it at the U.N., in the rights of the child, and
now we have seen it increasingly in our country.  The most evident
examples are the condom distribution programs, where condoms are
given to children as young as 11 or 12 years old, even over their
parents' objections.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And even in New York, the New York state court ruled that 
the parents could have no say.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  Well, New York, we were lucky in New York two years
ago.  New York said, no, this does violate parental rights, but
just last month the Massachusetts Supreme Court case saying parents
have no rights in this regard, children will be given these condoms,
even if parents object, was denied a hearing by the Supreme Court.
So now we have a terrible situation in Massachusetts where parents'
rights were simply dismissed.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So having conflicting cases, Massachusetts and New York, does 
that drive it towards the Supreme Court, do you think?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Perhaps eventually. That's what we thought would drive it to 
the court this time, but they said no.  I am sure there will be other cases, 
and we will be working on cases to take it up to the court to resolve
this, because there is precedent at the court.  The court has
said that parents have this right and that the right shouldn't
be infringed.  So it's not anything new that we are searching
here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Paul, wasn't the condom distribution kinds
of cases that perked your attention and Congressman Largent's
attention, or were there other things that made you think we need
to get involved legislatively?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Well, what our interest was was a desire to support and protect 
America's families.  Congressman Largent came to Washington with really an 
agenda that was two-fold: one of them which focused on fiscal matters, 
balancing the federal budget; the other one specifically was to support and 
garner some kind of governmental, I guess, inactivity or limits on the 
government to the kinds of things that are going on that many families across
our country feel are threatening or infringing their ability to
just live the way that they live, live the way that they were
brought up, those types of interests.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Give us an example, you know, some issues that you all were 
looking at and saying I think the line is getting a little fuzzy here, and 
it shouldn't be.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Well, I think it's very clear.  I was asked a question, 
&quot;well, I have kids, and are you telling me that all these government 
interests are trying to break down my door and do terrible things between 
my children and I?&quot; My response is I don't think that anybody is 
proactively targeting your family to go after and make some kind of mischief.
<p>
What we hear in our office are families that are going about their 
business attempting to raise their children the way that they raised or
the way that they think that their conscience dictates and finding
that just in the normal course of day-to-day activities, either
through a school or through some other government agency, that
they are now prohibited from just confronting their educators
and saying, hey, listen, I take great pains to instill in my children
things that we believe in and values that are important to us,
and we would really appreciate it if you didn't contradict us
through whatever means that you are doing so now.  And those kinds
of reasonable actions are the kinds of actions that many times
across the country have been halted and really given families
very little recourse in terms of what they can expect and what
kind of support they can expect from the government.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So it has been particularly sensitive on issues like sex 
education, condom distribution, and the discussion of values that might 
come up in, say, outcome-based education, where we are going to define
diversity as a value and then maybe bring in issues regarding
homosexuality that might have a different moral perspective than
parents.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER:  The school is very often the setting for
these kinds of violations of parental rights.  Psychological counseling
that parents don't want given to their children but that is given,
regardless of the objection, that is another big area, but even
outside the school, child protective services sometimes have come
into the home -- in fact, I shouldn't say sometimes, more often
that we would like -- come into the home and removed children
on mere rumor or on things as benign as spanking of a child. 
Now that doesn't happen every day, but it's happening with increasing
frequency, and that is sounding an alarm for parents.  You know,
we should be able to discipline our children with reasonable corporal
punishment, for instance.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.  You know, I think one thing a lot of people aren't 
aware of is that the Children's Defense Fund, a very liberal so-called 
pro-child group, formerly headed by Hillary Clinton, has advocated that no 
child be allowed to come home from the hospital until a social worker has 
been there first.  What other big picture, you know, big picture new
world order kind of intrusions do you see proposed by people?
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Well, the children divorcing their parents.  There's
another key example, I think maybe derived from the same group.
We have a case out of Washington State that people have looked
at for some years and have been frustrated about where parents
were trying to protect their child from drugs and from sleeping
from her boyfriend.  This is a minor child, and that child wanted
to file for divorce, and social service agencies came in and said,
no, you child, your rights are being trampled on by your parents.
So we are going to protect you from your parents.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I know, Cathy, you've taken a look at the U.N. convention, 
and one of the concerns of people who want to strengthen parental
rights is that talks about the child's free right of association,
maybe to associate with drug dealers or to associate with people
who they are concerned about.  I think everyone appreciates in
their own life their parents saying that person you cannot hang
out with any more.
<p>
MS. CLEAVER: Beyond even that is the uninhibited right to receive any 
information or any speech or material that the child wants, including 
specifically pornography.  It's ridiculous. I mean, the U.N. is so far 
out of touch, but the scary thing is that U.N. principles are being forced 
upon our country against, I believe, our citizens' will.  President Clinton 
in 1994 signed the U.N. treaty on the convention on the rights of the 
child. It needs to be ratified now, and we are urging the Congress not
to ratify this for that reason alone.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  I think there are really two dominant perspectives on
this whole issue.  One of them is very child-centric, that is,
whatever it takes to enhance and maintain the welfare of the child,
and the other one is a, in my perspective, much more common sense
approach, and that is our country was founded on freedom.  It
was founded on the right to be peculiar, if you will, antiquated,
progressive.
<p>
We have a society that is a free society and whose government was 
established to maintain that freedom, regardless of how it manifests 
itself, and so we are seeing the notion, the concept of freedom being 
held hostage by this idea that we have to protect specific and certain 
segments of our population no matter the cost, even if it costs us our 
freedom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Paul, what is the status of the legislation right now?  Where
is it?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  Well, we are very happy to see a Senate companion
to our House bill.  That is S-984.  The House bill is HR-1946,
and both chambers, the Senate and the House, have conducted subcommittee
hearings where witnesses have testified on behalf or in opposition
to the concept of the right of parents to direct the upbringing
of their children.
<p>
Right now we are working with organizations, the Family Research Council 
and other organizations, to get exact precise types of language that 
allows the courts very little wiggle room in terms of how to interpret 
the rights of parents to direct the upbringing of their children.  We have 
128 co-sponsors on the House side.  So we are very excited about that, and 
we are looking forward to a subcommittee market scheduled where they'll
entertain amendments or changes to the bill.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Great. We are going to want to hear more about that after the 
break, and Cathy, thank you so much for being with us.  I would certainly
encourage anyone to call the Family Research Council for some
of Cathy's excellent materials.  Please join us after the commercial
break as we continue to discuss the rights of parents as we are
joined by those who are on the forefront of this issue.  Stay
tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
[Segment from Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act Press Conference 
follows:]
<p>
MR. LARGENT: Currently there is an imbalance between who makes the decisions 
in the home between parents and the government as you can see represented here 
on our balance.  Parental rights.  I think this is a graphic representation
of what we're talking about.  American families in the balance.
<p>
Currently, parental rights, even though they have been recognized
as a fundamental right by the Supreme Court, by lower court decisions
time and time again all across the country, the lower courts do
not recognize parental rights as a fundamental right.  What we
do with the parental rights bill is codify into law a federal
statute that parental rights are a fundamental right and should
thereby have the same protection as any other fundamental right.
<p>
Today, because of the imbalance or misinterpretation of Supreme
Court ruling, parents must demonstrate that the government has
acted unreasonably in order to prevail.  Government must demonstrate
that it simply has acted in a reasonable fashion in order to prevail
in court cases where their parental rights have been usurped.
<p>
There are four specific areas that we address in the Parental
Rights and Responsibility Act.  That is the right of parents to
direct the upbringing of their children in regards to their education,
their religious training, their medical care, and the discipline
of their own children.
<p>
We'll go to the last chart, and then I'll introduce Greg Erken with Of The 
People. This is what we want to see as a balance between government and 
family in terms of who directs the upbringing of our children.  After the 
Parental Rights bill is passed, we will find a situation where parents
must demonstrate first that the case is about a parental right,
again, one of those four areas that I addressed, and that the
government has intervened in their parental rights.  This is the
four-step process that we are putting in place with the parental
rights bill.
<p>
Then the last two steps, the onus is really on the
government to show that there was a compelling governmental interest,
not a reasonable cause or a reasonable interest, but a compelling
governmental interest existed and it used the least restrictive
means.  This test is applied to all fundamental rights protected
by the Constitution.
<p>
We are not erecting a new test here. We are simply saying that what the 
Supreme Court has decided over the last 70 years in terms of parental 
rights being a fundamental right, that this is the standard that should be 
applied and is the accurate standard that the Supreme Court has already 
decided, and we are simply placing that in federal statute.  So that is
the heartbeat, the guts, of the Parental Rights and Responsibility
Act. That is what we are trying to do.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: I'm Executive Director of Of The People, which is a coalition 
of parents, state legislators, and grass roots activists working at the state 
level to add a parental rights amendment to state constitutions.  Our
efforts at the state level are working in tandem with the federal
efforts here represented by this legislation to guarantee the
rights of parents.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  We find it confusing and alarming that so much of government 
today seems determined to relieve of us of our parental responsibilities 
and rights, especially concerning education.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  As you can see, it seems the parental rights battle has 
begun at the federal level.  I am joined again by a key player, Paul 
Webster, legislative assistant to Congressman Steve Largent. Also 
joining us is Greg Erken, Of The People's executive director, and 
Rebecca Bocchino, a parent who became fed up with her children's education 
and began to research why her fight to change things seemed so hopeless. 
<p>
Thank you for being with us.  Greg, your group has been working at the grass 
roots level to get behind this piece of legislation.  How is that working,
and why did you get involved?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, Of The People has been working for about two years now, as 
you say, at the state level working to add a parental rights amendment to 
state constitutions, and we are also working with Paul and Congressman Steve 
Largent's, who is Of The People's national vice-chairman, in support of the
federal statute.
<p>
Just as some of your other guests have said and
will say, we got into the fight because it seems in so many areas
parents across the country are running into what we call a we
know what's best mentality for your children, whether it's condom
distribution or the resistance to school choice and vouchers,
psychological counseling or the threats to the rights of homeschoolers,
I would connect the dots and say that there is an overall assault
against parental rights and responsibilities, and we need to directly
counteract that at the federal and state level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Yes, it's interesting that you have the right to make 
decisions for your parents unless it's different from a judge or a social
worker, it would appear.  I mean, your rights go as far as their
judgment would take you.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Yes, that's right.  I think what parents are facing now is 
occasionally they are allowed by our kind bureaucratic elites to actually 
oversee their children and their children's decisions once they leave the 
house, but we need to reverse that decision, that attitude, and we need to
make sure that parents in the vast majority of cases are in charge,
and it's the schools and other bureaucratic shops that should
ask the parents can we teach your children this, and how about
this?  Would that be okay if your child was in such-and-such a
class?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Exactly. Rebecca, you are a parent.  I know
that there were some parents that led you to say, you know, this
has been frustrating.  I need to make some changes.  What happened
in your own family situation?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Well, we thought we had moved to one of the best school 
districts in the nation. Fairfax County, Virginia is one of the largest 
school districts in the nation, and we thought we were coming to a place 
where our kids would get the best education that they possibly could,
only to find that most of the decisions were made by the school,
and we found the process of involving parents was so manipulative
that parental input actually was changed to parental reaction,
and I noticed my kids were coming home with more and more intrusive
questions, more intrusive curriculum.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Give us an example.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Guidance counseling, use of journals, sex education. I 
mean, Fairfax County is full of it, and the more questions that I asked, 
the more I was treated like the enemy and the more hostile reaction I got. 
<p>
The guidance counseling manual in Fairfax County goes into great detail in 
instructing counselors how they can stiff-arm parents from getting 
information about what their children are being counseled on, even though 
the manual admits that parents have the right to know, and two parents in
Fairfax County asked through a FOI request, a Freedom of Information
request, to know what was done with their children, and they were
told that it would cost them $600 to find that information out,
and that is unbelievable.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And that is already taxpayer funded. I mean, they are paying 
for the education the children were receiving.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Sure.  And parents found their kids were being exposed 
to psychotherapeutic techniques. Two programs that have received the 
most criticism nationally, Pumsy[?] and DUSO, were both on the approved 
materials list in Fairfax County.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, so people understand, these are sort of dream fantasy 
projection kind of things.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Give them a little detail on what Pumsy, for example,
would do.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Pumsy used guided imagery.  One of the
exercises involved tying up the teacher and blindfolding the teacher
in the middle of the classroom.  These exercises were designed
to teach students that they could retreat into their own mind,
into their own world, that they were the sole authority.  All
information could be obtained within.  Parents found their children
were taking psychotropic trips in the back of the family station
wagon, just self-induced hypnosis whenever they felt like it.
Even though counselors denied that they were using these techniques,
they lobbied hard in the general assembly not to ban the use of
psychotherapeutic techniques in the schools.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Amazing. What are you seeing, Greg?  What other kinds of 
stories? I mean, the majority of the stories seem to come from the schools, 
where taxpayer money is presumably helping our children, but they are
not going to tell us what they are doing to help.  What else are
you seeing?
<p>
MR. ERKEN: Well, I think one of the classic kinds of cases that we see 
nowadays is condom distribution in the public schools, and parents are 
opposing not just the condom distribution, per se, but the fact that 
they are being handed out to their minor children over and against their 
consent, and there have been a couple of legal developments in the past 
couple of years that point out the need, why we need additional legislation 
for parents.
<p>
Parents in New York City a couple of years ago successfully sued
to get an opt-out in New York City for condoms.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now an opt-out, you have to explain that.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: Sure. A parental opt-out is a provision whereby a parent 
doesn't have the ability to stop the distribution period in the schools 
but does have a mechanism to make sure that their child either, say,
does not receive a condom or at least the parent is notified before
their child receives a condom from the school nurse or whatever
the mechanism is.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  While an opt-in program would be parents saying, yes, 
please give my children condoms; here's my written consent, like the same 
thing a parent would do to go on a class trip.  Yes, my child can go, rather 
than my child only can't go if I say no.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  That's right.  In a lot of ways an opt-in is preferable, because, 
after all, aren't we trying to get parents more involved with their child's 
upbringing and in the public schools.  Shouldn't we kind of fight the couch 
potato mentality that allows parents, after all, just like the rest of
us with human nature -- it's too easy to go on autopilot and to
say someone else will make the decisions for my children.  Let's
have parents make those decisions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Paul, you're on Capitol Hill.  What has been the response to 
congressmen and senators when you come with these kinds of horror stories. 
I mean, are they interested in the fact that parents like Rebecca
are being told it's none of your business what happens with your
money or your children?
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Their response is really surprising.  The first response is 
are you serious? Are you telling me that some parent in Georgia has to fight 
in order to not allow the school to take their daughters to a county health 
facility without their knowledge or without their consent?  They say are
you serious that kids in Massachusetts were exposed to blatantly
offensive and sexually explicit materials in the school assembly?
Are you serious that tests are asking things like are there handguns
in your house; are your parents on welfare?  You know, when was
the last time you masturbated?
<p>
They can't believe that this is the state of the relationship between their 
community government and their schools, which for the most part has the 
greatest government access to children and parents.
<p>
The other thing that is hard to believe that I like to point out to legislators 
on Capitol Hill is why is that so many of these state and local governments are
so willing to go to the mat for some of these things that seem
so silly and so peripheral to the education process when national
statistics are replete with examples of illiteracy, inability
to fill out job applications, remedial education in college of
basic mathematics.  I mean, it just seems to be a prioritization
that does not reflect the wishes and the needs of American families.
<p>
So really the biggest reaction is I can't believe that we need
this, and when we do explain to them, they say, wow, that sounds
like very commonsensical legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It's interesting the amount of attention paid to the sex lives 
of children rather than their reading ability.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Oh, it's amazing.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to talk more about that in a moment.
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear more about the endangered
rights of parents.  You won't want to miss it.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. I'd like to welcome our guests back to the
show:  Paul Webster, legislative assistant to Congressman Steve
Largent; Greg Erken, Of The People's executive director; and Rebecca
Bocchino, whose life as a parent was affected by this key issue.
<p>
Rebecca, you were saying that in your discussions with parents
there are a lot of misconceptions about parental rights.  What
are you finding?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  Some parents are making the mistake
that we need to ask the government to give us parental rights,
and that is wrong.  We have the right.  It is inherent.  It's
God-given, it's inalienable, and it is the proper function of
government to secure those rights.  Too many times we even see
Republicans talking about local control.
<p>
This whole opt-in opt-out issue, for example, in Virginia was tossed back 
to the local governments, and even some Republicans were plugging that as 
a good thing. I'd like for legislators and governors and mayors to understand
that parental rights is not subject to local negotiation.  It's
inalienable, it's inherent, it's our right, and it's the proper
functions of government to secure those rights.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And you were saying that sometimes government plays the race 
card in being against opt-ins, for example, which empower parents.
How do they do that?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO:  The Virginia Education Association and the NEA love to 
argue that because some families don't speak English or have other 
cultural barriers, they would not necessarily understand enough to 
make a decision to opt-in to a program. By their own logic, then, they 
also have to admit that they wouldn't understand enough to opt out, 
and if our long-range vision for education is truly lifelong learning, 
shouldn't we do all we can to lift parents up to the point where they can 
make an intelligent decision for their children?
<p>
I don't happen to agree with the statement that minority families are 
incapable of making decisions for their children.  I find minority families 
to be some of the most interested in their children's morals and values and 
education of all, and I disagree with the Virginia Education Association
and the NEA in that assumption, but we really should take a look
at opt-in as the preferred method of obtaining parental consent.
<p>
I mean, you couldn't walk into an emergency room and have a surgeon
go ahead and operate on your child unless you told them no, and
we shouldn't have it that way in the schools, either.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: As a matter of fact, the research would indicate that 
minority parents are even more conservative and concerned, and perhaps
the education establishment knows that, which is why they use
them to get out of asking.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Sure, absolutely.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What's been your experience, Greg?  You are spearheading
this state by state.  What are you finding?  As parents go to
their legislators and say we want some action, how is that being
received, and what have you been doing?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, in state after state, the reaction is as Rebecca has 
described. Generally they are getting pretty much of a stiff arm, the 
parents, that is.  Paul touched on another interesting issue, which is as 
the parental rights movement grows, it is not going to be just the
kinds of parents who are concerned about the kinds of values that
are being taught, in sex ed and everything, but there is another
whole group -- and obviously there is a lot of overlap -- of parents
that are concerned just about academic standards.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Maybe not about the condoms, but when Johnny
comes home and he can't read or write, they want to get involved
with the public schools.  They are running into the same problem.
But help is on the way, because Of The People right now has launched
a number of efforts in states to put our simple amendment, which
says the right of parent to direct the upbringing and education
of their children shall not be infringed, into state constitutions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  How many states are you in right now?
<p>
MR. ERKEN: We are active in 28 states, and we have a lot of interest in
the other ones.  We are going to ballot by a citizen initiative
in the state of Colorado.  It will be on the ballot there in November
1996, and I think we will also be very successful moving the amendment
by legislation in Michigan and perhaps Illinois and Alabama.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And certainly the research would indicate that when
one state embraces something like that, you get a real wildfire
starting.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  That's exactly what we are after.  We think
that the parental rights movement, because it is so potent, there
are so many parents like Rebecca out there who are fighting to
defend their families, this has the potential to become what we
call the term limits of the social values movement where we get
some victories at the state level, it spreads like wildfire, and
in turn that's going to help the efforts of Congressman Largent
at the federal level.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  And we've already seen state legislators begin to propose 
-- in Indiana the state house just passed a statutory parental rights bill 
that was -- it was not a state constitutional amendment, but Indiana, 
Alaska, Washington State, Kansas, I believe, there are a number of state 
statutory efforts that are going on.
<p>
I mean, it seems odd that we have to argue the point for something that 
is so common sense as to parents, you're good parents, you have the 
best interests of your children at heart, please, go about your business, 
we bless you and we support you, do your thing.  It's kind of funny.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In a country where an accused murderer is innocent until 
proven guilty and parents are held in suspicion, you know, almost guilty
until proven innocent.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER:  And it really does smack to the very foundations of what 
the United States is all about. Our constitution guarantees that we have 
certain civil liberties that are fundamental.  We have the liberty to 
speak. We have freedom of religion.  We have the liberty to believe. We 
have the liberty to exercise in the press, in the media.  The Supreme
Court has already said that -- 70 years ago was the last time
they iterated this -- that parents have the freedom to raise their
children free from governmental interference or intrusion.
<p>
So what we are really talking about and what underlies all the discussions
about today's social problems is the constitutionality of the
freedom for people to live as they choose, to live without overarching
governmental intrusion.
<p>
You know, the interesting thing back is if we look back 200 years at a 
different time in history, the people of this land revolted against a 
government that was too intrusive, that was too tyrannical, that stiff-armed 
their citizenry.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Taxation without representation.
<p>
MR. WEBSTER: Exactly. Now we're having parenting without representation on 
the local and the state level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Greg, are you all concerned about legal challenges, 
constitutional legal challenges, and how are you preparing for that?
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  Well, first of all, as Paul mentioned, we are codifying 
something that the Supreme Court said, as he mentioned, 70 years ago and 
which the court has never overturned.  What we are doing is bringing in 
out of some law clerk's file that nobody sees and you parents have to hope 
that judges will remember these cases and apply them correctly.  We
are exercising the right of the people, hence our name, to move
parental rights sort of out of the ether from some of those rights
that everybody instinctively knows they have and putting it in
black and white.
<p>
That's something that the people always have a right to do, and the 
U.S. Constitution and the state constitutions always speak of enumerated 
and unenumerated rights, and all we are doing is moving this one from 
the back burner, because it's being forgotten by too many bureaucrats 
and judges and saying, hey, we want it in black and white now.  The time 
is right to add it up there with free speech and freedom of religion.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Rebecca, is this conversation giving you more hope or
more fear?  You know, do you see any light at the end of the tunnel?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: Oh, definitely more hope.  I mean, this Congress
is finally -- for the first time, I feel like we have a chance
to really do what parents have been trying for for a long time.
I don't know about you, but I don't want the village raising
my child.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's right.
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: And it's the socialist mindset that says if you're against 
government providing the service, you're somehow against the service being 
provided at all.  I want to be free to do what I can do for my children
and provide for them what I can provide.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you know what's interesting about that it takes a village 
comment is that in context -- and we're talking about Hillary Clinton's
book, <i>It Takes a Village</i>, where she argues that we need more 
government to raise successful kids -- the African proverb comes from the
context that when the families break down or the men leave the
family or they've gone off to war and been killed, it takes a
village to make up for broken families, not it takes a village.
Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN:  And it would be one thing -- again, you
could take that slogan, and in proper context it would be okay.
For example, if the village were not undermining what the parents
are teaching their children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. ERKEN: The problem is when your child leaves home, they might 
encounter something in the movies or in the pop culture, which has 
gotten a lot of attention, which undermines parental authority.  What
we need to do is shine the light on too often it's our own government,
through our tax dollars, in the schools, that are doing some more
of that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right. The village is on the attack. We've got a couple 
seconds left.  What's one last thing you'd like people to understand 
about this issue, very quickly?
<p>
MS. BOCCHINO: They need to get involved.  You know, the price for
freedom is eternal vigilance, and parents are going to have to
quit the country clubs and the golf games and get into the PTAs,
get on the school boards.  They are going to have to take a more
active role in their children's lives and in their education than
they're doing now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much for being with us. When we return, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a bit of Gary Bauer's appearance on 
CNN's Morning News, discussing another hot issue, welfare reform. 
Don't go away.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Gary Bauer makes many appearances throughout the year on a 
variety of news broadcasts.  Gary is often seen giving his insight, 
particularly on CNN.  So let's take a look at what Gary had to say on 
CNN's Morning News regarding an issue most definitely discussed in the
upcoming election debates, welfare reform. <i>Straight Talk</i> now
brings you some Homefront News.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News"></center>
<p>
[Segment from CNN Morning News follows:]
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Is there a quandary here for conservatives as to how much you 
soften on this provision?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Apparently some of my friends think there's a quandary.
I don't think there is.  I believe that anything that encourages
promiscuity and discourages marriage results in more abortion
and more illegitimacy.  That's what we've got now.  We've got
1.5 million abortions a year and one-third of our children being
born out of wedlock.  That's a disaster for this country.  Part
of the problem is welfare, and we need to reform it.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Well, but you see that there's a movement, it would seem, 
within the House and among the Republicans to soften the provisions.
How much would be acceptable to you?  Can you go with vouchers?
Can you go with some form of if not cash payment, provisions
to these unwed mothers?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  I tend to be sympathetic towards vouchers in all sorts of 
areas, education, welfare, and so forth, but I hope the Republicans 
don't lose their heart on this, because I think the Catholic bishops 
are sounding the wrong note in their opposition.  To follow their argument 
through, we ought to increase welfare benefits.  Let's increase them 
ten-fold, because that will get abortions down.  Nobody believes that. 
In fact, the welfare system is encouraging abortion and encouraging 
illegitimacy by discouraging marriage.  That's what we need to get at.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Do you think the Catholic bishops are just seizing on the 
abortion issue to stake out more of a claim for the liberal position on
welfare?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I don't want to get too esoteric here,
but I think that in the bureaucracy among the Catholic bishops
there's a lot of support for the traditional welfare system that
has been put in place over the last 30 years, a system that takes
money out of the pockets of the American taxpayer and uses it
to subsidize bad decisions, and I hope that the Republicans put
a stop to that.
<p>
INTERVIEWER: Is there any legitimacy, if you will, to the argument that 
this will lead to more abortions, any data to prove that?
<p>
MR. BAUER: I have a 20-year record of being a pro-life supporter. I 
don't think anybody doubts that if I thought there would be even one 
more abortion, I wouldn't support this.  I believe that the welfare reform 
will result in less abortion. In fact, the states with the highest welfare 
payments are the states with the highest abortion rates.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with us 
to hear how you can get more information regarding the issues affecting you 
and your family.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. If you'd like to receive more information 
about our organization, tonight's guests, or the topics discussed, call us at 
1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week, we will be discussing how the media influences society
today.  From television to movies to music to the Internet, we
are surrounded by the media and its control over what we see,
hear, and sometimes the opinions and decisions we make.  Does
the media take such a responsibility seriously?  We'll find out
next time on <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.
Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
takes a look at something that hits close to home, especially for us here, 
the media's influence on today's culture.
<p>
Although the entertainment world's original mission was to bring wholesome 
programming and unbiased news coverage to the public, we have strayed far 
from that intention, it seems. An example can be seen in a recent 
controversy.  Just last week on ABC's <i>Nightline</i>, a report was given 
that insinuated American Catholics in the 1940s and 1950s, as a general 
rule, were prejudiced against Jewish Americans.  And although prejudice 
exists and is a terrible thing, should broadcasters slant a newscast with 
a negative portrayal of Catholics as a whole?  Is it fair to draw
conclusions of the views of all people in a certain group?  We'll
take a look at issues such as this and others in tonight's show.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from Bill Mattox, FRC's Vice President
for Policy.  Bill's extensive research of marriage and divorce
provides some key insights into why those who pledge to spend
their lives together in marriage often find themselves with broken
hearts and broken homes.  Bill's expertise on this subject has
been published nationwide, and <i>Straight Talk</i> would like to share
some of his findings with you as we go behind the headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bill, thank you so much for being with us today on Behind the 
Headlines. As you know, tomorrow is Leap Year Day, and there is an 
interesting old Sadie Hawkins tradition from European history in 
Scotland beginning in 1280, and into England and beyond, that says 
that on that day, women were allowed to ask men to marry them, and
if the man said no, he might have to pay a sum of money or buy
her a silk dress.  What do you think about that old custom?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, I suspect there are a lot of young women today
who would like to see that tradition carried on and would seize
the opportunity that this day might provide to approach their
boyfriend and see if he might have serious intentions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Marriage is a fascinating topic.  Every women's magazine 
talks about it in great detail.  For Generation X-ers, it is 
particularly sensitive.  They have experienced a lot of divorce and 
marriage issues.  How is the pendulum swinging for them?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Well, you're right.  They very much look at this issue very 
differently, I think, than many previous generations, and I think a lot 
of that is because their experiences as children have been quite
different.  Many of them, as you know, have grown up in homes
that either never had a father to begin with because they were
born out of wedlock or, more often, where the marriage broke apart;
and many of them have seen, then, first hand the problems associated
with divorce, both what it does to adults as well as the pain
that it often causes children.
<p>
I think, for that reason, many young people today are quite wary of marriage. 
On the one hand, they don't want to go and repeat their parents' mistakes 
and very much want to avoid divorce.  In fact, in a lot of the polling
that we have done, we have seen that the concern about divorce
and opposition to easy divorce is greater among this age group
than it is among older groups.
<p>
But at the same time, because in many cases they have never seen a marriage 
succeed, they have never seen conflict resolved successfully, many of them 
are not prepared perhaps for successful marriage and, perhaps sensing
that, are quite often much more willing to go the route of, say,
cohabitation than previous generations.  We have seen here in
recent years that the rise in couples living together outside
of marriage has been quite profound, especially among younger
Americans, and I think it is a reflection, ironically, of their
concern about divorce and, in a perverse way, a reflection of
the -- at least in the case of some -- a reflection of their high
ideals about marriage and the fact that they very much want a
marriage to succeed.  Unfortunately, as you know, cohabitation
is not likely to increase the likelihood of a strong marriage;
in fact, it is more likely to hinder a successful marriage.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Divorce is a very troubling subject to just about 
everybody, and in fact divorce reform today is a very big issue. People
are taking a look at how we might change the system.  How is divorce
reform being developed to bring more justice, in particular often
to women and children who are abandoned by men in search of trophy
wives?
<p>
MR. MATTOX:  Well, there are a lot of things being talked
about at the state level, and I frankly am quite encouraged by
the kind of growing dialogue and conversation and attention that
is being given to this subject.  In fact, speaking of leap year,
I just learned about a radio station down in Texas that, kind
of concerned about this issue, approached nine different judges
in the kind of three-county area where the radio station is heard
and asked them, on the 29th of February, a special day of the
year, that they not sign any divorce decrees on that day.  And,
lo and behold, all nine judges agreed to go along with that request.
They are calling it, I think, something like Home Improvement
'96 or something.
<p>
But we are seeing a growing level of interest and activism at the state 
and local level on this subject, and the policy proposals take a lot of 
different forms. The most common approach -- and, I think, perhaps the 
most appealing approach to this issue -- is one that is being advanced in 
the state of Michigan, where they are saying, look, on grounds of sheer 
justice, we want to protect spouses who do not want to see their marriages
dissolve, if they have done nothing that would, in a sense, fall
into the category of fault, so that if one spouse just wants to
get up one day and walk out, he or she is not able to do that;
that we are going to protect the interests of the spouse that
would not want for the marriage to dissolve.  Obviously, in cases
where both parties want to see the marriage dissolved, that would
still be possible.
<p>
But I think this has perhaps the greatest potential for movement in many 
of the states, because it really emphasizes this idea of justice and the fact 
that when someone abandons commitments that they have pledged to carry out, 
that has an effect, obviously, on the other spouse and also on children,
if children are involved.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  If you and I, Bill, were in a contract together and we were 
both going to bring something to the table and make a product, neither one 
of us could walk away without at least its costing some money to us, let 
alone perhaps being required by law to provide part of our contract.
<p>
In a fault-based system, my understanding is that there would
be some consequences for the person who walks away.  How will
a fault system be perhaps of assistance to women and children?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Yes. No-fault divorce is, I think, a misnomer.
There is no such thing as no-fault divorce.  I think, instead,
what we really have is, in a sense, no-consequence divorce, where
there are no apparent, at least no legal consequences, to someone
breaking a contract.  And yet we know that in other situations,
if that same man goes into the work place that same day after
he has abandoned his wife and children and decides to, say, fire
an employee or to break a contract with a vendor that does business
for his company, he is going to face certain legal rules that
he must abide by or face certain consequences.
<p>
What we have done with so-called no-fault divorce is really create 
no-consequence divorce.  And I think what we want to say is, look, if 
you make pledges, if you make commitments, if you make promises, we are
going to expect you to carry those out in the same way that we
do in other realms of life, and we are going to do this not just
for your good but to protect the interests of others who make
agreements with you based on their belief that you intend to follow
through.
<p>
Now, if for some reason the other party fails to live
up to their commitment, we will not hold you to remaining in the
marriage if you do not want to.  So if there is fault on the part
of the other party, yes, you can in those cases get a divorce.
But if, instead, you want to simply abandon your responsibilities,
you will not be permitted to do so and leave all the consequences,
if you will, to the other spouse.  We will protect their interests.
<p>
To take a look at the typical divorce, generally, the husband
is leaving a wife and child, often perhaps for a trophy wife,
and what we see, though, is that the thing that he most wants
is the ending of the marriage, and he gets that.  Then in divorce
what we see is a lot of negotiation for property and children,
and often the husband comes to the wife and says, &quot;Look,
you give me the property I want or I'm going to fight you for
the kids, and it is going to cost you a lot of money.&quot;  And
child custody battles become very bloody.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that going to a fault-based system will 
end these bloody wars over property but primarily for child custody?
<p>
MR. MATTOX: It may. I think it would be appropriate, whatever we do about 
fault-based divorce and whether we return to it in some way, shape, or form, 
I think it would be appropriate for us to try to disentangle these two
questions, because you are right.  It is quite common for one
spouse to kind of press on the property side while the other spouse
seeks to protect their interest in terms of child custody, and
that one quite often gets the kids and very little else.
<p>
I think it would be appropriate for us to separate these two issues and
to, first and foremost, in cases where the marriage is irretrievable,
say we want to protect the interests of the child and to make
a decision about how that child should be cared for and in whose
custody that child should be placed before we then proceed to
other questions about the division of property.
<p>
If that sort of situation were in play, then I think what we would see is 
that the decisions about who gets custody of the children would be
carried out in a way that is much better for all parties concerned,
and it would be done in a way that, of course, then would not
have implications for whether or not the parties are treated fairly
when it comes to property division.
<p>
But my hope is that we can avoid these kinds of questions as much as possible, 
and one of the things again that I find encouraging about a lot of the 
discussion that is beginning to take place is there is a growing recognition
that we have a very serious divorce problem in this country, and
my hope is that we can do as much as possible to prevent divorce
so that we don't have to then deal with a lot of these thorny
issues that arise in the course of divorce or, for that matter,
many years after a divorce.
<p>
You know, the bottom line here is commitment.  If there is a commitment to 
making things work, that goes an awfully long way toward making some of 
these difficult things all of a sudden seem less daunting and more 
overcomable.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  And, of course, Family Research Council has a lot
of information and resources available.  We would welcome anyone
to call.
<p>
Thank you, Bill, so much for being with us.
<p>
MR. MATTOX: Thank you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
looks at a few ways that the media shapes our culture today
and whether or not industry leaders are taking that responsibility
seriously.  Stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: In today's world, it is virtually impossible to escape the 
media -- from newspapers to radio to television to cable networks, to 
satellites, to movies, to computers, and the list goes on.  We are 
surrounded by it and experience its influence daily.
<p>
As the media has blanketed our nation and culture, it has expanded not 
just in scope but in the way in which information is exchanged.  The 
growth in types of communication forms has been especially fast paced in 
the last 40 years; and, bombarded by so many messages and message forms,
the definition of normal has evolved.
<p>
[<i>Roseanne</i> segment follows:]
<p>
TEENAGE GIRL: That it's time for me to get some birth control.
<p>
[End of segment.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A few cases point:  the media's depiction of the typical 
family, whom it glorifies as heroes, and what is considered acceptable 
behavior.
<p>
So as we flip through the channels, we are forced to ask ourselves 
whether media positively or negatively affects our culture today. 
<p>
To help us distinguish between some of the negative and positive effects 
of media, I am joined by Robert Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for 
the Family Research Council. As a former <i>L.A. Times</i> writer and 
editor, Bob has first-hand knowledge of how the news media works.
<p>
Also joining me, Tom Fitton, Director of Development for Accuracy in
Media, a media watchdog organization; and Sandy Crawford, director
of the Entertainment Division for the Media Research Center.
<p>
Welcome to this show, its distinguished guests which people need to 
know. I am surrounded.  Frankly, we started the show talking a little
bit about ABC's <i>Nightline</i> in the head.  ABC's <i>Nightline</i> 
show actually came out and said, well, we know -- and how do we know 
this? -- that Catholics almost all in general, in the 1940s and 1950s,
didn't like Jews.  Therefore, Pat Buchanan, being Catholic, must
not like Jews, either.  And now you tell me that, Tom, they have
decided to apologize.  Does this surprise you?
<p>
MR. FITTON: That's right.  They implied that Patrick Buchanan's father 
listened to Father Coglin(?), who was an anti-Semitic radio priest, talk 
show host, back in the 1930s and 1940s.  Ted Koppel came out and said,
&quot;Well, even though it was in the <i>Washington Post</i> and 
reported elsewhere, we should have checked it out ourselves,&quot; and
it turns out he didn't listen to Father Coglin, and there is this
unspoken assumption, or spoken assumption, that conservative Catholics
from the 1950s and 1940s were necessarily anti-Semitic.
<p>
Ted Koppel had to apologize on air to the Buchanan family, and that is 
a big deal in network news, to have a personal apology like that,
which shows just how far they went overboard in slurring the family.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Perhaps how much they were concerned about lawsuit,
as well.
<p>
Sandy, what have you seen in your work -- I know you
look at the entertainment medium, in particular -- about other
kinds of stereotypes that are being forced on people about all
these people are like this or like that?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: We are seeing a lot of negatives, especially where Catholicism 
is involved. That attitude is something that comes into play with 
entertainment media.  Many times you will see priests who are pedophiles, 
you will see nuns who are habitual child abusers, always whacking
children around with rulers and that kind of thing.  So you will
see that kind of stereotype, especially addressing people who
are religious or addressing people who are politically conservative.
Many times the folks who are politically conservative tend to
be portrayed as being somewhat backward and old-fashioned and
fuddy-duds; we don't want to be like that, that kind of mentality.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. I actually was on a CNN program just last
week where they made the passing slur that, well, you know that
a lot of Buchanan women supporters have never been to college.
I had to say, &quot;Well, I don't assume that that makes them
idiots, and I don't assume that that is true, either.&quot;  You
know, I am offended on both counts.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, something we have noticed, too, is that Jay Leno has 
been particularly very, very harsh about Buchanan, and every night with 
the monologues -- I mean, we can look at these monologues and understand 
that a joke's a joke, and we can all laugh at that.  But some of these
so-called jokes have started to become very, very harsh, just
very unfair assassination attempts on Buchanan, referring to him
as being a member of the Klan and just really terrible stuff.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: As if that is funny.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. FITTON: You know, the instinctive thing to call a conservative a 
Nazi, even in a joking manner, and to do it constantly night after 
night certainly doesn't help the conservative cause any, and it 
shows maybe that their instincts are wrong on this issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, you were actually in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> 
newsroom and have had a distinguished career in journalism before 
you came to this side of the fence, and I know you've got a book 
coming out soon which we want to hear about.  But what happens inside
some of the entertainment world and news world?  Are people making
these assumptions?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, the assumption is always there that if you are in 
journalism, you are a liberal, number one, and they have many ways of 
testing that.  It used to be the Ronald Reagan test, I called it, 
where a small group of people would gather in the newsroom, and then 
someone would bring up Reagan's name -- it used to Nixon's, then Reagan 
--  and there would be a general smirk, and so forth, and everybody 
would make sure everybody was smirking.  And if somebody didn't -- they 
just took it straight -- they would start boring in on that person,
and they would start extracting opinions from that person, and
that person would become a lightning rod quickly if that person
didn't tow to every liberal orthodoxy.  It was uncanny.
<p>
I can say many great things about the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and I 
think it is a fine paper, but I will say it is the most intellectually
stultifying place I have ever worked.  Even the liberals were
looking over their shoulders to make sure that the particular
brand of political correctness was absolutely correct.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is easy to see political correctness on an Oscar night 
or an Emmy night.  Everybody has to wear the red ribbon and say the
same kinds of things about the Earth and fur and vegetarianism
or whatever.  But some shows -- you all, in particular, look at
a lot of entertainment things; Tom, you had some to bring up --
some shows do go a little bit further in kind of pushing a world
view.  What have you seen in your observations?
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, we tend to focus a bit more on news, and the problem 
is the news is pretty good at usually pointing out problems. <i>Prime 
Time Live</i> on ABC a few weeks ago had a good segment talking about 
the ethics problems that children have, that many are stealing and 
cursing and doing all sorts of nasty things in ways they used not to do,
and they pointed out some advice that you could give parents to
have your child behave in a more appropriate manner in school
or at home.  And I don't know if it had to do with religion. 
Religion was mentioned once.  Children were asked, is there anything
you would give your life up for? and they went out of their way
to say, well, there was really nothing they would give their life
up for, although there was a sidebar comment, &quot;A few children
said their family and religion.&quot;  That was the only time
it was mentioned.  It was not used as a sort of model to make
children grow up right, and the parents were told basically to
have dinner with their children more often, nothing about church.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So that's the answer to our problems, is mealtimes.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Go ahead.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: I think that is symptomatic, and Ben Stein pointed this 
out in his book, <i>The View from Sunset Boulevard</i>, back in 1980; 
that religion on television was not so much trash as it was omitted. 
You would see a priest or maybe a rabbi perform a wedding or a funeral 
and maybe listen to a confidentiality.  But that was it.  They were
never main characters.  They were always considered peripheral.
<p>
He said there's a reason for this.  Most of the people in Hollywood
are irreligious.  They are not merely lapsed Catholics or Jews;
either they are hostile toward religion or feel it has no value
in the modern world.  Stein cited various surveys that have been
backed up since then by Robert and Linda Lichter and Stanley Rothman
showing people in Hollywood are greatly irreligious.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I have been intrigued by the popularity of <i>ER</i> 
and <i>Chicago Hope</i> and a lot of doctor shows right now, and everyone's 
on their deathbed and nobody prays, which I find an intriguing phenomenon;
you know, week after week, everyone's dying and nobody thinks,
I wonder what happens next or even talks about it.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: That is an interesting observation.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Or it is a last resort, but never in the middle of something.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I have actually never seen it.  I must admit I am a big fan 
of both those shows.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
And I have never seen anyone pray, even at the moment of death.  They are 
hanging on for their last moment, and they want to have one last Big Mac or 
something, you know? It is an interesting last wish.
<p>
What are you finding, Sandy, in entertainment?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, for the past two years we have released every year a 
study of how religion is portrayed on television, and our findings were 
very much in keeping with Mr. Stein's findings, that religion really was 
a non-event on television, that you tended to find more families who were 
watching the Superbowl together than ever going to church, ever saying
a prayer or saying grace, that kind of thing.  So our research
results do back up those claims.
<p>
As far as this general overall politicking, we have found overall that a 
lot of the politics of prime time have toned down somewhat.  The focus has 
turned to values -- sexual, moral values, moral issues -- and I think
that is where the big debate is going to be, because we are talking
about things like homosexuality and teen sexuality, that kind
of thing, and you are seeing just so much more really sexy television
shows that are out there, and even at hours early in the evening
now.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more about this.
Please join us after the commercial break as we continue to discuss
the media's cultural influence with those who are watching.  Stay
with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined again by some experts who have investigated the 
media's influence on our culture and especially our children today:  Robert 
Knight, Director of Cultural Studies for the Family Research Council; Tom 
Fitton, Director of Development with Accuracy in Media; and Sandy 
Crawford, the Media Research Center's Director of Entertainment Division.
Thank you again for being with us.
<p>
Sandy, I wanted to go to you first because we all know that newsrooms are 
supposed to be apolitical, and I want to hear about how apolitical they 
really are.  But I was intrigued recently on again a <i>Chicago Hope</i> 
episode where they portrayed a partial-birth abortion scenario.  They
got it wrong.  According to the partial-birth abortion ban, if
your life was in danger, absolutely, it is a necessary procedure.
<p>
It is always -- you know, abortion is, after all, an ending of
something.  In this episode, the baby was dead, the woman was
going into cardiac arrest, and they removed the child and called
it a partial-birth abortion to save her life and then had a show
about this where both of these facts were wrong; and, coincidentally,
it was on the timing of the vote.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you see that kind of coincidence in entertainment?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Nothing is coincidental.  Putting something on prime-time 
television means never really having to check the facts. It's all gut.
In the producers' gut, if they knew this was right, then that
is all that counts.  Don't let the facts get in the way.  And
that is something that we find in many instances in dealing with
things like we were talking about where religion is concerned.
There is a mind-set in Hollywood where the folks just -- they
don't have the facts on some of this information.  They don't
do their homework to the extent that they should whenever they
enter the political arena.  Now, there are some folks who do do
their homework.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: But in many instances it is whatever is in that liberal gut. 
That is what is going to fly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It must be true.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: It must be true.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  And they're not going to get challenged a whole lot.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: No.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: That's the problem. They're in a little glass jar, all talking 
to each other, all saying the same thing.  As Pauleen Kale, the New Yorker 
film critic, said once, &quot;I can't believe Nixon won by a landslide. 
Nobody I know voted for him.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: They are so out of it sometimes; they don't get that 
corrective, just the questioning sometimes from another point of view.
<p>
MR. FITTON: And the question seems to be, what is the impact?  And
for a long time during the 1980s, there was this unspoken pact.
Bill Bennett and Nancy Reagan got the media companies not to
glorify drug use in their movies or in their programs.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, that has fallen by the wayside.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is sliding, yes.
<p>
MR. FITTON:  MTV is full of music videos glorifying the use of drugs. They 
have run documentary programs on MTV. CNN has run a documentary program 
with a pro-legalization bent, and this sort of stuff is coming out in the 
form of higher drug use among teenagers.  It does have a real-world impact, 
and to pretend that adults can somehow separate what is good and what
is bad -- well, we can't allow our children to be forced to make
decisions like that because often they need a little help, and
one of the ways that we can help them is by keeping some of this
bad stuff off, by encouraging the corporations to be more responsible
about it.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Even cigarettes are back as a prop, because
Hollywood had been sensitive about that.  Young people were being
led into smoking, so it wasn't so cool anymore.  But if you see
movies like <i>Get Shorty</i> with John Travolta, the cigarette is the
main prop.  He uses it much the way Humphrey Bogart used to. 
But back when Humphrey Bogart was smoking, we didn't have these
soaring cancer statistics.  So I think they are being absolutely
irresponsible in glorifying cigarette use.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are going to look in the next segment in particular at 
the issues of children with an expert with Missing and Exploited Children.
But in terms of the news media looking at children and the entertainment
media looking at children, one thing that we have noticed is some
assumptions:  that they are sexual, that they can make their own
choices, that they don't need adults.  Do you see these kinds
of assumptions being made by the news media?  You know, get those
parents out of the way of those enlightened children.
<p>
MR. FITTON: That is right. I mean, MTV, which reaches a lot of children,
whether parents like it or not, ran a series of programs called
<i>Sex in the Nineties</i>. What they would do was produce folks who
were engaging in sexual behavior that most parents wouldn't want
their children to engage in.  There was no moral -- it wasn't
called immoral. It wasn't called, Hey, maybe you ought not to
be doing that. They presented homosexual relationships the same
way they presented heterosexual relationships.  It was seamless.
They would talk to a homosexual about his or her relationship
and then they would jump and talk to a heterosexual, as if there
was no difference.
<p>
These sorts of things are being fit to our children through outlets 
that children watch.  They really have a hostility towards parental 
values in this area.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, and they always say it's always up to the parent to 
be there, to change the channel.  Any parent knows you can't be in front
of a television set all the times your children might.  A case
in point was the other day when I took my daughter somewhere but
we left our 12-year-old just for a few minutes, and we had to
tell him, &quot;Look, you can only watch this.&quot;
<p>
Well, everybody knows the human heart is just -- if you say no to 
something, the human heart wants to say yes.  If you line up 30 park 
benches and on the last one it says, &quot;Don't touch, wet paint,&quot;
that's the one they're going to touch.
<p>
So we're in a bind.  If we make a big deal out of telling our son don't 
turn on the MTV, that is undue pressure on him.  And yet if we say nothing, 
he may stumble upon it.
<p>
So don't tell me it is always up to the parent to do it. We've got to 
clean up the air waves.  They ought to be family-friendly, and every 
parent shouldn't feel you have to throw up a fortress around your house 
and children.
<p>
MR. FITTON: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Sandy, you have a tool for that, and
I know Bob has used it.  Michael and I don't have children yet,
so we haven't had the need for it.  But tell us a little but about
the <i>Family Guide to Prime Time Television</i>.
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: We put out the <i>Family Guide</i> every year. It covers 
every single prime time television show on the four major networks and 
also Warner Brothers and UPN on the Warner Brothers and UPN networks. 
<p>
So what we try to do is give parents as much information about every
television show as possible.  We talk about things like what kinds
of values are on the show, if there is a lot of sex, if there
is a lot of rude language, just so each parent can make the call
themselves and apply what works for their family and make the
decision and get as much information as possible so that they
are making educated decisions.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What kinds of values do you see being given to our children 
or assumptions made about our children on entertainment television?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, the major assumption that is being made about children 
is that they are ratings points; they are just rating points.  Moving
a show like <i>Friends</i>, NBC's <i>Friends</i> -- that is a 9:30 
television show if I have ever seen one, with some of the subject matter
that is on, and very risque, lots of sex, lots of very vulgar
language on that show -- moving it to 8 o'clock, the ratings went
up, and of course they went up, because there are more warm bodies
sitting in front of the television, regardless of what age those
warm bodies are.
<p>
So in many instances you have networks that are
looking at children as potential audience members, as extra points
that they can sell to potential advertisers.  So that is kind
of a sad commentary on how the networks feel.
<p>
The networks do see children as being sexual beings, that they should -- 
that their wants and needs and desires are on the moral equivalency
level of those of adults; that they should have the opportunity
to experiment sexually, that kind of thing.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Right, and therefore, they are not as sensitive to parents' 
wishes. They say, we can go to the kids directly, because if they're 
competent, after all, they can listen to the stuff as well as anybody 
else.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Tom, what have you seen?  We are coming to the end
of our time.  When you go to -- and I would like each of you to
really fast respond to this -- if you look at an entertainment
industry or news company, and you say to them, &quot;Look, you're
being an irresponsible citizen of our national community,&quot;
what kind of response do you get?
<p>
MR. FITTON: Well, you get a very hostile, defensive response, and just 
one person saying something isn't enough.  You need to write to the 
advertisers. We have confronted these folks at the stockholders' meetings. 
We have embarrassed them in public, and that is the only way these 
corporate types respond positively to these concerns.  You can't be nice
with them.  You need to say, &quot;You're going to lose money
if you engage in this sort of irresponsible programming.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What do you think, Sandy, when you tell them, &quot;You're
being an irresponsible entertainment producer&quot;?
<p>
MS. CRAWFORD: Well, you've got to keep that two-way dialogue going. It 
is not enough just to walk away from the television, because when
you do that, you're saying that there's no hope for Hollywood
and that they're never going to change.
<p>
I really do believe there are a lot of good people in Hollywood who really 
do want to change. They need our encouragement and they need our support.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We are going to get to hear more from Bob Knight after the 
break.
<p>
I would like to thank both of my guests and hope that people
will call us for more information about their excellent organizations.
<p>
When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear more about how the 
media has changed the portrayal of children and their behavior over
the years.  Is it hurting or helping them?  We'll find out after
this break.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We're  back with more <i>Straight Talk</i> from the 
Family Research Council.
<p>
I would like to welcome Pete Banks to the show. Pete, a former police 
investigator and supervisor in the Child Abuse Unit is now the Director 
of Outreach at the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children.
And joining us again is FRC's Bob Knight, who has researched the
sexualizing of our children.  Thanks so much for being here.
<p>
Pete, my introduction to your organization came years ago when I was
a reporter, and it was very impressive.  You all had a cataloguing
of materials that showed how children were being seen as sexual
objects and were working on trying to rein in that kind of problem.
<p>
What have you seen in terms of the sexualizing of children, and
what is your group trying to do about that?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, we are responsible mainly for the national child 
pornography tip line, and as such we assist the U.S. Department of 
Customs and the postal authorities in their investigation of child 
pornography.
<p>
You know, there is not a fine line.  The fact of the matter is, child 
pornography is against the law.  We are not talking about protected 
speech; we are not talking about free speech; we are not talking about 
First Amendment.  We are talking about victimizing children, not only 
when the pictures are taken but also when they are displayed, and if 
you understand that each time that child's picture is shown, they are 
being victimized again and again, and quite often that type of material 
is used to exploit other children, used as grooming tools for other 
children to say, &quot;Oh, you see, they are kind of happy, they are 
smiling; why don't you do the same thing?&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Have you seen in our entertainment media, which started 
off with adults, and a lot of people are going to be the caretakers 
of children, to children really being sexual agents on their own, what 
impact have you seen from that sort of change in the media?
<p>
MR. BANKS:  Well, you know, one of the things that we always don't like 
to see is the childhood or the innocence taken from a small child, and 
that in itself is wrong, and that is wrong when they are victimized by 
a child molester or victimized by any of the institutions in society, 
whether it be the media or otherwise.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is a concern of your all's?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Oh, certainly it is, yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And what have you been telling the police and the parents 
that you work with about that shift?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, understand that children that are victimized, not only 
does it harm them, but they also have the potential for when they grow up 
to be victimizers themselves.  I think this is something that we have found 
to be true throughout the abuse of children and throughout the sexual
exploitation of children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, I know this has been a real concern of yours and that 
some of your interest in the media came because not only was the media 
sending certain messages, but it was sort of changing the culture in 
particular for children. What have been your observations about this 
shift?
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Well, the media are emitting a constant drum beat, and it 
is geared toward children, and it is that you are the main actor
here; you make up your own mind.  Only a wimp child would go to
his or her parents.  You see it all the time, and sometimes the
media promote things merely by examining them.
<p>
Case in point: a cover story in <i>USA Weekend</i> just a couple of weeks 
ago. It showed a picture of hundreds of kids, and it said, &quot;Why 
More Kids are Turning on to Pot,&quot; or something like that.
<p>
I remember during the 1960s when I was growing up that my interest in 
drugs was piqued by Time magazine and other magazines constantly 
saying, &quot;Look, everybody's doing it.  Everybody's doing it.&quot;
I felt weird because I wasn't doing it.
<p>
I got a chill when my son picked up the Sunday paper, and the first thing 
he saw was this thing, and he's going, &quot;Wow!  What's all this 
about?&quot; It is to the point where I don't want a mainstream magazine 
to come into my house anymore, because they are aiming it right at
my kid.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, there was an interesting study
not so long ago that Judith Reisman did, Dr. Judith Reisman, taking
a look at even in <i>Playboy</i> magazine over the last, I think -- 
what was it, Bob, 30 years? or since the beginning of the magazine --
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: -- that, more and more, the cartoons portrayed child sex 
rather than even adult sex in this adult magazine.  Has that been a trend 
that you have observed?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, just recently I remember seeing an advertisement
for some professional skaters, and one of the skaters was wearing
an outfit to dress up like a little child acting risque and everything.
You know, kids are naturally inquisitive and naturally risk-taking,
and we certainly don't want to be giving them more and more ideas.
<p>
You know, this is one of the things that happens on the on-line
services on the Internet, where they are able to go in and to
be whoever it is they want to be, and they wind up getting over
their heads.  They wind up getting in trouble because they are
making decisions because they haven't had the opportunity to go
through life to make the good decisions.
<p>
This is one of the concerns that we have about Cyberville.  We don't 
call it cyberspace anymore; we call it Cyberville, with citizens and with 
places. And the only difference between Cyberville and everything else is 
Cyberville has no zoning regulations, and Cyberville has no FCC.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. BANKS: So you can turn a corner and be anywhere.
At least there are some regulations, often effective, sometimes
not, that show what children see on commercial television, and
parents can make choices as to what they see on television.  But
in Cyberville, you have to be very careful about where your child
is roaming.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that the research indicates is that 
when it comes to sex acts in particular but in terms of children, 
child sex acts specifically, that we start with bringing down the 
barriers with visualization, like you said, showing alcohol, showing 
drugs, showing sex.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Grooming, it is called.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Grooming. And this is the kind of thing that, from MTV 
to, frankly, sitcoms, there is a lot of grooming going on out there, 
isn't there?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Yes, there is.  Yes, there is, unfortunately, that the 
taboos of yesterday are no longer in place, and I often wonder -- 
you know, when I retired from the police department, I kind of left
and I figured maybe we had two generations left in America before
we all killed each other, and I can remember so fondly that when
I was a kid, I mean, going to Mrs. Krischek's house with my little
bag on Halloween and getting a couple of potato pancakes and eating
them.  Can you imagine if your kid came home today with potato
pancakes?  You would throw everything out.
<p>
But by the same token, there were certain things that a child learned 
as they reached to adulthood when they are able to make the proper 
decisions, when they have had the exposure from the family.  But what 
we see now is kids without families.  What we see now is kids that
are growing up without any love, without any caring, without being
given any moral discipline by anyone.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: I mentioned earlier that the idea that the parent can be 
there and always monitor what the child is watching has fallen by the 
boards because of family dissolution.  Studies show many children watch 
hours of television and they are unsupervised.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Well, it is a national babysitter.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT: Yes, it really is, and it babysits because the mother or the 
father can get something else done in the meantime.  They can't be there 
every second. So they do the best they can.  They hope to leave the child 
in the hands of someone who is not going to exploit them.  But you
can't be so sure these days.  There is so much on there.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So where do we go from here?  There are tools like the 
Accuracy in Media and Media Research Center guides.  Frankly, Family 
Research Council has been interested in a P-chip, not a V-chip which 
would let the government or the entertainment media make some choices
for us, and if you buy technology, it blocks what we decide it
blocks; we have been in favor of a P-chip that a parent could
program in their own selection to block, depending on age appropriateness.
<p>
But what do you see out there?
<p>
MR. BANKS:  Well, you know, I wish we could program parents before they 
have children so that they can make good decisions, because it's a full-time 
job. We cannot put all of our eggs in the basket of technology.  We see 
that with the blocking mechanisms on some of the computers and everything
out there.  That is wrong.  Raising a kid is a full-time job,
and you need to make the right choices.  You need to ensure that
you elect officials that create the laws, that pass the laws,
that enforce the laws that protect your children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: You know, I was talking to a parent just before I came in 
here. Sorry, I want to get your opinion on this.  She said she bought
every blocking mechanism possible, put them on the entire computer,
and then got on there and saw what was happening in some of the
chat rooms and was horrified.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Right. It's a challenge to the kids, and again, those areas are 
the, quote, unquote, protected areas. They are the free-speech areas, and 
you have to be very, very careful.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it shows that you can't just depend
on shielding mechanisms.  Number one, your kid goes out there
and talks with all the other kids who haven't had a conscientious
parent shield them, so they pick it all up, anyway.
<p>
MR. BANKS: Right.
<p>
MR. KNIGHT:  The other thing is that why should the onus
be on the parents?  We've got to clean up the air waves.  This
is a little like that proposal by the President to bring back
school uniforms.  It may be a good idea for the wrong reason.
He said, &quot;Well, maybe now they won't get into fights over
expensive designer jackets.&quot;
<p>
So this is the typical liberal response. Instead of saying, &quot;Well, 
let's stop the crime,&quot; now make everybody wear uniforms.  So they say, 
&quot;Instead of stopping the trash that's coming out of the air waves, 
let's shackle all these parents to this new technological gizmo that's
supposed to help them.&quot;  It is avoiding the problem and treating
the symptom.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to have to have you back, Bob, to talk about 
your book looking at the impact of the media.
<p>
We have a few moments left.  What would you like parents to understand
about the world in which their children are growing up?
<p>
MR. BANKS: Well, what they need to understand is that the ground rules 
have changed.  It is no longer the way it was when they were children.
And the other thing is that they don't want to put their child
into a place where they're going to lose their childhood or their
innocence.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And is that the computer world today?
<p>
MR. BANKS: That is <b>the</b> world.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A lot to think about. I would like to thank my guests very 
much.
<p>

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>.
<p>
Gary Bauer had the opportunity to express his opinion on 
today's media during a recent CNN <i>Inside Politics</i> show. Whose 
responsibility is it to monitor what happens in our entertainment 
industry? Let's hear what Gary Bauer has to say on Homefront News.
<p>

<p>
[CNN segment from April 11, 1995, follows:]
<p>
MR. BAUER: The fact of the matter is that American culture is a lot different 
than it was 10, 20 years ago and that there is a constant diet of 
glorification of violence, of sex, of anti-women attitudes, of things that 
are debased and depressing that are served up particular to our children,
and I think a lot of Americans are offended by it.
<p>
Look, you have to be Rip Van Winkle and be asleep for the last 30 years 
to not realize there has been an incredible change in the nature of what
is shown on TV and in the movies as far as language is concerned
and vividness of the images, et cetera.
<p>
I think the point there is that, constitutionally, the folks in Hollywood, 
like Mr. Scher(?) and others, are able to do almost anything they want, 
and I don't think anybody would challenge that.  But there is also such a
thing as being good citizens.  And I think what Bob Dole's hopes
-- and I believe he spoke in his speech of the concept of shame
-- I think Bob Dole hopes that people in Hollywood would start
being good citizens and be partners with the rest of us in trying
to raise children and to send messages in our culture that are
positive and uplifting rather than constantly focusing on death
and destruction, violence, and hostility and violence against
women.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
confronts the drug problem in America and asks whether there is a problem 
at all.
<p>
The Clinton Administration significantly cut back the Office
on Drug Policy, saying it wasn't really a problem.  Many believe
we are actually winning the drug war.
<p>
Well, statistics on drug use show differently.  The number of drug 
abusers, especially among teens, has risen significantly in recent years. 
The National Institute on Drug Abuse found that annual marijuana use, for 
example, among eighth graders more than doubled, from 6.2 percent in 
1993 to 13 percent in 1994.
<p>
The steep rise in marijuana use also crosses over to hard drugs. Hospital 
emergency cocaine-related cases rose from 101,000 cases in 1991 to 120,000 
in 1992, and during the same period we had that problem with heroin. 
Heroin-related emergencies soared from 36,000 to 48,000 cases.
<p>
As this battle rages and more lives are lost, we must ask ourselves, 
what are we doing wrong?  Well, tonight we will talk to some people who
are working together to answer that question and battling for
solutions.
<p>
But, first, let's hear from the Family Research Council's
president, Gary Bauer.  Over the past years, we have heard a lot
from Amnesty International and other groups fighting for human
rights in Bosnia or China, for example.  But we rarely hear of
some other rights and lives that are being lost because of the
persecution of Christians throughout the world.
<p>
Gary recently has been studying this travesty, and in fact, FRC's Marty 
Dannenfelser recently spoke before a Senate committee to bring this 
persecution to light.
<p>
So let's hear what Gary has to say about a topic which has not seen much 
air time as <i>Straight Talk</i> takes you Behind the Headlines.
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Recently, Gary, you attended a conference by the Freedom 
House that dealt with the issues of persecutions of people of faith
worldwide.  What did you learn there?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, this is a really scandalous situation.  We all know that 
militant Islam is on the march in a good bit of the world, certainly 
throughout the Middle East and in many countries in Africa.  Along with 
that militancy has come an increasing amount of Christian persecution.
<p>
At this day-long conference in Washington, we got reports from
countries like Iraq, Ethiopia, Pakistan, others, Saudi Arabia,
where the persecution of Christians has gone so far that in Ethiopia,
for example, they are actually crucifying again those citizens
that they can identify as being practicing Christians.
<p>
We obviously feel deeply about this problem, not only about the fact 
that such persecution is taking place, but we also feel outrage at the 
fact that our own government, the Clinton Administration, particularly,
has been very insensitive on this.  The State Department regularly
releases reports on these countries that basically whitewash the
human rights abuses.  The State Department has caved in a number
of times to pressure from these countries on religious matters.
<p>
And so we want to really highlight in the months ahead what is
happening around the globe in these countries, many of whom receive
taxpayer dollars through foreign aid, and we certainly want to
up the pressure on the President to get serious about this issue.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The events in Saudi Arabia were particularly interesting.
Ironically, the U.S. Government caved on issues relating to pornography
and a bar rather than dealing with the issues of people of faith.
Can you tell us about that?
<p>
MR. BAUER: That is really an incredible story.  Apparently, at the U.S. 
Embassy in Saudi Arabia, there was a tradition there of holding church 
services at the embassy for American citizens that would want to come by. 
There was a Catholic mass held and some other services.
<p>
The Saudi government demanded that those church services end and also 
demanded that the U.S. Embassy close an embassy-sponsored nightclub that 
American soldiers would frequent.  As you point out, the American 
Government, faced with these two demands, caved on the church services 
but insisted that the night club stay open.  I think it just shows
that when it comes to these kinds of issues, many in the State
Department really have a tin ear on these kinds of matters, and
that is particularly offensive to many American Christians.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: One of the things that you talked about was that children
were being taken away from their families.  What did you learn
about that?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Kristi, it goes even beyond that.  There is widespread 
evidence of slavery again in many of these countries, only what is 
happening here is that Christian families are being broken up, and as 
part of this persecution, the children and the women are being taken away 
and literally sold into slavery in some African countries, again with almost 
no notice by the United Nations that usually is quick to point out human 
rights abuses, and certainly almost no attention being paid by the Clinton 
Administration on this issue.
<p>
We heard reports out of Iraq where Christians in Iraq that managed to 
escape that country into Turkey, they cannot get an interview with American 
State Department officials in Turkey. Instead, we insist that they be 
interviewed by the Turkish secret police.  The Turkish secret police are 
heavily influenced by radical Islam.  And so what happens is that these 
Christians that manage to get out of Iraq are sent back into that country to 
a fate that we can only guess.  At this point, the only thing we are 
exporting to Iraq are Christians, and that again is a tragedy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What would you recommend the U.S. Government to do about this?
<p>
MR. BAUER: Well, we need to be serious about human rights abuses
no matter who is involved, and certainly in these cases, which
is an area of growing abuse, we need to be very aggressive.
<p>
I think the State Department needs to start issuing regular reports
on this.  I think we need to make it clear that American foreign
aid will end unless religious persecution ends in these countries.
<p>
I would like to see the President appoint a special assistant
at the White House on this issue whose responsibility it would
be to brief him and the Congress on what it is we are picking
up through intelligence reports, and so forth.
<p>
And, last but not least, I certainly would like to see the Christian 
church arise from its sleepiness.  The church has really been behind 
the curve on this, and we quite frankly could take a page out of the book
of the Jewish community that has been very adept and very aggressive
any time a Jewish citizen anywhere in the world has been discriminated
against.  My hat goes off to the American Jewish community for
being aggressive on that kind of issue, and I think the American
Christian community needs to learn something from them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Ironically, the person who is leading the fight for 
Christians being persecuted is a Jewish gentleman.  Isn't that a little 
odd to you, as well?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  That is right.  Michael Horowitz, whom I worked with in the 
Reagan Administration, has taken the lead on this issue and, quite 
frankly, has been frustrated because so many church organizations in the 
United States seem to show very little interest or seem to be fearful of 
actually confronting these countries who are engaging in this unacceptable 
persecution.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you see a parallel in the increase of persecution
of Christians worldwide and incredible support here in the United
States for a religious liberty or religious equality amendment?
<p>
MR. BAUER:  Well, I think our founding fathers knew that persecution
is always just a day away, that liberties are very hard to maintain.
And I think that to the extent we turn a blind eye to persecution
in other countries, we set ourselves up eventually for not being
able to deal with persecution in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for being with us, Gary.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Thank you, Kristi.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight
Talk</i> begins our discussion over ways to combat America's drug
problem.  As we look at stats, it is easy to see that we have
failed to win this tough fight.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Recently the Family Research Council hosted
a day-long seminar that brought together experts who have researched
and been personally involved in treating our Nation's drug problem.
Following the seminar, I had the opportunity to speak to some
of those experts.  In the upcoming discussion, you will meet Lt.
Col. Robert Maginnis, a policy expert now with the Family Research
Council, who has taken a look at some of the criminal efforts
involved in the drug arena; Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist specializing
in clinical and policy areas of addiction medicine -- right now
she works with the District of Columbia's drug court -- and Bob
Peterson, a former drug czar from the state of Michigan and now
a leading consultant in the field.
<p>
Join me as we take a look at what these experts had to say.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Thank you very much for joining us all today.  Bob, one of 
the things that the Clinton Administration told us as they gave some major 
slashes to the drug budget was that we didn't have the problem anymore so 
much; that drug use was down.  Is that your finding?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Not at all, Kristi.  As all the national surveys are 
indicating now, drug use, especially among young children, and especially
in regard to marijuana, has skyrocketed in the last four years.
And, really, we need to lay the blame to a certain degree on
the parents.  The parents of the sixties, who were experimenting
with drugs in a big way, are now raising children, and they are
giving them sort of a mixed message.  There is a value conflict.
They want to say, &quot;Well, don't use them,&quot; but at the
same time, the kids are starting to use them, and it is really
devastating this country and we don't even know it.
<p>
If you start looking at what is going on in the media, they are 
glamorizing drugs.  You start looking at what this is costing this 
country in a major way, billions and billions of dollars, far more it
is costing us than in reality what it is costing us to try to
suppress it, to reduce demand, to reduce the supply of drugs in
this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sally, you are taking a look at people
who are in a court situation.  They have a drug problem.  Are
your numbers going down, or are you finding more and more people
coming to you for whom drugs are an element of the crime that
they are involved in?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Well, I think the data shows very well that heavy drug use is 
not going down at all, and the individuals I see are people who have been 
given a choice by a judge to either go to jail or go to a treatment program, 
and for many of them, even though they are well into their thirties, they
have never been in treatment before, though they have started
using drugs in their teens.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Are we seeing that it is possible for someone to have a 
minor marijuana use habit and that it ends right there?  You know, a lot 
of times people, when they talk about drugs, think that that there is an 
entry, a safe place where we can have recreational drug use.  Is that 
possible?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Well, marijuana is considered a gateway drug.  I think
that one of the reasons it is a gateway to heavier drug use, to
harder drug use, is because of the criminal element that individuals
become associated with as they are obtaining the drug.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, you have done a lot with the prosecution, and you 
were at the Department of Justice and have been on the prosecutorial 
side. In your experience, is drug use and the prosecution of drug use,
do they go hand in hand?
<p>
MR. PETERSON:  Well, the two are certainly correlated, and that is what 
is important for parents to realize, is that even if your child doesn't 
use drugs, if drugs are being used, your child is at risk.  For instance, 
date rape is highly correlated with alcohol and drug use; accidents, 
with marijuana. When they decriminalized in California, the number of 
accidents or charges for driving under the influence or reckless driving
went up.
<p>
A recent study showed that, out of those who are tested,
who test negative for alcohol, who are driving recklessly and
dangerously, the vast majority have illegal drugs in their systems.
So your children are at risk from crime and from accidents regardless
of whether they are using or not.
<p>
The other thing with marijuana is that the potency has gone up.  It used 
to be -- &quot;It's not your father's Oldsmobile,&quot; they say.  Well, 
it's not your father's marijuana.  It used to be 2 to 3 percent THC, 
which is the psychoactive compound in marijuana.  Now some of it is
2 to 3 percent, but they have gotten it up to 30 percent through
hybrid breeding.
<p>
The other problem is that methamphetamine is back, which is another very 
dangerous drug, because people who take it who are unstable are a lot more 
likely to act out when they are under the influence of these drugs.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Are you finding that, as you look nationwide, if there is an 
area of the country where drugs are not dealt with strictly and quickly
-- you know, what is the word, &quot;swift and sure&quot; -- that
that does have an increase in users?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Yes. I just actually did a book on this, and what I found 
was that from 1960 to 1980, the odds of going to prison or jail for drugs 
dropped dramatically.  It went down like 374 percent.  From 1980 to 
1990, it went back up again.  Well, from 1960 to 1980, violent crime
went up something like 250 percent; murder reached its peak level
in 1980, when drug incarceration was at its lowest level.
<p>
In fact, we have this myth that we are tough on drugs.  Under the
federal system, the average amount of marijuana is 3.5 tons that
a trafficker has.  And for possession of marijuana and cocaine
and crack under the federal system, you are less likely to go
to prison for that than you are for a tax law violation, and you
will serve the same amount of time as a migratory bird offender.
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The birds have it.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: That's right.  Drugs are for the birds.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Bob, one of the things that we see at the Family Research 
Council when we try to track pathology is that people lie.  It is hard 
to get valid sex data because people don't want to be honest about their 
sexual habits.
<p>
The same problem exists in a way with drugs.  What are you seeing in 
terms of users?  How reliable is the data, and how many people are actually 
using drugs?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: It depends upon which survey you look at, obviously, and 
there are maybe 70 or 80 million Americans who are saying, &quot;Yeah, I 
have used it in a certain period of time, maybe, over my life.&quot;
The numbers are going to be elevated depending upon the cohort
of people you are talking about.  The number of kids, probably
13 percent at a fairly young age, and the numbers are going up.
Once again, it depends upon the sector, it depends upon the racial
breakdown.
<p>
I did want to say something following up what Bob said,
and I don't think a lot of our viewers may understand that when
you start looking at people that are incarcerated, the people
that are trying to say drugs are not a big problem will not acknowledge
that a lot of these felons that are in jail right now for violent
crimes were using or had used recently, prior to that crime, an
illicit drug.  And that may have had a role in their particular
lifestyle choice that led them to the felony which landed them
in jail.
<p>
Unfortunately, if we don't arrest the scourge of drugs
on our land, we are just to continue to see this, especially as
the young cohort of teenagers today grows older, or the young
kids that are being raised in some pretty dysfunctional settings
grow older and become the killers of the next decade, and we are
faced with a critical crisis that is going to be really promoted
by drug abuse.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Sally, right now we have a very strange situation 
where the government indicates that cigarette use is very, very bad, but 
maybe marijuana should be legal.
<p>
But as you look at the people involved in drugs, are cigarettes a gateway 
to marijuana, a gateway to harder drugs? Is it broken families? What are 
some of the risk factors for the people who actually end up being drug 
users?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Well, I think the first thing you mentioned was some sort of 
analogy between nicotine and other drugs, and I think that is a dangerous 
analogy to make. Certainly from a public health standpoint, tobacco is 
very dangerous -- lung cancer, heart disease, et cetera -- but in terms of 
erosion of family life, of moral values, of capacity to function in society
and to adhere to your responsibilities as a parent, employee,
a citizen, that is where drugs are trouble, and I don't see too
many people smoking cigarettes who cannot abide by the law.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is a fascinating point, because in the cigarette
discussion, one of the points that has been made occasionally
is that cigarettes are really just as bad as drugs.  But that
is not your experience.
<p>
DR. SATEL:  When they say that, they refer often, I think, to the addictive 
potential of cigarettes.  And, yes, it is hard to quit cigarettes.  On the 
other hand, the consequences for using cigarettes aren't as immediate and 
as dangerous as for using hard drugs.  So I think the analogy is strained.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to take a look 
at the controversy surrounding crack cocaine and powder cocaine incarceration
rates. Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. As many of you may 
know, Rev. Jesse Jackson has made a lot of news lately talking about how 
the way in which we prosecute drugs is in fact racist; that crack cocaine 
offenders, generally black, are treated more harshly than those who use 
powder cocaine.
<p>
Bob, what is your perspective on that?  In our treatment of drug crime, 
do you see racist overtones?
<p>
MR. PETERSON:  I don't think it is racism.  What I have done in a study is 
I have looked at every crime -- violent crime, robbery, rape, murder -- 
and what I did is I measured the percentage of black and white victims
and then looked at the percentage of black and white imprisonments,
and what I found is that it always parallels the victim rate;
in other words, who is going to prison is based on who is being
victimized by these crimes.
<p>
Now, with the crack and the powder cocaine, they are identical chemically. 
They are identical substances. However, if you look at -- an analogy I would 
give is with an automatic machine gun and a hunting rifle and say, &quot;Gee,
they both shoot the same bullets, so they should carry the same
sentence.&quot;  One has a delivery mechanism that is a lot faster.
 The guy who is selling crack makes a lot more on an ounce of
cocaine than the one who is selling powder.  He is making more
profit and he is causing more immediate problems because of the
quickness that it goes to the brain, basically, and addiction
specialists say the quicker you get high, the quicker you drop
down, the quicker you get addicted.
<p.
The other thing is they use the federal crack laws as an example.  Under 
the federal crack laws, if you take the federal crack possession violators 
who are black and say what percent are they of the whole prison population,
it is six one-hundredths of 1 percent.  It is a very small population.
Eighty percent of those people were dealing, and the average
amount of crack they were dealing was 18,800 doses.
<p>
Now, does the difference have to be 100 to 1?  In other words, for 100 
grams of powder cocaine, should that equal 1 gram of crack?  I am not
saying that.  Maybe it should be 10 to 1.  You should look at
basically how much will an ounce of cocaine make of crack and
make it proportional.  So it does not have to be 100 to 1.  They
do have a point.  It might be a little too far.  But I do think
there is a definitely a difference, and the law has to recognize
that, and the reason there is a difference was because of the
devastation to the innocent victims in these communities where
crack ravaged their neighborhoods.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Have you seen drug crimes in general being weighted by race at 
all, or is it socioeconomic?  You said you took a look at the victims. 
What seems to mark the people who are most likely to be victims?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, for victims, of course, it is partly where you
live and who you are.  But young black males in this country are
victimized and murdered at a rate that is just appalling, and
people have to start paying attention to this.
<p>
Now, it was worse in the early 1970s when we had more lenient drug laws. 
The ratio was even worse.  But it is a very serious problem.  You know,
the number one likelihood of dying if you are a young black teenager
is murder.  And white America, all of America, has to start paying
attention to this.
<p>
But the answer is not to get weaker on drug crimes. Right now 70 percent 
of those who are even defendants for drugs are repeat offenders.  One 
in five have five or more prior felonies.  So we are not locking up a 
lot of first-timers, but if we concentrate on the first-timers with drug 
testing, fines, coordinated with treatment, we can avert the problem.
<p>
But the point is that it is based on victimization, and in fact for 
arrests, even though we incarcerate more blacks than whites for drugs,
we arrest more whites than blacks for drugs, even in the inner
city.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  When we look at treatment options, Bob, you have taken a 
look at a lot of different things that are being tried.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Sure.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What is working?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, there are a few that seem to be working. Faith-based
organizations -- I can think of Johnny Garcia down in San Antonio,
who has a better than 80 percent success rate.  So faith-based
organizations -- and there is something about it that is just
turning people around completely, whereas a lot of traditional
programs don't have nearly that sort of success rate.
<p>
One comes to mind that we were talking about yesterday, and it has to do
with what happened in Vietnam.  You know, we would take the dopeheads,
the people on heroin, and they couldn't go back to the States.
They couldn't get on the Freedom Bird to fly out of Saigon until
they were clean and they were tested to be clean, and when they
were clean, then they could get on that Freedom Bird and come
home.  Bob mentioned yesterday to us in the conference we had
that 88 percent didn't return to using dope again.
<p>
And so that is a testimony to the fact, I believe, that self-will can 
govern to a certain degree this whole issue of treatment.  Now, of 
course, we are going to hear from Sally on treatment.  But I wanted 
to follow up just a second on what Bob said in that the politicians
in this country, I think, are listening to what the people are
saying, and the courts maybe aren't quite as sensitive, because
we have a clash over this crack-powder cocaine issue between what
the Sentencing Commission is telling federal judges to do and
what the politicians are passing mandatory minimums and saying
this is what you are going to do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: And that clash is really reflective of the differences
of opinion about how we should treat drugs.
<p>
And so, yes, we do have a crisis, and as Bob articulated very well, we 
have a crisis, unfortunately, with crack and young black drug dealers 
out there. But by legalizing it, that is no solution to this terrible 
scourge that is on our land.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Sally, some people don't think that treatment 
is a solution, either.  There is this sense that we have to legalize 
drugs, we have to treat crack cocaine more leniently, because there 
is nothing else that we can do. Is treatment a viable option when we 
are looking at people who are addicted to drugs?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Treatment is a viable option, and I always say, if you 
legalize it, I'll just have more business, because there will be 
more addicts.  I am sure of that.
<p.
But what I want to point out is that treatment is a very important 
component of any kind of drug strategy.  Right now there is a fair 
amount of relapse, especially among hard core users, when they come 
out of treatment.  But what is very important to remember is that
treatment may not work as well as we like, and I think it can
work a lot better -- and I can get to that in a minute -- but
it is very much a worthwhile investment.
<p>
The ratio of savings in costs averted of medical care, of criminal 
justice, property crime, employment time lost, the ratio of gain in 
those areas to money spent on treatment is in the neighborhood of 
one dollar for treatment to between four and seven dollars saved in 
those areas.  It is a very worthwhile social investment.
<p>
The second issue, though, is how to make treatment work better, and 
there are several things.  One very important principle in treatment
is retention.  The longer you stay, the better you do.  The problem
is, there is a high dropout rate.
<p>
One thing we should be thinking about very seriously is how to get 
people to stay longer.  Now, one obvious way to do that might be that we 
will make treatment more attractive.  Well, the point is, a lot of people 
don't want to come to treatment, and one solution is to compel them to 
come to treatment.
<p>
Now, we do that in the drug court where I work because the individuals 
are given a choice --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: They can go to jail, that's right.
<p>
DR. SATEL: Which some choose, which gives you an indication of the 
aversion some people have to treatment. Why? Because it separates them 
from their drug.  So we can use that sort of coercion through the legal 
system.
<p>
There is another strategy that I would like to see revived.  Laws are 
still on the books for this in most states, but they have not been 
used, and that is what is called the civil addict.  That is a commitment
procedure.  It is basically putting people in treatment against
their will.  These would be people who are so ravaged by drugs
that they can't even make decisions; they can't care for themselves.
They have subjugated all their other needs and responsibilities.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Perhaps the homeless, some of the homeless that
are so drug addicted?
<p>
DR. SATEL: They would be a key population.
<p>
Another important point I want to make is that studies have shown
some very nice work by a researcher at UCLA that you don't have
to want to.  Everybody thinks that in order to get better with
treatment, you have to want to; it has to be voluntary.  And what
he has shown is that people who were coerced into treatment through
these legal means did as well in five-year follow-ups in terms
of their employment, in terms of their abstinence, and in terms
of their uninvolvment with the criminal justice system as those
who voluntarily finished.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But in terms of you have to want to, if they didn't want 
to, how did those people without the legal ability to make them go, 
how were they put in?
<p>
DR. SATEL: No, they were put in.  That's my point.  Many of the people 
who finished were put in.  And then others did enter on their own
volition, of course, because of pressure from family or employer.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: I would say, with the point you raise, though,
about if drugs were legal, you would have more business, I think
you might go out of business, because the number one referral
source for treatment is the criminal justice system, and people,
as you know, generally don't seek it out a lot of times unless
they are pushed either by family or by the criminal justice system.
So I wonder if your business would be damaged because people
wouldn't be in treatment if it wasn't for the criminal justice
system.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going
to take a closer look at the marriage of prosecution and treatment.
Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>, where we are 
taking a deep look at what is going on with the drug issue in America. 
Right now we are looking at the marriage of prosecution and treatment.
<p>
Bob, you were saying that if drugs were legal, we might not have any 
more treatment.  What is your experience telling you?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, that the studies that I have seen show that the 
number one referral source for treatment is the criminal justice 
system, and what we are doing is increasingly becoming more successful
at using the justice system to both get people into and out of
treatment, but really, the basic aim is to get people off drugs,
whether they go to formal treatment or not, whether they go to
AA or NA, which are volunteer groups that are really the most
successful, and any good treatment program sends people to AA
and NA, which are anonymous groups.
<p>
In Michigan, for example, we had a program where, if a felon had a drug 
problem, and when they are released in the community, they sign a 
contract with the court, and it says I will be drug tested three times 
a week, so if I'm using, I'm going to get caught, because the cocaine
stays in your system at least a couple of days.  I am going to
be drug tested three times a week -- if it is alcohol, it could
be every day of the week -- and if I test dirty, I go to jail
the first time for three days, the next time for seven days, the
next time for 30 days, the next time for 45 days.
<p>
What we found was 77 percent over five years being drug tested that 
frequently were drug free and rearrested, whether they went to formal 
treatment or not, and the key is that some people need formal treatment,
and some addicts will get off without that.  They will get off
with the AA and NA.  And so you save resources if the court says
my focus isn't on going to treatment; my focus is you have to
be drug free.
<p>
So if you come in to me, I say, &quot;Look, here's a number. If you 
need help to get free of drugs, you call them. They'll help you. 
They've got your name.  But I don't care if you go to treatment. If 
you're not drug-free on Monday, bring your toothbrush.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Sally, what do you think about that?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Oh, I think Bob is right that the criminal
justice system can be an excellent way to identify patients and,
for those who have to go to treatment, a great way to provide
leverage.  But I think what you were describing -- it is also
called coerced abstinence -- can be extremely effective.
<p>
Another dimension of the problem that may be useful in getting people
to decide to come off drugs is the fact that our society actually
enables quite a bit of drug use because entitlements are available
to people who use drugs.  We have supplemental security income,
social security disability insurance, veterans' benefits, AFDC,
public housing.  These all go to people who actively use drugs.
<p>
I think, for example, that what New York City is doing in terms
of considering drug testing for welfare recipients and heavy screening
of people who are entering public housing programs are very important
interventions.  If you kick the government props out from under
addicts, the world is going to start closing in, and they have
two choices:  stop or go to treatment.
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: I want to follow up on that in that in industry there 
are a lot of good programs today that we are not hearing about, and 
they are insisting upon testing, they are doing education programs, and 
they are putting the person's job on the line.  If they don't get clean
-- and they will provide help -- but if you don't get clean, you
don't have a job, and that is quite an incentive.
<p>
And parents who go through such a program, and they see their children 
begin to experiment with drugs, are beginning to communicate to them,
&quot;Look, you're going to ruin your life.  You need to get off
this stuff before it takes you down the primrose path.&quot;
<p>
Now, also, we need to consider what the message is that our kids are
seeing.  You know, they are out there listening to hundreds of
hours of bad music, some bad television, some bad movies, and
the media is really guilty of glamorizing drug use.  You know,
they think it makes them sexier, they think it makes them look
physically more powerful, that they are going to be smarter for
some reason, some pretty bad messages that are corrupting our
youth.  And somehow we have to turn that around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It was very interesting.  On an episode of <i>Friends</i>, 
the hottest sitcom out right now, they had Marlo Thomas on as the mother 
asking the daughters, &quot;Where do we get the best drugs these days?
What's hot?&quot;  It was a very unfortunate attitude.
<p>
But I wanted to ask you, too, Sally, and have you follow up with this,
Bob, is defining drug use as a disability or an illness, is that
part of the problem?  So now you are disabled.  So here's a federal
supplement.  Do you see that as the wrong message to send about
drug use?
<p>
DR. SATEL: I think there is a problem with over-medicalizing
addiction.  Certainly there are biological and health components
to using drugs.  Their effects obviously affect the body, and
when someone is severely addicted, their brain really is compromised.
I mean, it's the old egg on the frying pan -- this is your brain
-- and they can't make rational decisions.  So there is certainly
a biological component, but biology isn't necessarily destiny
here, and I think there is a tendency for people to then feel,
well, the locus of control here is outside of me.
<p>
One very unfortunate manifestation of that was a program under 
supplemental security income which considered drug addiction a disability, 
so that if you were disabled -- in order words, if you were too 
intoxicated to work -- you could get supplemental security income.
<p>
Now, that program was examined by Congress a few years ago, and while 
it is still on the books as a disability, at least a treatment component
was built in and the benefits were made contingent upon attending
treatment.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So once again it's the carrot and the stick,
and it is a big stick.
<p>
DR. SATEL: Oh, very much.  It is called contingency management in this 
field, and it can be very, very powerful.  I would like to see, as 
someone who has worked in the Veterans Administration for a while, I 
would like to see veterans' benefits, which can be very generous, up to 
$1,800 a month, I would like to see them be contingent upon veterans who 
have drug problems and who are mentally ill and have drug problems, 
contingent upon their compliance with treatment, taking their 
medication when necessary, and providing clean urines when asked.
<p>
MR. BAUER: Bob, is the disability issue a problem?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Oh, clearly, and I endorse what she said on the veterans. 
You know, we have a lot of young and old veterans that, for a variety 
of reasons, some of which, you know, they will go back to their days in 
Vietnam, and they will say, &quot;Well, because of the psychological 
impact of the devastation that I saw, I am high today on heroin.&quot;
Well, we need to help them work through it, but somehow we have
to test them, we have to facilitate the process of leaving drugs
behind, and clearly, that is a good example.  But there are other
programs, and we should not be spending government -- taxpayer
-- money out there to endorse and promote drug addiction.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Bob, some people think we are coddling our
criminals by having treatment as the first round.  Do you think
that that is true, that a disability way of looking at it is a
problem?  Or do you think treatment is the first line of defense
before prison is the way to go?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: I think enforced abstinence is the first line of 
defense, and whether that means treatment or not, I think again we 
are assuming that to get off drugs, you have to go to treatment, 
and all the studies show that is not true for everybody. As I said, 
88 percent of the Vietnam vets got off heroin without going to 
formal treatment.  We are talking about they did just as well whether 
they went and saw a counselor or did not.
<p>
So some people need formal treatment, some don't, but the focus on 
the criminal justice system has to be abstinence from drugs, not 
treatment.  We are not there to fill treatment centers.  It's there 
to make sure, when that person is released in the community, they 
are drug-free.
<p>
Now, the other thing is, I would not go into prisons and take the 
dangerous that are there -- 95 percent of our prisoners are repeat or 
violent offenders; they are not first-time drug offenders -- I would 
not take them out and put them on these programs.  I would take people
getting what I call meaningless probation.  I talk to kids, and
I say, &quot;How many know somebody on probation?  Do you think
that's serious?&quot; and they all start laughing.  Well, make
probation drug testing with progressive sanctions.  Make these
disability and welfare payments -- don't cut off the welfare mother
the first time she tests dirty; say now you don't get your benefit
for two weeks.  Now you don't get your benefit for three weeks.
Use it for behavior modification, but make sure you are going
to catch the person as soon as they do it and that you are going
to take progressively tougher action each time.
<p>
And this applies to parents, and I think that is the most important 
thing, is that everything we are talking about goes back to the home. 
I had the alcohol industry -- they have a thing called Sensory Council
-- call me, and they said, &quot;What could we do?  What could
we do legitimately that you would support?&quot;  I said, &quot;Well,
go out of business would be good.&quot;
<p>
[Laughter.]
<p>
But they weren't willing to shut down their doors and go out of business. 
So I said, &quot;Well, the one thing I think you ought to do is, there's
a test, a saliva test, a little cotton swab saliva test for alcohol.&quot;
I said, &quot;Every parent of people from 11 to 20 years old
should have a supply of these.&quot;
<p>
I told my sons -- I have six children, and I have four sons and two 
daughters -- and I said to my oldest, I said, &quot;We run the Ronald 
Reagan School of Parenting.&quot;  And he said, &quot;What's that?&quot; 
And I said, &quot;It's called trust but verify.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So once again, Bob, we find that verified accountability 
and self-discipline are keys to success.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: That is right. You know, one of the things with treatment, 
when you tell people they can't govern their behavior, they have an 
excuse not to.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When we come back, <i>Straight Talk</i> is going to take
a look at some of the solutions that we as individuals and a society
can enact.  Please stay with us.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Recently there was a national drug strategy session here at 
the Family Research Council, and Bob, you directed this day-long event.
What was the goal for the meeting of the minds?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, we wanted to put together a straightforward, simple 
strategy that we could turn over to Presidential candidates and have them,
at the national conventions this summer, make part of their platforms.
We wanted to address the issues that we talked about today, and
we want to permeate the country with the message that drug abuse
is serious, it is not going to go away, we have to make it a national
priority, and we want those Presidential candidates to embrace
that and run with the ball.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And, Sally, you were saying that one of the things that 
we need to enact this program is some money. But it is who gets the 
money that is a problem. What were you indicating for us?
<p>
DR. SATEL: Money in terms of disability payments? Yes, my point was 
that as a clinician, the reason I got interested in these issues was 
because, when I worked at a hospital, all my patients were getting 
entitlement money, and they were turning around and using it to buy 
drugs.
<p>
Now, as a clinician, here I see that the monies they were 
getting to help them live better lives, basically to provide for their 
basic needs, were going to make their conditions worse; and when my 
patients had a concurrent mental illness -- if they had schizophrenia,
for example, it literally made their schizophrenia worse.  They
became more psychotic, more delusional, more agitated.  So what
we had was a situation where the money they were getting because
they were ill made them even more sick.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: I would like each of you to go around.  You all participated 
in this discussion in last week's strategizing.  Bob, of the things that 
you all discussed, what do you think are some of the programs that are
really powerful from that law enforcement perspective?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, I think, first of all, it was very significant that 
the Family Research Council brought everybody together to do this,
because one of the big problems we have in this country, whether
it is law enforcement, treatment, or prevention, is that people
are not getting together to talk about this issue anymore, and
they are not pushing the issue forward, and they are not mentioning
it to the candidates, and whether it is President Clinton at all
his former State-of-the-Unions or whether it is the Contract with
America, the word &quot;drugs&quot; wasn't in either document.
So it is significant that we got together.
<p>
In the law enforcement area, one of the things we talked about was the 
drug testing of offenders with accountability.  Another thing was that 
the casual user -- we have to realize that that casual user is the one 
that is really fueling the drug problem.  We all like to focus on the
addict or on the people that don't have economic resources, but
it is that yuppie in Wall Street that is really fueling this trade
and getting away with it, and it is that Yuppie in Wall Street
that is more deterred by a minor jail sentence and sitting next
to some Bowery bums in the jail cell than the guy who is selling
drugs, let's say, in the inner city, because the guy in the inner
city, it's a badge of courage.  They have another notch.  I was
in prison again, you know, great job, well done.  But the guy
on Wall Street is deterred.  So those were two important things.
<p>
The other thing we talked about was the federal budget, that we
don't necessarily need more money, which I am sure Republican
candidates will be glad to hear.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Will be very glad to hear.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: The problem is reallocating the money we have. For 
instance, of the health care, the health care budget is, I don't 
know what, three to six times of any justice budget.
The total budget for state and local justice and for drug control
is 1.5 percent, okay?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Right.
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, out of this health care budget, HHS -- our 
Department of Health and Human Services  -- allocates 1 percent of its 
budget, from what I read, to drugs.  The Department of Justice allocates 
50 percent.  So what does HHS say?  Well, if you want us to do treatment,
we have to take some of the Justice budget.  No.  If drugs are
driving 30 or 40 percent of your health care costs, Congress should
tell HHS, &quot;You shall allocate 30 percent of your budget to
drugs.  You find a way to do it.  Find the things that you are
over-allocating to, and you can have treatment on demand for everybody
in this country without raising a penny of tax money.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sally, from a treatment perspective, what were some
of the initiatives that came out of the meeting that you were
really excited about?
<p>
DR. SATEL:  Well, one thing I would like to see and we talked about 
was having more capacity for long-term residential treatment. This 
is treatment that lasts between a year and two years.  Its goal is to 
really socially transform the individual.  We are talking now about hard 
core users.
<p>
While the drug problem, as you are saying, may be fueled in large part
by casual users, the economic burdens are extracted by the very
heavy users.  These are people who, when they go to a place, for
example, like Phoenix House, what Phoenix House addresses is not
the drug; they address the addict and the notion that the person
has turned to drugs because of a deeper personal disturbance,
and there is a lot of rebuilding of character, of capacity, that
those treatment programs do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Fantastic.
<p>
Bob, I have to commend you.  After a long career in the military and law 
enforcement angles, you were the one that said this drug problem is a 
problem; let's get together.  This was certainly your brain child.
<p>
From a public policy standpoint, Bob, what are you excited about in
terms of this drug issue?
<p>
COL. MAGINNIS: Well, it permeates all aspects of society.  It is 
driving our economy in a way that most people don't recognize. It is 
killing a lot of our kids, and it is killing a lot of older people.
<p>
But I see this issue really comes down to one issue, and that is 
leadership. The leadership starts at the top.  The President of the 
United States, like Ronald Reagan and Nancy at his side, needs to stand 
in front of every person in America and say, &quot;Don't do drugs. 
Drugs are bad.  They're going to hurt you.&quot;  Now, you get that 
sort of example, you identify the problem, you give them solutions, 
and you set a good role model.
<p>
Now, that has to go all the way down to the kitchen
table where Mom and Dad sit down with their son, their daughter,
and they do the things that Bob talked about earlier.  &quot;I
love you, but I'm going to test you.  I'm going to check out your
school environment, your friends, because I love you, and I want
to keep you off this, because I know this could devastate your
life.&quot;
<p>
So if we could get our politicians, our leaders, our
parents, our community leaders involved in this issue, as we must,
because it is a national emergency, then we can turn this scourge
around.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So as much as we are looking at treatment
and enforcement, for you it is a philosophical leadership issue
that is really causing some of the problems?
<p>
MR. PETERSON: Well, if you have the leaders together, everything 
else is going to fall in line.  They are going to prioritize the 
funding, they are going to prioritize the law enforcement.  They are 
going to get the media whipped into shape to do the right sort of 
thing. You know, it is really leadership.  If we have good leadership
on this issue, we can defeat the enemy; we can win the drug war.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  I would like to thank my guests for being with us
today, and I hope that you will call Family Research Council for
more information on any of these programs or some of the policy
related to drugs.  Please stay tuned.
<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk</i>. 
If you would like to receive more information about the Family Research
Council, tonight's guests, or the topics we discussed, call us
at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week we will take a look at a sensitive, life-enhancing and 
life-changing issue for parents and children: adoption. If adoption 
is viewed as the best alternative to unwed pregnancy by the majority 
of Americans, why is it so hard for couples to adopt children in our 
own country?  We'll find out next week as we talk to individuals who 
have been affected and involved in the adoption issue when we bring 
you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. Thanks 
for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
looks at an issue that seems to have been, in the past two decades of 
abortion discussion, swept under the carpet: adoption.
<p>
Although most Americans believe that adoption is the best response to 
an out-of-wedlock pregnancy, in 1991, 41 percent of out-of-wedlock 
pregnancies ended in abortion. Of the 44 percent carried to term, only 2 
percent of those children were placed for adoption.  Before 1973 when 
abortion was legalized, about one in five not-marital births to white 
women, for example, were placed for abortion.  But by the late 1980s, 
the number of children placed for adoption dropped drastically to one 
in 30.
<p>
This change has taken place at a time when rising infertility
rates show that one couple in four today cannot have children.
We'll delve into these issues and more in tonight's discussion.
<p>
But first, let's hear from Phil Olsen, the Family Research Council's
Vice President for Resource Development.  Phil and his staff are
in constant contact with the public, so they know what current
issues are resonating with American families today.
<p>
I had the chance to talk to Phil about some of those concerns, so 
let's hear his insights into what the media may not be telling you,
as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are very excited that Phil could join us today on 
Behind the Headlines.  What are people telling you today? You have 
been in the field.  It's hard to even see you sometimes in the office, 
Phil.  When you're out there in recent weeks, what are people saying, 
&quot;Look, this is the number one thing that I am worried about?&quot;
<p>
MR. OLSEN:  Well, I think that today, I think the thing that we hear 
the most is that they are very concerned about the direction our country 
is headed. They are very concerned about the moral decline that they 
see. They are very concerned about the disintegration of our society,
the difficulties that families have today just trying to be a
family.  And these are some of the things that we hear repeatedly.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Are the political things here in Washington making
the top ten list of family concerns?  Are you finding it's more
fear of the personal and the breakdown in the personal around
them?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, I think that one of the things that we
continue to hear is that people seem to be very skeptical of the
media.  They don't feel like the media is shooting straight. 
They feel like the media is running a public relations campaign
for this administration, and I think that they are very puzzled
by some of that.  They want the truth.  They would like the straight
scoop.
<p>
I think that, given the truth, they have the ability to
make up their mind where they want to come down on the issues.
But I think that there is a general consensus that they are not
receiving the truth all the time.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that explains in part the growth of groups 
like the Family Research Council?  You know, where are people going to 
go for that kind of information they are looking for?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I think that is absolutely the case.  I think that people are 
realizing that they need to look to organizations who can provide them 
with information that is reliable.  I think that that is something that 
has set the Family Research Council apart.  People have come to realize
that they can depend on the research that is produced by the Family
Research Council.  They can rely on the work that we are doing
here on their behalf.  I think, to be honest with you, that is
probably the primary thing that has led to the growth that we
have seen in the Family Research Council in just the last few
years.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that as you are meeting a lot
of people who are turning toward their family issues, is there
a thought that it is more the personal that is impacting or the
government?  Where are people concerned about in terms of the
impacts negatively on their family?
<p>
MR. OLSEN: Well, again, I think that there is a range out there in 
terms of people's understanding of the political process.  I think 
there is a great frustration that exists, because they don't really 
understand a lot of what is happening in this country.  There has been 
for many, many years a sense that when you elect a representative and 
send them to Washington, D.C., they are going to do what is in the best 
interest of the family, or so you think.  And, unfortunately, in too 
many cases, the reverse has actually come to pass, where these elected
officials are not doing what is in the best interest of their
constituents.  They are being coerced into making decisions that
might be in the best interest of a small minority group or a small
special interest group, and that is not what is best for our country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Phil, we thank you so much for being with us in
Behind the Headlines and look forward to seeing you again.
<p>
MR. OLSEN: I thank you, Kristi.  It has been great to be with you.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares insights of some experts who have researched the adoption issue.
We'll find out why adoption is no longer mainstream.  Please
stay tuned.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Tonight we are talking about adoption.  I am joined by Gracie 
Hsu, a Family Research Council policy analyst, who has looked extensively 
at the legal entanglements that surround adoption.  Also joining me is 
Bill Pierce, President of the National Council on Adoption, whose 
organization is spearheading proposed adoption changes; and Chris Casey, 
Executive Director of the Campaign for the American Family, who is 
currently organizing an adoption seminar this spring. Welcome to the 
show.
<p>
Gracie, we certainly welcome you back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. You
have been studying adoption for a while.  What have you seen in
adoption trends?  We looked at some disturbing numbers in the
first segment about a tremendous decline.  What are you finding
out?
<p>
MS. HSU:  What we are finding out is that fewer teenagers
and fewer people who have unwed pregnancies and births are choosing
adoption.  Whereas there used to be maybe a significant number
of pregnancies that would end in adoption, and especially if they
were unwed, now we are looking at about 2 percent.
<p>
NCFA has done a great job in tracking these trends over time, but 
what we're seeing is that the laws, also, when it comes to adoption, 
have not been encouraging this; in fact, they have been trying to make
it so it is less popular, especially in foster care situations,
where it makes it even more difficult for adoptions to take place.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Bill, actually, I have been acquainted with your
organization for 10 years.  I have been here in Washington long
enough to say that.  What have you seen with the laws surrounding
adoption?  Are they hostile, actually, to its being accomplished?
<p>
DR. PIERCE: Well, they are, because if you think about it for
a second, our tax laws are one example.  Our tax laws provide
benefits for people through deductions if they decide to have
a child biologically.  Our tax laws even provide deduction if
someone medically decides to terminate a pregnancy.  But our tax
laws have no benefit whatsoever if someone tries to adopt.
<p>
So one of the things we have been trying to do, as Gracie knows and
as Chris knows, is to work for an adoption tax credit to be passed
at the federal level to make it possible for more people to adopt.
<p>
One of the big things that would help to really reprivatize adoption,
that would empower ordinary people, that would help change the
system in a dramatic way, would be to put a $5,000 refundable
tax credit as part of adoption.
<p>
The nice thing about it, it is one of those things which is bipartisan 
in its origin. We have both Democrats and Republicans that like it. Newt 
Gingrich thinks it's a great idea.  I was at the American Enterprise 
Institute the other day, and I heard David Bonior say that he would 
endorse it.
<p>
I think the challenge now is for us to see whether the Congress,
which is always talking a lot, can actually put a small, simple
piece of legislation together and put it through without turning
it into a Christmas tree and hanging everything that we would
like to see on one piece of legislation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: But that's a fraction of adoption costs, are they not? I 
mean, what does the average adoption today cost?
<p>
DR. PIERCE: Well, there's a tremendous range, but I would say somewhere 
between $6,000 all the way up to $30,000.  But $5,000 would make the key 
difference for lots and lots of people.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Chris, your organization has targeted adoption as something 
that is one of your goals. Why?
<p>
MR. CASEY:  Well, my father, the former governor of Pennsylvania,
Bob Casey, when he was governor, made adoption a top priority,
and he thinks that it's time for the national government to do
the same thing.
<p>
We have a lot of people out there who have done great things in the 
adoption area privately, but we don't see a national effort by our 
government to make it a top priority. We think it's time that that 
happened, and I think if that happens, if you have rhetorical change, 
in addition to legislation change that Bill has talked about, that people 
will start to see it as the positive, life-affirming option that it is, 
and I think then you will see that the number of adoptions start to 
increase, and, hopefully, through the work that we are doing, bringing 
people together to talk about the many problems and barriers that currently
exist in the system, we can have some real changes, I think, relatively
quickly.  I think that it is the kind of issue that has not seen
its potential on the national level, and I think it is a perfect
time for it, because we see the tremendous social costs that go
along with family disintegration.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, your father, who is a Democrat -- a lot of people think 
that this is a Republican issue, but it's really not -- chose adoption. Do 
you think because it was difficult in Pennsylvania or because he wanted 
to make it easier? Why adoption?
<p>
MR. CASEY:  Well, he has always been a strong pro-life advocate and has 
seen the tremendous dichotomy and schizophrenia, if you will, where people 
in this country will go to China, to Russia, to Latin America to adopt a 
child.  They will jump through all sorts of hoops and at tremendous 
personal sacrifice.
<p>
At the same time, when you have 4,400 children being
aborted every day, that is a situation that obviously is out of
balance, and I think he saw that operating on the state level
and wanted to do something on the national level.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting that you would think adoption would be 
the common ground where pro-life Americans and people who support
some kind of legalized abortion would be able to come together.
But it doesn't seem like that is what really happens.  Gracie,
what is your experience?
<p>
MS. HSU:  Well, what is interesting is that public opinion polls 
overwhelmingly say that people are in favor of adoption. If you are 
given four options as to an unwed teenager who is pregnant, what should 
she do, the number one answer is always adoption.  That gets the most 
votes out of everything else. And the least popular is abortion, and in 
between there is marry the father and to have the baby and raise it 
herself.
<p>
But even though public opinion is high on adoption, what we are
finding is that people don't practice this, and much of the reason
why is because we see a social trend that says illegitimacy is
okay.  We are growing in illegitimacy statistics.  People are
having kids outside of wedlock in their thirties and forties,
even, and it is perfectly normal. People accept this.
<p>
There is also the fact that abortion really changes the entire 
equation; that once you have abortion, most people are concentrated 
on do I want this baby or do I want to abort.  They are not thinking
what is best for this baby.  They are not thinking child-centered.
They are thinking what is best for me in my circumstances.
<p>
And so until we can reach beyond the selfish need, and once they start
to focus on the child, then they do realize that adoption is the
best alternative.  But it takes a while to get there now.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: One of the things that strikes me as interesting about
the challenge that we face in terms of promoting adoption as we
should is that I think even if you put aside the issue of abortion,
which is obviously a key issue, and you just look at it from the
point of view of economic conservatism, there's a lot that needs
to be done, because in town -- and I have been in this city now
for 26 years -- I have heard very seldom what I would call the
economic conservatives, the libertarians, really focusing on adoption,
I think, the way they should.
<p>
I don't think that they understand that if you talk about welfare reform, 
if you talk about independence, if you talk about all of the issues that 
are critical to economic conservatives, that adoption is a real solution 
here. This is a way to take a pregnancy which is untimely and which may 
have tremendous social and economic negatives for a whole variety of
people and turn it on the flip side and make it an economic positive.
<p>
I mean, if you just take the comparison between a lot of state
laws that provide mandated insurance coverage for infertility
treatment -- infertility treatment is basically about a $35,000
procedure for a 25 percent chance of having a healthy baby.  Well,
if you compare that to adoption, adoption is, at most, on average,
a $15,000 cost for a 100 percent chance of having a healthy baby,
and economic conservatives should see that as a great bargain.
<p>
They should also see it as a great bargain in terms of preventing
welfare dependency, of preventing secondary pregnancies, of preventing
divorce because people got married when they were not really wanting
to.
<p>
So I think one of the things that particularly <i>Straight Talk</i>
and the Family Research Council has been great at doing is in
getting out to economic conservatives and giving the message to
them that --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It costs less.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: -- leaving the issues of morality aside, economic conservatives 
should really start focusing also on the issues of adoption.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So many broken wheels end up with a broken-down adoption 
system, and I would like us to look a little bit at foster care.  You
know, one of the things that we have seen as an impact -- and
I would like you all to say what you all have seen -- in adoption
is the fact that in foster care, sometimes we are spending years
and years and years of a child's life not severing damaged parental
bonds and allowing that child to go out of the welfare system
and into a stable married home.  We are holding children sort
of in perpetual child jail.
<p>
The Gregory K. situation, for example, when the boy tried to divorce his 
mother, could have been resolved with a severing of a very damaging 
parental relationship early. I don't think that should be taken by any of 
us to think that we don't want to hold families together when possible. 
<p>
But tell me what you're seeing, for example, with foster care, where 
children are there for their entire life, transferred from home to home
with no future.
<p>
MR. CASEY: It's a very tragic situation.  We hear a lot of tragic stories 
of kids being bounced between the birth home and the foster home.
<p>
Foster care costs about $10 billion, the state and federal costs together, 
whereas, as Bill points out, adoption is basically a cost-free solution.
<p>
I think foster care was originally intended as a temporary home for kids 
and oftentimes ends up being semi-permanent; in some cases, permanent.
And it cannot replace an adoptive home where you have loving,
willing parents who will care for the child, and that is the option
we should be pushing.  We need to move away from the long, prolonged
waits and go to a system where kids are given a better chance
and taken out of an abusive home on a more timely basis so they
don't spend so much time in foster care.
<p>
DR. PIERCE: One of the things that reminds me of the foster care issue 
is, indeed, some material that I got from Chris's organization the 
other day. There is a case up in Philadelphia involving Baby Mitch, 
which is a perfect example of what we're talking about.  Here we're
talking about a newborn baby which was abandoned.  Usually that
baby would end up going into the public foster care system, rattle
around the system, and be lucky if, in a year or two, that child
ended up being placed for adoption.
<p>
Well, they did something really radical, and they turned the baby 
over to the private charitable sector, and they said, &quot;Find a 
home for this child.&quot; And that is one of the things that we think 
would make real good sense, and in fact one of the things that we 
have been trying to push on the federal level is something called the 
Abandoned Babies Act, which was introduced by Representative Fawell from
Illinois, and what he is basically saying is, &quot;Look, we're
not trying to take anybody's rights away, but we ought to jump-start
the system so that if a baby is abandoned, you get that kid through
the system in a hurry and you get that kid into a permanent home.&quot;
<p>
Quite frankly, I think that the way to do that is to do what they
did in Philadelphia and what they have done before in some states,
and that is to basically say, &quot;Look, we're going to take
the issues that have to be done by the state -- the police powers,
like protective services -- and we're going to leave that in the
hands of the public welfare department.  But the other things
that can be contracted out, that can be given to the private voluntary
sector, we're going to give them those things to do.&quot;
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We are getting a lot of calls at Family Research Council
every day, people who are interested in adoption, and I've got
a list myself of people who want more information.
<p>
Chris, you are getting ready to have a conference.
<p>
MR. CASEY: Yes.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: We have very little time left.  Where can they call and 
what will they hear at your conference?
<p>
MR. CASEY: Well, they can call me at the offices, and the number is 
(703) 875-8724, and I will be happy to send them materials on the 
conference.
<p>
Dr. Pierce is helping us with the conference, and there are others, 
national adoption leaders, that we're going to convene.  We will have 
a seminar on May 9 here in Washington where we will bring together
experts to talk about the problems, and then in the fall we're
going to have a full-day conference in early October to expand
upon it and to talk about solutions.
<p>
I think one of the things that we would like to see is, if this 
government, the national government, can talk about putting 100,000 
cops on the street in high-crime areas, we think it's time that we 
worked towards the goal of 100,000 adoptions each year for the next 
five years. That would go a long way, we think, towards rebuilding the 
family in this country.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  That is very exciting, and I would like to thank my 
guests.  Call Family Research Council for more information.
<p>
Please join us after the commercial break as we introduce
you to an attorney who facilitates adoption and a couple whose
unique experience in adopting a child you won't want to miss.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome Barbara Jones, 
an adoption attorney who has facilitated many successful
adoptions, and Benny Phillips, pastor of Fairfax Covenant Church,
and his wife, Sheree.
<p>
The Phillipses have six biological children, which is amazing in 
itself, but they are here to share the story about their youngest 
daughter, number seven, Julia.
<p>
Thank you for being with us today.  Thanks so much.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Glad to be here.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  This is so exciting.  We were talking about some of 
the legalities of adoption in the first segment, and it is very, 
very difficult.  But yours is a story that so many people call us 
about wishing they could adopt, and we get many, many calls.
<p>
Now, I am going to hold up a photo of your family. I think some 
people are going to have a hard time understanding
why, with this lovely family, you all had the yearning to adopt
and your passion for adoption.  Tell us why.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Well, about, I guess, 10 years ago, 10 or 11 years ago, 
God just dropped something in my heart that some day we would be 
adopting, and at that point we had only two children, I think.  Time 
passed; we continued to have children, as you see, and as we got more
involved in the pro-life issues and talked to various people,
their experiences of how you can serve and help as far as the
pro-life movement is concerned, one of the ways we felt like God
would have us get involved is through possibly a crisis pregnancy,
and that is how this all developed, was through a crisis pregnancy.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sheree, do you remember that day?
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS: The day that she came?
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  The day you got your child.
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS:  Yes.  As a matter of fact, we were contacted by
a mutual friend about a very young teenage girl who had scheduled
an abortion but had consented to talk to a couple, particularly
a pastor, about her decision, and we had the privilege of going
to meet her, along with her mother, to speak with her, to encourage
her, to express love to her and concern for her, and we were delighted
when, just a few days later, she called and had canceled the abortion
and asked us to consider taking her baby.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's fantastic. And, Barbara, you helped facilitate that, 
I understand.
<p>
MS. JONES:  I had the great privilege of working with this precious
family.  Not only do they have a heart for children, but their
heart was very expandable.
<p>
I think some of the most exciting things that we went through were 
just the relationships that they were experiencing with the birth 
parents.  After they met the birth mother, they had the opportunity 
to go and meet the birth father, speak with him to see if in fact he 
was amenable to this particular family receiving his child.  That 
meant a great deal to him, and it established the rapport and the 
relationship for him to be able to relinquish his child as well and 
know his child would be in good hands.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  What are you finding as you have been handling adoptions? 
So many people are deterred and intimidated by the legal barriers, 
really, to adoption.  What are you finding in your practice to be 
true about the legal barriers to adoption?
<p>
MS. JONES:  Well, much of it is myth.  With some of the media
cases -- Baby Jessica, Baby Richard -- there is a tremendous fear
that is really evident when you speak to adoptive couples.  But
as we educate them and point out in some of these cases there
were actual legal errors that may not have been proclaimed by
the media and teach them that the relationship can make such a
difference, just in meeting the birth parents.  I think education
is really a key.
<p>
Also, there are the statistics.  There is such discouragement that 
there are not babies to adopt, which in fact, there are babies to 
adopt, and it is showing families how to meet birth parents, to link 
up with them for adoption.
<p>
I think another concern is cost.  It is very costly, and as a result 
of educating, and people like Benny and Sheree, pastors, doing it in 
their church, many churches have established funds to help the families 
with some of the costs to defray them, and also to be able to point
out other areas, if there are grants available, to direct families,
even to teach them such things as they can take loans against
life insurance policies, home equity loans; also, churches many
times just take an offering for the family.  So to encourage them
that if they really have a heart for it, there is a way.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: What were you surprised about?  As you began to have a 
passion for adoption as a solution to abortion, what surprised you as
you were learning?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  Well, I think probably the thing that surprised us 
the most was how quickly you emotionally get involved in the process 
and how, as we began the process of adoption, particularly a 
trans-racial adoption, just how your heart -- talk about expandable 
heart -- just how your heart grows and expands for this whole issue, 
and you get to a place where you really want to be able to provide not 
only these children with homes and environments but to be able to serve 
people who are in crisis situations, that this is a viable option, and 
the church can do something about it, and to instruct even people
in our churches that, hey, here's an opportunity for us to carry
out the mission, to broaden our evangelism, and to really make
a difference in people's lives.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of people are afraid to adopt.  Were you all 
afraid to adopt?  Were you afraid about being a media case where someone 
was going to come back and say, &quot;I changed my mind&quot;?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  I think for about 15 minutes, and after Barbara talked 
to us and we asked that question and she was able to educate us as to 
what is really going on, it dissipated, and from that point on we didn't
carry any concern whatsoever.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Tell me, Sheree, about the first moment that you saw 
the baby.  What was that like?
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS:  Well, it was a moment I'll never forget, because, to
be quite honest with you, I had some concerns about adoption.
Having had six biological children, having been told that we
would never have children, I received each of these children so
eagerly.  I was a little concerned, to be candid, that I would
have the affection and the love and the bonding that I experienced
with my biological children with an adopted child.
<p>
But because we were able to share the labor experience with our birth 
mom, we were able to be in an adjacent room and receive our little
baby girl, we heard her first cries and she was presented to us
still wrapped in her little newborn blanket, when the nurse walked
in and handed her to me, I can honestly say that in that moment
I knew this is my little daughter.  And the moments we had there,
an hour or so that we had with her, holding her, talking with
her, experiencing -- her maternal grandmother was there, and we
got to share that time with her -- was a precious moment.
<p>
For any adoptive mom that I speak with who has, understandably, 
similar concerns, I can say that the love that we have, the bond that
we share with our daughter Julia, is no different than that that
we have with our biological children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Do you find that as you -- you get to see this miracle 
regularly.
<p>
MS. JONES: I do.  One of the most fun questions is always to -- when 
I am working with folks that do have biological children or a biological
child and they are seeking to adopt or going through the process,
is to say to them afterwards, &quot;Please, tell me what it's
really like, because you've had the privilege of being a biological
parent and an adoptive parent.&quot;
<p>
Benny and Sheree were the two that did it best and in a most lasting 
way, in my memory. They said, &quot;Well, it's different but it's the 
same, but you love them just the same,&quot; and then the tears came, 
and they just can't put it in words, but what that showed me is that
there is truly a grafting into the heart, and they understand
more than us -- we were not adopted -- what it really is like
for the Lord to adopt children, that He loves us unconditionally,
and that always is the case.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Very much so.
<p>
You get to see a lot of people long term. What do you find? People 
adopt once; they want to come back and adopt more children. You hear 
some people saying, &quot;Well, sure, it's great maybe at that 
moment, but what about later?  Does the shine wear off?&quot;
What are you finding as that has been your focus?
<p>
MS. JONES: The shine doesn't wear off.  For some families, they are 
satisfied when there are two siblings because there is a brother or 
a sister in the family, and often through agencies that is the limit.
In the past it has been maybe two children per family.  So sometimes
they are content with that.
<p>
Then you meet the family like the family that is down in Florida, the 
owner of the Orlando Magic team who has many children.  Occasionally I 
work with couples where there is no limit, and they come back for more 
and more and more. There is no limit to their love and their household.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: It is very, very exciting, and we want to actually
let people meet Julia.  If you want to come on and bring her in,
and this is your oldest daughter, I understand?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: Right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  We would like to have you --
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS: This is Jamie.  She is not our oldest, she is our oldest 
girl.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Oh, your oldest girl.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  We have a son 18 -- come here, sweetie.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Great.  Come on in to Dad.
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  And this is Julia.  Come here.  Look at the camera. 
Everybody wants to see your pretty face.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: So what have you found as your family has adjusted to 
this newest child?  What myths about adoption do you laugh at now that 
you look back?
<p>
REV. PHILLIPS:  Oh, wow!  I mean, we do laugh at the
myth that you can't love an adopted child as much as one of your
own, because I can't make a -- there doesn't seem to be anything
distinguishable to me in the way we relate to her and how we feel
about her as I did when she was her age, you know.  And the children
-- I mean, to watch these children relate to her and how they
have taken her -- as a matter of fact, the problem is her kind
of ruling things.  And so that whole thing of, you know, it's
different -- do you love, do you bond -- I find that that may
be difficult at first for some to get through that moment, but
you do get through it.  You really do.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: That's very exciting.  Thank you for sharing your story.
<p>
MRS. PHILLIPS: Thank you so much.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear
about the other side of adoption as we meet a young woman who
went through two different experiences in placing two children
for adoption.  Stay tuned for more after this break.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  I would like to welcome back Barbara
Jones, an adoption attorney, and a good friend of Barbara's, Nicki
Scolaro, who has a unique and touching story to share about the
circumstances of placing two children for adoption.
<p>
Thank you very much, Barbara, for being back, and Nicki, for coming 
today. You placed two children for adoption, two different kinds of
adoption, closed and open, but tell us a little bit about why
that was a decision you made and how you came to make it.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Well, the first time I became pregnant, it was a situation
where abortion was not even a thought to me.  I just was raised
in a background and the family environment in which we just didn't
believe in abortion.  So I knew from the moment I found out I
was pregnant I was going to go with adoption.
<p>
With the first experience, I ended up going away to a maternity home. 
It was a very sheltered environment.  Counseling was provided.  But it 
was different in that only half of the girls actually placed their 
children for adoption, so it wasn't that that was what everybody did. 
But I knew what I was going to do from the moment I found out I was
pregnant, and it was a closed adoption.
<p>
It was just a situation where I described the type of family in which 
I would like my child to grow up, and they named some prospective 
clients only in a description of them.  I didn't meet anybody.  I 
don't know any names.  It was very closed, and after I had Lauren, my 
first child, I left the hospital 18 hours later and I had an hour to
say goodbye to everybody I had lived with for four or five months
and leave.
<p>
I had no contact for the first couple of weeks after
I returned home with the agency, and it was just all very standoffish
after that, and in that respect it was just not a positive experience
for me, just because so much was left to the imagination, and
there was just not a lot of comfort there, because I wasn't given
any information about --
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Did you have a lot of fear about where your child was 
or --
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Yes.  I didn't know anything about the family.  My main 
concerns with that situation are, if something were to happen, would 
anybody ever tell me? How do they feel about me?  Situations like that 
where it's just, you know, when you are left with your imagination, you 
can imagine some pretty terrible things.  And when I came home, it was 
just a very awkward situation for my family.  It was a hard thing to
handle, and I ended up getting in a bad relationship and getting
pregnant again.
<p>
Actually, I was planning on keeping my second
daughter, simply because the adoption experience was not a positive
one, and I just didn't think it was possible to do it again. 
So, about six months into my pregnancy, I realized I was no more
equipped at that time to be a mother than I had been before, and
I still wanted to finish college and do things with my life, and
I just didn't see anything positive coming out of trying to raise
a baby on my own.
<p>
So that's when I decided to adopt again, or place for adoption again, 
and I knew there had to be a better way to do it, and it just so 
happens that I was living with a family who took me in as an unwed 
mother, and his doctor's nurse wanted to adopt. So I just called her 
and was like, &quot;I'm pregnant; do you want to talk?&quot;  I mean, 
it was a very awkward situation.  It just seemed so unnatural, like, 
&quot;Hi, do you want my baby?&quot;
<p>
So we actually ended up meeting, and just by luck we just fell in 
love with each other.  She and her husband are just wonderful people, 
and they had adopted before, and it just worked out so perfectly. I 
mean, it just doesn't seem like anything at all went wrong. I became 
very close with them, and they were actually in the room when Katherine 
was born. In fact, I was spending the night at their house and I went 
into labor, so they took me to the hospital.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A very much better experience.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Yes, totally the opposite extreme from Lauren's situation. 
And the comfort that I feel from knowing them so personally and seeing 
her house.  I know her dog and her older sister.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: I mean, there is just nothing left to my imagination. I 
don't have to wonder about anything, as well as for them, any questions 
she may one day have, they will be able to answer.  So it is a very 
positive experience.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think in the first -- there is a lot of discussion 
about how -- although a lot of women think adoption might be something 
they would like, that there really is a lot of need for counseling to 
deal with the emotions connected.
<p>
From your experience, would that have helped even the first time,
to have had someone there?
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Oh, definitely, definitely. When I came home from having 
had Lauren, I was in this emotional wilderness, and they pretty much 
didn't tell me what it was going to be like as far as -- you know, all 
they talked about was, &quot;Oh, you get to start school in a couple 
of months,&quot; and they talked about me as far as what I would do for 
the rest of my life, but not in relation to the loss I felt with -- I 
mean, there is a hole there.  You get -- all these maternal instincts 
come, and there is nothing there to take care of, and it's a hard 
thing to deal with, and I think, had I had counseling at that time,
I more than likely would not have gotten pregnant again.
<p>
But I ended up, once I did get pregnant again, I realized I had to 
have some help, and I was in counseling for a while, and it totally
changed my life.  I mean, I really needed that.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: And now you're going to graduate from college soon and are 
looking toward law school and to a lot of other choices.
<p>
MS. SCOLARO: Yes.  I am actually considering becoming an adoption 
attorney, because there is so much that I think needs to be changed. 
As we were saying before, there are so many myths about adoption
that people just have this horrific picture of it, and it really
does not have to be that way if you do it right.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Now, Barbara, you are involved in these situations. What 
are you finding as you are dealing with young women making very hard
choices?  What do you find that you need to tell them?
<p>
MS. JONES: You mentioned the counseling. First of all, when I meet 
with a birth mom, generally, they have already matched with a 
prospective adoptive parent, or it might be a situation where they come 
from a crisis pregnancy center, and I will just give them free legal
counsel so they can factor that into the decision-making process,
whether they would actually be able to walk through it, and many
times that assists them in coming to that decision.
<p>
I think counseling is critical.  I have worked with birth moms who have 
been in total denial, told me that they never felt the baby kick, that 
when they went to the hospital, they were expecting maybe their period
was coming. There was such incredible denial, but then here's
the reality of a baby.
<p>
My favorite counselor with birth moms is in fact a trained social worker, 
but she is also a birth mother that placed a child six years ago, and 
she is so effective because she knows the issues of their heart. And 
when a birth mom can be -- if you can walk her through her grieving and 
all the things that she is going to be experiencing, it helps her to do 
the hard thing that she is doing and it gets her over that just really
difficult period and brings her to wholeness and healing again,
gives her hope.
<p>
So counseling is critical.  I think education is critical. Even in the 
legal relationship, working with birth parents, it is far more than just 
the law part, because in many ways you are a friend and you are walking 
them through those different stages.  You come to care very much for 
them.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The grieving is something, I think, that people don't talk 
a lot about, even when you are making a decision that it is something 
that you're letting go.  How long did it take you to sort of grieve
and get over that?
<p>
MS. SCOLARO:  Actually, I can't say that it is something that ever 
really ends.  There comes a point where definitely you don't cry every 
day. It's a loss you have to deal with constantly.  I think, at least 
for me, I can say that it is just something -- I had to accept that this 
was just part of who I am now and part of my life, and you have to move 
beyond the shock of, oh, my gosh, this actually happened to me, or that
I actually did this, and you have to try to look at it as a positive
experience.  I mean, my life is much better, her life is much
better, this family is happier, and you have to just focus on
the positive.
<p>
But there are still moments when I think it is almost surreal, like 
I can't believe I did that, not in a bad way, but just it seems 
unbelievable.  But I think there is always going to be something, like 
it's very hard for me to imagine, when I do get married and have 
children, being happy about being pregnant or something like that. 
There is always going to be something there that I am going to 
associate with having children that will never leave me. It is like 
I will never forget that they exist. They will always be my first two 
children.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Sure, absolutely. What are you finding -- you know, Nicki 
is thinking of, saying now the way to deal with it is to be positive. 
When you are talking to a birth mother, is it helpful to say, &quot;Let's
think of the positives&quot;?  What is helpful?  What have you
found to be helpful when you are there?  Because it is easier
for Nicki now to say, &quot;This is how I deal with it.&quot;
What is helpful when you are there talking with someone who is
considering adoption?
<p>
MS. JONES:  First of all, to let her know that it is her decision and 
no one is going -- we are not going to pressure her. It is also very 
important, I think, to esteem a birth mother, to tell her she is a woman 
of honor, and she is a woman of integrity, to hold her head high, because 
she is bringing life three ways:  to this infant, to her own body, not 
experiencing the ravages of abortion, and she may choose to give the gift 
of life to a family that is waiting.  So I think that is very important.
<p>
Also, the other thing that seems to just really stand out is the
relationship that birth parents establish with adoptive parents,
and sometimes they will tell you that the sweetest part about
adoption is the relationship with the adoptive parents, and some
will say that we're afraid we're going to miss them more than
we'll miss our baby, because we know in time we'll go our own
ways and separate.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much for being with us, both of you, and I 
really appreciate the stories that you're telling. When we return, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shows you a clip from CBS's <i>48 Hours</i>, 
which brings into light a whole new perspective on parenting
and who has the right to raise children.  Don't go away.

<p>
[Commercial break.]
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Coming up, we've got a clip from <i>48 Hours</i> 
which takes a look at homosexual adoption, a very controversial topic.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">

<p>

[Clip from CBS <i>48 Hours</i>, February 22, 1996, follows:]
<p>
MALE VOICE:  . . .it really doesn't matter whether they have a father 
there or not.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: Men and women are not interchangeable puzzle pieces.
<p>
MODERATOR: It matters to Kristi Hamrick and the Washington-based Family
Research Council, a conservative think tank.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  . . .the issue here is not two women who benignly want to 
set up a home; it is people actively seeking to rewrite the world, to 
rewrite the law, to rewrite child development into their own image.
<p>
MODERATOR: The judge who wrote the New York decision said that when it 
comes to the best interests of a child, stability and two parents at
home is more important than sexual orientation.
<p>
MS. HAMRICK: The judge is wrong, because eventually these children are 
going to want to know, why wasn't there a father there for me, why wasn't
there a mother there for me, why do I feel like something is missing
when everybody tells me that I've got everything I need?  Because
they need both.
<p>
[End of 48 Hours clip.]

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with 
us to hear how you can get more information regarding the issues affecting 
you and your family.

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us at <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. If you would like to receive more 
information about our organization, tonight's guests, or the topics 
discussed, call us at 1-800-225-4008.
<p>
Next week, we will bring you a look at a phenomenon sweeping our
country.  It's gambling.  Is gambling the pot of gold at the end
of the rainbow that casino owners promise?  We'll hear about it
from some national experts who have studied this issue and have
a lot to say.  So you won't want to miss us next week as we bring
you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> invites you to share in a very special annual Family 
Research Council event, the Washington Briefing.

<p>

The 1996 briefing brought together people from across the nation
to hear from some of the [people] most able to provide insight
into America's politics and the challenges facing today's American
family.  The wide range of briefing speakers, from Congressmen
and Senators to journalists, to individuals engaged in pro-family
battles, provides inside-the-beltway knowledge [to] which we as
the public are not often privy.

<p>

So we hope you'll join us tonight as we present highlights of the 
1996 Washington Briefing.

<p>

To begin, though, let's hear from some of the leading freshmen in the 
House of Representatives.  Congresswoman Sue Myrick of North Carolina,
Congressman David McIntosh of Indiana, and Congressman George
Radanovich of California answer some challenging questions asked
by some of the Washington Briefing attendees.  These are questions
that you may have wanted to ask many times and questions that
you hoped reporters would ask but didn't.

<p>

So we've gone beyond the newscasts and ignored some of the true 
insights that they might uncover as <i>Straight Talk</i> brings 
you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

[Segment from Washington Briefing follows:]

<p>

QUESTION:  What can we do to get the truth out, and, number two,
why is it that our side of the story isn't being told, except
through underground mechanisms that some of us hear but nobody
else does?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  Some of us who have been up
there all this year have been fighting this battle since the day
we got there in trying the turn around the way the message is
communicated, what we say, what we do, and tell the truth about
what we're doing.  But we haven't been successful in convincing
the powers-to-be to get it done.  We aren't going to get it through
the national media. We have to pay for everything we get.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RADINOVICH: What we want to leave here is emphasizing 
the fact that we need help in the form of volunteer effort and money in
order to get the message out.  But in addition to that, pray Psalm
37 continuously, because within your sphere of influence, there
is likely to be, I wouldn't say unlimited but an uncharted amount
of time for prayer, and that works.  You sit down and you pray
that prayer about what's going on in this country; you will, on
your knees, turn that election around, and I want to just totally
emphasize that.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

QUESTION: The Speaker was named the Man of the Year, and he 
certainly has had a great deal of energy in the contract, and we 
don't hear much from him anymore.  Does he still have the support 
of the freshman class and the Republicans in Congress, and what 
role is he going to play in this next year?

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  Well, he does have support of the class.
I'll just say that.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  Yes, definitely.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  The freshmen are behind him.  There has
been a lot of media that has been trying to divide us and say
that there is a problem within the Republican leadership, and
so forth.  That is not the case.  Newt stepped back to do the
vision thing again, which is the Contract with America idea. 
That's what he is about.  That's what he's best at.  He has turned
leadership duties over to Dick Armey and rest of us who are in
leadership.  We all have liaison responsibilities with particular
bills that are coming on the floor.  That is something that hadn't
happened before.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE McINTOSH:  You'll see the freshman
class rise up in Newt's defense, and they will continue to try
to attack him, because he has verbalized and stood for the things
we believe in.  He, as Sue mentioned, is very consciously at this
point preparing for the next fall's election, and he realized
that during the Presidential primary it would be difficult for
us to have a lot of leadership coming out of the House of Representatives,
because people would be focused on choosing a nominee for the
party.  But if we laid the groundwork now, we could go forward
once the nominee is chosen or becomes apparent and work towards
this renewed agenda.

<p>

He came back and briefed all of us a few weeks ago after the break 
that this was his plan and how he was doing it, and we all went up to 
him and said, &quot;Let us help in any way possible, because we want 
to support exactly what you're doing there.&quot;

<p>

QUESTION:  This question may sound cynical, but I ask it in all 
sincerity.  You're only freshmen for one session, and this freshman 
class is so great.  How long will it be before your freshman class 
falls into lock-step with the old guard in Washington, and now we've 
got to count on more freshmen?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE MYRICK:  I think we probably all want to touch
on that one, but I will just say that we and those of us sitting
up here who are in freshmen leadership per se work very hard to
make sure that doesn't happen.  We kind of serve as each other's
conscience.  We prod each other.  One of the strengths we have
is that we're all willing to take on different issues, and somebody
will honcho a different issue, which is why we've been able to
do a lot, and that's very good.

<p>

But when we got here, we decided [that] together we were a force and 
we had some power, and if we weren't together, we were nothing; 
individually, we can do nothing. So we work very hard to keep us 
together, even when we are not freshmen.  Those of us who come back 
will do the same thing, and we will, hopefully, be able to work with 
the new freshmen coming in to make sure they do the same thing.

<p>

It is very important to us that we keep that mind-set.  We try to 
remind ourselves who we are, where we came from, and why we're here all 
the time.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE RADINOVICH:  I think most of the freshmen that
have come in really were remarkable in one thing, and that was
that, as Sue said, they let you know who they were, how they thought,
and what they intended to do.  We did that formally through the
signing of the Contract with America, which was on September 27,
1994, and the election was after that, on November 8, 1994.

<p>

So that is something -- if anything else represents the change
that we bring or the beach head that we have established inside
the beltway, or however you want to put it, [it] is the fact that
we were clearly about who we were so that the voters across this
country who are smart, not dumb, knew exactly what they were getting
when they went to the polls, instead of trying to paint yourself
into something and then coming here and doing something else.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents more from the Family Research Council's 1996 Washington Briefing.
What can we do to help in the fight for pro-family issues?  Former
Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey, a leading Democrat, shares
his ideas after this break. Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. Former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey began our
1996 Washington Briefing, taking on the pro-life debate from a
unique perspective.  Let's hear what Governor Casey has to say
as we share with you FRC's 1996 Washington Briefing.

<p>

GOVERNOR CASEY: When I was governor of Pennsylvania, and I finished 
my service there in January of 1995, I saw first hand the root cause
of most of the social dislocation in our country, and that, of
course, as you well know and as this organization has championed,
the dislocation flows from the disintegration of the American
family.  Unless we try to reconstitute, as all of you know so
well, try to reconstitute that institution called the American
family, America will continue in a downward spiral.

<p>

Now, that is not being apocalyptic; I think that is being quite accurate
in terms of where we are in America today.  And I would say, if
one thing has become crystal clear in 1996 in the debate thus
far in the Presidential sweepstakes in America, it is, from where
I sit at least, not just the economy; it is also the culture.
And those candidates out there with a single-track message, who
talk only about the economy, don't seem to last too long.  It's
not that people are not interested.  Of course, we're interested,
and people want to know where America is going and where the candidates
out there today propose to lead us.

<p>

I would like to suggest two directions today, not exclusive by any 
means but important.  Number one, I think we've got to make adoption a 
number one national priority in the United States of America.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And I want to tell you why.  I ran a major state, no different from 
New York, California, Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, you name it.  Thousands
of kids trapped in the foster care system; cost $10 billion, with
a B, $10 billion a year.  And all of the federal incentives, the
reimbursement systems, are in the direction of keeping those kids
in foster care, and they stay there too long, and when they leave,
they wind up too often either in the penitentiary or in the cemetery.

<p>

And why can't both parties stand up say, We disagree on a lot
of things, but there's one thing we can agree on, and that is
the most cost-effective, compassionate, effective alternative
for children in America today who find themselves trapped in foster
care is to make it easier for the adoption process to work, on
both the public side and the private side, so that the disincentives
in our federal reimbursement system are reversed in favor of urging
and giving incentives to states to take children out of foster
care and put them into adoptive homes where they will have a real
chance to be decent and law-abiding and happy and productive citizens.
Aggressive advocacy of adoption, I think, begins the process
of reconstituting the American family.

<p>

In my state of Pennsylvania in 1987, we joined with a group called One 
Church/One Child run by the Black Ministerium.  It began in Chicago and 
came to Pennsylvania. We teamed up with them at the state level, and 
over the next seven years, we placed 800 children, African-American 
children, in adoptive homes.  We began a new statewide initiative to 
press for adoption, to make it a top priority. We can do it and have to 
do it, it seems to me, at the national level.

<p>

Let me move now to a second proposal, and that is one with which 
you are very familiar:  Is America going to provide legal protection 
for the child or not? And how long do we have to wait?  We've waited 23 
years.  Another 25 years?  When is this debate engaged?  If not now, 
when, and if not you, us, well, then who?

<p>

Let me tell you what I am talking about.  We have an ideal opportunity 
right now, at a time of great spiritual and cultural renewal in this 
country, symbolized, I would submit to you, by the tremendous impact 
this organization and Gary Bauer and all of you have had in shaping 
public opinion in America.  I would commend to your reading this article 
here that I've brought with me today in the <i>Women's Quarterly</i>. 
It is written by a feminist, or at least a pro-choice person, whose
name is Candace C. Crandall.  It just came out.

<p>

She explains in this article why the pro-choice movement is suddenly 
playing defense. The title is -- you'll excuse me -- but &quot;The Fetus 
Beat Us.&quot; You see, we're winning this battle.  We're really winning
this battle.  It seems that too few of our own people realize
that we're winning this battle.

<p>

Look at some of the signs. The First Lady tells us abortion is wrong. 
<i>Newsweek</i> magazine. Kate Michaelman said that abortion is a 
&quot;bad thing,&quot; her words.  Henry Foster says that the 
abortion is a &quot;failure,&quot; his word, which he abhors. And 
Susan Estrich(?), who ran Mr. Dukakis' campaign, said, &quot;We're 
winning in the courts&quot; -- that is, the pro-choice side -- 
&quot;but losing in the streets.&quot;

<p>

Now, all of these signs and trends have made their demands on
the political system, and so in 1994, the Republican resurgence
in the Congress -- you've heard Mr. Steeper's(?) analysis of the
1994 returns when the number of people who voted for the Republican
Party in the congressional elections zoomed, catapulted, exploded,
from 27 million in 1990 to 36 million in 1994.

<p>

The Freedom of Choice Act went down the tubes, never got out of 
committee.  Medical schools aren't teaching young doctors about abortion 
anymore. Over 80 percent of the counties in America don't have abortion
clinics 23 years after <i>Roe v. Wade</i>. In 1994, pro-life 
congressional candidates won, by and large, and pro-choice candidates 
lost, by and large.

<p>

Two conclusions follow, from where I sit, from all
of this.  One, cultural issues are central to the emergence of
the Republican Party in the Congress of the United States, just
as they are, in my judgment, to the demise -- some would say the
disintegration -- of the Democratic Party at the national level.

<p>

The <i>New York Times</i> had a front-page story about two months ago
talking about the Democrats and the defections across the United
States at all levels, not just retirements in the Senate and the
Congress; in state legislatures, in local government all across
America.  I think this concern I am talking about here today is
what fundamentally drives that demise, because how can the party
which came into being and which prided itself on leaving no one
out and no one behind, prided itself on the protection of the
powerless, how can it write off -- since when did America write
off -- an entire class of people, especially the most vulnerable
of all, and say, &quot;There's nothing we can do.  The children
must die&quot;?

<p>

That's not America.  That's not who we are. That's not our American 
experience.  We've never accepted that before, except in one case in 
the 1860s when the Supreme Court said that African-Americans are 
non-persons; they have no rights. That mistake was corrected. The 
mistake of <i>Roe v. Wade</i> remains to be corrected. But it will 
be corrected, and it will be corrected, in my judgment, in our 
lifetime if we make this case and make it consistently and make it 
with passion and make it, if you'll excuse me, with a sense of outrage 
and say to the people of this country, &quot;What are they doing to 
America, when we have lost 30 million?&quot;

<p>

And what do we have to show for it? Are women more liberated or more 
free?  I ask you, when is a woman more free, when she is giving life 
or when she is taking it? And is America's true character to be found 
in an abortion clinic or in an adoptive home?  What is consistent 
with the essential goodness and decency of the American people?

<p>

I think our people understand that, and if we present it to them 
as a natural outgrowth of the American experience, of expanding the 
circle of the commonly protected and making the Declaration of 
Independence not just words on a page but words to live by, we're 
going to prevail, because I firmly believe that abortion is destined 
for the scrap heap of history. I believe that we've got to continue 
to speak for the child. And if we do, I believe this country will 
realize the potential that Jefferson had in mind when he said that 
these rights, the most important of which is the right to life, 
these rights come not from the state, not from the Congress, not 
from the Supreme Court, not from the state legislature, but from 
the hand of God.

<p>

That's the challenge that I leave with all of us here today.
Thank you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Please join us after the commercial break as we 
continue our 1996 Washington Briefing highlights with Rabbi 
Daniel Lapin.  You won't want to miss it.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>.  Rabbi Daniel Lapin is a strong advocate
of the preservation of America's families through Judeo-Christian-based
conservative values.  Rabbi Lapin has influenced many with his
commentaries on the socioeconomic trends that have shaped this
country.  Let's hear what he had to say to FRC's Washington Briefing
attendees.

<p>

RABBI LAPIN: There are two different views of America
today.  There is the view held by the Boy Scouts of America, by
Family Research Council, and by so many other Americans, actually
a majority of Americans, who still remember that it is duty, it
is faith, it is intellect.  It's doing what we know to be right,
not what we feel like doing.  And feelings, while very important,
come second.

<p>

Let us take a look for a moment at two organs that
the good Lord has provided us with.  He has provided us with eyes
and ears.  Let's ask ourselves for a moment which of those two,
eyes and ears, is the avenue to the emotions and which one is
the avenue to the mind and the intellect.  Think for a moment.

<p>

Gentlemen -- this is a quiz just for the gentlemen -- have you
or any other male whom you know, at the present or at any time
in the past, ever become involved with a woman in an utterly unsuitable
relationship that was destructive, painful, and going absolutely
nowhere?

<p>

[Laughter.]

You do not have to raise your hands for this one.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I will take the answer as a yes from virtually all of us. When that 
happened to this man we all know, when this happened, was it because 
of the way the woman looked, or was it because of the way the woman 
spoke over the phone? Eyes and ears stand clearly for an emotional 
dominance versus an intellectual or obligation/faith/duty-driven view 
of the world.

<p>

While America was driven by words and by the ear, we were a nation 
that was capable of weighing things out, looking at the long term, 
being careful about things.  But as soon as we turned into a nation
that gets most of its information through the eyes, look what
happens.  Everything changes, and we are now -- every single debate
today is framed in emotional terms, everything.

<p>

What about the children?  Hillary Clinton made an entire industry, with 
her friends, out of the children, because that is a wonderfully 
emotional picture, and nobody stops to think that children shouldn't be 
Hillary Clinton's problem; it should be their parents' problem.  And if 
she wants to help children, she should help the parents, not the children.
We don't need a direct line from the government to our children.
We want that line to go through us.

<p>

We don't need schools where teachers are told, &quot;Be certain that 
your children are encouraged not to tell their parents about this 
part of the program.&quot; That is what children are taught in 
public school today:  &quot;Don't tell your parents about this. 
They won't understand.&quot;  We don't need that. But in an 
emotionally driven society, it is very difficult to deal with that.

<p>

Now, emotional is short term. It's now.  I've got to do something 
about it.  There's somebody starving. There's somebody hungry. 
There's somebody out there who needs help.  And there is no cause to 
ask oneself, what is the long-term impact?  And this is why it is that 
otherwise well-intentioned people, intelligent people, even 
intellectual people, would go for the welfare system as it is, 
because it is only reasonable if you bring up onto my screen a 
wretched, miserable, suffering human being. Ladies and gentlemen, 
is there anybody in this room who wouldn't feel driven by compassion? 

<p>

But don't do that to me.  I resent it.  You are robbing me of an 
opportunity to weigh it up intellectually. I don't want the picture of 
the starving person in front of me while I weigh this up.  I want to be 
able to think clearly for a few minutes and evaluate what is the most
effective way to help this problem long term.  But as long as
you are wrenching at my emotions, I can't do anything about this.

<p>

And that's why it is, in the book of Numbers, chapter 15, &quot;And
you should not stray after your hearts and after your eyes.&quot;
Heart, if you think about it, heart is a metaphor for the emotions.
Don't stray, says Numbers chapter 15, don't stray after your
heart and don't stray after your eyes.  You must have a heart,
and you must enjoy your eyes, but that's not a way to make decisions.

<p>

And that is what is happening.  The Peter Jenningses and the Dan
Rathers of the world are emotionally driven; they are visually
driven.  And the consequence is [that it is] very difficult to
maintain stable structures in society, because emotions are short
term; intellect and duty are long term.

<p>

This is why it is that Washington, D.C., is absolutely filled with the 
most wonderful single women, who truly desire to be married and to 
raise families, and it is tough to find guys that are man enough for the 
job, because we have been turned into an emotionally driven society,
not an intellectually driven one, and emotional is short term.
Short term, there are no benefits in marriage, particularly with
the wonders of the sex revolution that says that premarital sex
is just fine.

<p>

You have now eliminated the last possible, conceivable
-- well, that is perhaps not a good choice of word -- the last
possible reason why any man driven by short-term emotionalism
should ever contemplate marriage.  It's not possible.  Only with
the long-term view is that possible.

<p>

Now, what is the counter? If, indeed, we have become a society driven 
by the eye, driven by emotionalism, driven by the short term, that that 
is the final argument -- listen to our politicians sometimes; listen 
to public speakers.  You provide an emotional reason, and that's it. 
Everybody's satisfied.  That's the end of it.  It's non-refutable. You 
can't do anything about it.

<p>

This very hotel is running a campaign to add onto your bill for 
UNICEF, and there are pictures of children in need. It's tough. But 
you know something?  I'm not going to do it, because I am not 
convinced that the United Nations best knows how to make sure that 
that money goes into the tummy of a starving child instead of into 
that of a bloated bureaucrat.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

And so there needs to be a restoration of the intellectual
faith aspect of life.  We've got to rebuild that, and I have two
very specific recommendations for you, two very specific recommendations,
recommendations that you can carry out with you to your families,
to your friends, to your neighborhoods, and above all convey these
ideas, if you would.  Tell them your rabbi sent you.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Convey these ideas as a proud religious conservative.  Let's come
out of the closet.  It seems everyone else has.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

There's nothing wrong with saying, &quot;I am a religious conservative,
and it is my religious belief that fuels my ideas,&quot; because
politics, ladies and gentlemen, is wonderful.  Politics is what
enables us to live with one another in spite of differences without
resorting to guns and fists.  We can talk our differences through.
And politics is nothing but applied values, and we must be proud
to say where our values come from, because there is no other way
to combat the drive of the heart which we should not follow, the
drive of the eyes which we should not follow.

<p>

And so my specific two recommendations are:  number one, reduce your 
TV watching by at least half an hour a day.  Now, just to give you the 
figures here, ladies and gentlemen, I have done this calculation over
and over and over again.  I can't believe it myself, but believe
me, it is true.  If you methodically cut out half an hour a day
of television watching, which I am sure every one of us can do,
you gain, over the next decade, six months of productive time.
Six months. Do you know what you and I could do with six months
of productive waking time?  That is the time that half an hour
a day of television will buy you.

<p>

But it buys you something much more urgent than that, and that 
is a reduction in your visual input, and it gives you an opportunity 
to get a little bit more verbal input, which is more balanced. How 
do you do that?  Practice conversation. Encourage people -- do you 
know that there are Americans that have the television on during 
family dinner? Don't do it. It's terrible.

<p>

Those are my two suggestions:  half an hour less television a day 
and only conversation when the family is together. It's going to 
be very tough, because a society that has overwhelmed itself with 
emotionalism and with imagery and with eye-driven content is going 
to find it very difficult to converse. Have you noticed that? People 
are awkward when there's nothing on and we are reduced to nothing 
but conversation.  We have lost the art, and it can come back.

<p>

And, fortunately, we have such a ready source of material to bring 
it back, and that's the Bible. There is something to talk about. 
There is something to talk about, and there is a way of latching 
onto any aspect of events of the day and using the time to analyze them 
from an intellectual point of view with no pictures.  Expose your children
to that.  Encourage other people to do the same.  It's a wonderfully
exciting experience.  But apart from the pleasure it brings, it
reduces the visual input, which makes the participants that much
less an emotional crowd.

<p>

And, ladies and gentlemen, I believe, as these crashing waves of 
cultural chaos threaten to engulf the very civilization that has bred 
us, it is only going to be a traditional Judeo-Christian vision of 
society, made possible by all of you here today, that is going to 
restore the health of our great country. And it will. It will because 
we are at the very beginning of America's third great religious 
reawakening.

<p>

The first one, in the early 18th century, brought about American 
independence. The second one, in the 1800s, laid the groundwork for 
the abolition of slavery.  And the third one, ladies and gentlemen, 
that we are right in the middle of right now is the one that is going
to restore the moral, cultural, and economic health of our blessed
land.  Tell them your rabbi said so.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will share more 
of the 1996 Washington Briefing as we hear from Oklahoma Senator Don 
Nickles.  He shares some exciting changes he hopes to accomplish in 
the upcoming months. Please join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. The 1996 Washington Briefing allowed us to hear 
from those in government who are ardently fighting for America's 
families.

<p>

Senator Don Nickles is a real leader.  We now share with you 
his perspectives on current issues pending on the Senate floor and
how those issues affect you and your family.

<p>

SENATOR NICKLES: I want to talk to you about a whole bunch of issues 
that are kind of pending, and I will go kind of fast and talk about 
those and encourage your involvement and encourage your input, because
a lot of these are very important to families, one of which, I
am just going to say, is one of our biggest items.

<p>

Many of us believe very strongly in balancing the budget, and we believe
we should not spend more than we take, and you say, &quot;Why?&quot;
Well, that is economic policy and that is prudent and that is
fiscal.  I will tell you, I think it is vitally important for
our kids.  I don't think it is morally responsible to be leaving
our children with decades and billions and now trillions of dollars
of unfunded debt that we have put on their shoulders.  So I think
it is high time -- well past time, frankly -- for us to balance
the budget and quit laying more additional debt on our children.
That is what the fight is for.  It is, are we going to morally
responsible?

<p>

We live in the greatest and the freest county in the history of 
mankind. That is a real blessing. God has blessed us. But we see a 
lot of challenges and in some cases some actions
that are taken either by President Clinton or maybe by Congress
that infringe on our freedom.  Maybe it is excessive debt.  Maybe
it is policies that are coming down from the administration that
really infringe on what I would call a family-friendly environment.
And when we see that, I think we have a real obligation to stand
up and say, &quot;Wait a minute.  That's wrong.&quot;

<p>

You know, it is not just fiscal issues.  I will just give you an 
example: welfare. Unfortunately, President Clinton vetoed two welfare
reform bills.  He campaigned that we need to end welfare as we
know it, and he always got applause.  I was one that was applauding.
We need to.  We have 334 federally defined welfare programs,
means-tested welfare programs:  if you meet this criteria, you
get the benefit.

<p>

We don't think that makes a lot of sense. A lot of us say, &quot;Wait 
a minute.&quot;  These government welfare programs are well 
intentioned; good intentions.  I don't fault the intentions of the 
authors of the proposals.  But what you have is program stacked on 
program on top of other programs, and the net result is that we have 
created a welfare dependency cycle where people are looking to 
government as their sole source of solutions to problems instead of 
to families, instead of to communities. Instead of developing an 
interest in trying to climb that economic ladder, they say, 
&quot;Give me a handout.&quot;  We have almost created a generational 
welfare dependency cycle.

<p>

We are going to have a debate before too long on minimum wage.  I am 
going to oppose their efforts.  And you say, &quot;Well, why?&quot;
Hey, I used to make minimum wage.  My wife and I have been married
now 27 years; she has still put up with me.  Our first jobs, we
both made minimum wage.  And, frankly, it wasn't enough.  President
Clinton and others say, &quot;Oh, no, we think it should be against
the law for you to have a job unless you pay such-and-such,&quot;
and therefore pricing some jobs out.  Maybe it is that janitor
service, maybe it is pumping gas, maybe it is sacking groceries.

<p>

But that might be that 16-year-old in Chicago that has some
open time during the summer, and so if he can't get a job, what
is he going to do?  And a lot of times people end up in the wrong
environment.  Instead of doing something good and positive, maybe
a job, and saying, &quot;Hey, this job doesn't pay enough, I need
to learn more, I need to get a better education, I need better
training so I can get a better job,&quot; they end up involved
in drugs or in crime, and so on.  And so to me that is an important
issue.

<p>

It is an important issue when we talk about crime. Unfortunately,
I notice President Clinton has got maybe an election year conversion.
He is starting to talk about his war on the drugs.  We just did
two papers talking about Clinton's about-face on the war on drugs.
He is now going to increase funding for the Office of National
Drug Control Policy.  What he didn't tell you [was] that in 1993
he reduced the office from 146 employees to 25.  What he didn't
tell you [was] he cut the office by over 80 percent in 1993; he
totally gutted the office.

<p>

When you talk about family values, it is interesting. You remember 
the Clintonites just ridiculed Vice President Quayle when he started 
talking about family values. Let me tell you something. Dan Quayle 
was right, and welcome aboard the Clintonites and others when you 
start talking about family values.  Family values are important.

<p>

I urge you to get involved.  I urge you to get involved in these 
campaigns, whether for House members or for Senators or for the 
President of the United States.  It is critically important, and it 
is not just so you can elect more Republicans.  I am a partisan 
Republican. I am chairman of the Policy Committee, and so on.

<p>

Find out where people stand on issues.  I will be very comfortable if 
this group will go out and find out where people stand on issues, 
regardless of party.  I will be very comfortable with whoever you support.
You find people that have character, people that believe in family
values, people that really think as you do on a lot of these issues,
whether you are talking about abortion, whether you are talking
about gays in the military, whether you are talking about who
should be surgeon general, who should be appointed to the Supreme
Court.

<p>

These are awfully important issues.  These are issues
of life and death.  These are issues that deal with the future
of our kids and our grandkids, so they can come back and say,
&quot;Yes, we really do thank God for the fact that we live in
the United States of America, because it is still the greatest
and the freest country in the history of mankind.&quot;

<p>

Thank you very much. God bless you.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> gives you a look 
at issues being battled by our very own Family Research Council staff. 
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk</i>. The Family Research 
Council staff works diligently to positively shape issues affecting 
today's families, from pro-life issues to cyberporn to gay marriage. 

<p>

FRC briefing attendees wanted to know some specifics on those issues, 
so they asked our staff. Let's hear those questions and answers on 
tonight's Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

STAFF MEMBER: It would seem like to me -- and I guess this is to Bob 
Knight and Bob Maginnis -- that a President that has pushed the 
homosexual issue as strongly as he has, that in itself would be enough 
to defeat a President, and I wonder why we haven't been stronger
on that, to use that against him.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  One problem is you don't see too many opposition 
figures out there in front on this issue, frankly.  It's a hard sell 
for us in Washington to persuade people to take it on, even though it 
is a clear winner with the American people.

<p>

Right now the Republican nominee will have a terrific opportunity 
to delineate the differences between the two parties should he 
choose to do so, and that is by taking up the gay marriage issue. That 
is going to be a monumental issue in this country during this year, 
during this election year.

<p>

You have to ask yourself how many politicians would want to be in
the position of voting against laws that uphold traditional marriage
during an election year.  I mean, this is a gift to anybody who
wants to take it up, and yet we frankly have been meeting opposition.

<p>

We are hoping that will change this year, because the marriage
issue is a winner.  The polls show that 71 percent of the people
in the state of Hawaii are against gay marriage, liberal Hawaii.
Polls show similar figures for the nation as a whole.  And given
that this is after about 10 years of mainstream media propaganda
about homosexuality with almost no answering except the work we
have done and some other groups, once the issue is joined and
the facts are out on the table, I can only imagine that those
figures will rise.

<p>

So the real problem is we need some leadership in the political 
realm to take up the cause that we know all Americans would 
respond to.

<p>

COL. MAGINNIS:  It has only been the Family Research Council -- and 
I can say that without any reservation -- that has really led the 
charge on this issue, that has held the fort.  We have been in the 
courts, and we are the only organization in the courts in this 
country battling the issue of homosexuals in the military.

<p>

One of these cases, probably the <i>Thomasson</i> or the 
<i>Abel</i>(?) case, will go to the Supreme Court this fall, and
we will have a decision this time next year which will tell us
what the Supreme Court thinks about this issue.  What the Supreme
Court tells us about this issue will have just about as much significance
as what they tell us about the Second Amendment out in Colorado.
Probably it is going to have a lot to do with some of what Bob
just outlined in regard to single-gender marriage, because they
cite all these military cases as evidence that there is no problem
with this.

<p>

I will tell you that the people on the Hill -- and
I have talked to a lot of them on this issue -- they run from
it because they are afraid of it.  People in the military -- I
talked to the chief of staff of the Army and to most of the senior
leadership.  They ran from it.  There are only a few people that
are willing to stand up and tell the truth.

<p>

STAFF MEMBER: I just wonder what is being done to get pornography off 
of the Internet.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Just in January, as part of the large Telecommunications
Reform Act of 1996, we had the Communications Decency Act, which
is specifically designed to deal with the accessibility of pornography
on the Internet.  So that was passed, and that was a huge victory
for us.  We worked for a long time on that, with other groups
as well.

<p>

Immediately after President Clinton signed the act, though,
the ACLU filed suit against the Communications Decency Act, saying
it was unconstitutional, and I am traveling to Philadelphia at
the end of this week for the trial in that case.

<p>

The ACLU thinks it is unconstitutional because they think any 
restriction on anything that can remotely be called speech or expression 
is unconstitutional. They are wrong, and they usually lose, and we 
expect that they will lose in this case, too.

<p>

What the CDA does is says that mild pornography, which adults have a 
constitutional right to get -- we don't like that, but that is the state 
of the law -- cannot be given to children, and that is on firm legal 
grounds. So the CDA is well within constitutional precedent, and we 
think it is going to be upheld.

<p>

Does that mean that there will be no pornography on the Internet? 
No, that is not what that means, because pornography laws are broken 
every day.  But the fact is, there will be ground rules, and there 
will be a law that a prosecutor can use to prosecute people who violate 
this new law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares more of our annual Family Research Council's Washington Briefing. 
The 1996 briefing included nationally known speakers who informed FRC 
constituents about the most current and controversial events.  Key among 
the speakers were leading Senators and Congressmen detailing issues
affecting America's families.

<p>

The FRC Washington Briefing was also a wonderful reminder that the 
pro-family battle is not exclusively fought inside the beltway. Leaders 
from across our nation maintain the standards that ensure family values 
are not lost in today's societies. You will enjoy this exchange of 
national and front-line leaders in this briefing highlight.

<p>

But to begin, let's hear Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum's insight 
into what actually happens on the House and Senate floors.  For you 
C-SPAN junkies, the congressional voting process may seem routine, 
but for many the congressional language sounds foreign.  So Senator 
Rick Santorum provides a clear definition of that language and what 
changes need to be made so that our representatives can efficiently 
and effectively make positive decisions for American citizens.

<p>

To learn more, <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes you Behind the Headlines.

<p>

[Segment from 1996 Washington Briefing follows:]

<p>

SENATOR SANTORUM:  What makes the Senate slower than
the House?  It is called a filibuster.  I was in the House four
years; I have been in the Senate now a year and two months, although
it seems like I have been in the Senate four years, because we
just spend that much more time on the floor in debate and deliberation.

<p>

In the House, majority rules.  If you have 51 percent of the vote,
you can do anything you want in the House of Representatives,
anything.  You have something called a Rules Committee in the
House, which, every time a bill comes to the floor of the House,
there is a rule that comes with it that limits debate and limits
amendments.  If you want to offer an amendment on the floor of
the House, by and large, you have to get permission from the Rules
Committee to do so.  And if you don't get permission, you can't
offer the amendment.

<p>

So it is very much a majority-ruled and controlled
body.  The Rules Committee has nine Republicans and four Democrats.
So even if we lose one or two of our own, we still win.  So it
is very hard for the leader -- and the leader puts people who
are going to follow the leader on the Rules Committee.  So you
really have absolute control over it.

<p>

In the Senate, every bill that comes up, you can offer an amendment, 
whether it is germane or not germane.  We can be debating 
telecommunications, and we can have an amendment that deals with the 
Bosnian war; just no relevance at all.  And they can continue to offer 
it. Every day they can offer the same amendment.  Every bill that comes 
up, we can deal with the same amendment.  Many times we do deal with
a lot of the same.  Senator Wellstone has one of his favorite
amendments.  He offers it all the time.  We voted on it 10, 12
times.  But that can happen in the Senate.

<p>

Also, we have to have 60 votes to pass a bill.  Now, it only takes 51 
to pass, but to get to the passage, get to the vote on final passage, 
you usually have to break, at least in this Congress, we usually have 
to break a filibuster, which means we need 60 votes.  So we have to 
have 60 votes to get to passage, which really means you need 60 votes
to pass a bill, and you have this unlimited amendment which will
delay things for a long, long, long time.  So that is the problem.

<p>

The solution is actually a very simple solution, and that is get
60 Republican Senators.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents more from the Family Research Council's
1996 Washington Briefing, as we hear how we can make a difference
in reforming our current welfare system.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. At the 1996 Washington Briefing, Senator Dan
Coats spoke of hope and vision for truly impacting Americans who
are in need.  Let's hear how we can help transform lives and revive
our communities.

<p>

SENATOR COATS:  Something that has just been a passion of mine and 
something that I have been working on for nearly a decade is an issue 
that addresses not necessarily the political side of the question but 
the moral and spiritual side of the question.

<p>

I am encouraged from the standpoint that America today is talking 
about not only the failure of big government to address our problems 
but beginning to seriously examine the moral and spiritual and 
cultural decline that is taking place in this nation and beginning 
to ask questions about how we can revive the role of the family, 
the role of the church, the role of the spiritual involvement and 
values in terms of education, in terms of who we are as a people.

<p>

We are beginning to read in what normally would be considered liberal 
publications, we are beginning to hear from people who normally would 
be labeled as coming more from the liberal side, that the failure of 
the secular approach, the big government approach, must lead us to an 
examination of whether or not we can identify other successful 
approaches; and I am encouraged that that debate has begun.

<p>

Ten years ago, as the Republican leader of the Children, Youth, and 
Families Committee in the House of Representatives, I began, along with
some others, to look at the role of the government in addressing
some of these fundamental needs that exist in our society today.

<p>

That committee, in its first year of existence, traveled around
the country attempting to elicit from individuals speaking before
our panel identification of the problem and solutions to the problem.
And everywhere we went, it seemed that no matter who came before
us to propose the solutions, the bottom line of what they proposed
was more of the same.  &quot;Oh, this program could be effective
if we had some more funds to enlarge it, to broaden it, to reach
out.  No, we don't have positive statistics to give you right
now in terms of outcome, but if we could put more money into the
program, if we could put more effort -- and, by the way, we don't
have the money here, so you need to send it from Washington&quot;
-- everywhere we went in the country, no matter whom we talked
to -- rural, suburban, inner city, or whatever -- all the experts
came before us and said more of the same.

<p>

It was at one of our last hearings in Macon, Georgia, on the subject 
of the rural southern youth and the problems that they were 
experiencing, that the very last panelist to appear before our 
committee before we rushed back to Atlanta to get on a plane to come 
back to Washington was a humble black minister from the Macedonian 
Missionary Church of Waycross, Georgia.  I don't know how he got on 
the panel. I don't know who invited him.  I didn't know why he was 
there.

<p>

Rev. McKinney, as some of the members and staff were starting
to pack up their papers to get ready to go back to Atlanta, presented
some of the most eloquent testimony that hit the nail right on
the head.  He looked at us and said, &quot;I've been listening
all day, and what you Congressmen and women don't seem to understand
is that the problems that I have to deal with with the youth of
my area, mostly low income, mostly black, that's true,&quot; he
said, &quot;but the problems I deal with are the same as the problems
everywhere.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;Those problems don't just result
from a lack of good housing, from a lack of good programs, from
a lack of schools, lack of education.&quot;  He said, &quot;Those
problems go deeper than that.  What you Congressmen don't seem
to understand is that if we want to heal individuals, we have
to touch the whole person.&quot;  He said, &quot;Government can't
do that.  You see,&quot; he said, &quot;all of us are made up
of not just body and mind but soul and spirit, and if we can't
redeem and heal soul and spirit, no matter how much money you
pour into programs, no matter how many bureaucracies you establish,
no matter how many programs you send to us,&quot; he said, &quot;all
the money in the world will not solve the problems of these people,
because we have to heal their soul and spirit as well as address
the problems of body and mind.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;These young girls that come to me with child, no 
father taking responsibility,&quot; he said, &quot;they're looking 
for something to love.  They are looking for something that is much 
deeper than can be solved by a government program.  And these young 
black boys that come that have been fathering kids all over the 
community, they're looking for something to prove that they are a 
man.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;That is why you must begin to examine how we can utilize 
the role of the church, the role of the family, the role of charity and 
private organizations outside of government which can bring these 
spiritual values to bear on a spiritual problem.&quot;

<p>

From that point forward, I began the process of attempting to identify 
ways in which the government could shift its emphasis from government 
programs which can't address soul and spirit to programs that can address 
soul and spirit.  I realize that you have to get beyond government.
We have to find a way to utilize institutions that are not government
institutions so that those institutions can bring to bear the
spiritual content and effort that can truly make a difference
in lives that are hurting, that can reclaim lives and redeem lives.

<p>

I have examined programs across the country that are reaching
out and solving intractable problems by injecting a spiritual
renewal and a vision of hope and redemption in the people that
they reach out to.

<p>

All of that led to the culmination and development
of a program called Project for American Renewal that I have worked
on intensely for the past year and a half, pulling together a
number of ways in which the government can begin the process of
shifting from the public sector to the private sector, ways which
do not violate the Constitution in terms of government involvement,
but energizing those organizations and those entities, those institutions
that can truly reclaim our communities, pull families back together,
reclaim lives, and bring spiritual and moral values to the programs
that they engage in.

<p>

Heart and soul of it all, though, is a charity
tax credit which allows every taxpayer in America to make a choice.
You can send up to $1,000 of your taxes that are due to the Federal
Government, or if you have more confidence in your local church
program or your local charity or your local faith-based organization,
you can designate that $1,000 to that organization and offset
it against those taxes due.

<p>

The bottom line: provide a hope and a vision for renewal of American 
society, for bringing families back together, for reuniting communities, 
for involving faith-based charities and involving the church in ways 
that provide redeeming, life-transforming, real help to people that 
are in need.

<p>

I think our party needs that vision.  I think we need to 
stand for more than just simply more of the same.  We don't know what 
to do except pour more money into the Washington institutions or simply 
wash our hands of the problem and say, &quot;Well, we just hope it
works itself out.  Government can't do it, but we don't know who
can.&quot;

<p>

We know who can.  We know who brings the hope of change,
the hope of redemption, the hope that touches soul and spirit
as well as body and mind.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Please join us after the commercial break as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> continues our 1996 Family Research Council Washington Briefing 
highlights.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Washington State has a lot to be proud of in electing Congresswoman 
Linda Smith.  As a freshman, she has taken an extremely unpopular 
stance on making radical but, many believe, needed changes to 
government as we know it.

<p>

REPRESENTATIVE SMITH: In this envelope are all the invitations of the 
nighttime events I could go to.  I can go to a Rock the House if I am 
a lobbyist and want to pay $500.  And I can go to a California Fiesta.
This is just the events I could go to each night from about 5
to 10 o'clock instead of reading the bills.

<p>

So when I got here and I got these, I go, &quot;Now, ooh, I didn't 
bargain for that.&quot; Of course, as a two-week write-in candidate, 
I didn't bargain for much of anything.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I am not a Republican first, though. I know where my source is. And 
so when I got to Congress as a write-in candidate, I looked at the 
place, I looked at those invitations that I got each night, and I 
couldn't do it.

<p>

The first invitation, I looked and here were the names of the 
committees on it, and at the bottom it said, &quot;PACs, $500.&quot; 
I picked up the next one.  It said, &quot;PACs, $1,000.&quot;  And 
then I went into training, and I found out I was expected to spend
three to five nights a week, three to five hours a night, going
to these events to raise money for my colleagues, and they would
do it for me, and the invitations were sent to the PACs and special-interest
groups that surround this place.

<p>

I decided I wouldn't do it for a very functional reason.  I didn't have 
three to five hours a day.  I hadn't run.  God had put me here.  Some 
people have spent two years, but I spent two weeks. And while I was 
here, I was going to get the job done, really kind of basic stuff.

<p>

But I went to a couple of receptions, and I realized not only could I 
not do that; I couldn't go.  Now, I am not holier than thou.  I have
run a corporation; I have been in the business community for years;
I have been in politics.  I am not a neophyte to this.  But the
first time one of the lobbyists came up to me and leaned towards
me and said, &quot;I was a friend in your last election,&quot;
I realized we had two languages, the language out in the real
world and here.

<p>

What that means is he had given me money into
my election, and he went right on to say, after he said, &quot;I
was a friend in your last election&quot; -- that means I gave
you a contribution; that's the translation -- he went on to tell
me what they wanted that was right on the floor right then. And
I go, &quot;Oh, this is really close.&quot;

<p>

Then I realized that what was happening is there are fund-raisers all 
around every night, Democrat and Republican, probably a dozen or more 
every night.  That's where the lobbyists go.  They pay to get in, $500
to $1,000, for members for their war chests -- that means money
you accumulate from special interests to make sure nobody runs
against you -- and that that was just an atmosphere where they
could come and find a certain number of members every night to
lobby the bill on the floor.  We were in session just about every
night, and we ran back and forth between these events and voted
and went back and forth.

<p>

I watched what was happening to these families, and I am not saying 
that they are all breaking up, but it will be amazing if they don't. 
Here was dad at these receptions every night, or mom, mostly dads, 
three to five nights a week, with everyone telling you you're wonderful 
-- of course, they want something -- giving you money, and then these 
families were having to figure out how to get home on the weekends, and 
if they got home on the weekends, how they were spreading their time 
between their family and their district, or moving their family here and
then having to choose between the district or the family here.
Bad situation.

<p>

I looked at this and thought, Now, why did God
put me here?  I don't believe God makes mistakes.  I was so overwhelmed
by it, and I don't mean losing control, I mean just I can't believe
this place operates this way.  I started looking and going, &quot;Why?
Why, with good people coming here, does it happen?&quot;

<p>

This is the way it happens, and I figured it out.  It's a trap.  Good
people get here.  They stay good, but they have to harden a little
bit to stay in it.  Now, some folks say, &quot;That's not fair,
Linda; it doesn't affect me.&quot;  I'll give them that.  Maybe
a few people it doesn't affect. But as soon as they get here,
this is what happens.  They arrange one of those events for you.
On it they put the committees that you are on; in fact, they
put the freshmen on key committees to raise money.  They then
call on the name of the chair and the committee, and they will
do this if you're a lobbyist, and they have your staff doing it
at night, and you pay people to do it, and volunteers do it.

<p>

Let's say that you're a lobbyist.  They will call you and they will
say, &quot;Hi.  I'm calling tonight.  I didn't see your name on
Linda Smith's event tomorrow night,&quot; the fiesta, California
Fiesta or whatever.  They make it sound like a party.  Who pays
$500 to go to that kind of party?  And then they pause.  I mean,
it is all scripted.  &quot;Well, are you coming?&quot;  They say
something about being busy.  &quot;Well, have you sent your check?&quot;

<p>

Now, this is just the way it goes, and not occasionally; that
is the scripting.  Tell me it's not affecting this place.  It
is affecting this place.  And even if you somehow in your heart
can feel it doesn't affect you, it does affect this place.

<p>

So when I decided that we couldn't do that, I started accumulating
all the invitations, and I realized that the committees are on
all of them.  The chairmen of the committees support you on them,
and you have four, and if you have four, you are going to need
to go to several hundred.  If you go to several hundred, how do
you get your work done?  How do you see your family?

<p>

So what we are calling for is a bill that basically terminates the 
flow of money here.  I want to tell you, it is not a partisan thing.
It is not a Democrat thing.  They built the system up real good.
And it's not a Republican thing.  We got the system.  But it
is a system that I don't believe will allow us to balance the
budget.

<p>

I have watched each appropriation bill come to the floor,
one by one, and I have watched the fight over such things as the
National Endowment for the Arts.  Now, even if you support the
National Endowment for the Arts, should it be added to our debt
each year, being that we are spending 20 percent more than is
coming in every year?  It would make sense that would go first,
wouldn't it?

<p>

What about the tobacco subsidy?  Some of these things
make sense they would go first, wouldn't they?  Do you know that
we couldn't take them out?  Now let's go to sugar subsidy, let's
go to tobacco subsidy, peanut subsidy. But they contribute a whale
of a lot of money around here.

<p>

Now, most people would say, &quot;They only support us because we 
are philosophically with them.&quot; Well, they were philosophically 
with the Democrats last year, then, because most of the groups gave 
two to one to the Democrats, and as soon as we took control, now they 
give two to one to the Republicans.  It is amazing how they philosophically 
shifted all in one year, isn't it?

<p>

Now, the big problem is right now we didn't build it, it isn't our 
fault, but we're in it.  So you're asking a lot of people to change a 
system in the middle of a war.  It would be like asking our freshmen to 
lay down their arms in the middle of a war when their opponents are coming 
in here and raising money, because this is a war for this century. I mean, 
this is going to be whether or not we change America.

<p>

So you have the freshman Republicans, especially, coming in and saying 
we're going to clean up the system, but they are terrified of not having 
enough money with a Democrat coming up against them, and it is mostly
that direction.

<p>

So here they are.  They look like a hypocrite if they stay in the 
system and talk against it, if they use it, but they know they're 
going to be got.

<p>

Now, I have a belief. It is called a Daniel standard, and that is 
what frustrates people. Once I get to the point where I believe it's 
wrong, I don't care where God sends me, I am going to go into that land 
and I am going to follow that standard.  Daniel went in and he didn't 
eat off the table.  But what did he do?  He trusted in God for his 
provision.

<p>

Now, what we would do here is, we come in, we have a choice.
Do we follow the way of this place, pretend it doesn't affect
us -- and maybe some people it doesn't -- or do we say, &quot;I'm
not going to do it.&quot;  I don't believe everyone is called
to the same standard.  I believe they are called to right as God
shows them, but sometimes He will show you right a little before
me because He is working on me somewhere else.  I believe it is
wrong to the point where I cannot hold fund-raisers here.  I can't
do it.  You only start believing you can do it when you get here.
The real world out there doesn't think it's the right thing to
do normally.

<p>

What we're doing with the measure that I am trying
to pass is just saying, let's change the system.  I am not even
asking that we change it in the middle of this war.  I am not
asking for a Daniel standard.  All I am saying is let's vote now
and not send any more freshmen into the system, not have them
have to look you in the eye and say, &quot;Yes, I took $10,000
from the tobacco lobby, but it didn't make any difference.&quot;
That is a horrible thing.

<p>

We are just saying, at the end of this year, change it. Change the 
system.  And then, I believe, when we come back, people are going to 
trust us to make those tough decisions.  But right now they look at it 
and it is all muddled, and they go, &quot;How can we trust people when 
this is happening?&quot;

<p>

We could lose our system, I believe, by the 
lack of trust in it and what we are doing here.  I believe it is a fight 
for the Democratic system, and I think it is also a fight for whether we 
have a balanced budget, because you remember all those balanced budget 
things, they are seven years long, at least.  But every year the 
lobbyists around this place -- not bad people; they would probably like
to go home to their families, too -- every year, the special interests
grow.  There are 14,000 lobbyists.

<p>

Do you really think -- and I will leave you with this -- that by the 
end of the seven years, we can really balance the budget, with the 
amount of special-interest money that flows to this place?  I don't. For 
me to keep my word to my district to go in and balance the budget and to 
clean the system up, I have to do what I'm doing.  I don't have any 
choice.

<p>

So you will see me standing and saying, &quot;If the Republicans
are doing it, they are wrong.  If the Democrats are doing it,
they are wrong.&quot;  The situation does not dictate that this
is right because the Republicans are in control.  And in fact,
because I think God raised us up in a different way, a lot of
us miraculously, we have a greater responsibility.  People are
looking to us and saying, &quot;Is this Congress going to be different?
Is it going to be different than the old one that built a shroud
of protection around itself and became elite, or are they going
to be really a Congress of the people?&quot;  And I believe that
we have a much greater chance of preserving this democracy if
we are a Congress of the people, but I know we have to follow
God's word.

MS. HAMRICK:  We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. Robert Novak can often
be seen on CNN's <i>Capital Gang</i> and <i>Crossfire</i>, and one 
guarantee from Mr. Novak: he's not shy when it comes to voicing his 
opinions, which he shared at the 1996 FRC Washington Briefing.

<p>

MR. NOVAK: As I go around the country, Republicans are dispirited. 
One year after they were in ecstacy, conservatives are worried.  How
did that happen?  How did it happen?  In fact, in a time when
I think the world is getting more and more conservative, when
the efficacy of government and the reliance on politics is declining
in every corner of the world, we have what is the most liberal
President we have ever had in the United States.

<p>

How did Bill Clinton get elected in the first place?  Well, we had a 
three-way race and President Bush broke his word on taxes.  And something
else.  There was something positive that President Clinton did.
Bill Clinton and his running mate went around the country, two
bubbas on a bus, telling people that they were a new kind of Democrats;
they didn't believe in too much government, too much taxation.
They were populists.

<p>

You know, I got a kick out of Al Gore calling
himself a populist.  I have known Al Gore since he was 12 years
old.  How did I know him when he was 12 years old?  Well, his
daddy, Albert Gore, Sr., was a U.S. Senator when I covered the
Senate for the <i>Wall Street Journal</i> a long time ago.  I was pleased
to be a guest in their home.  They lived, they had an apartment
in the Fairfax Hotel, where little Al grew up.  The Fairfax Hotel
was partially owned by the Gore family, and today the Fairfax
Hotel, if you want to go looking for it to see a historic site,
is the Ritz Carlton Hotel.  And, you know, ladies and gentlemen,
there are very, very few populists who grow up in the Ritz Carlton
Hotel.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Little Al went on to St. Alban's, which is the fanciest prep school 
in Washington, and from there he went to Harvard, where I am told he 
studied Southern as a foreign language.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Now, Bill Clinton didn't need to develop his southern
accent.  But populist?  Georgetown School of Foreign Service,
then to Oxford, Rhodes Scholar, back to Yale Law School, where
he met Hillary Rodham; and together they went to Texas, where
they ran the McGovern for President campaign in Texas, which was
one of the 49 states that George McGovern failed to carry for
President in 1972.

<p>

After that they got married, went to Arkansas,
and Bill ran for Congress, was defeated; ran for state attorney
general, was elected; ran for governor, was elected; defeated
for reelection the first time out, then came back and won three
terms as governor; and then, first crack out of the box, ran for
President and was elected.  Very unusual to do it the first time,
the point being that President Clinton has spent almost his entire
life either running for office or serving in office, and in fact,
most of the people in his administration, contrary to all the
evidence of the 20th century, believe that government is the solution
and not the problem.  This is -- and I have been through the New
Frontier, the Great Society, Jimmy Carter -- he didn't have a
name, thank goodness -- and this is the most liberal administration,
by far.

<p>

Our newsletter which we are writing this week, we have
done a state-by-state analysis on what would happen if the election
were held today.  You know, there is a kind of euphoria among
Republicans.  They think that even though they are behind in the
popular vote, they are going to win the electoral vote.  It doesn't
happen, friends.  If the election were held today, President Clinton
would win by an electoral vote majority of -- we haven't done
the final numbers, but I think it is going to be about 130 votes
in the Electoral College.

<p>

Now, does that mean that it's over; we can go home?  Would that I 
wouldn't have to suffer through this eight-month campaign.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But, no, there's a lot of pitfalls for the President.  Pitfall number 
one is Bosnia. Yes, there are 40,000 troops in Bosnia.  The bad news 
in Bosnia is that the snow is melting, the weather is spring, and maybe
these Balkan lunatics are going to start killing each other again
and our troops will get in the way.  I pray that that doesn't
happen, and I know you all pray that, too.

<p>

But, politically, there is very little margin of error for the President. 
He wants to get these troops out quick.  Let the Muslims and the Serbs
and the Croats start killing each other again.  Nothing is going
to be solved by our being there.  But let's get them out, because
the American people didn't want them there in the first place;
they still don't want them there in the first place; and Congress
didn't want them there in the first place, but they succumbed.

<p>

The second pitfall is Whitewater.  Whitewater won't go away. 
A lot of the sophisticated people in this town say Whitewater
is not important.  I have a lot of Republicans, even, who believe
that.  All of you should read a book called <i>Blood Sport</i> by Jim
Stewart, Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative reporter, definitely,
definitely not a conservative.

<p>

Mr. Stewart, not a Washington reporter,
not a political reporter, was approached by a friend of his, Susan
Thomases, the First Lady's right-hand woman -- or should I say
left-hand woman -- asked if he could write, they would give him
access, and could he write a book on Whitewater, meaning it would
be an exculpatory book.  He got interested. They didn't give him
the cooperation that was promised, but he has written a hell of
a book.

<p>

Just today I talked to a former U.S. attorney who, going
through the book, jotting down things, found eight violations
of statutes, criminal violations, felonies.  Will the First Lady
be the first First Lady to be indicted, or even to be an unindicted
co-conspirator?  No wonder they want to end the D'Amato hearings,
put a stop to this.

<p>

The third pitfall is the economy:  0.9 percent
growth in the last quarter.  The first two quarters of this year
are going to be low growth, no growth, or negative growth.  The
economy is weak.  And the interesting thing is, as Pat Buchanan
has understood, it is weakest on the people who are in the Democratic
voting base.  Republicans are doing pretty well.  Will it get
weak enough so that it turns against the President?  No President,
when there has been a perception of an economic downturn, has
ever been reelected.

<p>

And the fourth pitfall is what the American
people think of Bill Clinton.  There is the question of whether
the American people really do want Bill Clinton in the White House
for four more years.  The Republicans have disappointed them,
I think.  I don't think they see in Senator Dole a visionary leader.
But sometimes they will say, perhaps, with all their shortcomings,
the opposition is better.  Perhaps the American people will take
a look at the issues:  Do I want more government or less?  Who
do I think is best equipped to have a social revival in this country?
And is government the problem or the solution?  That is what
is going to make this, despite everything else, an interesting
campaign.

<p>

Thank you very much.

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares insight from 
Family Research Council president Gary Bauer.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>. FRC president Gary Bauer is known in Washington and
across the nation for standing firm when it comes to fighting
for America's families.  Let's hear his insight on tonight's Homefront
News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER: One of the central things that sort of drives what we are 
doing at FRC is the fact that for about 15 years now, all of the polling 
data has been showing that two-thirds of the American people think
that America is headed in the wrong direction.

<p>

What could be on their minds?  Why are they so filled with anxiety? Now, 
I suspect some of it is economic. There hasn't been real wage growth for
a large segment of the population for about 20 years.  There is
a great deal of concern about downsizing and all the issues in
the headlines.

<p>

But I don't really think, at the end of the day,
that it is a essentially economics that are driving the answer
to that question.  I think Americans are pondering the heart and
soul of America, and it is that which is troubling them about
the future, the sense that I think we all have that America is
one wrong turn away from a disaster.

<p>

Every place I go, people say to me, &quot;What in the world happened to 
us?  How did we get here?  When did these things take place?  How did it 
all just sort of transpire that we woke up one morning and this was where
we were living?&quot;

<p>

I think, clearly, one answer to this question
of how we got here is that, as a society, we have collectively
forgotten God.  I mean, there is just no doubt about that in my
mind.  Now, that is a very impolitic thing to say in Washington,
D.C.  If you go up to a congressional committee or before some
reporter and you say, &quot;You know, the reason we're in this
mess is because we've forgotten God,&quot; that's a pretty unusual
thing for someone to say in Washington, even today.

<p>

But it's clear. I mean, isn't it clear to you all that that is at the 
core of the problem?  This is a terribly ironic thing that has happened
in the United States.  All over this city -- you've passed them
probably in the bus and when you've been walking around in the
last day and a half - there are monuments in this city where there
are words etched in the stone that make it clear that our liberty
comes from no man but from God.  Those monuments reflect the founding
of America.

<p>

Lincoln called us the almost chosen people, and he
called us that for a reason.  Every one of us have, either in
our pockets, or you ladies, in your purses, money that says, &quot;In
God We Trust,&quot; and the phrase has become as devalued as the
money it is printed on.

<p>

Now, to listen to the cultural elite in
this city, you would think that the biggest problem facing America
is that men and women like you, men and women of faith, may actually
get into the public square, plant your feet, and not move until
you have changed the country.

<p>

I would hope you would remember that the biggest threat facing 
America is that you will not do that.  You are the only ones that 
can explain to the American people the importance of the family to 
civilization. Nobody else is going to do it.  You are the only ones who 
can make the case for racial reconciliation, because you know we are 
all created equal by God, that we are equal in His sight, and that is the
foundation upon which a society gives equality to all people regardless
of their race or their creed or their economic background.

<p>

You are the only ones that can do that.  You are the only ones that
can explain, ultimately, the sanctity of human life and why life
can't just be put up to a vote every couple of years depending
on changing mores.  If you don't get into the public square, plant
your feet, and stand for these things, I am absolutely convinced
that America will fall in the next century as surely as it would
from economic collapse.

<p>

What's the second reason that we've gotten
into the mess we're in today?  I think the second reason is our
failure as a culture to teach our children who we are, what this
experiment was all about.  The research on this is absolutely
clear.  Each generation of young Americans knows less about their
heritage, about who they are, about the shoulders of the giants
upon whom they sit as Americans than the generation before it.

<p>

Now, the trend line here is clear.  A country for whom its children
are forgetting the basics or are never taught the basics is a
country in trouble.

<p>

I would like to suggest to you tonight that
we are not going to reform American education in the next year,
the next five years, or the next ten years, so we are going to
have to take it upon ourselves to make sure that our children
know the minutes of the last meeting, that they know about the
values that the country was built upon.

<p>

We have to teach our children who said, &quot;Give me liberty or 
give me death&quot; and who said, &quot;I have a dream.&quot; We need 
to teach them about what happened at Normandy, what happened at 
Concord Bridge, what happened on Pork Chop Hill, and how their liberty 
was born and nurtured in those places. We need to show them what 
Constitution Hall looks like, what good music sounds like, what the 
lady in New York Harbor stands for, why there was a Berlin Wall and what
the forces were that brought that wall down.

<p>

We need to teach them about Ruth and Naomi, Jonathan and David. In short, 
it is up to us to teach them to love the things we love and to honor
the things we honor, because nothing less than that will do.

<p>

Finally, I think the third thing that has happened is that we are in 
the process in America of separating virtue from liberty.  If we 
separate virtue from liberty, which is what the society in this 
culture is doing today, then the consequences are inevitable.

<p>

I think I have talked to some of you before about the absolutely 
incredible reaction to the death of Jerry Garcia, the lead singer of 
the band, the Grateful Dead.  But the thing that astonished me was,
here's Jerry Garcia that never got out of the sixties.  The man
was a dope addict and an alcoholic his entire life.  And yet when
he died last year, the culture treated his death as if a great
hero had passed from the scene.  It was one of the lead items
on all the evening news.  I watched United States Senators leave
committee hearing rooms to go out into the hallways and speak
to banks of cameras to say how much their lives had been touched
by Jerry Garcia.

<p>

There is something wrong, ladies and gentlemen,
when people like Jerry Garcia are held up as great heroes and
yet one-half of American 16-year-olds cannot tell you the correct
half-century the American Civil War took place. That's a problem.

<p>

And I suppose that there is no issue that is a clearer example
of the separation of virtue from liberty than the issue you have
heard about time and time again in the last day and a half, and
that is the sanctity of human life.  I mean, this is the marker
issue.  I suspect that there are probably some of you who would
maybe prefer that we not harp on it so much.  We can't stop harping
on it.

<p>

I believe it defines who we are as a country, and if we
ever rolled back abortion on demand, almost every other issue
we were dealing with, I think, would fall into place in a very
short period of time.  This issue is at the core of what our liberty
means and the role that virtue plays in moderating that liberty.

<p>

And so this organization, the Family Research Council, will
never back off on the abortion issue.  Men and women like you
who bring new life into the world, who stand for these values,
who will do anything for blood of their blood, flesh of their
flesh, that is courage, and that is what the Family Research Council
will stand for as long as I am here and this great staff that
you have met is here, and with your help.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
presents insider information from those who attended the recent 1996 
National Education Summit.

<p>

Education affects the pro-family movement on many levels, and there is 
no shortage of controversy.  One recent example is the constant battling
over public school curriculum, which deletes key historical events
but somehow manages to teach children an amoral value system,
complete with bad advice on sex.  It seems clear that as a country
we can no longer ignore the fact that educational standards, measured
by students' knowledge and performance, have drastically plummeted.

<p>

The 1996 National Education Summit was supposed to address that
learning crisis.  The conference was organized by IBM CEO and
chairman Lou Gerstner, Jr., with the help of the governors and
other high-ranking businessmen.  But will their solutions for
a broken school system help your children?  Stay tuned to learn
more.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Cathy Cleaver, Family Research
Council's Director of Legal Policy.  Cathy has been involved heavily
in an issue that affects all families and all children, pornography.
Because of numerous court cases attacking the legal boundaries
around our children, the pornography industry has a lot of power
today, but there are some key legal battles in the works.  Stay
with us as Cathy fills us in on what the pornographers don't want
you to know about what goes on behind the headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Cathy, thank you so much for being with us today on Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is my pleasure.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There has been a lot of news out recently from Los 
Angeles and New York and now Philadelphia on pornography and the 
telecommunications bill, pornography on the Internet, and reading 
the news reports, is it fair to say that it would be smashing blow 
to the First Amendment if we see restrictions on the Internet?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I love the way you put that, and that is really how 
to phrase this question.  The ACLU and others who are fighting to 
get this new computer pornography law restrained make just that point: 
If we don't have free-flowing pornography to every child in America, 
we have lost our valuable First Amendment freedoms.

<p>

That's ridiculous.  Most courts think that's ridiculous, and we are 
counting on that.  The Supreme Court, of course, has said we don't 
have to have that, that pornography is not a measure of our freedom; 
rather, it is a sort of low-level type of speech that we need to 
tolerate at some levels, but certainly we don't need to have our 
children tolerate it.

<p>

So I believe that the challenges that are going on across the country 
are just the same challenges we have always seen and that our side 
will be successful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Just yesterday, you were in Philadelphia at the court 
case there.  Tell us a little bit about what's going on there and 
how it will affect parents.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: In February, the Telecommunications Act of 1996 was 
signed into law by President Clinton. Part of that act included the 
Communications Decency Act, which is simply a law that says adults 
have no right to knowingly give pornography to children over computer 
systems.  Makes sense.

<p>

Well, the ACLU and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit saying
that this is going to ruin our cherished freedom of free speech,
and we have this drama played out in a federal court in Philadelphia.
I have attended every day of the hearing, and it has been quite
a show, with sex experts saying that children should see pornography,
that it's not harmful; other people saying that the Internet will
just cease to be if this restriction is in place.

<p>

The Department of Justice is defending the law, and they are doing a 
good job. I was pleased to see that they are vigorous in their defense
of the law, and I believe they believe in its constitutionality.
Certainly Janet Reno and the policy makers at Justice had some
trouble in 1994 with child pornography and weakening the statute,
and we don't see a replay of that yet.  Frankly, I don't think
they have the political capital to waste on another debacle like
that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of people may not remember what the
Clinton Administration did on that child porn case, where essentially
they tried to change the law to say that if a child who is being
molested appears to be participating in all of this, that somehow
they are at fault.  It is an astounding legal principle, isn't
it?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It was a terrible burden to put on the prosecution,
and I would say that it would really bring any child pornography
prosecution to a screeching halt.  It would never be prosecuted
under the types of burdens that the Justice Department at that
time was suggesting.  But that was turned around, public outrage,
and healthy public outrage and efforts from all groups, including
the Family Research Council.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We hear a lot from the American Civil Liberties Union 
that somehow, if we don't have pornography on the Internet, the 
Internet will cease to be, as though perhaps it were created, we must 
assume, for the purpose of transmitting hard core, obscene images. But 
what is the ACLU's history on pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: It is very radical. They lead the charge in trying to 
legalize child pornography, even hard core child pornography where a 
child is shown being raped. The ACLU believes that once a video or 
a magazine of this child's rape has been produced, it is a sacred 
text that must be protected by the First Amendment.

<p>

They are out of touch. We wouldn't want to live in an ACLU world. 
And, thankfully, our courts have not bought in to their arguments. 
But they keep trying, and they are trying again here, with the same 
sort of notion, that someone should be allowed to intentionally give 
a child pornography. And the ACLU, of course, also believes that 
children have a right to see pornography.

<p>

So they are leading the charge against the Communications Decency 
Act, along with People for the American Way, the American Library 
Association, and the cast of characters that we have seen time and 
time again who defend the pornographers and their right to make 
profits in selling this kind of material.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A typical comeback from the pornography industry
and the so-called First Amendment people is that it's the parents'
problem, it's the parents' responsibility.  How do you respond
to that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Well, I say time and again that no law
is designed to fill the role of a parent, and neither is this
law, nor has anyone suggested that this law is to substitute for
a parent.  Rather, parents are no match for an $8 billion to $10
billion a year pornography industry.

<p>

There is a role for government to play in protecting children or 
protecting anybody that is weaker in society from elements that are 
stronger in society. That's what our criminal laws are all about, 
and we have criminal laws that prevent an adult from exploiting a child 
through pornography. That is a consistent theme we have seen in 200 
years of laws. And that is the same theme we have with this law.

<p.

Parents certainly have a role, and there is no one taking that role away. 
But they need help.  They can't do it alone.  And the responsibility 
should always remain on the shoulders of that person who is dealing in
harmful material, just like in the instance of toxic waste or
something like that.  If you emit toxic waste in your business,
you have a responsibility to curb that.  Similarly, if you are
distributing pornography, you have a responsibility to keep it
from kids.

<p>

That is really a legal principle that we as a society
have embraced that has been fought by these civil liberty groups,
but we have embraced that, and the courts have upheld that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Let's say that a parent really does buy the ACLU line
and accepts the fact that they are supposed to be the sole defender
of their child.  Is it possible for a child to really block pornography
and obscenity from their home with the blocking technologies today?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Absolutely not.  We have seen many instances in
which parents have tried to employ this blocking technology, and
pornography has still reached their children.  Pornography that
is attached to an e-mail message, for instance, is not blocked
by the software.

<p>

During this hearing, very interesting testimony from SurfWatch, the 
leading software filtering company right now. I have nothing against 
SurfWatch or the filtering companies, and they will provide somewhat 
of a help to parents.  But they want to be a substitute for a law.

<p>

Yet, in the hearing, they admitted that they miss 800 pornographic sites 
per month. And they say, &quot;Well, that's not so bad.&quot;  Well, I 
think parents think that's bad. That's a lot of sites of material that
could just ruin a child's mental health, frankly.

<p.

So it is ridiculous to think that sort of technology can be a complete 
substitute for a law.  We are left with hoping that pornography 
distributors will, of their own, decide not to harm our children. 
History has not shown that that is a good assumption.

<p>
MS. HAMRICK: A lot of people are not aware that, under American law, the 
way in which we have regulated communication is the way in which 
something is transmitted, so that you cannot send something threatening
through the mails, for example; you cannot sell pornography without
some kind of adult supervision; you have to have a restricted
access.  So we have really regulated transmission of information.

<p>

As we look at the Internet, a new way to transmit information,
are we seeing any new laws being made?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: With this new medium, all we're doing is importing laws 
that our country has embraced for decades.  There is no new legal theory 
at play here.  It's the same old principle that people who distribute
pornography cannot distribute it to children.

<p>

It is interesting, because every time a new technology develops, first 
of all, pornographers rush in and exploit that technology, sometimes 
drive it, I am sorry to say, drive its development.  And then, secondly, 
the porn defenders come in and say, &quot;Well, pornography law can't
apply in this technology.  Certainly videos are different than
magazines, and certainly pornography laws shouldn't apply to videos.&quot;
That's what we heard in the early 1980s, if you can believe it
or not.

<p>

Well, that argument failed, and we have seen that with
television, telephone, cable, and now we are seeing it with the
computer and with the Internet.  It's the same old song, and it's
really nothing new that this new computer porn law is doing. 
It's just relatively different because it's a different medium.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Taking a look at some of these different transmission
issues right now, there's a new law in California dealing with
a new way of distributing pornography, newsstands, magazine racks
right next to other newspaper boxes that actually sell hard core
pornography. What's your involvement in that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: I love this new law in California.  For all its troubles 
with pornography, California has come up with some good, innovative 
laws to protect communities and families.  One such new law is a law 
against pornographic news racks.  What we are seeing springing up in 
California are news racks right on the street, next to the regular news, 
with hard core pornography.  So any child with 25 cents can receive
that magazine.

<p>

Well, there's a new law now that says those news
racks that distribute hard core porn cannot exist unless they
are supervised 24 hours a day by an adult, or unless they are
accessible only by adult tokens.  That makes sense, because then
adults can get the material that they might have a right to get,
but certainly children cannot.

<p>

That is causing such a stir in California, and we are filing a brief 
in support of that law. We think that law is fully constitutional. And 
actually, the consequences of this lawsuit are really grave.  If we 
were to lose this one, then I would venture to say we will see 
pornographic news racks popping up all over the country.  So this is a 
crucial case for communities and families.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Cathy, so much for being with us today on 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: You're welcome.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
begins our inside scoop from those who attended the 1996 National 
Education Summit.  Are America's leaders serious about making positive 
changes in our children's education?  Stay tuned to find out.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Reading, writing, and arithmetic were once the core of 
education. Yet there are students across the United States today who 
actually graduate from high school lacking these basic skills.

<p>

Clinton's national education standards and Goals 2000 both promised to 
fill the gap and prepare students for life.  But questions among parents
and educators arose regarding these standards.  Were children
going to be better educated, well read, insightful, and intellectual?
Or will they merely be illiterate but politically correct?

<p>

Burdened with the cost of teaching basic skills to many entry-level 
workers, corporate America decided to get involved.  Lou Gerstner, Jr.,
CEO and chairman of IBM, spearheaded a movement to evaluate our
education system and began by organizing the 1996 National Education
Summit.  Governors, CEOs, and policy makers from across the country,
including President Clinton, attended the summit in an attempt
to agree on a newly improved standard.

<p>

This commitment to educational excellence, which was documented and 
signed by all the governors, seemed like a step in the right direction. 
But what about the voices of those who were visibly not in attendance, 
including conservative leaders with strong grass-roots appeal, private 
school representatives, and, most importantly, parents?

<p>

Developing a sound education policy may not seem controversial, but 
experts agree that parents, educators, and corporate America still have
a long way to go.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To tell us just how far we have to go to actually see 
improvement in our children's education, I am joined by Robert 
Morrison, Family Research Council's Special Assistant to the 
President, whose experience at the Department of Education well 
prepared him for his policy role today.

<p>

We also have Michelle Easton, president of the Virginia State Board 
of Education.  As a representative of Governor Allen, Michelle has
acted as a key pro-family advocate.

<p>

And also joining us is Carolee Adams, who attended the 1996 National 
Education Summit on <i>Straight Talk</i>'s behalf, our own special 
correspondent.

<p>

They are all here to talk to us today, and welcome to the show.

<p>

Michelle, let's start with you.  You were there with Governor Allen, 
and although IBM organized the event, was very powerful as a force, 
ostensibly, everybody said, well, this is really a governors' event. 
So you were there with the governor.  Why don't you tell us the good
news, if there was any.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, there was some good news. Every governor was allowed 
to bring along one staff person and asked to bring one business person, 
and I was his staff person.

<p>

Governor Allen went to the meeting with some 
serious concerns about the policy summit statement that had been drafted, 
and he was very successful in persuading the other governors to make
some changes to that document, to make it more acceptable to those
of us who feel the Federal Government has almost no role in education;
that is for the states and localities to make decisions, and preferably
localities to the greatest extent possible.

<p>

He was given credit in the press for that. The <i>Washington Times</i> here, 
I have an article, the day after the summit:  &quot;Summit Policy Position 
Altered.&quot; And it says, &quot;Led by Governor Allen, they rewrote the 
policy statement to better reflect conservative views and reaffirm that
the states and not the Federal Government play the major role
in education.&quot;  So that was a success of the summit, that
all the governors voted for a statement, and the CEOs voted, also,
affirming that it is not the Federal Government where decisions
should be made about education; it is states and at the local
level.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, you are experienced in education.  A
long time back, I remember Ronald Reagan was going to get rid
of the Department of Education, very much affirming the position
that the states had a role by getting rid of the federal role.
Obviously, that did not happen.

<p>

Maybe you can tell us at the beginning of our conversation, in a 
nutshell, what the bad news was.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, unfortunately, the summit had an opportunity
to really make some gains.  They could have talked very seriously
about what we think is the most important reform in education:
letting parents choose safe and effective schools for their children.

<p>

Regrettably, those who led the summit pushed that pretty much
off the agenda and ruled it out of order.  We think they are incorrect
in that respect.  When parents can choose an excellent public,
private, religious, or home school, that in itself brings about
high achievement, high standards, and safe schools.

<p>

It is an irony, because business, including Lou Gerstner, Jr., the 
chairman of IBM, they continue to tell us what it is they seek from 
our education system, what they are hoping to get from our graduates. 
The schools that we champion, the schools that we highly respect and 
encourage, are the very schools that do the job that business says it 
wants done.

<p>

So we think as more corporate executives who weren't perhaps
at the summit or whose voices weren't heard at the summit, especially
as those who are small business and entrepreneurs, those who are
actually responsible for 90 percent of the new jobs and new goods
and services, when they find out how much bureaucracy is going
to be added on as a result of Goals 2000, as a result of certificates
of initial mastery, we think they are going to join into a national
movement to repeal Goals 2000, get rid of the Department of Education,
and not to impose national standards and a national curriculum
on America's communities.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, Carolee, we were blessed to have our own special 
correspondent in you there, and you are also a home schooler yourself, 
and you certainly represent a new wave.  And it is interesting. Family 
Research Council has done some polling that home schoolers are made up 
by a lot of interesting constituencies -- some Perot people, some 
independent-minded people, real popular with certain 1960s radicals 
and conservative pro-family Americans. Did you see your interest in 
other kinds of educational opportunities represented?

<p>

MS. ADAMS: No, unfortunately. I certainly am a proponent of children, 
students, being accountable for things that they learn in school. In 
my community we are spending $16,500 a year per child to educate 
children, so they should be accountable.

<p>

However, we have chosen to home school for a number of different reasons. 

<p>

In my interview with one of the governors, I said to him, I brought to 
him the situation, I said -- it was Governor Tommy Thompson -- and I 
said, &quot;I'll bring to you a situation of a little boy by the name of 
Tommy. And Tommy is a real wiggly Willie, and he doesn't want to sit
still in his seat, and he can't read, can't write.  He is incorrigible.
His teacher doesn't know what to do with him, so his momma pulls
him out of school.&quot;

<p>

Now, if his momma hadn't pulled him out of school, we wouldn't have 
had all the lights, the camera, and the action, because it's Tommy 
Edison that I'm talking about. And so I asked Governor Thompson, I 
said, &quot;What are you going to do with a little boy by the name of 
Tommy Edison?&quot; He said, &quot;Well, we'll give him a second 
test.&quot;

<p>

This is where I feel we have a sincere problem of understanding about
different learning styles, the necessity of parental involvement,
and that standards are important, technology is important, but
there is a lot more to it than that, and home schoolers would
be encouraged, from Governor Thompson's words, to participate
in the forum, and I know that they already are being tracked with
certain types of governmental programs, and that is regrettable.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Virginia has been very lucky to have Governor Allen
taking a real leadership.  There are all kinds of educational
reforms out there, charter schools.  From your perspective at
a state level, why is the state better able to have a role in
education, and how can the states better accommodate people like
Carolee?

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, the state is better that the Federal
Government simply, plainly, common sense, because it's closer
to the people.  But the local level is even better in terms of
making decisions and spending money.

<p>

In Virginia, our local school districts have a tremendous amount 
of autonomy.  Now, there is a fair amount of money that comes from 
the state level, and it varies by jurisdiction. The poorer 
jurisdictions get more state money than the more affluent ones. 

<p>

But in Virginia what we have been trying to do under the leadership 
of Governor Allen and how his State Board of Education -- he has 
appointed the majority of members of that now; it took a couple of 
years to get that - is to have the state's role be very limited but 
very useful.

<p>

The first thing we did is we decided we wanted to set up 
some academic standards in the core academic areas of English, science,
math, and history.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The pragmatic core subjects, not how do you feel about 
math but whether you can do it.

<p>

MS. EASTON: That's right. It took over a year. These are the standards
of learning here, and I have an 800 number if your listeners might
want to get a copy of them.  They are not perfect.  They are not
perfect by any means.  But you won't find in here anywhere how
do you feel about something.  It's what do you know, what do you
know.

<p>

This was our first step in trying to have the state set
a framework.  Now, we don't tell schools how to teach this.  We
don't tell them what books to use.  We don't tell them what methods
to use on the local level.  Now, these are public schools only.
In Virginia, mercifully, we leave the private schools alone pretty
much.

<p>

We set out the standards, then devise a set of state tests.
Did you learn this stuff?  The tests that our kids currently
take, for the most part, in the public schools are called norm-referenced
tests where they are measured against some mass of children, and
the results come out, and they are very confusing.  We want to
test kids, did you learn your history?  This is straightforward
history, kindergarten to 12th grade, a series of tests, and then
we want to publicize the results of those tests.

<p>

Then what happens? We want to let localities decide what to do.  We want 
to create a dynamic so there are rigorous academic standards, there are
good tests on them, a lot of information -- are you learning this
stuff?  Do you know your history?  Do you know your English? 
Do you know your science? -- and then let localities do what has
to be done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to want to hear that 800 number really fast 
and come back.

<p>

MS. EASTON: Okay.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Give us that 800 number.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  It is 1-800-292-3820.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Grab a paper and pencil.  You can write that again after
the break.  Please join us after the commercial break as we continue
to discuss educational change with our group of insiders.  Stay
tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined again by some experts who are actively involved 
in efforts to restructure education. We have again Robert Morrison, 
special assistant to Gary Bauer at the Family Research Council; Michelle 
Easton, president of the Virginia State Board of Education; and Carolee 
Adams, a home-school mother and long-time education activist and our own 
<i>Straight Talk</i> correspondent. Thank you again for being with us. 

<p>

When we left before, we were taking a look at the fact that Virginia -- 
you know, a lot of the reason why people are upset about standards
is the standards have not been very academic; they have been quite
philosophical:  you know, how do you feel, what do you think about?
Virginia has tried to do something different, and you have an
800 number where people can get a sample.  Give that again.

<p>

MS. EASTON: Yes. It is 1-800-292-3820, our new, rigorous, knowledge-based,
academic Virginia standards.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Bob, you are tracking what all 50 states are doing 
and were at the governors' convention, National Education Summit, 
looking at all 50 states.  How does what Virginia is doing, pragmatic 
work, compare to what is happening or what you fear might happen?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, we are very complimentary of Virginia. We 
definitely approve of what Governor Allen has done in resisting the 
idea of further federal encroachments in the education area. We 
applauded when Governor Allen stood up very tall and straight and 
said, &quot;No, we don't want to do this. We want to go back and bring 
authority back to where it belongs, to localities, to elected school 
boards, to parents.&quot; Governor Allen has been a champion in that 
regard.

<p>

In other states, we commended Governor Merrill in New Hampshire [who] 
has not applied for Goals 2000 funding; Governor Keating in Oklahoma; 
Governor Foster in Louisiana. Out in California, Governor Wilson is not
taking Goals 2000 funding.  So we think there should be a national
move to resist the kind of bureaucratization of education and
the dumbing down, frankly, that has come from Goals 2000.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But, Bob, I think one thing that is interesting is a
lot of people have this very false perception that the Federal
Government is paying for education; that if we get rid of the
Department of Education, we have just de-funded our schools.

<p>

But you have an interesting formula.  It is like a dollar's worth,
one dollar in every hundred?

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Yes, right. In Montana I think the figure came out 
to something like $1.50 per student that they would have gained if 
they took the Goals 2000 money. But the Goals 2000 money works in 
another way.  It's not very much and it doesn't help you a whole 
lot, but as it is often said, the worm doesn't have to be very big 
to conceal the hook.  So if you just bite, you're hooked.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How is that?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, because Goals 2000 is very, very directive in
terms of what you are going to do.  You are going to have to restructure
your schools.  You are going to have to have your programs approved
of by various people.  Right now they've got a new entity that
may be approving of your standards in history, math, science,
and English.

<p>

We have already seen the initial efforts nationally
out there for history standards.  The first two efforts have been
a disaster.  The first effort was so horrible for national history
standards that the U.S. Senate voted 99 to 1 to reject them.

<p>

So they went back to the drawing board, and they said, &quot;Okay,
we are, after all, historical revisionists.  We can revise.&quot;

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So they took 15 months, they revised, and the second
set comes out, and they tell kids that in national history standards
we have to think that Goals 2000 is a good idea because these
standards endorse Goals 2000; we have to think that redesigning
the family, redefining the family, is a good idea because they
define the family in the history standards as a group from which
we receive love and support.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Well, that's nice, but that's not all families do and 
it's not all they are.

<p>

They also make a bid for equalization of school
funding.  What has this got to do with U.S. history, we might
ask.  Nothing.  That's the whole point.  A lot of what is in there
has nothing to do with it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So what we find is that the Federal Government throws 
in maybe one dollar per child and then demands control over how you 
spend all the rest of your money.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  When I served in the U.S. Department of Education,
some of the career civil servants there, good folks that they
were, said, &quot;We couldn't be doing all these bonehead things,
Bob.  You got us all wrong. We only provide 6 percent of the funding,
just 6 cents out of the dollar.&quot;

<p>

So finally, after two weeks of orientation, I asked one of these fine 
folks, I said, &quot;Have you ever been to India?  Have you ever seen 
the mahouts in India? They are very small guys.  They only weigh about 
100 pounds. They only weigh about 6 percent of what the elephant weighs.
But they've got this stick, and when they jab the stick behind
the elephant's ear, the elephant goes the way they want him to.&quot;

<p>

And that is the problem we face.  Even when you have good reforms,
the Federal Government can make it impossible.  I just have one
example.  Ohio attempted to have an eighth grade reading requirement
for high school graduation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Amazing.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: And you would think that President Clinton would say, 
&quot;Good for you.  You're at least raising standards.&quot;  His 
Education Department sued the state of Ohio not because eighth grade was
too low but because it was too high.

<p>

MS. EATON:  And yet President Clinton came to the summit and gave a 
speech that could have been written by George Allen or Ronald Reagan, 
saying, &quot;Oh, we need to have tests; we need to have accountability; 
we need to hold children back when they don't perform.&quot;  It almost 
makes you feel that he says one thing and does another.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, imagine that.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  You know, George Allen is one
of my favorite choices for Bob Dole's Vice President, so I'm on
your side.  However, I will say this.  Governor Allen said to
me that this was not a tops-down procedure; this is a bottoms-up
procedure.  But I have a great concern that that isn't going to
happen that way.

<p>

As an example, at the final press conference,
Lou Gerstner got up.  He is the chairman of IBM.  He said that
these transcripts and the certificates of mastery, everything
is going to be ready in one year's time.  Now, if a child doesn't
have that transcript or doesn't have that certificate, then they
can't get a job.

<p>

Also, I sensed that the child is also going to
be geared -- I mean, this is the third wave.  This is your new
industrial revolution becoming a technological revolution.

<p>

I was reading Alvin Toffler's book about the third wave, and he cited
that when we were moving from an agrarian society in the early
1800s over to an industrial society that covertly the children
were being trained to do things in a methodical way; that they
were able to get up on time, be at school on time, do this on
time, so that they could get a job and be there from 9 to 5.

<p>

So whatever we are going to be educating the children in school today
is going to have to fit.  This is what the CEOs want, particularly
those who are using modern technology to a large degree.  They
are going to have these kids come in well trained to use technological
equipment.

<p>

I heard one of the governors say or one of the CEOs
say, &quot;We have enough lawyers.  We have enough philosophers.&quot;
However, we can't overlook the fact that we still need lawyers
and we still need philosophers, and education is not to give them
a job.  Education is for the sake of education.

<p>

I am not a liberal thinker at all, but I think the entire summit lost out 
[in that] the systemic problems of education were not addressed, and I 
believe Governor Ridge wanted to.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We don't have a lot of time left, but maybe in one 
minute, Michelle, you could sum this up, because one thing that has 
not been addressed, this was really set up by corporate America for 
corporate America's goals, which are not necessarily the goals of a 
parent, that their child be well-rounded and well-read. Quickly, what 
would you see corporate America's goals were?

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Well, I think one reason the scope of the summit was so 
limited, and we didn't get into things like school choice and 
school-to-work and other issues like that, is when you have 50 
governors -- liberals, conservatives, Republicans,
Democrats -- to get them all to agree on something is very difficult.
So they focused very narrowly on standards and on more technology
in schools, and that was clearly what the CEOs wanted at this
particular meeting.  It was something they thought they could
get through, get everybody to vote for, and I think with some
of the changes that Governor Allen and some of the other conservatives
got in, where we keep stressing that there is not a federal role
in those things, it was successful in that sense.

<p>

But it is certainly true that there are many, many other issues that need 
to be addressed and discussed, and there are some CEOs that are more 
interested in training students for jobs, while others, big and small 
business, really are more interested in what many of us want, which is 
children with good basic skills and knowledge to come into the workplace
and then they will train them for the specific jobs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to find out if that's a brave new world
or a new horizon, and in a moment, when <i>Straight Talk</i> returns,
we'll hear about how our country's educational system is still
in need of an overhaul, and we'll find out more after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once again my guests, 
Robert Morrison, Michelle Easton, and Carolee Adams, all of whom 
attended the 1996 National Education Summit.

<p>

Now, Carolee, you were talking before the break about corporate
America, something which you are quite experienced in.  You were
a vice president for Citibank, I think, for 15 years and a manager
of people, and so I think you can appreciate the fact that you
would like your workers to read and write and use the computer.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  Oh, absolutely.  There is no doubt.  I mean, a large
corporation like IBM, as an example, spends an exorbitant amount
of money on training, retraining, I mean teaching them how to
read and write, but also college-level students.  I know a friend
of mine who works for a major consumer goods -- it's food products
-- and he has his Ph.D. in food chemistry.  He said, &quot;We
assume that when they get out of college, they know nothing. 
We retrain them from the beginning.&quot;  So the corporations
have to cut back on their expenses.  They are very competitive.
The words that kept emanating out of the conference were, &quot;We
want to compete in a global marketplace.&quot;  So the children
have to come in well trained.

<p>

However, I am deeply concerned that this entire philosophy is not 
akin to the American spirit.  We have not heretofore before -- and I 
think Governor Hunt said this -- we have never done this before, and there 
is a book out called <i>The Coming Revolution in Education</i> by a Professor 
Boyce out of the University of Georgia, and he said that we haven't in 
the past created a school system to really fill jobs, and --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But is that the purpose of our school system?  I mean,
is that an appropriate purpose?  Schools make just workers?

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  No, that's not.  The purpose of the school is to educate
them.  A liberal education is supposed to give them an opportunity,
particularly your K-12 grades. They are there to experiment with
a lot of different things. Am I going to be a great mathematician,
a scientist, an artist, a wonderful mother?  I mean, that is something
that -- you know, they are dropping out home economics out of
a lot of courses in high school.  That's not required.  I have
a real problem with that, and so that is for colleges to do.

<p>

I was at a conference on the stock market on Wall Street, and there
was a gentleman, head of a major exchange, and he kept talking
about how the CEOs and the teachers were going to revamp the educational
system.  No, no, no.  It's parents and students [who] have to
be included, and I found that missing at the education summit.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Did you find that missing, as well, Bob, because
I know that is one of your primary concerns, that we are losing
the purpose of education.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, sure.  One of the things that -- we share this 
with business at all levels. Parents have a great stake in a quality 
education for their children. They also have a great economic stake in 
their children's education. You will find very few parents who are 
indifferent, don't care whether their children are able to get a job 
after they finish high school or college.

<p>

So there's a tremendous incentive for parents to get the best education 
for their kids. When parents can choose their children's schools, they 
routinely choose a school that will have high standards.  No parent wants 
[his child] to go to a school that does poorly and that kids are ill 
prepared, and the parents are very harsh when they find that that's what
the school has done.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What is the statistic?  I mean, certainly in Washington, 
D.C., the President and the Vice President both send their children to 
faith-based private institutions. You were telling me the other day 
that the majority of public school teachers' children were also in 
private schools.

<p>

MR. MORRISON: In many major city school systems, you will find 30, 40 
percent, 50 percent in some.  One of the debates with Keith Geiger, the
president of the National Education Association, when Bill Bennett
charged him and said that 50 percent of Chicago teachers had their
kids in private schools, and Geiger said, &quot;No, it's only
40 percent.&quot;

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

Well, four out of ten.  The other teachers had their kids in suburban 
school districts.

<p>

Our point is that there are excellent public schools, excellent private, 
religious, and home schools.  Parents choose the best school they can 
get.

<p>

As to the summit and the failure that we saw in the 
summit, it is [that] the difficulty is the old New Hampshire phrase, 
&quot;You can't get there from here.&quot;  By taking over more and more
power to a national entity, they are describing a new board, a
new agency, a new creation that they want to build which will
have power to bully states that are good --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Tell us about that.

<p>

MS. EASTON:  Many of the CEOs and many of the governors
were very supportive of a notion in the draft summit statement,
which we did manage to amend somewhat, which would have created
a new national organization -- just what we need -- to help states
share information about creating standards and reform, to compare
standards to each other, to European nations.

<p>

Governor Allen said, &quot;Wait a minute, wait a minute.  This makes me 
uncomfortable. It has the smell of a governmental thing.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Oh, no, no, no, it's not governmental, just all of us getting 
together.&quot;

<p>

He said, &quot;Why do we need it?  If you want Virginia's 
standards, get on the Internet, get to our web site.  There you've got 
them. Do you want to talk to us about how we did it?  Give us a 
call.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Oh, well, we need it to help us coordinate and do this more
effectively.&quot;

<p>

What he did manage to do was to give us all
respite on it, and they took the language out of the statement
that said this would happen instantly, and it was made into they'll
come back with a proposal in July to the governors.  But, I mean,
what a worrisome thing.  Just what we need, another national organization,
another bureaucracy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And what would it do?  I mean, what would it do that 
the Department of Education hasn't done badly?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Set the standards, set the tests, and decide
what happens to the kids or the schools or the administrators
if the kids don't pass the tests.

<p>

Now, some of the things that are going to happen if you don't get the 
certificate of initial mastery are you won't get a driver's license, 
you won't be able to get a job at 16 or at 18 or go to college.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So what would home schoolers do, for example?  Are they 
going to be --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  They will conform or else.

<p>

MS. ADAMS: That is what Governor Thompson said. &quot;They will be 
encouraged.&quot; And so I think that that is --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Government doesn't encourage.

<p>

MS. ADAMS:  Those were kind words.  I found people
speaking differently throughout my interviews.  This was going
to be, you know, bottoms up not a tops down.  I think it's tops
down.  I think we have to be honest about this.  For the most
part, not all states perhaps, but if you're going to have an IBM
which gets people from every one of our states, then those 50
states are going to have to -- somebody in Idaho is going to say,
&quot;Well, I want my child to work for IBM.&quot;  &quot;Well,
you don't participate in the program.&quot;  And they are going
to be encouraged to participate, home schoolers, private schools.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Which is a Soviet system.  I mean, let's be honest.
The Soviet system preprograms your path and you get there --

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  It is much more -- it is actually probably more
-- to be fair about it, they are talking openly.  Mark Tucker
of the National Center on Education and the Economy urged Hillary
and Bill Clinton to take a page from the German book. <i>Newsweek</i>
magazine says we're going to move toward a German system.

<p>

But <i>Newsweek</i>'s business section, in the same issue, April 8, 
talked about the German system and the &quot;German disease&quot; --
12 percent unemployment rate, higher than that youth unemployment
rate, great concern, skinhead phenomena, a little bit of the kind
of Pink Floyd record, just another brick in the wall.

<p>

MS. EATON: The problem with the European model is when you take a kid 
in tenth grade or ninth grade and you train him for one job and then
that company goes bust or he gets fired for some reason, and he
is not prepared to shift to another corporation, to another job.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think we have gone for a broad vision in America.

<p>

You get our last comment.

<p>
MS. ADAMS:  Oh.  I have encouraged the CEOs that I have met, if they're 
going to work hard to improve their bottom line, they do as much as they 
can to lobby congress to enable parents to parent once again, whether 
that be increased tax exemptions or some method of reducing the $484 
billion a year that we spend on education rather foolishly right now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have been privileged to have you all with us, and I hope 
people will call for your standards, or you can call the Family Research
Council.

<p>

When you return, <i>Straight Talk</i> will show you a clip from
Gary Bauer's appearance on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>. We will hear what
Gary has to say about education.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i>.

<p>

Gary Bauer made an appearance on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i> following
a decision made by a Queens, New York, school superintendent who
advocated teaching first graders that the homosexual lifestyle
was the moral equivalent of marriage.  Gary met some hard and
fast opponents when discussing this issue with Bob Beckel(?) and
Deborah Haffner(?), executive director of the Sex Information
and Education Council.

<p>

Let's hear what Gary has to say as <i>Straight Talk</i> presents 
Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

[Segment from CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, December 8, 1992, follows:]

<p>

MR. BECKEL: -- Gary, two pages out of 430 or so in a recommended
curriculum.  You guys take this thing and the yahoos in Queens
take this thing, and they blow it into a big deal.  We talk about
it on television.  Isn't this really what -- let's talk about
it for what it is.  It's fodder for you guys to put in your direct
mail pieces to raise a lot of money to fund your right-wing causes
under the guise of pro-family, when really what you are is a reactionary
crowd who are cutting out a whole segment of society.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Bob, you know, you are in your usual emotionalism.  Nobody 
sent any direct mail to the Hispanic and black parents in the Queens
School District who are vehemently objecting to the idea that
their children ought to be taught that homosexuality is normal
and on a par with the heterosexual family.

<p>

If Deborah wants to read <i>Heather Has Two Mommies</i> to her children 
at home, that's her business.  But when she and Fernandez and others try 
to take our tax money to teach first graders that these are acceptable 
lifestyles, they are crossing a line that has nothing to do with direct 
mail.

<p>

You don't have a right to overrule parents when they feel uncomfortable
about teaching their children something.  The parents of Queens
have been very clear about this.  They don't want their 6- and
7-year-olds being taught about strange lifestyles.  They want
their kids to be taught reading, writing, the history of this
country.  If the schools in New York would do that, they would
turn out successful students.

<p>

MS. HAFFNER: Gary, what about --

<p>

MR. BAUER: I would love to see parents have a chance to vote
on that.

<p>

MR. BECKEL: The parents just decide everything in the school?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  On controversial social matters, parents ought
to have a right to tell how their tax dollars are going to be
used, not to vote on what history is going to be taught, not to
vote about what math is going to be taught, but when you get into
areas of values, parents have a right to have input.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the break.  Stay with 
us to hear how you can get more information regarding these issues 
affecting you and your family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. If you would like to receive more 
information about our organization, tonight's guests, or the topics 
discussed, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week we will be discussing an issue not often seen in secular 
news coverage:  religious liberty and Christian persecution around the 
world.  We will hear how thousands of people are sacrificing their 
lives for a faith which they refuse to deny because their government 
demands it. Could America be headed in that direction?  We'll find out 
next week as we bring you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick. Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
delves into an issue which Americans seem immune to, Christian 
persecution. Within the last year, many eyes have been truly opened 
through the people with whom we will speak tonight to the plight of 
Christians around the globe.

<p>

Last week a front-page <i>Washington Times</i> article
told of the tragic life of Robert Hussein.  In 1977 he had a brief
encounter with Christianity while in the United States, and he
decided to learn more by persistent Bible reading.  After much
thought, he accepted Christ as his personal savior.  Two years
ago, he publicly called himself a Christian and began witnessing
in his Islamic-run homeland.  Since then, Mr. Hussein has been
rejected by his family, including his two small children, arrested,
and threatened with death.  But his story is not unique, and you
will hear more about these tragedies and what is being done to
save these lives later in the show.

<p>

But, first, those of you watching the show are going to witness 
some Family Research Council history in the making.  Still under 
construction, a bit of FRC's future was taped just yesterday so 
<i>Straight Talk</i> viewers could get the inside scoop from Doug 
Werk, Vice President for Administration.

<p>

Thanks to the generosity of two Michigan families, FRC will go
a new direction later this year.  To learn more, let's go Behind
the Headlines.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Doug, a lot of people may wonder why we are standing here 
in front of the National Museum of American Art.  But this is a very
exciting location for Family Research Council's future, and you
as the Vice President for Administration have really been working
on a dream to make something happen.  Could you tell us why we
are here at G and Eighth Street?

<p>

MR. WERK: 801 G Street, Kristi, and you are absolutely right.  It really 
is a dream come true for us at Family Research Council, because we are 
in need of a new home, and this is where our new home is going to be. We 
are going to be the primary tenants of a building that I am going
to tell you about in just a few minutes.

<p>

But I want to point out why this particular place is so important, this 
particular area. Not only is this National Museum of Art a beautiful 
edifice, but over here you have the Martin Luther King Library, which is
important to the entire Washington, D.C., area.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It's a very big research library.

<p>

MR. WERK: Oh, it is, and a lot is accomplished there for this city.

<p>

On the opposite corner, cater-cornered in back of this new construction 
here, will be the home of the Secret Service, where we will have 2,900 
Secret Service agents patrolling this area.

<p>

You see that large building down at the end of the block there with the 
glass walkover. That's a large office complex, and there is also a huge 
shopping center there.

<p>

This is an historic church right there with that dome on
it.  This is the Baptist church of downtown Washington, D.C.,
Calvary Baptist Church, which happens to house the Young Life
for the District of Columbia.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A lot of our viewers are involved in Young Life, and that's 
an exciting organization.

<p>

MR. WERK:  It really is.  Chinatown, of course, is on the back
side.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One block over and there you are.

<p>

MR. WERK: One block and there you are.

<p>

But I think, also, we should point out that these large cranes over 
here are preparing the hole for the new sports arena complex. And so, 
right around the corner and down the block will be the brand new sports 
arena.  And so it is an exciting area and an exciting time for us as we 
prepare for our new home.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Take us through that building. We've got six floors, Doug. 
Maybe you could just run through what is going to be located on each 
floor, more or less, and then we are going to get to go see the site a 
little bit closer up.

<p>

MR. WERK:  There are a couple of things that I want to point out.
First of all, we could only go up so high.  We could only build
a building as tall as the National Museum of Art.  And so that's
the reason for the six floors.

<p>

Also, we had to put a certain amount of space into a museum. So the 
bottom floor is going to be all public-access area. On the right-hand 
side as you enter the building from G Street, we will have a museum, we 
will have some history not only of our country but history of the Family 
Research Council. We will have a bookstore there where folks can come 
and pick up materials that we produce, as well as outside materials.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There are some exciting things for kids to do there,
too, with computers.

<p>

MR. WERK:  Absolutely.  We'll have some interactive computers that 
the kids and all family members can use.

<p>

The second floor will be where the administrative group will have its 
offices. On the third floor we will have our resource development 
group. The fourth floor will be our executive wing, where Gary Bauer
will be housed, and also, we will be able to have our board of
directors' meetings in a very large conference room.

<p>

The fifth floor is policy group, and a lot of the research and analysis
work will be done on the fifth floor. And the sixth floor is kind
of an area where --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To be announced.

<p>

MR. WERK: To be announced.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are here on the actual site right now with Andy 
Busey(?), who is our project superintendent kind of managing the site, 
and I know Doug has said great things about you. How long does a 
six-floor building like this -- we've got one level of parking -- how 
long does something like this normally take?

<p>

MR. BUSEY: Generally about a year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: About a year. So our project -- how are we doing on our time
frame?

<p>

MR. BUSEY: Oh, we're doing pretty good.  We are going to
be right in there, a little bit less than that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, it's exciting.  Andy, thanks so much, and we're going 
to look forward to seeing the building.

<p>

MR. BUSEY: All right. Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So, Doug, we are on the fourth floor, which
is as high as they would like us to go and still be safe.

<p>

Well, Doug, we are standing in a building that has represented your
passion and your time and really a life's work, in a way.  What
are you most looking forward to?

<p>

MR. WERK: I think I am looking forward to the day when we can cut the 
ribbon and actually take possession and see what God has for us here in 
Washington to further the work that we do.  That's going to be exciting 
for me. It's going to be the culmination of a lot of earnest, hard 
effort, and I am excited to see the excitement of our people as we 
move over here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And for our friends and supporters from
across the country who are going to be seeing this segment, when
can they come to Washington and see this building that you have
been working on?

<p>

MR. WERK:  I am hopeful that we will move in sometime in the first 
two weeks of November, and shortly after that, we are going to have 
a ribbon-cutting for our staff and invited guests.  Then we are going to 
have an open house, and we are going to invite any and all that would 
want to see our home, not only in the District but from across the 
country. So that is going to be fun to do, probably before the end of 
the year and the winter sets in again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, when they do, I hope that our friends and supporters 
take the time to write to Doug Werk and let him know what a great job he 
has done. Thanks so much for being with us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

MR. WERK:  Thanks for having me, Kristi. Appreciate it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares with you a man who courageously raised his voice for those who 
have no voices of their own as they suffered persecution for their 
faith. Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Every week, millions of Americans put on their Sunday 
best and attend the church service of their choice, whether it be 
Catholic, Protestant, Episcopal, Baptist, or any other denomination. 
For the many Americans who walk up those church steps or sit in a 
synagogue pew or conduct weekly Bible studies in their homes, it can 
be easy to take for granted the freedom to worship that we share with 
our countrymen.

<p>

Only recently in cases such as school prayer have Americans even
questioned their religious liberty.  Yet, throughout the world,
millions of people daily risk their lives by taking a stand for
their belief in Jesus Christ.  Persecution, including torture,
slavery, exile, and death, tests the faith of those who refuse
to deny their savior, and their stories are told in headlines
from the <i>New York Times</i> to church bulletins.

<p>

In Sudan alone, 1.5 million people died at the hands of Islamic rulers, 
and at least 25,000 children, some as young as six years old, have 
been documented as being sold into slavery.  These outrageous acts of 
persecution sweep across the continents, from the Middle East to Thailand,
to Africa, to China.

<p>

Recently the Clinton Administration has been criticized for ignoring 
these atrocities while conducting business as usual with those who 
perform them.  In testimony before the House International Relations 
Subcommittee earlier this year, witnesses presented a cry for help 
for the lives of those suffering and for U.S. involvement in stopping 
the slaughter.

<p>

[Congressional testimony segment follows:]

<p>

WITNESS: So far, the U.S, Government has largely turned a deaf ear 
to this rising tide of terrorism and these human rights violations.

<p>

[End of congressional testimony segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yet, today, little has changed.  As government
officials mull over these proceedings and lives continue to be
lost, people of faith consider the words of the psalmist:  &quot;For
your sake, we face death all day long.  We are considered sheep
to be slaughtered.&quot;

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As we just saw, and as shocking as it may seem, millions 
continue to lose their lives for their faith even today.  To share with 
us an expos&eacute; of these worldwide travesties is Michael Horowitz, a 
senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and director of the Project for 
Civil Justice Reform.  Welcome to the show.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Glad to be here. Where's your helmet, by the way?  You left 
it somewhere.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I left my helmet in the office.

<p>

Michael, I can't think of anyone better to talk to us about what is 
happening to people of faith around the world, and it is ironic that 
that job is distilled almost to one man.  How did you get involved 
with that?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, you have overstated it.  There's a
growing army of people.  It has in a way been easier for me to
do it, and really, to answer your question, I'm a Jew, and it
has been much easier for me, therefore, to blow the whistle, to
prod, to provoke, and to shame Christian leaders into taking the
kind of action they can.

<p>

You know, we have people, like the people
coming on your next segment, who have been the flickering candles
trying to keep this word alive.  My job has been to broadcast
the extraordinary work that they have done, and I have been one
of many in doing it.  But as a Jew, it has been easier in many
ways for me to do it, and for one particular reason.  Christians
around the world today have become the targets of choice for the
thug regimes around the world, the radical Muslim regimes, the
remnant Communist regimes.

<p>

What is going on with Christians, particularly
evangelicals and Catholics, is so similar to what happened with
Jews in Europe as Hitler came to power.  Three things.

<p>

<li>First, the bad guys could demonize them.  They're different. They 
provoke envy, and they're powerless.  And, also, they represent -- 
Christians do -- threats to these thug regimes.  Because of their 
faith, they're beyond the reach of bribes and threats, which is what
these regimes live on.

<p>

<li>Two, the elites -- governments -- don't care.  At our best, our 
government has been indifferent.  Typically, we have been hostile to 
the claims of Christians who have been persecuted.  You know, the
elites in Washington, when they think Christians, they think,
Oh, these are the persecutors.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, that is how they are described time and time 
again.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Sure. And in Bosnia, a terrible story, just fills all of 
their predispositions.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  But the idea that Christians are the victims -- as 
indeed they are, more than any other group in the world, and by orders 
of magnitude, and reigns of terror against them are growing -- is so 
foreign to the way Washington insiders and elites and national media 
tend to think, that we have been hostile to them.

<p>

<li>And, finally, the Christian community has been silent, just as the 
Jewish community was as Hitler began to rise to power.  And I'm not 
going to let that happen as long as I have any voice within me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You said earlier that although the Christians are 
powerless, they are envied in these countries.  Why would they be 
envied?  If they're powerless, if they are merely trying to live 
moral, quiet lives, what provokes envy?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, of course, they are successful to the
extent they are given a chance to be.  They live lives of faith.
They are powerless against mob sentiment whipped up against them.
Within their communities, often you find charges of apostasy
being weighed in against good, popular, successful teachers, successful
businessmen.  It's easy to get your competitor out of business
if you wave and scream, call him a Christian, then get a bunch
of mobs to burn down his home.  And that's what is going on.

<p>

Governments around the world are spending millions to make tapes, 
scurrilous tapes, calling Christians evil, worse than that, and these 
tapes are circulating.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Not unlike the films the Nazi government
made.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Precisely, precisely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Have you been surprised, after what we witnessed in the 
Holocaust -- and it has got to be the most documented event in history, 
the demonization of a race and a faith to the point that they could
justify that kind of mass murder.  But then we see today Christians
in the Sudan being crucified, murdered, sold into slavery.  Are
you surprised that this could happen again, it seems to me very
quickly?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Nothing surprises me on this Earth. When
good men and women remain silent, anything is possible.

<p>

Now, again, we don't have that kind of holocaust that the Jews 
experienced except, as you point out, in Sudan.  It's getting there. 
As Nina will say, as Mr. Jacobson will say, we've got as many as 
30,000 Christian children yanked from their homes by a radical 
Muslim regime and sold into slavery.  That's going on.  And yet 
here's Farrakhan going to the head of Sudan and calling himself a 
great ally and no voice raised against it.

<p>

Well, we've got to raise our voices.  And when we do, as we are now 
beginning to do, as the Christian community is beginning to do, people 
are listening. The <i>Washington Post</i> the other day had an 
extraordinary column entitled &quot;Christians Have Rights, Too.&quot; 
The writer, who is the deputy editor of the editorial page, said that 
we in the <i>Post</i>, in the media, are responsible for not taking 
seriously these kinds of claims, and he said that this was an important
movement.  He called it the most interesting foreign policy issue
of 1996, and he said if the Christian community organizes, it
will make foreign policy harder with Saudi Arabia, with China,
but, he said, lives will be saved. And I think we're going to
save some lives here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a Jewish gentleman, you are correct, your voice rings 
even more resolutely when you speak on these things, and there has 
been a kind of quiet growth of a partnership of Jewish men and women 
of faith with Christian men and women of faith.  You look at the 
Judeo-Christian heritage. It's easy to understand why.  And yet that 
has not been common. Why do you think there has been that quiet 
gathering, and why you particularly?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I think, in the wake of
the Holocaust, the Christian community has understood the price
that always gets paid, ultimately, when there is a kind of religious
bias that goes on.  But there is something else that has happened
that has been so interesting in this case.

<p>

As I began to write about the persecution of Christians, I would be 
greeted with silence from the Christian community, and I would say to 
some of the leaders of the Christian community, &quot;You know, if I 
had written about anti-Semitism going on, you would be overwhelming me 
with phone calls saying, 'How can we help?'&quot;  Because the 
campaign against Soviet anti-Semitism, one of the most successful human 
rights campaigns in recent history, would not have been possible without
the active commitment of the Christian community.  And so I said,
&quot;How can you be so powerful, so caring, so moral, so strong
in your voice when Jews have been involved, as they were in the
Soviet Union, and so silent when your own are at stake?&quot;

<p>

That question cannot really be answered, and I think it has been
one of the things that has moved leaders of the Christian community
to the kind of action they have taken.  Now we have people like
Jim Dobson, Gary.  Chuck Colson has been an extraordinary leader.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: A powerful voice.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Richard Land of the Southern Baptists; they have begun 
raising their voices. And the National Association of Evangelicals 
issued an extraordinary statement of conscience on this subject.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more about this in a second. 

<p>

Please join us after the commercial break as we share with you more 
courageous and tragic stories of those standing for their faith. Stay 
with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research 
Council</i>. I am joined by people who have witnessed the horrors of 
Christian persecution and are making efforts to save lives around the 
world. I welcome back Michael Horowitz, director of the Project for 
Civil Justice Reform; James Jacobson, president of Christian 
Solidarity International; and Nina Shea, director of Freedom House's 
Puebla Program on Religious Freedom.  Thank you for being with us, 
everyone.

<p>

We were just talking with Michael at the beginning about kind of the 
context in which we have found silence.  But you all certainly have not
been silent, and your voices are being heard more loudly.

<p>

Nina, let's start with you.  Your organization focuses on the kinds
of tangible persecution that occurs.  What have you all witnessed?

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is correct, Kristi.  We have been monitoring and
testifying in Congress, writing about persecution of Christians
in China, in Vietnam and Sudan.  We have sent missions to these
places.  China has one of the largest Christian movements in the
world today, rivaling our own, and they are the most persecuted
in the world in China. China has more Christians in prison than
any other country in the world, and we have cases, for example,
of one man who is an evangelical Protestant who is in prison now
for three years because he, quote, propagated the book of Genesis.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What does that mean?  Because you hear propagation
of the gospel and proselytizing.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  He was simply holding a Bible study session in his home. 
It's called the house church movement. They are underground. They are 
arrested and punished severely if they are caught.  So they are not 
allowed to have their churches.  They meet in their homes and read the 
Bible, they sign hymns.

<p>

Mike Horowitz is absolutely right in saying that
the West has been indifferent to the fate of these people.  Our
own Ambassador Sasser went to China this winter, in February.
I met with him a few days before he went, and he had never even
heard of the house church movement at the time that I met with
him.  That was a couple of days before he left.  Though he was
well briefed on other important human rights issues in China,
he had never heard of the house church movement and knew nothing;
he was totally ignorant about the fact that they are being persecuted.

<p>

We have another person in prison on our case list, in our database,
from China who was simply praying without authorization, was the
charge against him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So what? They have to apply for a permit to pray?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How can you pray with authorization?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  They have to register with a Communist, atheist-controlled 
organization in order to pray.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And then the penalty for that would be prison.
I prayed without the permit.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Prison.  Prison and hard labor. They are forced to work 
virtually as slaves in motorcycle factories, in brick factories, 
for 13 years, 20 years, indefinite sentences, because there is no 
due process in China.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to want to go to James and hear a little bit 
about the Sudan, but I wanted to touch first on -- it has to be 
frustrating, then, for you, with China, to have most favored nation 
status, to consistently get economic benefits while at the same time we
see huge human rights violations.

<p>

There was actually a cartoon -- I think it was in the <i>Washington 
Post</i> this week -- where it showed Bill Clinton straddling two boats. 
One said &quot;China's Economic Future&quot;; one said &quot;China's 
Human Rights Violations,&quot; and he was doing a little splits, 
trying to hold the two together.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  That's right.  Well, unless and until the Christian
churches raise their voices, human rights is always going to lose
out in the MFN debate, because the commercial interests are intense,
and they are lobbying, and the Christian voices are very weak
at this point.  We must start speaking out for our brethren who
are being persecuted in China and in Sudan and in Vietnam.  We
have a lot of influence in Vietnam, a lot of influence in Saudi
Arabia, where there is not a single Christian church allowed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MS. SHEA: Even our own -- and this is another example of insensitivity 
of the West -- even American citizens are not being defended by our 
government in their right to practice religious freedom.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, Saudi Arabia is an interesting example where the 
embassy recently said that they were going to fight the government to 
be sure that pornography was distributed in Saudi Arabia, which was 
against their faith, but they went ahead and shut down the on-base, 
on-embassy church because that was offensive.  An interesting kind of 
decision to make.

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is right, yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sudan, though, I know has been chilling a lot of people 
because prison and torture, these things are real and terrible, and we 
are hearing about crucifixions from Sudan.  What has your organization, 
James, found to be true?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Yes.  Christians around the world need our help,
support, and prayers now more than ever.  We really welcome Mr.
Horowitz and his voice crying out in the wilderness, basically,
on this issue.

<p>

In Sudan, though, the horrors of radical Islam
are really magnified there like never before.  We have a situation
where the government of Sudan is controlled by this radical group
called the National Islamic Front, and anybody that doesn't convert
to their radical branch of Islam is basically -- they must convert
or die.  We have tremendous, incredible stories coming out of
Sudan.  My organization has spent a great deal of time there with
workers in the country doing everything we can to help alleviate
the situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have to think that those workers are in fear for their 
own lives while they are there.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: Absolutely.  They risk their own lives and livelihoods. 
A lot of our co-workers have families, and we have a lot of prayer 
before they go in.  We really emphasize that, prayer protection before
they go into these places.

<p>

But in Sudan we have a situation where, that we know of, about 1.5 
million people have been killed.  We have a situation where there 
are between 5 and 6 million refugees. My organization can confirm 
about 25,000 children that have been taken into slavery.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And when you say taken into slavery, there have been 
some recent articles about sex slaves, labor slaves.  What kind of 
slavery, if you could be, unfortunately, more graphic for our 
viewers?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Yes.  I don't know how graphic I should be for this, 
but you can just imagine.  It is true. The young ladies are taken 
and used as sex slaves, concubines. The young men, they are used as 
things such as human blood banks for the army of the National Islamic 
Front.  Slave branding goes on. Every type of just horrible job, these 
slaves are given.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Mike, you were talking earlier about a lot of people
hear what is happening in Sudan and see some of the Islamic countries
being so brutal and are fearful of some of what that means in
terms of the impact of the Islamic faith.  But you had a point
that you wanted to make on that.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I am so glad you raised it, because what is really 
going on here is an effort by crazy, radical thugs to hijack one of the 
great faiths of the world.  For much of its history, Islam was as 
welcoming of strangers as Judaism and Christianity; in some decades even
more so.  And so what you have are these radical guys using religion
to perpetrate murder and intolerance.  That is what is really
going on.

<p>

One of the most compelling things that has come out
of this effort that we have been making are the voices we have
heard from the moderate Muslims in these countries who are also
targets of death by these thugs, and they say to us, &quot;Thank
God you're raising it.  Create a constituency in America to protect
the weakest, to stand up to these thugs, and we will be protected.
Democracy will be preserved.&quot;

<p>

That is the case always. When thugs want to practice murder and 
death and kill democracy, what they do is pick a vulnerable 
religious community and make them scapegoats and torture them.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is an interesting trend.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Stop that; you've stopped the thugs.  And
that is what the Muslims are telling us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nina, I know that you have seen these same kinds of things, 
this horrific abuse of faith to kill those who don't convert.  What are 
you seeing as you look worldwide?  What trends are moving your 
organization?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Well, what we are seeing is, in the aftermath of the
Cold War, Christian persecution coming to the fore, and it is
emerging in the remnant Communist countries.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why do you think that is?  Why the remnant Communist 
countries?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  They are terrified of Christian churches because they have
a transcendent truth.  They do not believe that the Communist
Party and the Communist ideology is their ultimate power.  And
they also resist corruption and bribery and uphold the dignity
of the individual, which is an anathema to Communist ideology.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So a democracy that might be based on faith -- you
know, &quot;We hold these truths to be self-evident&quot; -- that
is threatening.

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And we are going to have to hear more about this in a 
second.  I want to come back to that point. When <i>Straight Talk</i> 
returns, we will hear more about efforts to fight global Christian 
persecution and how you can become involved in helping save lives. 
Join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. I would like to welcome once again tonight's 
guests, who are battling for the lives of those standing for their 
religious faith around the world: Michael Horowitz, James Jacobson, 
and Nina Shea.  Welcome back to the show.

<p>

For people who are connoisseurs of news, which I
must say our viewers really are, when you are looking at the newspaper,
trouble spots come to mind.  I would say we would all agree that
Sudan would seem to be the most egregious example of what is going
on.  But what else?  Where else in the country should people be
watching?

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Great swaths of the Middle East and Northern
Africa, in the Muslim world; for example, Algeria, Saudi Arabia,
Pakistan, even Egypt, Iraq, Iran.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Very powerful and in the news.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: I would only add here, it's not only the official 
government action.  Often you have, quote, friendly
governments like Pakistan, like Ethiopia, with which I am particularly
familiar, where the government is weak and appeases the radical
terrorists.  And when we are silent here, it means there is only
one squeaky wheel on that issue, and so the terrorists are given
rein.  So Egypt, Pakistan, and Ethiopia are three countries where
the presidents of the countries probably would abhor that kind
of thing and yet where the terror is phenomenal and growing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It has been interesting to see the Clinton Administration
commend the leaders of some of these very countries that seem
to be most appalling, and we are certainly seeing Bill Clinton
right now reach out particularly to China and Asia, and that seems --

<p>

MS. SHEA: That is right.  China and Vietnam are two big abusers
of religious freedom for Christians.

<p>

That brings up another point, which is the insensitivity of the 
administration in certain aspects regarding Christian persecution. 
For example, political asylum. Christians have a very difficult 
time getting political asylum in this country.  We know of a case 
of a Sudanese Christian whose employer was assassinated for his 
faith.  He was told by his bishop to leave the country to save his 
life.  He got here, and he has been in an immigration prison for the 
last three years awaiting deportation. His application was turned 
down because he could not define the doctrine of transubstantiation, 
a doctrine which Catholic priests study for a year in theology school, 
to the satisfaction of an immigration judge.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Think of this, Kristi.  This is a country founded as a 
haven for victims of religious persecution.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: And here we are turning, shutting the gates to Christian
victims of persecution.  You know, the administration has issued
guidelines saying that if somebody has, if a woman has a feminist
complaint, and they are often real, open the doors.  But I once
went to one of the leading immigration lawyers, told her about
a case of my Ethiopian friend whose has been hung upside down
for hours as pastor of the leading secret evangelical church,
had hot oil poured on his feet, had his feet lashed with steel
cables, was arrested after he returned to Ethiopia after years
of exile, told the immigration lawyer about it.  I said, &quot;Can
you get asylum for him?&quot;  She said, &quot;Can he pass through
the eye of a needle?&quot;  That is really what our government
is doing.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  In our organization, we are trying to
get the administration to do something even more basic than immigration
policy, and that is just to recognize that these things are going
on.  They ignore it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly. To acknowledge it.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Just to acknowledge it.  We want them to recognize
it and condemn it.

<p>

One of the activities that we have launched into is a national 
petition drive on Sudan.  We just want President
Clinton to speak out on behalf of these persecuted Christians
in Sudan.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You can hear the President talk about
opening the doors for asylum for homosexuals and opening the doors
for asylum possibly for women who face female circumcision, but
not for Christians being crucified.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: That is correct.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  A perfect example of that was at the Beijing Women's
Conference that the United Nations held last summer.  That conference
produced a 127-page document on abuses against women around the
world, and they were all sorts of abuses, everything from environmental
to financial abuses, and so forth, spousal abuse.

<p>

There was not a single mention of chattel slavery in that document. To 
me that would be absolutely the first thing I would put in there, is the
fact that Christian women and girls are being sold into slavery
for as little as $15, the price of two chickens, in Sudan.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And you would think that would be offensive.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: And the First Lady is so outspoken on children's rights 
and children's issues.  Why is she ignoring 25,000 children being enslaved 
in Sudan?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Exactly.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: It is beyond imagination, really.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  But, you know, one of the things -- I am
not even looking for the administration to recognize the problem;
I want the President to live up to promises that his administration
made as our movement first began and then reneged on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And there was pivotal meeting on that.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. We had a great meeting that Nina hosted with 
Christian leaders from around the country. Jim was there.  Major 
Christian leaders of major churches with major ministries.  Gary Bauer 
was, of course, there.

<p>

After that movement, the President and the administration made 
two commitments:  one, that they would appoint an advisor to the 
President for religious persecution, with real power to
investigate and report; and, two, that he would make a speech
to the National Association of Evangelicals on the subject.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Two rather simple things.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Yes. After the president of the National Association was 
called into the Oval Office to speak with the President, who said, 
&quot;I'd like to do it,&quot; two weeks later, the NAE got a phone call 
from the White House saying, &quot;You know, we don't think the President
can do it.  There's not enough money in his budget to fly to your
convention in Minneapolis,&quot; said a White House official to
the NAE.

<p>

We want to hold the feet of the President to the fire.
You know, he could have been such a hero, even in political terms,
to the Christian community.  And yet the lobbyists from the State
Department, from Saudi Arabia, from the business-as-usual crowd
in China got to him.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: Well, he would have been a hero if he had done it, and I 
would have happily participated in helping the President gain credit 
for doing the right thing. He is doing the wrong thing.  We need to
hold his feet to the fire.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes.  There was apparently money to fly to the sticks 
to throw a log in a ditch but not money to fly to talk about 
Christians being sold and murdered.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: To make matters worse, as Nina mentioned earlier, we have 
an ambassador to China who has never heard of the house church movement.
So not only do they not live up to promises, but they send an
ambassador there that has never heard of the house church movement
in China, which is amazing.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Richard Land, who is the director of the Christian 
Life Commission of the Southern Baptist Church, in congressional 
testimony, made a striking proposition which Chuck Colson has agreed 
to and many of us are thinking about, and that is, let's have a 
couple of million Christians write letters to the White House saying, 
&quot;Come home, Jim Sasser, to take a little seminar on the house 
church movement.&quot; There may be more evangelical Christians in 
China than there are in the United States today, all underground 
and persecuted.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems likely, doesn't it, Nina?

<p>

MS. SHEA: Yes.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: And let's keep him here until he passes a pop quiz and 
knows what is going on about it.  That would send such a neat signal
to all of the State Department wet-finger-in-the-air crowd.  Ignore
the fate of Christians at your peril, friend.

<p>

So I think we are going to look to do that.  I think we are also 
hoping to organize, and Nina is also going to host a meeting in May to 
see if we can organize a Christian persecution Sunday in this country --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Fascinating. Good idea.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: -- to have thousands of pulpits talking about this on 
some Sunday in September.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: On some Sunday in September. You know, <i>Straight 
Talk</i> viewers will have to get an update on that.

<p>

What can people do? I think it is clear that, number one, they could 
write the President. And as we near the end of our segment, what else 
could people do?  They could call you all.  Give your phone number. 
You have this card to talk about this.

<p>

MR. JACOBSON: Right. Just give us a call. We have a simple 800 number. 
It is 1-800-323-CARE. That is 1-800-323-2273.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And what will you ask of them?

<p>

MR. JACOBSON:  Well, first of all, we'll put them on our
monthly newsletter mailing list.  They will get a free newsletter
every month that talks about religious oppression around the world,
what they can do about it.  We have a series of petition drives
each month that they can participate in.  We ask people to pray.
That is the most important thing, first of all, is to pray for
persecuted Christians around the world.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Nina, you have a phone number as well.  Give the phone 
number and tell us what will happen.

<p>

MS. SHEA:  Yes.  Okay.  Our number is 202-296-5101,
and you can call collect, and we will put you on our mailing list
as well, and you will get an urgent action alert every time we
hear of a new case of a Christian either imprisoned or tortured
somewhere or someone who is dying in prison from pneumonia or
some disease, who is in a critical situation.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ: I cannot begin to tell you what heroes these people are. 
They have been at it when nobody was listening.  That is the real test 
of a good person.  These are the people who go to heaven, the people
who do it without glory and keep it alive, and it is because of
their effort --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you hope will change, Mike?

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  Well, I think we want to make this country sensitive
to the fact that there is this persecution going on, because,
you know, the great human rights issue as we enter the 21st century
is religious persecution.  The great hope for the 21st century
for my children, so that it not be as bloody a century as the
20th century was, is that free men and women can worship God.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MR. HOROWITZ:  If God is alive in the 21st
century, my kids are going to safe.  We weren't so safe in a century
in which God was said to be dead.  So we are really talking about
the freedom of all people, not only Christians, in the effort
to protect these Christians around the world who have become the
targets and the symbols of what freedom is all about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank all my guests and note we had hoped 
to have a pastor on who had suffered persecution and, unfortunately,
could not because he might have been tracked down by the Immigration
Service here and deported, even though he is here saving his very
life by that.

<p>

Thank you, my fine guests.  I hope you will call
or write.  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shows you how religious
liberty is being defended in the United States as we hear testimony
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.

<p>

Cathy Cleaver, FRC's Director of Legal Policy,
testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee last fall, supporting
an amendment which would prohibit discrimination against religious
expression.  Let's hear what Cathy has to say as <i>Straight 
Talk</i> presents Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

[Segment from Testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee,
October 25, 1995, follows:]

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: On behalf of Gary Bauer and the Family Research 
Council, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the 
opportunity to address this distinguished committee on the critical 
issue of religious liberty.  I also want to appreciate, Mr. Chairman, 
your having these hearings. We think they are vital.

<p>

The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent. The Establishment 
Clause was designed to prevent the State from coercing a religious 
belief.  The Free Exercise Clause was designed to prevent the State 
from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.  Thus, the 
religion clauses were designed to work hand in hand to promote 
government neutrality with regard to religion.

<p>

In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly 
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The Court 
has created a false conflict between the religion clauses, which must 
be reconciled in each case, and the Establishment Clause prohibition 
has been the usual victor.

<p>

On October 20, this committee heard testimony from a distinguished
panel of experts who discussed the history of interpretation errors
in First Amendment religious clause jurisprudence and the efforts
to correct those errors by federal statutes.  I will not repeat
this testimony, nor will I refute the argument that nothing need
be done, for the acceptability of that position is increasing
waning.

<p>

I also won't discuss the issue of government-sponsored
or teacher-led prayer, and I think it doesn't serve this debate
to continue to debate that issue.  It is not the issue being promoted
or supported.  It is not being presented to this committee, and
it is not being supported by legal experts who favor an amendment
or a federal statute.  So I think it would do us all well to stop
arguing that; no one is arguing it in earnest.

<p>

I will attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional amendment 
rather than a federal statute and address certain specific concerns 
that have been raised in the public debate.

<p>

The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the Constitution 
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination against 
religious expression and against persons, groups, or organizations in 
access to government benefits or protections on account of the religious 
character or their speech or identity.

<p>

We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather, we 
support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's 
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.

<p>

For purposes of discussion this morning, I will center my comments
on the draft proposal garnering considerable support and presented
to this committee on October 20.  It is the proposal, the second
amendment that Senator Biden read earlier.

<p>

This language would, in effect, say to the government, do not 
discriminate against persons on account of their religious beliefs; 
and to the Supreme Court, do not construe this non-discriminatory 
treatment to be a government establishment of religion.

<p>

The fact that some civil liberty groups call this amendment extreme 
does not make it so. It is a negative mandate upon government: do 
not discriminate and do not misconstrue.  It bestows no new rights; 
it apportions no new responsibilities.

<p>

Some suggest that the Court is coming
around on its own, obviating the need for an amendment.  I would
say that the 5-4 decisions from the Supreme Court do nothing to
advance the notion that things are clear in this area; that we
have statements from Justice Souter saying that the government
need not be neutral toward religion; and other things that do
not suggest that we are through debating this issue.  The Religious
Liberty Amendment could be thought of as a religious amendment.

<p>

In closing, this principle of neutrality is not new; it is the
aim and result of our First Amendment's religion clauses, properly
understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment could restore this
saving principle so that our First Amendment would not be used
to promote the empty state religion of secularism but to promote
true freedom and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth,
to which every American is entitled.

<p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>.  I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.  
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> presents two incredible women who 
have committed themselves to making a difference.  Theirs is 
not a random sentiment but a focused love for those children 
who have suffered the most severe physical, emotional, and 
sexual abuse.

<p>

Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson founded 
Childhelp USA more than 20 years ago, and it has become the 
largest national nonprofit child abuse treatment and 
prevention organization.  We had the opportunity to visit 
the Alice C. Tyler Village of Childhelp East to see how 
children's lives are benefitting from Sara and Yvonne's life 
work and the work of Childhelp staff and volunteers from 
across America.  You won't want to miss seeing the 270-acre 
Virginia facility that houses children ranging from 2 years 
old to 12 years old. 

<p>

Like the more than 3 million other children who 
endure abuse each year, these children long for healing, 
both physically and emotionally.  Tonight's show will help 
you understand why Childhelp USA serves as a lifeline to 
suffering children across our nation. 

<p>

In addition to the staff of Childhelp USA, the 
volunteers provide a crucial aspect in the healing of abused 
children, from organizing fund-raising events to purchasing 
a child's birthday gift.  I had the opportunity to talk to 
Connie Olsen, a vice president of the Childhelp USA Board of 
Directors, Chairman of the Alice C. Tyler Village of 
Childhelp East, and wife of someone close to us here at 
Family Research Council, Phil Olsen, Vice President of 
Resource Development. 

<p>

Connie's Childhelp involvement began in California 
and continues here on the East Coast and nationwide.  So let 
us now bring you an inspirational story not often heard in 
the broadcast or print news coverage as we take you Behind 
the Headlines.

<p>

</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Connie, you're a national board 
member with Childhelp.  There are a lot of good 
organizations.  This is certainly a phenomenal one. 
But why this one?  Why did you choose it? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I graduated from social work from 
Utah State University, and when I had children I stayed 
home, and when my youngest one was 4 years old, I started 
looking for something outside the home, a charity to get 
involved in, and someone approached me and asked if I wanted 
to be a part of a chapter in Orange County, California, to 
raise funds for an organization called Childhelp USA for 
battered and abused children.

<p>

So I did a little bit of research, found out what 
they did, what they were about, and thought, This is for me. 
This sounds great.  So I took a tour of the Village and 
joined the chapter.  That was in 1981. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So as a person who had not been 
involved full time in working with abused children, what 
impressed you about Childhelp?

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think the thing that impressed me 
the most was the dedication of the volunteers, as well as, 
when I took a tour of the Village, the dedication of the 
childcare workers that worked with the children.  I could 
see that they were really there not because they were 
burdened by what has happened to these children but because 
they really felt there was hope for them, and I was so 
impressed with the process that they used with the children 
to try to heal them.  That is what really impressed me. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As a board member, what are your 
goals for Childhelp? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  The goals that I have as a board 
member are to try to help raise the funds to do the 
necessary treatment that is necessary for the children, from 
the art therapy to the animal therapy to excursions for the 
children, to anything that is needed to help them build 
their self-esteem, get a good education. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You have gotten to see some really 
troubled kids come into this program.  I mean, how would you 
describe the lives that you have seen so that people can 
understand the kind of trauma we are talking about? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  Well, as I think you have probably 
been told, the children that we get at the Village out here, 
their last resort is a psychiatric ward.  So the average age 
of our children right now is age 5 and 6.  They are really 
young.  We have children that have just finished their last 
dose of chemotherapy.  We have children that are 
handicapped. 

<p>

You look at these cute little beings, and you just 
look at the trauma that they have been through already, and 
they are only 5 and 6 years old.  It just touches your heart 
and makes you feel so good.  Even if it is as a volunteer, 
there are just certain things that you can do, whether or 
not to go to a toy store and get different donations for the 
therapy that they have in art or whatever it might be.  But 
the cases are severely abused. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What makes the biggest difference in 
the lives of these kids? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think it is the fact that they 
realize that when they come here that they are not going to 
fail, and the staff knows that they are not going to fail, 
that they are going to work with them until they are 
successful, and they don't accept failure.  And I think that 
that is probably, for many of these children, the first time 
that they have ever gotten that feeling from an adult. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there any special child that 
comes to mind that you labor for here at Childhelp USA? 

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  When I lived in California, I was a 
special friend to a little 4-year-old girl.  One of the 
other reasons I got involved with Childhelp was that I could 
involve my children, too, in the process.  And so we had 
this little 4-year-old girl who was our special friend, and 
we were able to take her on different excursions away from 
the Village.  So even now, after -- that was in 1984, and 
even now, I think about that little girl and -- she had been 
sexually abused -- and the things that she had gone through. 

<p>

Even as a volunteer, you get tired, and you are 
knocking on doors, and you get people slamming the door in 
your face sometimes, and you are just a volunteer.  But when 
you think back at the children and why you are there, I 
think that is the special thing in your heart that keeps you 
going.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What one thing would you like people 
to know about Childhelp USA?  This is the first time maybe 
they have even heard of it.

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  I think the most important thing is 
that they really care for children, and they sacrifice and 
do anything that they can do to really make that child feel 
better about themselves, learn forgiveness, and understand 
what happened to them the best way that they can.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Connie, thank you so much for being 
with us on <i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

MRS. OLSEN:  Thank you for asking me.  This was 
great.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares with you two women who are dedicated 
to the prevention, treatment, and research of child abuse.
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I had the opportunity to visit a 
wonderful facility where abused children find a home and a 
safe haven, and I also had the chance to meet with two women 
who made it all possible for these abused children to 
receive healing. 

<p>

Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson were 
introduced to the critical need for such an organization 
more than 25 years ago, and <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes 
you on a visit to the East Coast Childhelp USA Village. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA: Childhelp is one of the leading 
organizations fighting child abuse across America.  We deal 
in research, prevention, treatment, and we are trying to 
make a difference in this world and turn these children that 
have been abused into wonderful citizens where they will not 
continue that abuse, that cycle, and we are making great 
headway.

<p>

We are very thrilled that so many people in this 
country now are aware of child abuse, because when we 
started our efforts in that direction, very few people knew 
about it, nor were they really sure that it was happening.  
And so the laws have changed, the issues are at hand, people 
know exactly where to go most of the time for help.  We have 
the National Child Abuse Hot Line, 1-800-4-ACHILD, and 
people can call there for help, whether an adult or a child 
in distress. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you say your goal is to stop 
the cycle of abuse.  So what do you mean by that?  I mean, 
these children come in and they are injured.  What kind of 
cycle would go on? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, we try to turn that child 
around.  The first thing you do is deal with their self-
esteem and build their potential where they know that they 
are a human being that is loved.  They have been told so 
frequently that they're a bad kid.  They're the ones taken 
out of the home, and so they feel that they're the ones that 
have done something wrong.  You have to assure them that 
they are a loved individual that can give back to this 
world.  And once you deal with them in therapy and in 
treatment and give them what they need to become whole 
again, you can turn a child around.  In fact, it is easier 
to turn a child around than it is an adult sometimes; in 
fact, most of the time.  They are like little sponges that 
take to heart the love and the care. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Their self-esteem is just rock-bottom 
when they arrive, and we try to make them feel good 
about themselves, and whatever is their interest, we try to 
work with them and build that, whether it is art or animals 
or whatever; it all plays a part of their self-esteem. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, people need to understand we 
are not talking about children who are having trouble 
reading.  Childhelp deals with a special kind of child.  
What kind of child would be involved in the program? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, these are the most difficult 
cases, children that really can't fit into an ordinary 
foster home, as an example.  In fact, many of them have had 
failed placements, as they call them.  They are like rubber 
balls going from foster home to foster homes because the 
foster homes are not always trained to care for these 
children.  They are not therapists, and these are children 
that are hard-core cases that need to be dealt with in the 
milieu that we have at our villages of Childhelp. 

<p>

The staff is tremendous in these villages.  They 
have to have a lot of care.  They have to have a great deal 
of patience, and they do wonderful work in turning these 
children around, and these are, as you say, not ordinary, 
just the ordinary child-abuse cases, so to speak; these are 
children that really come from mental hospitals quite 
frequently because of their emotional impact or, if they did 
not go to the villages, would end up in a hospital such as 
that.  So they definitely are hard core. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You know, also, a great part of 
the healing is love, and the staff really have a lot of love 
in their heart for these children, and we have had children 
who have arrived and they couldn't walk, they couldn't talk, 
and it's wonderful to see the staff work with these children 
and get them to walk, and maybe they are 2 and 3 years old 
and they're still in diapers.  But it's wonderful the love 
that they give these children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  These are children that have been 
molested, been abused, been beaten, been severely neglected 
and are generally underdeveloped on a multitude of levels? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  There is no question about that. 
There are so many different -- we will say this about every 
child that comes to the Village.  They are all emotionally 
battered, emotionally disturbed.  You would have to be to 
live through what they have been.  But every child is an 
individual.  They have their individual problems, and that 
is why each one has a specific program for them that is 
dealt with in how to deal with the child. 

<p>

We were at a staff meeting this morning looking on 
to see how that twice a day they have these meetings to 
determine how that child is doing and progressing and 
changing the modality of how they're being with that child 
if that child is not responding. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They work with them as an 
individual.  It is wonderful. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  They say that if you even attempt 
fund-raising broadly, that people cannot connect with that, 
but for people who are involved in helping others, that they 
have to do it specifically; that it is better to have 
someone support a specific child, better to have someone 
work for a specific goal.  Is there a child in your mind, or 
one or two children that you think of when you go out to try 
to make it happen, to try to bring in money, to try to work 
it?  Tell me about the children in your minds that you're 
thinking, This is a hard day, but today I'm doing it for 
this child. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  I think that when you break down a 
case, that is always the best, to think of one specific 
child, as you said.  There are 3.1 million cases of child 
abuse that are reported, but for every one reported, there 
are three to four that go unreported.  But when you bring it 
down to focus on one child's problem, you and I can relate 
to that. 

<p>

There are many favorite stories that Yvonne and I 
have.  One little boy had been locked in a closet all his 
life, and he had come to our Village, and we really raised 
him.  This is the Village on the West Coast.  We cared about 
him very, very much, because we had watched him develop from 
a child that could not speak and was so withdrawn.  He had a 
little limp.   

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  He didn't develop right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  His foot turned in because of the 
fact that he had been locked in that closet for so long. 

<p>

But we saw him through actually the time he was 12 
years old, and he was adopted by a minister and his wife.  
And so when we followed his case, to know that he could turn 
out to be even a human being, it was wonderful to see. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  With this same little boy, 
remember, we always have a Christmas program every year, and 
the children put on the play, and he was one of the first 
children at our Village on the West Coast.  We were all 
there together, and we had a couple of people who sing on 
the Lawrence Welk Show come and sing with the children, 
Guy(?) and Rolna(?). 

<p>

They were playing the guitar and singing, and all 
of us, we were baking cookies and singing Christmas carols 
and everything, and this particular little boy went up and 
looked at the guitar and looked up in their faces.  He had 
never heard music before.  And just a simple thing like 
that --  

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  He didn't know where it was coming 
from. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  He didn't know where it was coming 
from, but he had never heard it before, and then he loved 
it.  He thought music was the greatest. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We also had two children that were 
brother and sister that were raised with a group of dogs, 
and they really acted like dogs.  They would bite, they 
would bark.  Our staff had to deal with them on a one-to-one 
basis for a long time and really teach those children 
everything, how to go to the bathroom, how to eat correctly, 
and they were really something when they came to that 
Village.  We saw them shortly after that, and to see them 
just a few months later as an angel in the Christmas 
program --

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Again! 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- it really rewards us, because we 
do work very, very hard every day to bring in the money to 
keep our facilities going, and that is not an easy task. 

<p>

Sometimes when you get so tired, you think, well, 
maybe we should sit back and let someone else do it.  But we 
realize that our hearts are so in it, and we are so 
dedicated, that somehow we can tell the stories first hand, 
what is happening. 

<p>

The reward is to go to the Village, like we are 
here today, and see what is going on with the children and 
know that they are cared for and they are being turned 
around. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing 
child abuse.  Let's hear how Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime 
Fedderson began their efforts to heal broken lives and 
hearts of children.

<p>

You were actresses. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And somehow you got invited to go 
overseas on a trip to look at international children.  How 
did that happen? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, we were actresses in the 
1950s and 1960s, and they interviewed like 500 actresses to 
go overseas to entertain the servicemen, and we were the two 
selected, and they didn't even know we knew each other.  So 
it was meant to be, for sure.  But we went overseas in 1959, 
in October, and we went through one of the worst typhoons in 
the history of Tokyo. 

<p>

We were very young, and we took our little 
dictionaries with us, and we went out to see some of the 
area that had been hit so severely, and when we did, we 
found 11 little children huddled together on the street 
trying to keep warm, and their little hands were cracked and 
bleeding. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It was so cold.  It was horrible, the sight. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, it was so sad. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  They grabbed us and tried to get under our coats --

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They got under our coats. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- to keep warm.  It was really a 
tragedy that we had never seen. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  That is right.  We kept saying, 
"Do you have a <i>mama san</i>, do you have a <i>papa san</i>?" 
And they would say, "No, no," and we learned that these children 
were orphans, and they were Amerasians; they were American-
Japanese children, and they didn't have a home.  And so, 
through our military connections, we were able to place them 
in a home with a wonderful Japanese lady who had already 
taken 10 others off the streets in her home. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And when you went home, you raised 
money to help support those children? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes.  Well, before we left, we were 
<i>mama sans</i> of 21 children instantaneously.   

<p>

But then they started leaving children on the 
doorstep and up the block with notes pinned on them, "For 
the orphanage of mixed blood."  And so it ended up, before 
we came back to the States, we had over 100 children 
completely entrusted in our care, and that is when we came 
back to the States and began International Orphans, Inc., 
and from there we built onto that orphanage and built three 
other orphanages in Japan.  So we had four orphanages in 
Japan before Congress asked if we would do the same thing in 
Vietnam.  And so we went into Vietnam and built five 
orphanages, a hospital for orphans, and a school. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  So that is what we did overseas, 
and our work was kind of completed over there, and then 
Nancy Reagan said, "You know what?  You're looking for a new 
project here in America.  Why don't you look into child 
abuse?"  This was about 25 years ago, and we really hadn't 
read much about it at that time. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We thought she got it wrong. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  So, anyway, we got a small grant 
from Sacramento.  We looked into the problem, and of course, 
we learned that it was the number one killer of infants at 
that time.  Can you believe that, 25 years ago? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  But, you know, before that, we 
organized a Vietnam baby lift and brought the children over 
to this country.  We did not care for those specific 
children in an orphanage site, but each one of those were 
adopted the moment that we took them off the plane.  It was 
then that we went into the child abuse arena and ever since 
have been in that. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And we are standing now at the site 
of what is going to be definitely the premier child abuse 
treatment center in the United States, probably the world.  
I mean, what do you think about in a moment like this? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, I think at one time in our 
life we thought we were going to be actresses and one day 
get married and have children, which we did.  But at the 
time when we found these little children on the streets, we 
thought we were just going to help them and that this was 
why we were selected to go over there, to help these 
precious little ones through the storm and find a home for 
them.  We didn't dream at that particular time that it would 
unfold like it has, and now we are one of the leading 
organizations to help abused and neglected children here in 
America. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  At that time we had no idea that God 
had planned this for our mission in our life, and we are so 
glad that He did, because it means that our life has been 
fulfilled in a glorious way to help these children become 
whole again. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You both are mothers, but in a way 
you probably feel like mothers to a large family. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, absolutely.  And we even tried 
to keep up with the children, the 11 that we found on the 
streets in Japan that caused us to start this whole thing, 
and I guess we are grandmothers and maybe great-grandmothers 
by now with those children. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  It is true. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Because we started so long ago, 37 
years ago.  But it is wonderful to see them turn out well 
and to come back and say that it made a difference in their 
life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, you all have been friends for a 
long time. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Almost 40 years. 

<p>
MS. HAMRICK:  So how would you describe, each of 
you, the thing that your friend brings to this special task, 
because you know each other better than probably almost 
anyone.  This is a very special task.  What special skills 
-- you know, describe each other.  What are the special 
skills you each bring? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Well, I think we both have the 
heart for children and the love for children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, Yvonne deals with the 
volunteers a great deal. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Yes, I work a lot with the 
volunteers. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And she has a lot of patience, and 
she deals with them very well.  I do more the business end 
of it.  But she really knows how to handle those chapters 
and do well with them. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  We have a lot of wonderful 
volunteers.  We have chapters on the West Coast, the East 
Coast, down south, up north, and they work very hard for the 
children, and they are special friends to the children, and 
that means an awful lot.  They pay for their child's 
birthday party, and then they contact them all year long, 
and they have their picture.  But it is very nice for the 
volunteer and also for the child that that child has a 
special friend besides the staff that they see every day. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is really important for the 
children, isn't it, giving them other kinds of connections? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right, because sometimes they do 
not have parents involved.  Sometimes they do, but sometimes 
they don't.  So that's their very special person in their 
life.  And when they put on a program, like at Christmas, 
they always look for their special friend, because it's like 
having a parent out there watching them.  So it means a lot. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  In fact, we have had children come 
back to the village at times to tell us and thank us for 
their time, but to tell us about their reflection of those 
years at the Village.  And one the things they recall most 
is about their special friend and that someone was not 
really paid to look after them but wanted to do that and 
cared about them and reached out to them.  So it made a big 
difference in their life. 

<p>

Some of the things that we say to children that 
you think really didn't make a dent and you're not getting 
to them, later in their life, they recall that and will tell 
you that it really did and that they appreciate the time and 
effort and the care that you gave them.  And so that was 
wonderful for us, to be able to see our graduates, so to 
speak, come back and let us know what it meant in their 
life. 

<p>

This one particular little girl I am thinking 
about had a scrapbook in her arms, and she sat down and went 
over the pictures with us, and she said, "These were the 
best years of my life."  And it really did something to us, 
because if those were the best years of her life, then we 
had accomplished something. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Where all are there Childhelp 
organizations and centers? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have a village on each coast, 
east and west, and then we have an advocacy center, a sexual 
abuse advocacy center, in Knoxville, Tennessee, and one that 
was opened in Manhattan, New York, in conjunction with 
Cornell University, and then we have foster homes and group 
homes.  We have survivor programs and, of course, one of the 
main programs is our National Child Abuse Hot Line. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Amazing.  How many calls do you get 
a year? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have reached the capacity of 
300,000 a year.  It's more like between 150,000 to 200,000. 
That was the year that we had <i>Scared Silent</i> with Oprah 
Winfrey, and it was shown at the same time on all three 
networks, and so our phones really went bonkers.  But we are 
hoping to be able to answer more and more calls as we 
expand.

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And as we're on TV more, like this 
show, it really helps, because people hear the number and 
they use the number.  They call.  And we hope that people 
will if they need help. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will 
continue our discussion with those who are fighting for 
America's abused children.  Join us after this break. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. We are sharing with you 
my visit to Childhelp USA East Coast Village and my 
discussion with Sara O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson, the 
founders of Childhelp. 
	Ironically, in a way, you all both were on the 
<i>Ozzie and Harriet Show</i>, which is the program that people 
often sort of derisively say, "Well, family values people 
want to recreate Ozzie and Harriet.  And yet we have seen 
since those days a rise in child abuse numbers and a 
breakdown in the family that has been unprecedented.  What 
is different today than was true of the time when you all 
were both really television stars? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our American values. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right, the morals. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our values have broken down.  The 
dysfunctional families that you're seeing today.  People are 
not taking time with their children to teach them the right 
pathway in life.  And so we notice a big difference, and we 
think that's why we are having so many cases of our children 
not being cared for, the gangs. 

<p>

You know, when you treat a problem like child 
abuse, you're covering more territory than just that; you 
are really counteracting a lot of social ills all the way 
through the pathway, because you are dealing with juvenile 
delinquency up to the hard-core criminal, because it has 
been proven that the largest percentage of those that are 
incarcerated have been abused as children. 

<p>

So until we change the other spectrum, the other 
funnel, get the money to the child's issue, we are not going 
to see a change.  We have to get to that child to make the 
difference for our future. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Think of how the movies have 
changed and think of how TV has changed.  I know since we 
were in the movies in the 1950s and the 1960s, they are more 
violent, and the sex that is shown, and everything has 
changed.  It influences the children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There are statistics that would say 
that one in three girls and one in five boys will be 
molested.  Do you believe that? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, we definitely believe that.  In 
fact, I think that we heard of some new statistics that have 
just come out that are even larger than those figures.  I 
don't think that America knows yet what we're doing to our 
children.  We have to wake up.  And, yes, it is wonderful 
that we are more aware of what's going on than we did, say, 
10 years ago, or, as you say, when we were in the movie 
industry.   

<p>

But America still has to wake up and really band 
together to make that difference.  And if we don't, then 
we're going to lose America, a lot more than just our 
children.  That's what counts. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You know, when we got involved in 
this 25 years ago, it was kind of kicked under the rug.  It 
was around, child abuse, but we were the first organization 
to do a television special, to make people aware of the 
problem.  And I think people are more aware.  We have 
changed our laws, which we need to still change more, but 
because of that, they are reporting more, and so we are able 
to do something about it, and that is very important. 

<p>

We worked very hard to get to the young children. 
As you know, our ages are from 2 to 12, and we feel that the 
younger we can get them, the sooner that we can turn those 
children around, because the older they get, the more set in 
their ways and the more abuse they have had, so it is harder 
to turn those little lives around. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Help people understand.  When they 
say one in three girls and one in five boys molested before 
18, does that mean parents need to be afraid of actual 
physical, sexual molestation?  I mean, what are we talking 
about?  Is there a range of behaviors? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Training our children to be aware.  
We have a wonderful program right here that is working out 
of our Washington, actually our Virginia office, and that is 
the Good Touch, Bad Touch, training the children when they 
are in grammar school and on up how to deal with that, what 
they should look out for.  And when you educate them, they 
will be aware. 

<p>

We just have not educated our children well 
enough.  We haven't educated our children who have children 
how to be good parents.  And so I think that we are seeing 
somewhat of a change in that direction where we are trying 
to put the emphasis on that, where it belongs. 

<p>

But the age of a child -- you want them to be able 
to trust people, and you want them to be loving and kind.  
However, they have to be aware of strangers and what to do 
and what not to do. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  A lot of times they are not 
strangers, though; they are people they know, and that 
really complicates the problem. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is scary, because I think we 
are all pretty good at telling children, Run away from a man 
who wants you to get in his car. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right.  But when you say it's your 
stepfather or your stepmother or something like that, or 
uncle --  

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Who is the general perpetrator?  
Tell us about them. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Generally, it is someone they know. 
It's either their own parent, their stepparent, neighbors, 
relatives, that type of thing.  And that is scary because, 
naturally, these are the people whom the children do trust. 

<p>

One thing that we should all be aware of is the 
fact that we should listen to our children.  When the 
children often tell you what has happened, let's say if the 
father or stepfather, the perpetrator -- the mother kinds of 
pushes it off or says, "Oh, you're just making it up," 
instead of really listening to what your child has to say.  
And that is an emphasis that we would like to make, to 
listen to your children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Have you found the 1-800 number to 
be a good way to get to some of those children? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, yes. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Oh, absolutely.  That hot line is a 
lifeline.  The thousands of lives that have been saved that 
we know about personally that have been saved through that 
hot line -- you realize how valuable it is.  The children 
really don't know where to go.  They're afraid to tell their 
mother, or they've told their mother or whomever -- their 
father, their teacher -- they haven't listened, they haven't 
responded.  They don't know what else to do. 

<p>

But when they call 1-800-4ACHILD, we will tell 
them what to do, and we have the capability of patching that 
call in where a child does not have to hang up and redial 
another number, let's say in Paducah, Kentucky.  It patches 
them right in to the appropriate authority with that child 
on the line, and then we take care of the situation from 
there with the local, let's say, child protective services, 
sheriff's department, or whatever. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And it's 1-800-2ACHILD for the 
hearing impaired. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Reaching children is one powerful 
audience, but it does seem that having a center so near 
Washington, D.C., gives you an opportunity to reach another 
audience.  Is this Virginia center specifically located to 
talk to some of the men and women in the Nation's Capital? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, actually, Yvonne and I had 
that in mind.  We wanted a place near Washington, because so 
many of the politicians that we had called on prior, they 
wanted to come to the Village on the West Coast to see what 
we were doing, but they couldn't come that far. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And some of them have. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes, many of them have, but many of 
them couldn't.  And so we said it would be nice, where they 
are really setting policies and dealing with the issues, if 
we had a place near Washington that they could come and 
couldn't make too many excuses of why they couldn't be 
there. 

<p>

And so that was our target as far as being near 
Washington, and that is why this is not too far away.  It is 
45 minutes from Dulles Airport, to give you a sample of 
time.  And so we have had politicians here on the spot to 
see how the child abuse is being dealt with from this angle. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I was a police reporter and a court 
reporter and have seen many horrendous cases myself and a 
lot of child-molesting trials, and it is very difficult to 
find a place to send children who have been severely abused. 
Your waiting list has got to be pretty tremendous. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  It is. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It is, but we're building new 
cottages.  There will be one going up for 16 more children 
imminently, and perhaps two.  We are hoping that we will 
receive enough money that we can do two at the same time for 
32 more children.  And so the need for expansion is great.  
We're hoping that people will open their hearts and their 
pocketbooks so that we can do more. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Kristi, we're so excited about this 
because this is our new Village, so to speak.  New cottages 
will be built there. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Great.  It's beautiful! 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Sixteen to a cottage, and it will be 
like a little neighborhood in a cul-de-sac.  So the very 
first cottage will be built now on this specific ground, 
starting either this month or the beginning of next.  So 
we're very excited to see this happening. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You'll have to come back and see 
it after we complete the homes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We will. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Yes. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And see the children running around -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And this will open up a lot of doors. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, absolutely, absolutely.  This 
is so needed. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We need more cottages, as you're aware. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, I can imagine. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We have beautiful land on which to put it. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is wonderful. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  So we are thrilled that more 
children will be healed right on this spot. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares 
more from Childhelp USA.  We'll also discuss how you can 
become involved in changing the broken lives of abused 
children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.] 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you the 
conclusion of my visit with Childhelp USA founders Sara 
O'Meara and Yvonne Lime Fedderson.  You'll hear more about 
why their vision for abused children is so needed and how 
you can become a part of that vision. 

<p>

The best change in law from your perspective was 
the laws to take a child out of the home?  What was the best 
change that took place since you got involved? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  To protect those that came forth to 
say they suspected child abuse, whether it was a teacher, a 
pediatrician, the next-door neighbor.  They were afraid to 
say that because -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Because they could get sued. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  -- if they went to court and the 
judge would decide, well, the child could have fallen down 
the step and therefore broken his arm, then that person 
could turn around and sue that doctor or whomever, and he 
was not protected in any way.	 

<p>

And so now, you know, in every state you can be 
prosecuted for not, in certain areas, I mean as far as 
teachers are concerned, and pediatricians, et cetera, you 
are mandated by law. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What is the next change that's 
needed in the law? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, there are many changes we 
would like to see in the law.  We would like to see that 
children that are taken out of their home are cared for in a 
better way and that more money would be put in where we had 
more social workers to be able to take care of the children 
and take the children out in the first place, because it's a 
proven fact that now a large percentage of cases they can't 
do anything about; they can't even go to somebody --  

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Have to leave them in the home. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  It is just those children who are in 
immediate danger most of the time that can be helped. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  If it's a life-and-death 
situation, then they remove them, but, unfortunately, many 
others need to be removed, also, for a time, anyway.  And we 
are not going around trying to take anyone's children from 
them, but on the other hand, if they need help and if the 
child needs to be removed for a while, then we're for that, 
of course. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  We are not protecting our children 
like we should. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a strange situation when it 
comes to molesters, because the research is clear that 
molesters are serial offenders, generally molesting, from 
your research, 117 children per person, and that is very 
chilling to people, as well. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Yes, it is. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What would you tell parents who are 
concerned that something might be happening to their 
children?  What are some danger signs? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, danger signs, you mean of the 
child to -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  For the parent to be aware of.  As 
they look at their child, what might clue a parent in that 
there is something there to be concerned about? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Definite mood changes.  You mean of 
the child themselves? 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Definite mood changes, a child going 
inwardly that maybe had been very much of an extrovert, or 
vice versa.  Any time that a child complains of certain 
hurts on their bodies, when their personalities change, 
their emotions change, which is readily to be seen when 
something like this happens, quite frequently. 

<p>

Many children try to put it out of their minds as 
if it didn't happen and cover it up, which, of course, then 
is a major problem as they grow older.  But usually, if a 
parent knows their child, they will notice a big difference 
in what has happened due to that trauma. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Also, I think, if a child doesn't 
want to be with an uncle or an aunt or someone alone, that 
the parent should think about that and listen to the child, 
because environment there's probably a reason that the child 
doesn't want to verbalize because that person is a relative 
or a friend and they might get in trouble for saying, 
because maybe they've been told, "This is our secret; don't 
you dare tell or I'll do something to your mother or your 
father," or whatever.  So the child has to keep that secret. 

<p>

But they may be trying to tell you something in a 
different way by, "I'd rather not go alone; I don't want to 
go over there to visit so-and-so, and if I do, please don't 
leave me alone with that person."  Think about it. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  I knew of an actual case of a child 
that loved Cub Scouts, and all of a sudden, he didn't want 
to go, and of course, the parents were saying, "This is 
ridiculous.  You're almost through with this term, and if 
you don't want to next time, but you must finish out this 
term now for your Cub Scouting."  This little boy screamed 
and yelled and did not want to go, and it was because the 
Cub master was molesting those children.   

<p>

So I go back to the fact that we have to stop and 
listen to our children and hear what they are saying to us. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Right.  That's so important. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As you work with the children here 
at the EastCoast Village -- and there's the West Coast 
Village -- you are hoping to do something in the lives of 
those kids.  What are you hoping to accomplish in the lives 
of children as they leave? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Grow up and be good citizens and 
not abuse their children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And to give them inner light and let 
them express their own potential, their own little 
individual being, to fit into the network of society and let 
them know that they are cared about and loved, and teach 
them to love themselves, as well. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  You have to love yourself before 
you can love others. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And a good bit of your program helps 
bring out their passions.  You have painting and riding and 
a variety of things. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  That is very important. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And that was really different from a 
lot of programs which were rather antiseptic and almost 
jail-like.  What was your vision when you were looking at 
something to build for kids? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Our vision was that Yvonne and I 
wanted to build a home that would really be homelike.  So we 
visited all around the United States different facilities.  
Now, keep in mind this was almost 20 years ago. And the ones 
that were supposed to be the best -- we went to New York, 
Michigan, all over the place, and we visited, and we were 
horrified.  The rooms for the children were not bright and 
cheerful at all.  Many did not even have bedspreads in the 
rooms or pictures hanging. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  They were all white. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  The therapy they talked about, they 
were lucky if they saw a therapist once every three months.  
And so, knowing that, we said, You know, we would like to 
change the thinking, frankly, from our social service field 
and deal with a place that would be where we would want our 
own children to be if they had to be in a place like that. 

<p>

And so every room that we decorated, every program 
that we insisted upon to go in from the beginning, was done 
with that in the back of the mind.  What would it take for 
our child to be rehabilitated and feel loved and nourished 
and in a homelike setting?  And that's where we were coming 
from. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And when my daughter was growing 
up, she used to love to go to the Village and ride the 
horses, and I think she wanted to move there. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So that had to really touch your 
hearts as mothers, then. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Oh, yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To walk around and think of your own 
children. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  That's exactly right. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And that was the criteria on which 
we opened our first village of Childhelp in California. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  And, you know, it pleases us 
because the children, our children, have never resented the 
time that we have spent with the children at the Village.  
We have always made them feel a part of it.  And now they 
are involved in our work, which really makes us very happy. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Fantastic.  So for the people that 
are watching and would like to get involved, what can they 
do to help?  What kinds of things are there?  And we are 
obviously going to show a number.  But how do people get 
involved? 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Well, we have chapters and 
auxiliaries affiliated in every place where we are, and 
there are many things volunteers can do, from hands-on 
situations where that is feasible and they are trained 
volunteers.  We can do that.  But, also, there is so much 
work behind the scenes.  So we can use anybody that is 
willing to help, almost. 

<p>

The Special Friends program is very important, 
too, but that only comes about if you are a member.  So we 
are saying to call and we'll find a place, hopefully, for 
that volunteer who wishes to make a difference. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What one word, or couple of words, 
but how would you describe, then, overall, as you look at 
your life's work, how would you describe it? 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Busy. 

<p>

[Laughter.] 

<p>

Very rewarding, though. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Extremely fulfilling. 

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  Very. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  And I don't know what we would have 
done with our lives without this, even it has consumed our 
life, that we feel that we were brought here for that 
purpose --  

<p>

MS. FEDDERSON:  No question about that. 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:   -- and so we're very pleased that 
we're able to do it. 

<p>

[Segment from Childhelp Dinner Event follows:] 

<p>

MS. O'MEARA:  Childhelp has survived and prospered 
for 37 years just because of people like you who have been 
willing to volunteer their time and to share their money.  
There is nothing that cannot be accomplished when a 
community agrees to roll up its sleeves and do whatever it 
takes to make life better for its children. 

<p>

I want you to know that you're champions.  Every 
single one of you in this room is a champion.  So on behalf 
of the children we serve, I stand here in their stead to say 
thank you. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight, <i>Straight Talk</i> celebrates Mother's Day just a few
days early.  Mothers are such an influential part of a
child's life and possess the privilege and opportunity to 
shape the lives of little ones.

<p>

We all like to talk about our moms, sometimes 
lovingly, sometimes in frustration, but, unfortunately, in 
our cultural conversation, it is rare that mothers are 
revered and the art of motherhood, honored.  So we think it 
is important that on this special holiday we highlight the 
joys and pains of motherhood.  In fact, I had the chance to 
speak with mothers whose lives are different in a variety of 
ways but all share the experience of motherhood.  Tonight, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you their insights, experiences, and 
wisdom. 

<p>

And since I am not yet a mother, I asked a good 
friend to help me along.  Charmaine Crouse Yoest is a mother 
of two, former Deputy Director of Policy for the Family 
Research Council, a contributing editor for <i>Policy Review</i>, 
the Heritage Foundation magazine, and author of a new book, 
<i>Mother in the Middle</i>.

<p>

Charmaine, thanks for being here with me today. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Thanks, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We probably couldn't tape-record most of our 
conversations.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But I am looking forward to hearing more about 
your book, <i>Mother in the Middle</i>, and I wanted to start 
off by saying here once a year we take the time as a culture 
to talk about motherhood, but even recently a lot of the 
stories are very negative.  You know, on Mother's Day we'll 
have stories on why our mothers have ruined our lives. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Why do you think motherhood has been 
so disrespected? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, that was the most fascinating 
thing about the research for this book, is there have been 
several different reasons.  The most current, of course, is 
feminism, and I think that we made a big mistake in the 
women's movement of trying to say that our whole identity 
was going to be wrapped up in the workplace.  And so if you 
go that direction, then motherhood and children becomes an 
impediment.  So I think that is one of the biggest reasons. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We'll be talking more later, but 
first let's hear what blessings motherhood has brought to 
the women with whom I spoke.  They are special women from 
inner-city Washington to the suburbs, and I know that I 
learned a lot, and I hope that you, too, will have the 
chance to learn and relate to their experiences of 
motherhood. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  One thing I would say we get from 
children, it has been my experience, is unconditional love. 
I think sometimes parents see themselves as loving their 
children unconditionally, but for most of us, we chose to be 
parents.  But none of our children chose to be born. 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  I didn't realize what holding 
your own child the first time would be like.  I mean, it 
really for me was like falling in love with somebody, almost 
like when you fall in love with your husband.  It was just 
-- that's an experience that you can't have with somebody 
else in your life except your own child. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  The blessing is first for me, 
and then the daily hard toil is nothing compared to the 
blessings and the joys. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  It's a joy that cannot be explained, 
cannot be felt until you decide that you're going to do it. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  My perspective is not they're a 
burden and they're work, but just that they're a true 
blessing from the Lord, and I just have learned to delight 
in them.  It has really made my life more joyful. 

<p>

MS. VAILES:  When your children come along, you 
see them as blessings, and the burdens hit you afterward. 

<p>

MS. HARDISON:  No amount of money or personal 
affirmation can replace those things of molding young 
children, watching them develop.  It's incredible. 

<p>

MS. ANDERSON:  They'll just come up to you and 
they'll put their little hand in your hand, and there's 
nothing any better than that. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  You get appreciation for the 
little things that make up for the bigger world, and I think 
sometimes you miss that if you're not a mother or not 
involved with children, because children will stop and say, 
"Look, look at the flowers," or, "Look at the bee," "Look at 
the butterfly," and you know, you're just walking past all 
that stuff, and you'll miss it.  And I think they kind of 
bring you back to, you know, where you should be focused. 

<p>

MS. LEE:  You know, there are certainly 
sacrifices, and I could be in a bigger house or wearing 
better clothes or, you know, whatever.  But I don't think 
I'd be any more happy than doing what I'm doing now. 

<p>

MS. SMITH:  Just the little things she's learning; 
it's really a joy, and she's just the delight of my life. 

<p>

MS. THOMAS:  I mean, I'm constantly aware of, oh 
my gosh, what an awesome job, and they're looking at me.  
I'm like their first person that they're really thinking, 
this is how people ought to be.  It's pretty humbling. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  Children love you unconditionally, 
and I think that that's, in my view, a blessing from God, 
because it gives me a different insight into the love of God 
to see this little person who's going to put their arms 
around you regardless of what happens.  Or we've been harsh 
with them, or if they've been disappointed, they still love 
you, and they do that from the beginning, even before they 
learn to speak.  They have ways that they learn of 
expressing their love. 

<p>

The other thing I would say is that children have 
a certain manner of expressing like fresh and creative 
things, and so I try to listen to my children very 
carefully, because there's so much that they say to me that 
I haven't taught them, and so I have an opportunity to learn 
from them, and that's really a blessing. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You all are experienced mothers now. 
But what advice would you have liked to have known before 
you became a mother? 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  Breastfeeding doesn't come naturally. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I mean, just to be intensely practical, nobody 
told me that.  I thought, you know, you're equipped 
biologically to do this; that's the way the Lord intended it 
to happen.  And that, at least in my experience, and I know 
in the experience of a lot of women, that is just not the 
way it happened.  And nobody told me that. 

<p>

I think those first early weeks with your first 
child especially are really critical to your self-esteem as 
a mother, because you're doing it the first time, and those 
kinds of things like breastfeeding and just caring for them, 
you can easily feel like you've gotten in over your head. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  It's something that you never can 
probably hear enough, is that the best-laid plans of 
yourself and how you think that life is going to be gets 
changed, and God has the best-laid plans, and I know most of 
my friends know, and you know, that I have a little girl who 
is three, and she had some mild disability issues, and we 
thought, you know, this would be our special child. 

<p>

We had our son Mack back in October, and he has 
very severe disability issues.  He's at home with us right 
now, on a respirator, and with a variety of physical and 
neurological difficulty. 

<p>

But it is still, with all the responsibility and 
the hardship and challenges, the joy is incredible, and I 
would always tell that to anyone.  No matter what happens 
with your child, no matter how challenging.  The joy is 
incredible. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  I wish I knew or maybe someone had 
told me -- you know, you hear all the time, almost like a 
cliche, that it goes by fast, but I don't think I really 
appreciated that.  My older daughter is six now, and she's 
going to kindergarten, and next year she'll be gone most of 
the day, and as I mentioned earlier, just learning, making 
sure that despite the pressures and whatever stress you 
might have in your life of raising children, that you are 
delighting in your children.  You're looking into their eyes 
and into their faces, and you're taking that time out to 
read them a story or to have the quality time with them that 
can so easily seem to be squeezed out, out of a day, and all 
those things I don't think I really -- it took me a good 
three years of raising my children to learn those lessons, 
and I wish I had known ahead of time. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Because I am an educator, 
it's so funny.  You know, you can teach a sister one year, 
and in two years or the next year you can get a brother, and 
they're so different, and I would say, "How do they come 
from the same house and they're so different?"  And I would 
say that all the time. 

<p>

But when I had my own, I realized how they could 
come.  You know, the gene pool is mixed together and you 
come up with whatever you come up with.  My kids are night 
and day.  But I used to always say, "How do they come from 
the same household?  Do they have the same mother?"  And it 
is so amazing, and people tell you, "Kids are not the same." 
I knew they weren't the same.  I knew that. 

<p>

My father used to always say to us, "Fair is not 
equal," and I never understood that until I became a parent. 
He would always say, "Fair is not equal," and I didn't 
understand what that was until I had my own. 

<p>

MS. THOMAS:  I just find that I really had to 
become a better person myself.  You know, I just thought I 
was a pretty cool kind of person, that I was a pretty 
patient.  It wasn't a natural thing, but I had been working 
on it, and I thought I had that pretty well in order. 

<p>

There's nobody that challenges that like a little 
toddler.  Nobody.  I mean, nobody has made me that mad in my 
lifetime. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

You know, of anything that I have done, and just 
learning to love beyond that, learning just to keep self-
control over that, because, I mean, he's precious to me.  I 
mean, I'd die for him in a heartbeat.  But he's driving me 
nuts.

<p>

And just learning to give that to God, the part 
that I'm just out of control over, and just being the adult 
and stepping back and what do I need to do in this 
situation.  Sometimes it's the discipline, sometime it's 
just an extra hug, that they've been attention-deprived that 
day because you've been running around too much, and that's 
really what the problem is, and it's just really hard to 
discern that and not take it as a personal affront. 

<p>

MS. LEE:  Before I had children, I worked and I 
had this immaculate house and great meals, the kind that Mom 
made every night when you came home.  And now it's like, 
"Well, honey, Spaggetios or hot dogs, which is it?  You got 
a choice." 

[Laughter.]

<p>

It's just really difficult at the end of the day 
to muster that energy to get in there and cook and get the 
house clean, because, you know, you feel better about 
yourself if you look good and your house looks good and your 
husband comes home and goes, "Wow!  I've got a perfect wife 
here.  I've got a perfect wife that's a mom, too."

<p>

So I have really had to just step back and say, 
Okay, I'm not perfect; my house isn't going to be perfect, 
and we're just going to do the best that we know how and be 
happy with that.  So I'm learning to change my level of 
happiness. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  When I had my first child, I went to 
classes and I was sort of soaking up all this advice which 
turned out to be irrelevant. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And so the lessons that I did get, I didn't have 
the experience of wanting to trust them because nobody told 
-- there were some things that happened that nobody told me 
or warned me they would happen.  So I said, well, this is 
such a --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Like what?

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  Well, just that, you know, when you 
take the Lamaze class, it's supposed to be so easy and so 
simple to just have this baby. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And it wasn't like that at all.  And I'm saying, 
"What did I take these classes for?"  None of this stuff 
that was supposed to happen in the class happened, and all 
of the stuff that wasn't supposed to happen, did.  And so I 
began then to sort of not trust the official sort of line 
about even how you have a baby.

<p>

But I recognize that each mother is different.
Your bodies are different.  You just sort of bring to that 
process a whole different sort of sets of strengths and 
weaknesses and disabilities, et cetera.  So, so much of it, 
you just have to learn by experience.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about motherhood, and we want 
you to join us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We're celebrating Mother's Day 
in our own unique way, and I am joined by Charmaine Crouse 
Yoest, who is not only a mother of two but also an author 
and national spokesperson on family issues.  She also 
happens to be a very good friend of mine, and I am happy for 
the opportunity to share this special show with her. 

<p>

Well, Charmaine, we just saw the first of three 
segments looking at real-life moms talking about real-life 
problems, and I think the one thing that I was really struck 
by was that nobody said it was easy; everybody just said it 
was worth it.  I think sometimes in the discussion of 
motherhood there's this insinuation that it's going to be 
easy, that you can do it. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Well, you know, I think the thing that 
really struck me, as well, about that is this element of 
surprise.  You're surprised by the fact that it isn't easy, 
but the surprise over the joy.  We heard that over and over 
again with those women, and that is so much what we heard, 
too, doing interviews in the book, is that, you know, 
motherhood has been so devalued in our society that when you 
get into it -- well, you remember when I had my kids.  I had 
the same thing happen to me. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: I was, you know, a little bit hesitant 
about getting to this whole mom thing, and all of a sudden, 
my kids were there, and it was just unbelievable how -- you 
know, nobody can tell you.  That's a cliche, but nobody can 
tell you what it's going to be like ahead of time. 

<p>

I think that that is a natural thing, but in our 
society today it's accentuated, and that turns into being a 
problem when we've got this whole system that is geared 
towards women taking six weeks of leave and then going 
straight back into the work force. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right, and the book that you were 
mentioning was your new book, <i>Mother in the Middle:
Searching for Peace in the Mommy Wars</i>, which I really liked,
because there is a conflict, I think.

<p>

Well, maybe there doesn't have to be, but there 
certainly is a conflict that is described between the fact 
that we as women can achieve many things, and motherhood is 
an aside, as though motherhood is not an area where I 
achieve, or motherhood is not even important for me to 
attempt to achieve, like you do the motherhood thing, yes, 
whatever, maybe, maybe not.  But your career -- you know, 
here's success. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But it's not easy. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Well, I was really struck -- in doing 
the research for the book, we went back and did kind of a 
content study of some of the women's magazines, and one of 
the articles that really jumped out at me that is always in 
my mind was from <i>Cosmopolitan</i>, and they said, "Can You Be 
Somebody and a Mommy Too?"  And the whole idea was, they 
said -- of course, the article was saying yes, you can be 
somebody, but still, that title just continued to stick with 
me, because I thought, you know, that's the subtle message 
that we're sending to the next generation of women, that 
being somebody and being a mommy is not the same thing. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: So I think that's a real problem for women today.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is interesting, because I think 
there is a big generation gap between <i>Cosmopolitan</i> magazine 
and MTV, Generation X, and the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, because 
in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, I think the message is very 
clear, and not just the <i>Journal</i>, not to slam on them, but 
there was an article you and I were commenting on not long 
ago where a woman was commended as being this female worker 
of the year, and she had been cutting deals on a phone while 
she was in labor and was back to work the next day, and she 
got an award for that.

<p>

MS. YOEST: Yes. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you and I were talking about 
where were her priorities, and then you contrast that with 
Generation X data that says that they're the group of people 
who have most suffered from a lot of broken homes, and most 
say they want to change their work day to accommodate their 
family.  What did you find?

<p>

MS. YOEST:  You know, it's funny.  Since we're 
friends and this is a more informal discussion, I will tell 
you honestly, one thing that has struck me in terms of the 
aftermath of the book is you see some of the -- I go through 
this myself -- you see some of these articles.  There was 
another article in the <i>Journal</i> where they were highlighting 
these really top women, and the whole point of the article, 
Kristi, was that these women had achieved so well because 
they had wonderful time management skills.

<p>

So I walked around for the rest of the day going, 
"Oh, gosh, so that's all it really takes, is great time 
management skills."  But, you know, that's a bogus message 
to be sending to women that if you just manage your time 
correctly, then you're going to be able to hold down a full-
time job and be a perfect mom to your kids.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST:  And it was really kind of comforting 
to me because I was doing an interview later that day with 
another mom who has four children, and she is running a 
business out of her home, and I mentioned this article to 
her, and the conflicted feelings I had had reading it, and 
she just laughed.  She said, "You know, I was one of those 
women.  Everybody looked at me and thought I had it 
together.  I had great time management skills," she said, 
"but I knew that my family, and particularly my kids, were 
suffering." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. Don't you think that -- you 
and I have talked a lot about it -- that we have to expand 
our definition of womanhood?  So I ask you a leading 
question:  Don't you agree with me? 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But we have defined womanhood as we were oppressed 
economically, so now, the real woman today has the best 
resume on the planet, rather than that women are very 
relational, that the husbands and men in their life and 
their families are important; and, significantly, at the 
Family Research Council, we have seen a lot of data	 that 
says most women during the first five years of their 
children's life would like to adjust their work schedule to 
accommodate that, rather than a lot of our federal 
proposals, which are all organized toward getting women back 
to work, because work is what women really want, isn't it? 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And isn't that a little narrow? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, that's what my passion is all 
about with this whole issue, is that <i>Parents</i> magazine just 
ran a study.  They surveyed 18,000 of their readers, and 
they found that only 4 percent of those 18,000 women wanted 
to be holding down a full-time job.  Sixty-one percent of 
them wanted to have a part-time job.

<p>

So I'm looking at this and saying, You know, but 
our federal discussion is all centered on day care, as if 
that is what women want.  And what we found in talking to 
women was that that was not what they wanted, that they were 
really struggling with this issue of how to put their 
children first. 

<p>

Going back to another thing you were talking 
about, in terms of the issue of sacrificing for your 
children, I think one of the difficulties in talking about 
this issue and that I struggled with as I wrote the book is 
that there are no easy answers.  You can't come down and say 
that, okay, here's the perfect work/family balance.  You 
know, we subtitled it, <i>Searching for Peace in the Mommy
Wars</i>, so we kind of wrestled with this question, what is
peace?

<p>

Well, peace is not necessarily that everything 
will be easy.  And in today's society, in our secular 
society, people equate difficulty with something being 
wrong.  Everything should be easy.  But, you know, the truth 
is that children are a sacrifice, and we have to come to 
grips with that. 

<p>

Kind of to tie that a little tangentially into 
another thought is that this has to start with women, 
because if we keep waiting for society --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To fix it. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: -- to revalue women, yes -- but if 
women don't value children, then why should anyone else?  
The problem is that feminism has, for decades now, wanted to 
make it out that men and women were exactly the same.  The 
problem with that is, you can't get away from the fact that 
women do have this intrinsic biological connection to their 
children that, just by force of nature, is different than 
what it is for the man.  And so I look at that and say, 
Okay, as one of the women mentioned, you know, breastfeeding 
is a pretty important component of raising your child.  
That's a vital connection to your child. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And it's hard. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  And it's hard.  And if the mother 
doesn't value that, then why would the father?  Why would 
society? 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right. 

<p>

We're going to talk more about the difficulties 
and challenges of motherhood. When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, 
we'll gain more insight into motherhood and the issues 
facing mothers today.  Stay with us. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. With Mother's Day just around 
the corner, tonight we are sharing some real-life motherhood 
experiences.  In fact, let's hear what these mothers had to 
say about some of the hard lessons they have had to teach 
and learn from their children. Join us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What lessons did you find hard to 
teach your children?  What were things that were difficult 
to transfer, values or skills or just the kinds of things 
they need to be the people you wanted them to be? 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Well, I'm still at the 
teaching stage, so what I'll say is, it's so amazing how -- 
because my kids are close in age -- you want them to share, 
and sharing is a big thing.  So you want to teach them to 
share, and I was on this mandate about a year ago.  I'm 
going to teach them to share.  I don't care.  They're going 
to learn to share, and dah-dah-dah-dah, and I gave them all 
these biblical points of why they should share, you know, 
all of the stuff, until I realized they were sharing.  It's 
just that they have to work it out, and if I just kind of 
stay out of it, they will share.  As long as I'm giving them 
love and support, they'll work it out.  But, you know, 
you're so into, when they're two and three, they're going to 
learn to share.  But, eventually, if you live what you 
teach, they'll learn it, so it's kind of easy. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  That's true, what Sabrina is 
saying, and I, too, want to teach the sharing, but I want to 
teach what a strength it is to share and to give, because 
the world is about keep, get, take from whoever else and 
just keep for yourself.  I would like to teach my children 
that that is a position of weakness, and the sharing and 
giving is the real position of strength, and I'm trying to 
work that in. 

<p>

My mother says that it's difficult, but if I 
remind myself that this is a four-year-old, he's not going 
to exhibit this behavior today, it becomes less difficult.  
I feel I'm putting things in that perhaps I'll see in the 
future, and I have to remind myself that he's not going to 
learn it in two minutes, three minutes.  It may be years, 
but soon, I hope that he reflects the kind of behavior I'm 
nurturing now. 

<p>

MS. SUTHERLAND:  Loving seems to come naturally to 
children if you give them an environment in which it can 
flourish.  They're just so loving and responsive.  But all 
of the other things, like manners and not screaming, you 
know, just all the things that toddlers learn, are hard, I 
think.  It's hard to shape somebody gently and with respect 
to who they are, so that you don't feel at the end of the 
day that you've kind of beaten them down but that you've 
really nurtured them. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  If it's this kind of challenge when 
they're two and a half -- I've got a three-year-old -- what 
the challenges are that are ahead of us and how much harder 
it's going to be to teach them to respect your body, to 
respect other people, to learn the harder the things they're 
going to be met with in grade school, now -- unfortunately, 
in grade school and middle school -- and I am in awe of that 
responsibility, of getting prepared for that and learning 
what I need to learn to be able to help them through that. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  I think, ideally, as a mom, you 
need to be confident and secure and kind of as if you've 
already done it, but you're really doing it for the first 
time.  So again, with my three, I feel like, as the years 
have gone by, I am getting more confident and secure. 

<p>

But probably the area I struggle a lot with is 
just, as we have been talking, the area of discipline.  I 
think part of that has to do with, you know your own 
boundaries; you know what's appropriate, because I find it 
hard to -- I put off disciplining them, and you see that 
children -- they need it.  You know, they need to learn 
boundaries.  They need to learn what's right and wrong, and 
they need to see that there's consequences. 

<p>

And so I have seemed like I learn this repeating 
lesson that the more I put it off, the harder it is for me 
and the harder it is for them.  As a friend of mine once 
said, you can't as a mom expect to be popular.  You have to 
be willing to be unpopular.  And that's true, because even 
after I have disciplined, I want to run in and have that 
close bonding and friendship, and I need to restrain myself 
and say, you know, let there be distance and let my kids 
learn the hard lessons of life. 

<p>

MS. ANDERSON:  With the discipline and stuff, you 
know, the kids will say to me, "Mom, you know, I don't like 
you very much." 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I'm like, "Well, you know what?  I'm not liking you right now, 
either." 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I'm like, thank God we still love each other, you 
know.  I said, "There's nobody in the world I love more than 
you."  I said, "Sometimes we don't like each other very 
much."  But it's a hard thing to teach them that you still 
love them even in that discipline time and stuff. 

<p>

MS. VAILES:  Other people have a lot to do with 
and a lot to say about how the children come up.  "Don't let 
those children run in the church."  "Don't let them do 
this."  And it's difficult.  Patrice and I know that because 
of our differences, and it makes me reflect on the 
differences that I had with my own mother in raising them. 

<p>

So I'm learning to stay out of things and let her 
handle it.  You know, they're her children.  It's difficult, 
but I'm learning. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that motherhood has 
been severed from womanhood in the discussion of it?  
There's a lot of focus on work, women as people who make 
money, women as people who have a career.  What about focus 
on women as people who bring the next generation to life? 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS:  Well, I personally feel 
that, in the African-American community, mothers generally 
worked, if not full time, at least part time, so I think 
that we were excluded from the discussion, anyway, and now 
that they're including a discussion of working women and 
working mothers and whatever, we are more included in the 
discussion, and I think before we were excluded, and I don't 
think that was an issue for our community, generally, 
because most of us worked.  My mother worked, my grandmother 
worked, her grandmother worked.  I am from a lot of women 
that worked.  I work.  I'm sure my daughters will work. 

<p>

So I think that that whole issue wasn't an issue 
for us, and I think that we're now becoming included.  And 
there are still African-American mothers that don't work and 
stay home with their children, which is wonderful, too.  But 
I think that now we are more included as a community. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you would say most women work. Go ahead. 

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  I would say that, in terms of how 
womanhood relates to motherhood, one of the most important 
things a woman can do, a mother can do for her children, is 
to have and to convey to them a strong sense of her own 
identity, and it's not like, well, I'm less than or I'm 
subordinate or I'm weak or I don't have any potential.  But 
I think that the mother's sense of herself gets conveyed, if 
not through words, through behavior, to the children, so 
that I would like to think that whether I work or don't 
work, that I live my life in such a way that I'm an 
inspiration and an encouragement to my children to become 
all that they can be. 

<p>

But we live in a society that has peculiar ways of 
sort of pigeonholing mothers and women so that you have this 
role and not that role, and I think that that can really be 
a problem.  Especially in the black community, that's a 
problem.  We get so stereotyped and even demonized and 
denigrated.  You know, well, you're a mother; you're not 
this and you're not that. 

<p>

My perspective is that whatever I achieve, 
whatever I accomplish, it is for my children; it's a major 
part of my being there for them as an example, as a role 
model, as an inspiration. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  Yes, I agree with what Cheryl 
says, and somewhere mothering is lost on society.  I think 
there is the physical mothering of having our children and 
nurturing them, and also, there's the spiritual mothering 
for me, and that is the woman that works in her community, 
that is working at school, in the offices, the president of 
a company or whatever.  It's a whole nurturing, bringing to 
birth, giving life to whatever -- babies, careers.  It's a 
whole world of things that today's world doesn't see, 
doesn't grasp. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll 
talk further about motherhood today.  Join us after this 
break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. I'm joined again by 
Charmaine Crouse Yoest, who is helping me, a future mother, 
decipher roles of mothers today in America.  Welcome back, 
Charmaine.

<p>

MS. YOEST: Thanks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  My mother would pay to know when. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But to kind of springboard off the conversation 
that we just saw with the group of mothers, it was 
interesting talking about the fact that mothers are a 
spiritual force and a broader force and have a bigger 
influence than, you know, five minutes with my kids and I'm 
off to make my real impact in the work world.  Did you find 
that in your research? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  You know, that's a real linchpin of 
what I'm thinking about in motherhood here and what we're 
talking about in the book.  It's just that children have 
eternal value, and when our society became more secular, we 
lost that appreciation for anything that has to do with the 
eternal.  And so, as a result, I think that was a huge part 
of the devaluing of motherhood. 

<p>

It was really kind of interesting to me to look 
back to history and to see if we had any kind of model for 
what motherhood could be.  In the early 1800s, mothers were 
put up on a pedestal, they were revered, for precisely the 
reason that she was mentioning, that they had a force in 
society.  The power that they held as the women who were 
raising the next generation of Americans was very deeply 
honored, and they were seen to have influence in the wider 
community, not just within the home. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Isn't it Winston Churchill who said, 
"The hand that rocks the cradle rules the world"? 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And there was a real valuing of the 
impact that women had in the lives of the people around 
them, broader merely than work. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, and we have just lost an 
appreciation for that.  The most moving thing to me, we tell 
in the book the story of Harriet Beecher Stowe.  She was the 
woman who wrote <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>, which is partially 
credited with igniting the Civil War.  The genesis of that 
book, she told a friend once, was in the summer when she 
lost her baby son to cholera.  As any mother who has gone 
through that experience, she was so grief-stricken, and 
shortly thereafter, after her son died, she started hearing 
stories about slave mothers who were just viciously ripped 
apart and separated from their children forcibly, never to 
see their children again, sold into slavery.  She just so 
identified with the pain of losing a child that she sat down 
and wrote <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i>.

<p>

When I heard that story, I thought, you know, 
that's what motherhood is all about.  Making a difference in 
the larger society, having your own personal experience 
connects you into the wider society at large, and giving 
your actions a motivation that is more important than just 
your small family. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It was interesting, looking at some 
business models lately, I think what was powerful was that 
in a lot of ways a lot of workplaces are structured after a 
masculine role model where it is very linear -- you do this, 
you do that -- where they said that women managers were more 
relational and built teams on the strengths of individuals, 
while men liked to designate and delineate a task and build 
it on the strength of the description or the formula. 

<p>

We have been tempted to say that the formula is 
right and the relationships are wrong, and I think, in a 
broader perspective, women bring to business and to the 
community an appreciation for those relationships that is 
different. 

<p>

I was interested to see some chamber of commerce 
data recently that said that the majority of start-up 
businesses in America today are begun by women looking for 
options and are doing it in niche businesses. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Yes, and in fact, do you know that 
women have a very rate of success with home-based 
businesses?  This is a real growth industry. 

<p>

I was struck, to play back to the last piece, the 
one woman who was saying that she comes from a long line of 
mothers who have worked, and one of the points that we 
really wanted to hammer home in the book is that women have 
always worked.  Work is not a shameful thing. 

<p>

I think that we can sometimes, in this whole 
debate over women and work, from a conservative Christian's 
perspective, sometimes there can be a bondage that women 
feel in that if they need to work or if they are working in 
some way, that that is wrong.  But that is kind of twisting 
a biblical model of work.  It's okay to work.  The point is 
that our children do come first. 

<p>

And so what we are really wanting to bring into 
the public discussion is, if women need income, they don't 
necessarily need a job.  How can we be more creative in 
looking at our society and making it easier for women to 
augment their income through home-based work, through part-
time, through flex-time, through job-sharing?  There are so 
many exciting options out there, particularly with the 
technological age. 

<p>

Debbie, my co-author, and I wrote this book 
together and only got together once over the course of 
writing the book.  We did it all by computer.  And it's 
amazing to me.  It's so exciting, the opportunities that are 
out there. 

<p>

I think it's sad to see women who are struggling 
so hard, wanting to spend more time with their children.  
That's what we heard over and over again from women as we 
talked to them for the book.  And they're not getting any 
support for thinking creatively in the broader society.  All 
you hear women's activists saying is, "Well, women need more 
day care."  I don't think that's what real women are saying. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Well, women don't want that.

<p>

I was really struck by some day care data recently 
that 50 percent of children under 18 are cared for by their 
mother who is staying at home, and of the remaining 50 
percent, one third of those are cared for by mothers and 
fathers flexing their work schedules so one of them is 
always there; one third of them are cared for in a household 
with extended family, and a very small percentage of that is 
maybe a nanny; and of the remaining one third of that 50 
percent, only that small percentage chose an institutional 
day care setting.

<p>

But the conversation is all as though this is what 
women want -- we want a place to send our children to -- 
when I think that people's patterns are clear that we want 
to keep our children close, even if we need to earn extra 
money. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: Exactly. That's what so frustrating, 
is that the national debate doesn't reflect the mother in 
the middle, the woman who is struggling and saying, "How can 
I be with my own children?"  That's what troubling to me as 
a public policy person and as a mother, is to see almost 
this train coming down the track.  Even the Republican- 
dominated Governors' Conference called for more day care 
money in the welfare reform bill. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right. 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  So I see our public policy discussion 
going an entirely different direction than where I think the 
women of America are going, because I was very encouraged in 
terms of talking to women.  I felt like there is a real 
renaissance of revaluing motherhood across our country, of 
women saying, "I'm going to draw a line in the sand, and 
this is what's important to me, and I'm going to make this 
decision for my family whether I get patronized or not." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Especially, I think, among younger 
mothers, and we're going to get to talk more about that 
later.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we're going to share 
more from mothers who give their advice to women considering 
having children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. We are continuing our 
celebration of motherhood.  Let's hear some advice from a 
diverse group of mothers to women who are considering having 
children.  Let's see if that biological clock is worth 
listening to.

<p>

Today in America, one in four couples is 
infertile, and the number is growing, and there are a lot of 
factors that are playing into that.  For children up for 
adoption, there are 40 certified, on-a-waiting-list, 
available couples per child. 

<p>

So there are a lot of women who are going to see 
this television show that would like to be where you are, 
would like to have children.  And just thinking about them 
for a second, or people who are just grappling with this -- 
there are a lot of women who don't have children -- my 
husband and I, we don't have children yet -- here on 
Mother's Day, what are your thoughts for those women out 
there who wish that they were among you? 

<p>

MS. LEE:  I try to tell my friends now that are in 
the mid-thirties or early thirties that are putting off 
motherhood -- "Oh, I'll be a mom some day.  We're not ready 
for it yet" -- I say, because we had a very difficult time 
conceiving with our first child, and I just can't tell them 
enough, "Don't wait.  If this is what your heart's desire 
is, don't wait.  The career can wait.  You have a lifetime 
of a career after your child is grown.  But this is the time 
right now where you have the energy, your body is physically 
ready."  I just would advise them to go ahead and get going 
on it, put the priorities first.

<p>

MS. VAILES: I was very happy to have my children.
I guess the one thing that I would like to stress is being 
there for them and being open to hearing what they have to 
say.  I used to say that the Lord blessed me because I don't 
show my panic; it comes much later.  So my children could 
tell me anything.  It's the communication that helped me 
learn, helped me grow, helped me become more flexible.   

<p>

It got to the place that they used to tell their 
friends, "You need to talk to my mother," about problems or 
whatever was going on with them when they saw things that 
needed to be changed.  And they would come to me with 
everything.  So it's very easy, now that they are adults, to 
have open communication. 

<p>

MS. THOMPSON:  For me, having been a public health 
nurse -- and I have had opportunity to travel quite a bit to 
Third World countries -- I have always had a desire to 
adopt, and as you talk about the statistics, I would 
encourage people that there is something you won't have, 
having your own, and yet there are other special things you 
will have if you're able to adopt.  And that is something 
that I still hope, in the future, that we might be able to 
do even though we have been able to have our own, because 
the world is a needy place.  There are needy kids out there, 
and it just takes a little bit of love.  You've got people 
here that desperately want children and children here that 
desperately need homes. 

<p>

MS. STEWARD-SALTERS: Women that don't have 
children, they need to pray to see if that's what God wants 
them to do, because God's wishes are different for everyone, 
and there might be a role for you as an extended family 
person that might be much needed in comparison to you 
raising your own, and you have to pray about that. 

<p>

I know that I prayed before I started having my 
children, because if you met me about five years ago, you'd 
say, "She's having kids?" 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

So I was like, mmm, I don't know if I want to do 
that.  So you have to pray and you have to wait and see what 
His answer is. 

<p>

MS. STARNES:  You don't know what's down the road 
for you when you start trying.  Maybe you conceive 
instantly, and that's great, because so many of us don't 
have that luxury, and what a nice surprise to find that out. 
Otherwise, you may find out you've got some difficulties and 
you need the time to work through it, and you can't do that 
when you're 38.  You don't have that much time. 

<p>

MS. VAILES-MACARIE:  I would have missed -- how do 
I say this? -- the whole world of mothering if I didn't have 
children, because for me there was all this mothering that 
needed its connection or its contact, and it's all of what 
they have said and just a whole lot of other things in me, 
and I needed to make contact with that that needed my 
mothering, and I would have missed all of that without 
children, and it's all of your teaching and your learning, 
the prayerfulness, the growing up, just everything that you 
bring to that need, your purpose to that need, and that's 
what I would have missed, and I am glad I had the blessing 
to connect.                                                   

<p>

DR. SANDERS:  You have to love children.  I mean, 
that's the most important thing that you do as a mother, is 
to love them.  I mean, that's your job, that's your 
responsibility, that's your basic obligation, is to love 
them, to lead them; that is, to give them some sense of 
direction, some sense of boundary, some sense of discipline, 
some sense of orientation when they lose their way, to lead 
them; that is, to be the parent, be the adult, at least as 
long as they are needing that; also, to listen to them. 

<p>

There are so many children whose behavior 
indicates that they don't have anybody to listen to them or 
who will listen respectfully to what they have to say and 
will sort of give them a sense of self-esteem and of their 
own worth by saying, "Well, you're important.  I'm going to 
listen to you.  You have something to say."  Or, "I'm 
interested in how your day was, or what your ideas and your 
thoughts are."

<p>

This is important, this listening, because I think 
that the more we invest in listening to our children, the 
more we kind of help them to become socialized and to just 
realize, well, I'm an important person.  I have something to 
contribute, something to say.

<p>

And then the last thing is to learn from them and 
to recognize that parenting is a learning experience.  Even 
if you have studied developmental psychology, it seems that 
once you have mastered, sort of, as a parent the stage where 
they are, they have a way of leaping to the next stage, and 
then you've got to catch up and say, "Okay, this way of 
dealing with the child has got to grow as parent." 

<p>

This is what I am experiencing as a mother, is 
that I am learning how to be a mother from them as I have 
watched them go through their changes and their growth and 
their development.

<p>

But my commitment, again, my obligation is to stay 
with that process and not to say, "Okay, well, you just go 
ahead; I'm going to stay stuck right here."  And as you are 
probably aware, there are adult parents of adult children 
who get kind of stuck at a particular stage of mothering, 
and then it's really difficult for that adult child, because 
it seems to me that the overall goal and purpose of 
parenting is to do everything you can to prepare that child 
to be an independent, interdependent human being, an adult, 
and not to sort of put them in some sort of perpetual 
childhood because of your own emotional needs or whatever. 

<p>

So the goal is that they can really reach their 
full potential as adults, but this listening, this loving, 
this sort of learning from them and this leading them, for 
me, is what motherhood is about. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the 
break.  Stay with us to hear how you can get more 
information regarding issues affecting you as a mother or a 
father and your family.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you for joining us here at 
<i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. I 
would also like to thank Charmaine for all her insights. 

<p>

Charmaine, we just heard a lot of really good 
advice from some moms.  In the little bit of time we have 
left, what advice would you give women searching for peace 
in the mommy wars? 

<p>

MS. YOEST:  Well, you know, Kristi, it was really 
inspiring to talk to women who have been so creative in 
finding their own peace.  We have a whole chapter of stories 
we tell of women who have found a situation that really 
works for them. 

<p>

I think the message that we wanted to send women 
home with was that you can make your own life, what you want 
it to be, that there are opportunities out there, and that, 
as women, we need to be aggressively moving into the 21st 
century and staking out the territory and saying this is 
what motherhood of the next millennium is going to look 
like. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

MS. YOEST: And we can create our own terms and 
our own situation in a creative way that isn't dictated by 
what the activists are saying they think motherhood should 
look like.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, it has been unfortunate, a lot 
of the women who say they're for women are just for big 
resumes and abortion, and you think there's a little more to 
womanhood than that. 

<p>

MS. YOEST: A lot more. Yes, exactly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We're going to want to have you read 
this book.  If you'd like to receive more information about 
the Family Research Council, tonight's guests, or get a copy 
of Charmaine's book, please call us at 1-800-225-4008. 

<p>

Next week we'll be discussing a chilling issue 
facing us today:  euthanasia.  You won't want to miss this 
potential impact that will come with a contract with death. 
Please join us when <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research
Council</i> returns. Thanks for watching.

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight's <i>Straight Talk</i> looks at an issue surrounding our
personal mortality: life, death, and euthanasia.  Do we want
an America in which doctors have the authority to kill
ailing patients?

<p>

Just yesterday, Dr. Jack Kevorkian was acquitted
for the third time of charges involving his role in yet
another death.  These acquittals, along with several liberal
court rulings, are sending a message loud and clear to the
nation's elderly, our disabled, terminally ill, and in fact,
our entire population.  The message:  be healthy or beware.
Who will decide which of us are too sick to take up so-called 
valuable resources, and should we give that authority 
to physicians?  Tonight we will discuss whether euthanasia 
serves the population compassionately or acts as a means of 
coldly eliminating expense and our own humanity.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Robert Knight, FRC's
Director of Cultural Studies.  Bob speaks about an issue 
heatedly discussed just this morning on the House floor, the 
homosexual activist Cherry Jubilee Celebration, a gay-sponsored 
party, that took place in taxpayer-supported federal buildings.

<p>

Yesterday, Steve Gunderson, the gay representative 
from Wisconsin, talked about this issue for an hour on the 
House floor.  Today, Bob Knight gives his insight, and he 
shares an FRC exclusive video about the homosexuals' use --
possibly misuse -- of federal buildings.  Trust me, you will 
not see this on local broadcasts or read about it in many
newspapers. So <i>Straight Talk</i> now takes you Behind the
Headlines.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You know, a lot of
people may have heard in the news about a party called
Cherry Jubilee.  It has been a bit controversial, and in
terms of Behind the Headlines, we would like to understand
what exactly does that mean?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, every spring, we have the 
cherry blossom festival, and the cherry trees bloom around 
the Tidal Basin, and they are beautiful, and increasingly in 
recent years homosexual activists have held various events 
around the city, and they call it the Cherry Jubilee.  This 
year they staged events in two federal buildings, and we got 
wind of this not through some great spy network; they 
advertised it in their publications.

<p>

So we thought, well, this is curious that federal 
buildings, one of them the Andrew W. Mellon Library, which 
is an old august building right on Constitution Avenue 
across from the Smithsonian, was going to be used for a big 
party, an all night long party, and then there would be a 
recovery brunch -- they call it recovery, I guess from the 
party the night before -- in the Rayburn House Office 
Building, which is the largest office building housing 
congressional offices.  We thought, is there something wrong 
with this picture? We'd better take a closer look.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think people would be very 
surprised that this kind of party would have taken place in 
a taxpayer supported federal office building.  How were the 
homosexual activists able to get access to these rooms?
They are kind of tough to book.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Now we have placed many calls to the 
Andrew Mellon Auditorium and the General Services 
Administration, and they will not return our calls.  I think 
they are starting to circle the wagons about this, because 
people are wondering how could they commandeer these 
premises for a party that really got out of control?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we were taking a look at some of 
the different homosexual literature talking about the Cherry 
Jubilee party, they said that it was a certain kind of 
party.  Could you help us understand what kind of a party 
Cherry Jubilee was?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, that is what caught our 
attention.  In a local publication, they said it would be 
like a circuit party, which is something you will see in New 
York and other major cities in which thousands of homosexual 
men gather and have an all-night party, and usually you will 
see drugs present at parties and sexual acts being 
committed, and just basically an orgy, to not think of a 
better word for it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is rather amazing to imagine that 
there were parties in federal office buildings where sex 
acts were taking place.  You know, frankly in Washington, 
DC, that kind of thing has always been very controversial, 
you know, whether it is people jumping in the Tidal Pool or 
different things that people said they did in offices.
Every time it has come up, it has been very controversial.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Yes, and other things.  I wonder if 
you could have a prayer meeting, you know, at the Rayburn 
House Office Building.  Maybe you could, maybe you cannot, 
but I know of at least one instance in which a group was 
denied use of a federal facility.  That was Anthony 
Falzarano's[?] Transformation ex-gay ministry.  He asked the 
Museum of Women in the Arts, a federal building, if he could 
have a conference there, because outside groups can rent 
rooms, and he was just flat-out refused, and he was never 
told why, and I have to suspect it is because of the nature 
of his group.  He helps people out of homosexuality, and 
that is not politically correct.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Now, Bob, my understanding is there 
is some video of this event.  How did that come about?
Where did that come from?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, we contacted a photographer who 
is famous for getting into events and taking footage, and he 
agreed to go into this event, and he stayed the whole 
evening, and he had a camera, and he went in with a 
companion, and they took shots of each other.  So they were 
just celebrants along with everyone else.  Then he swung the 
camera around and took footage of the dance floor and other 
areas, and some of the footage is so dark you cannot see it, 
but he provided a narration for us and told us, look, I will 
tell you what was really going on in the corners, things you 
do not really want to know about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What surprises you the most about
this kind of activity in a federal building?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I think the lack of oversight by 
Congress and by the Clinton administration as to what is 
going on in the federal buildings.  I mean, these are 
government buildings.  They are paid for with taxpayer 
money.  The stamp of approval of the U.S. government and 
thereby the American people comes about when you stage an 
event in one of these buildings.  The government is saying 
we think this is fine; this is okay.  But, in fact, it is 
not okay.  Our representative Bob Dornan said on the floor 
of the House that this is an outrage that federal buildings 
can be used for events like this, and I hope more comes out 
of this.  I hope they actually have an investigation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is very likely that there will be 
an investigation of this party and of who may have set it up 
and where the federal money may or may not have gone.  What 
is the most likely scenario for bringing this about?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I would think that would be at the 
core of the investigation, how it came about, because 
outside people like us are not getting any help out of the 
government in determining how this was able to happen.  So I 
think we need congressional help to do it, and I hope that 
is something that occurs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, Bob, you were able to get some 
videotape of this particular activity.  How did you get that 
tape, and could you explain to us a little bit about what we 
will be seeing?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Okay, yes, I think seeing is believing, and a 
picture is worth 1,000 words.

<p>

[Cherry Jubilee segment follows.]

<p>

NARRATOR:  Washington, DC, the nation's capital.
Every year during April, thousands of tourists come here to 
see the cherry blossoms.  They also come to see Washington's
magnificent architecture and monuments to the nation's
leaders of government, industry, and the arts.

<p>

On the weekend of April 13 and 14, 1996, two 
federal buildings were sites of two celebrations of which 
few Americans were aware.  The Andrew W. Mellon Auditorium 
is named after industrialist and art collector Andrew 
Mellon, who donated much of his fortune to help found the 
National Gallery of Art.  On the afternoon of Saturday, 
April 13, preparations were underway for what was advertised 
in homosexual publications as the Cherry Jubilee Main Event 
Party to be held in the Mellon Auditorium across the street 
from the Smithsonian Museum of American History.

<p>

That evening, the dignified auditorium, which was 
built in 1935 and has played host to presidential events, 
took on a different cast.  It was bathed in colored lights 
to create a rainbow flag, the symbol of the homosexual 
activist movement.  Inside, thousands of half-naked men 
danced and writhed on the main floor of the auditorium.  
Then event, sponsored by two AIDS activist organizations, as 
well as several local businesses, also had support from 
major corporations:  American Airlines, Snapple, American 
Express, Starbucks Coffee, and Miller Beer.  The party 
lasted from 9 p.m. to 6 a.m.

<p>

Throughout the evening, limousines dropped off 
many of the participants.  As the evening wore on, the 
dancing became more lewd and suggestive, with some dancers 
simulating sexual acts and others shedding clothing.

<p>

Just off the dance floor, at least one couple 
appeared to be having oral sex.  In the darker corners and 
in the restrooms, men met to have sex with one another.  
Restroom stalls were occupied almost continuously with two 
men at a time, and the sounds coming from them indicated 
that cocaine was being snorted and sex acts were occurring.  
Outside, in an alley next door, men disappeared into the 
darkness in pairs.  So many men were using the area, 
security people finally closed it off.  Public urination was 
common, even in front of the building facing Constitution 
Avenue.

<p>

The next day, Cherry Jubilee ended with the 
Capitol Hill Recovery Brunch at the Rayburn House Office 
Building.  Inside the foyer of this historic building which 
houses the offices of many congressmen, drinks were served 
at an open bar while a disk jockey played music.  Cameras 
were forbidden at the event, whose location was arranged by 
openly homosexual Republican congressman Steve Gunderson of 
Wisconsin.

<p>

According to a homosexual publication, the weekend 
events raised $50,000 for two Washington-based AIDS groups:  
Food and Friends and the Whitman-Walker Clinic.  Whitman-Walker 
Clinic, which treats people with AIDS, also hosts 
meetings for gay political activists and promotes such 
causes as lesbian parenting.

<p>

The clinic, which is supposed to discourage 
unhealthy activities such as occurred during the Cherry 
Jubilee party in and around the Mellon Auditorium, 
advertises routinely in the Washington Blade's Lights Out 
section, a supplement that features ads for strip clubs, 
bathhouses, phone sex, prostitution, and orgies, in short, 
the type of unsafe sex that has led to the tragic epidemic 
of AIDS among homosexual men.

<p>

The Cherry Jubilee was not the first time that the 
Andrew Mellon Auditorium has been used for a homosexual 
activist event.  In 1993, during the homosexual march on 
Washington, the auditorium hosted the National S&M Leather 
Fetish Conference.  The event celebrated sadomasochistic sex 
and featured virtually naked men being led around in dog 
collars by their dominant partners.  Pornography and sexual 
paraphernalia was sold, including several publications that 
promote pedophilia, the sexual use of children by adults.
Inside the auditorium, a slide show depicted graphic sexual 
acts.

<p>

SPEAKER: Sadism and masochism. S&M is an 
absolutely wonderful part of, well, sexual life. This
building has the S&M leather fetish contingent for the march 
on Washington.  The S&M Leather coalition of organizations 
from around the country picked up some money, and it is a 
government building.  The Federal Government provided this 
building with just a few applications and permits and some 
money.

<p>

NARRATOR: Americans who have become aware of 
these events have these questions:  how could taxpayer 
supported federal buildings be commandeered by homosexual 
activists for their activities, why did the activists choose 
the federal buildings when they could have rented any number 
of other places to hold these events, and why have political 
leaders done nothing when apprised ahead of time of the 
Cherry Jubilee events in the Rayburn House Office Building 
and the Mellon Auditorium?

<p>

It is time that people knew how their federal
buildings are being used for celebrations of homosexuality,
dangerous sexual activities, and the taking of illicit
drugs.  It is also time to ask why corporations are lending
their good names to this radical agenda and why America's
political leaders are standing by doing nothing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, if people would like to get a
copy of this video and of some of the materials that go with 
it, how could they do that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, they can call our 800 number --
that is 800-225-4008 -- and obtain a copy of the video.  We 
are asking a $7.50 donation just to cover the costs, and 
that is not much for a video, let's face it.  But we did 
incur some expenses in making it, but we are more interested 
in getting it out there so people can see how far the 
homosexual agenda has gone in this city, that they can 
countenance basically an orgy on federal premises and most 
people do not bat an eye.

<p>

It is that bad, folks, and I think this video 
would be a great tool to convince friends who are wavering 
on the issue and think, oh, it is not that big a deal.
Don't worry about it. It's just a matter of tolerance.
Well, if it were just a matter of tolerance, it would be
simple, but it is not.  We are talking about people who are
trying to commandeer governmental power, governmental
buildings, and basically force the homosexual agenda on the
rest of us.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being with us on 
Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, thanks for having me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break,
<i>Straight Talk</i> speaks to those fighting against the
legalization of euthanasia.  Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape segment follows.]

<p>

NARRATOR: A new pro-life movement is quickly
emerging across the nation. These cries for life not only 
echo for unborn children who cannot speak for themselves but 
also for the elderly in response to a chilling trend that 
currently is sweeping courtrooms nationwide, the litigation 
of the so-called right to die.  Physician-assisted suicide 
has become the politically correct term for euthanasia, 
which on March 6, 1996, a federal court of appeals ruled a 
constitutional right.

<p>

At present, the very essence of human life and 
existence appears to be at odds with a growing belief that a 
doctor can help a patient die in the name of humanity.  In 
ancient Greece and Rome, patients never knew if their 
doctors would heal them or kill them.  From those troubling 
times emerged the Hippocratic oath in which doctors pledged 
to do no harm.  Are we on a slippery slope to the same fate 
ancient Greeks and Romans faced?

<p>

DR. KEVORKIAN:  The first thing you do is check
the morality of a law, and if it is immoral, you disobey it.
Ladies and gentlemen, I do that.  You pass any law against
assisted suicide and euthanasia and I will disobey it, I
state it openly, because it is immoral medically.

<p>

NARRATOR:  Soon, the right to die could become the 
duty to die.  Patients with high cost health care or lack of 
family support could feel pressured to end their lives 
prematurely out of fear and loneliness.  Masked in the name 
of humanity is a threat too great to be ignored, doctors and 
health care providers literally snuffing out innocent lives 
in the hour of their greatest need for compassion and 
healing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To help explain what euthanasia 
advocates mean when they talk about compassion, I am joined 
by Dr. David Stevens, Executive Director of the Christian 
Medical and Dental Society, who recently testified before 
the U.S. House Judiciary Subcommittee in opposition to 
euthanasia.  Also joining me is David Morrison, a researcher 
and writer for the Human Life International, which has 
researched euthanasia internationally, and its impact on our 
nation today, and Gracie Hsu, an FRC policy analyst whose 
work deals with the impact of so-called mercy killings.

<p>

Welcome.  It is good to talk to such an esteemed 
group of people.

<p>

Doctor, as our only official doctor here, I guess 
the thing that I would like to ask is, judging from your 
experience in the medical profession in school and the 
reading of the journals and certainly in your professional 
acquaintances, how comfortable are you with your colleagues 
and peers making life and death decisions for other people?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think most doctors are very 
uncomfortable with it.  I think that is why the AMA has come 
out so powerfully against this, which some people doubted 
they would.  This is not about the right to die.  This is 
about the right for doctors to kill.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Right.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  And that is taking medicine into a 
whole level than it has ever been before.  It is giving an 
enormous amount of power to doctors to literally decide 
whether people should die or live.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gracie, you have a degree, a 
master's in public health, and did some extensive studies at 
Johns Hopkins.  Where do you see this trend going in terms 
of empowering physicians, not to save life but to kill when 
it is cost-effective?

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, as we all know, two years ago, 
when Clinton came out with his health care reform plan, one 
of the biggest things that we talked about was the rationing 
of health care resources.  There is only so much money to go 
around, and so where is it best suited, and obviously people 
in the latter stages of life who have terminal illnesses use 
a lot more of those health care dollars than anyone else 
does.  But is that to say, then, that they are somehow less 
suitable to receive those monies simply because they would 
die anyway, and I think really that is the crux of this.

<p>

Doctors are so pressured now, because of HMOs and 
because of other constraints with money, to cut their health
care spending, and this is one way that I see the movement
going, and I think that is the most troubling, especially
for doctors, because it is not necessarily their own
decisions any more, but it is the AMA's or it is the HMO
that they work for or some other type of cost containment
kind of structure that is bearing down on them.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think the key thing is this is
dangerous.  It is dangerous for people.  It is dangerous for 
you.  It is dangerous for me.  It is dangerous for my 
mother.  The way this law is being formatted and what they 
are trying to do is that this will be a personal choice 
between the doctor and their patient.  Can you imagine going 
to the hospital to visit your mother who is very ill, and 
you get there and she is not there, and you ask what 
happened?  Well, my doctor, the doctor that has been taking 
care of her, helped her kill herself last night.  She 
thought that she was too much a burden on the family.  She 
thought that the inheritance was being eaten up. She
thought that you were tired of coming to see her, because
you had not come as often. Can you imagine the guilt that 
that is going to bring on people?

<p>

Then, we need to understand something.  All of us 
escaped the abortion issue.  We are here.  We are not going 
to escape this issue.  This issue is going to face every one 
of us personally.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  David, you have been writing about 
that.  I mean, in some ways euthanasia and the discussion on 
physician-assisted suicide is, in your writings, you are 
seeing it as an extension of the abortion issue.  How do you 
see that being connected?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  In the fact that both the recent 
9th Circuit decision and the <i>Roe v. Wade</i> decision had as 
part of their foundation the notion that people can define 
their own reality, that people can define their own notion 
of what is objectively right and wrong, that human life is 
not kind of a universal standard.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What would the standard be then?  If 
you look at what the 9th Circuit said and the 2nd Circuit 
said, and you were very critical of the thinking in their 
decisions, what would be the standard to decide whether life 
had value?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, people need to go back to the 
universal standard which has been in place for 400 years, 
which is the difference between ordinary and extraordinary 
care, that if, heaven forbid, a person gets cancer and 
begins to die and comes to a point where really all medical 
science has for them is pretty much exhausted, they should 
have an option to say no more extraordinary means, which 
means experimental treatment, whatever, should be used to 
save them.  The disease will take its course, and they 
should be kept comfortable, fed, turned, I mean, all the 
palliative care, but that in terms of having a doctor come 
in and kill them is wrong.

<p>

I mean, what the doctor was saying is absolutely 
true, because the Royal Dutch Medical Society came out 
earlier this year with agreement with the Dutch government 
to back away from physician-assisted suicide in Holland 
because of the doctor stress.  Now they want the situation 
to be where a doctor does not actually do it, that he is 
providing the mechanism for doing it; the person does it 
themselves.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You know, Dave makes a really good 
point in some of his writings in ordinary versus 
extraordinary care that I would like you all to comment on.  
I think one thing that is confusing for people when they 
hear about the so-called right to die is what does that 
mean?  Does that mean I have cancer and I am not going to 
get better and I am merely going to be made comfortable and 
allowed to die?  Is that the right to die?  Because that is 
not what you all are talking about.

<p>

DR. STEVENS: There is a lot of confusion.  I 
think that is one reason that 75 percent of the people in 
the United States right now think that physician-assisted 
suicide is a good thing.  There is so much confusion about 
somebody is going to force me to stay alive against my will, 
and there are laws on the books across this country that 
prevent that from happening.  That is not what we are 
talking about.  What we are talking about is someone helping 
you decide and assisting you in killing yourself, and that 
is a world of difference.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And the thing is, you see, the 
Hemlock Society and all these pro-euthanasia groups that are 
really pro-patient-killing groups, they are coming in and 
making hay off of that confusion.  They are coming in and 
putting a videotape of someone like the guy in Canada, 
Austin Bastable[?], who the Canadian Right to Die Society 
had on DeathNet[?], they had him on the Internet with a 
video and everything, and it was a courageous battle to die.
People look at that and they think, my gosh, that should not
happen to me. Heaven forbid.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they do not understand.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  They do not understand.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to clarify this 
a little further in just a moment.  Join us after the 
commercial break as <i>Straight Talk</i> continues our discussion 
of euthanasia.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. It is hard to believe that 
euthanasia has even made it to our nation's courts, and here 
tonight to explain why is Dr. David Stevens, Executive 
Director of the Christian Medical and Dental Society; David 
Morrison, researcher and writer for Human Life 
International; and Gracie Hsu, an FRC policy analyst.

<p>

Welcome back, everyone.

<p>

Gracie, we were talking a little before about the 
pressures, why people would feel a need to have a family 
member killed, and you had a point to make.

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, if we look at abortion as an 
example, what we find is that women, because they have now 
this choice whether to have an abortion or not, we find that 
many fathers of their children say, look, I am not going to 
take care of your child, because you have that choice.  You 
chose to bear this child to full term, and now it is your 
responsibility.  In that same way, we can expect to see a 
diminished quality of care for the elderly in hospices and 
nursing homes everywhere, because they will be saying to 
them, well, you should be taking your own life; why do I 
need to help you?

<p>

We have this whole perverse understanding of 
compassion.  No longer is it to talk somebody out of their 
depression and to make them feel better about themselves and 
to feel better about life; it is, look, you have no life 
worth living, you might as well kill yourself.  I remember 
as a student health advocate at UCLA, we were told that if 
there was somebody who was thinking about committing suicide 
and you felt that their thinking was -- that they had 
actions planned, that you had a requirement to report that 
to the police because their life was worth saving, and it 
was not because of privacy or anything else.  You had to 
breach that barrier, and you had to say that person's life 
was more important than any breach of privacy or
confidentiality that I may have promised that person.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is an interesting philosophical 
shift where before if someone is talking of killing 
themselves, we have a duty as human beings to care for them 
and to talk them out of it and help them understand the 
value their life has, and now, what?  We have a duty to make 
an appointment so that we can point you to the tallest 
building so you can get the job done?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  One of the things that Gracie said, 
one of the things that I wanted to comment on is that 
palliative care, which is caring for people in the last 
stages of life when medical technology for cures has run 
out, is very low or to non-existent in countries that have 
active patient killing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you are saying that in the Netherlands, for 
example --

<p>

MR. MORRISON: Right, in the Netherlands palliative care is no 
where near what it is in the United States, even, or other 
countries in Europe.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Doctor, do you think there are 
physicians that would embrace assisted suicide?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  I think there are a lot.  Maybe not 
as many as some think, but we only have to look at the 
abortion issue; a little over 2,000 doctors do the vast 
majority of abortions in this country.  I think more will 
get involved in this.

<p>

I think this whole thing is driven by a perversion 
of language.  You know, you talked about suicide.  They use
the word rational suicide.  That is an oxymoron.  There is
no such thing as a rational suicide.  If you are suicidal,
you are not rational.  It is like somebody standing on a
bridge.  You walk up to them, and they explain to you why
they want to kill themselves, and you say, okay, I know it
is hard to jump; let me give you a push.  That is what we
are doing with this issue.  Your doctor will ease it.  It
will not be such a hard decision.  We will make it pleasant,
as you jump.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  The thing is when we as a society 
begin to define death as a good, okay, then it is only 
natural that if we define it as a good, we want to give it 
to other people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now one of the distinctions you make 
in your writings, David, is you say it is understandable 
that at some point a cancer patient, for example, there may 
be nothing else that they can do, and we make them 
comfortable in the death process.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  There may be nothing else that we 
can do to reverse the cancer, that may be true, right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right, and so we make them 
comfortable.  But you make a distinction between medical 
care, that we may be at the end of our medical options, and 
depriving people of water and food.  Why do you make that 
distinction?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Because in my view, depriving 
people of water or food is the same type of the thing as 
patient killing.  It is a slower -- I mean, obviously, there 
can be instances, very limited numbers of instances, where 
to actually give food causes more pain, in which case you 
could make an argument that if you are going to give 
painkilling drugs, you should also withhold food, because it 
has caused the pain, as part of the drugs, but that is not 
the standard.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you see in the medical 
community on that, Doctor?  I think a lot of people -- they 
are afraid that physician-assisted suicide means that if I 
am dying of cancer, my doctor will give me a painkiller so 
that I can proceed in that process.  Does the medical 
community draw lines between ending care and stopping food 
and water?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, there is a lot of debate on 
that issue.  Personally, I think, right along with David, 
that is cruel and unusual punishment.  I mean, we send 
millions overseas to take care of starving children and then 
turn around and starve a relative to death to kill them?  
This was the circuit court ruling in New York.  That is what 
they based -- they said it was discriminatory.  If you are 
willing to do that, then how can you say that you will not 
give someone a handful of pills to kill themselves?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Which is ironic, because we are 
going to justify giving them a handful of pills because we 
are in favor of starvation?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Yes, because we are starving them to 
death. Let's be more humane; let's give them a handful of 
pills.  I mean, this circuitous reasoning that is going on 
in the courts is baffling to me in the profession and, I 
think, a lot of other doctors.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And what I would stress here is 
that each one of these cases is an enormous failure of 
compassion, of real compassion, which is drawing close to 
someone and being with them in their pain, because one of 
the people who sued in the New York case, the 2nd Circuit 
case, was a man dying of HIV/AIDS, and one of the things he 
said in his suit was that my friends have -- my condition 
has progressed to the point that my friends will not come 
visit me.  They say that seeing me gives them nightmares.
So he is going through this terrible experience.  He is
entirely by himself.  His family has forsaken him.  So in
that circumstance, suicide can seem like a much more
appealing prospect.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So instead of us feeling indicted by 
the fact that this gentleman needs love and we are not 
giving him love, we are as a society to feel indicted 
because we do not kill him?  It seems extremely illogical.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  It is not true compassion.  It is false compassion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I wanted to ask you, Doctor, though, 
because one of the reasons why a lot of people are going to 
be talked into killing themselves is going to be money, and 
what do the numbers show us about the costs of our medical 
care at the end of life?

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, people say there is not a 
slippery slope on this issue, but I think it is not only 
slippery, I think it is greased in the United States, 
because 50 percent of health care costs occur in the last 
three months of life.  There is going to be enormous 
pressures on doctors, hospitals.  Insurers are going to be 
putting these pressures, the government, to limit cost, and 
because of that, it is going to drive this into new realms, 
not just the patient who is willing to do it, but the 
comatose person, the disabled person, the elderly person, 
and what was the option or choice to die is going to become 
the duty to die.  You have an obligation to society to do 
this.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Especially for, I think, the 
comatose patient and some of the people who are not as able 
to speak, we are going to run into a real abortion quandary 
where we are killing our friends and relatives.

<p>

I want to talk about this further.  When <i>Straight
Talk</i> returns, we will share more insights into the effects 
of euthanasia on our nation.  You will not want to miss it.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are delving 
into the topic of euthanasia with Dr. David Stevens, David 
Morrison, and Gracie Hsu.  Welcome back.

<p>

Doctor, you had just given us the chilling figure 
that 50 percent of health care costs normally comes in the 
last 3 months of life, which is going to pressure a lot of 
relatives, not to mention HMOs, into convincing people to 
die.

<p>

Gracie, do you think that the money argument is 
going to play well in the public health field, or will they 
be patient advocates?

<p>

MS. HSU:  Well, unfortunately the public health 
industry has been very well known to say that quality of 
life matters much more than the sanctity of human life, and 
so whether it be abortion or euthanasia, they are very much 
in favor of seeing if the quality of life is not there, then 
abortion before they are born and euthanasia after they are 
elderly is a good thing, and unfortunately, the economic 
costs are very large, and they loom greatly in public health 
and in medical circles.

<p>

In fact, in December, when I was with the American 
Medical Association and some of their delegates, talking 
about what are the biggest issues that you see, and I was 
trying to bring to them a pro-life perspective.  They said, 
you know, honestly, the biggest issue right now is economic 
costs and how much it costs to sustain life and especially 
in the last years of care.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But quality of life, I mean, that is 
really in the eye of the beholder sometimes, and I think we 
all -- David, you have written about it, too -- hearken back 
to the quality of life conversations that Nazi Germany had, 
and in the Dr. Kevorkian trial, it has been interesting.  We 
were just talking about that at the break.  The quality of 
life discussion has even infiltrated there.

<p>

Tell us what you saw, Doctor.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, the quality of life discussion 
is all about whether this life is worth living, and that 
means somebody has to make that decision.  Somebody sits 
back, and today it can be one place, and tomorrow it could 
be another group of people, that all of a sudden they do not 
have that quality.

<p>

It was interesting.  Today the prosecutor at the 
Kevorkian trial held up a newspaper from 1933.  Headlines 
blaring said "Suffering to be Ended." That was the Germans 
stating that they were going to begin killing those that 
were disabled, that were retarded, that they were suffering, 
that we were going to relieve their suffering by killing 
them, and we see where that door once it was opened led, and 
I think the same thing is going to happen here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: David, I would like you to address 
that point, because clearly if we start talking about 
quality of life, then we are talking about not the sanctity 
of life, not even -- I mean, it is very much going to be 
subjective.  Who is going to make that decision?

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, in Holland, for example, more 
and more it is doctors, but it is also relatives.  The Dutch 
government did a survey or a report on the practice of 
patient killing, or euthanasia, in Holland.  It was called 
the Remalich[?] Report.  The third reason listed for 
involuntary euthanasia, which is where the person involved 
in being killed does not say yes, please or no, don't, or 
whatever; they are just killed -- the third reason is the 
family could not take it any more.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I mean, that is just ridiculous. The family cannot 
take it any more, so we are going to get rid of our problem.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  Well, because when euthanasia came 
into Holland, it came in not even as a law.  It is still 
technically against the law, but there have been a series of 
judicial agreements, arrangements, understandings over time 
which has made the practice of patient killing, in fact, not 
prosecutable, and what has happened is it started out with 
very narrowly defined -- you had to be very sick, you had to 
be terminally ill, almost the last stages, all these 
qualifications.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You had to ask for it.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  You had to ask for it.  Well, it 
has just been broader and broader and broader.  Again, if 
you define it as a good, the tendency is to give it to more 
people.  So now you have people who are merely depressed.  A 
doctor was brought up on charges in Holland last year 
because he had administered -- he killed a patient who had 
been just mentally -- you know, both of her sons had died, 
she was very depressed, and he had killed her, and they 
brought him up on charges, and they acquitted him.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  It is interesting, too.  Another 
most infamous case was a 27-year-old ballet dancer, and she 
had arthritis in her toes and could not dance any longer, 
became depressed, and her doctor helped kill her.  I mean, 
is that all life is worth?  I cannot dance any more, I 
cannot do another vocation, I cannot go help kids in some 
part of the world?  I mean, there is where life has gone, 
and that is where it will go here, if we are not careful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think we have been schizophrenic 
in our thinking about this.  If you think recently about 
Christopher Reeves, for example, who very sadly broke his 
neck not 10 miles from where we are right now, and I think 
has received very positive public response to his very 
courageous fight, and I remember him being interviewed, and 
he said that he was at that point that he wanted to die and 
his wife and his children said we need you, and that was a 
turnaround for him, and I can imagine the same situation 
where, what, the wife and the children say youre expensive?  
I mean, we are really losing the fact that life brings an 
intangible quality, and I fear we will not see a lot of 
those stories if this keeps up.

<p>

DR. STEVENS: I have treated thousands of patients 
that have been terminally ill.  Almost every one of them 
sometime during the course becomes depressed and despondent.  
Do you know they are scared of?  They are scared of two or 
three things.  They are scared of being a burden.  They are 
scared of loss of control.  They are scared of death itself.  
They are scared of pain.  What they are really wanting -- 
they are sitting out there signaling, saying do you still 
care for me?  Do you still love me?  What we are turning to 
is to say, no, you are right, maybe it would be better if 
you were not here.

<p>

What a message we are sending to people.  When 
they need us the most, we turn around and say, now, here is 
a handful of pills, here is a canister of carbon monoxide.  
We have diagnosed the problem right.  I would be the first 
one to say health care in this country is not perfect, okay, 
and it can be done better, especially at the end of life, 
but we may have the right diagnosis, but this is the wrong 
treatment.  We need to deal with the depression.  We need to 
deal with the cost concerns.  We need to deal with a loving 
atmosphere.  We need to deal with pain control.  But we do 
not need to kill the sufferer to eliminate the suffering.

<p>

MR. MORRISON:  And the thing is, too, that there 
is a witness now.  There is a growing witness, I think, for 
the truth in this, which is coming from Mother Teresas 
whole order, from the Houses of Love she runs for people 
with AIDS around the country.  People do not know that there 
is an organization called LARGE[?], which is a series of 
communities around the world for people who are 
developmentally disabled and people who are not, and they 
all live together, and there are powerful voices there about 
the value of life, the value of living with, quote, unquote, 
a disability.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a slippery slope, isn't it? I
mean, in abortion what we have said is that life is as 
valuable as it is to me.  I have an interesting -- reading 
feminist literature, there was an interesting thing in the 
New York Times Magazine not too long ago -- Gracie and I had 
some long conversations about it -- where the woman came to 
the conclusion after having her own child that it wasn't a
person until she had decided to have the baby and accepted 
its humanity, and until then it was merely a decision, and I 
wonder what kind of leaps of logic we are going to see in 
the end of life.  So you were a person, you were my father, 
until now.  You have a health problem, and so now you are -- 
what? -- not a person.  You are plant life.

<p>

I would like to ask you all in terms of the 
slippery slope, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals 
and other very radical pro-animal groups have argued that, 
you know, animals have their own sort of humanity, and it 
would be better for us to experiment, for example, on 
comatose patients than it would be for us to ever use animal 
tests.  Do you see this kind of euthanasia discussion 
leading to that, because, again, I think, if you look at 
euthanasia, in Germany that that is exactly what happened in 
the death camps, that we saw experiments on humans.

<p>

We actually do not have a lot of time left. Doctor, let me have 
you answer that.

<p>

DR. STEVENS:  Well, I think we are moving to that, 
and all we have to do is look at Kevorkian, you know, the 
physician-assisted suicide poster child.  He back in the 
1960s was going around with an ophthalmoscope and looking 
into people's eyes and retinas as they were dying to try to 
see the exact moment.  He has proposed that we harvest 
organs from prisoners that are going to be killed.  I mean, 
this whole thinking that there is no sacredness to human 
life, we can do whatever we want to people once they are no 
longer declared to be human.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a powerfully dangerous slippery slope.

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares insights from 
Family Research Council President Gary Bauer.  Please stay 
tuned, and thank you to my guests.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. FRC President Gary Bauer had 
the opportunity to speak at the 1996 National Day of Prayer 
event and provided his insight into the current plight of 
our nation and its families. Let's hear what Gary had to 
say as we share some Homefront News.

<p>

<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/hmfrnt.gif" alt="Homefront News">
</center>

<p>

MR. BAUER:  For about 10 years now, two-thirds of 
the American people have been saying that America is headed 
in the wrong direction.  They said that when George Bush was 
in the White House and the Democrats controlled the 
Congress, and they are saying it now with Bill Clinton in 
the White House and the Republicans controlling the 
Congress, and I do not believe it has anything to do with 
the ebb and flow of politics or who happens to be sitting in 
the Oval Office.

<p>

I think the American people are pondering the soul 
of America.  I think they are thinking about a mother in 
North Carolina who straps her children in the back seat of a 
car and sends it to the bottom of a lake, or about a family 
in Los Angeles that makes one wrong turn and before they can 
get off that street of killers, their 3-year-old child is 
dead of sniper fire, or the incredible headlines a few weeks 
ago of a 1-month-old baby almost being kicked to death by a 
6-year-old in a robbery, and the politicians read the 
headlines, and they have no idea what to do.

<p>

My friends, there are many, many ways to measure a 
great nation.  You can measure it by the size of its 
economy, the strength of its military, and the gleam of its 
cities, and by those measurements the United States is a 
great, great nation.

<p>

But you can also measure a nation by how many of 
its families are broken, how big its virtue deficit is, how 
many of its children will cry themselves to sleep, and the 
fact of the matter is that tonight in Washington, DC and in 
the suburbs and all over this country, too many of our 
children will cry themselves to sleep, too many children 
without a father's arms to comfort them, too many children 
exploited by drugs or pornography, too many children who 
have bought into the siren song of the culture that says if 
it feels good, do it, and by that measurement, we are in 
danger of becoming something much less than a great nation.

<p>

Now all the politicians are asking why?  What 
happened?  What is the government program we need?  I don't 
think there is a government program.  I don't think there is 
any number of bureaucrats that can make it right.  I believe 
that what happened is that we forgot God, and having 
forgotten God, we have unleashed the hounds of hell on our 
streets and our neighborhoods and our communities, and 
unless we are willing to deal with that, then all the 
politicians in the world will not be able to put America 
back together again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we will share our conversation
with a true American hero.  Almost 1 year ago, on June 2, 
1995, U.S. Air Force Captain Scott O'Grady's life changed 
forever.  On that June afternoon, Captain O'Grady flew 
his F-16 over hostile Bosnian territory enforcing the 
United Nations no-fly zone, when suddenly an anti-aircraft 
missile hit his plane.  From then, miracle after 
miracle led to his rescue, which occurred almost 6 days 
after Captain O'Grady found himself hiding in hostile 
territory without food or water.

<p>

The successful Marine rescue mission brought 
home a brave new hero, and we will find out how Captain 
O'Grady's experience shaped what he is doing today and 
shapes his future.  You will not want to miss this 
exclusive <i>Straight Talk</i> interview.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Robert Knight, the 
Family Research Council's director of cultural studies.
Bob enlightens us on a crucial social and policy change
which threatens to redefine marriage as we know it now
and have known it since even before recorded history.
The courts in Hawaii are toying with redefining marriage 
to mean two men or two women or fill in the blank,
instead of protecting the relationship at the core of all 
civilized societies, marriage between a man and a woman.

<p>

Bob shares important information regarding the 
ramifications of this change that you probably will not 
hear on the broadcast or print news coverage as we take 
you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You know, it may 
seem strange to a lot of our viewers, but we are actually 
going to have a conversation about what is marriage, and 
why do we even care what it is?  Why are we talking about
marriage today?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, it has been forced upon us.
This is not an issue that we raised, because we have been 
for marriage all along and want it to stay the way it is:
the social, legal, spiritual, and economic union of a man 
and a woman.  That is what it has been for centuries.  In 
fact, if you just reduce it to the bringing together of 
the two sexes to form families, that is the way it has 
always been across cultures around the world for 
thousands of years.

<p>

So the only reason we are even discussing it is 
because of a court case in Hawaii.  Three years ago,
three same sex couples sued to get a marriage license.
They were denied by the state of Hawaii because there is 
an opposite sex missing in each couple, and so they took 
their case all the way to the Hawaiian Supreme Court.
That court told the state:  find a compelling interest in 
maintaining this definition of marriage, or we are going 
to legalize homosexual marriage under the state's gay 
rights law.

<p>

So right now that court case is simmering.  It 
is supposed to be heard in August, 1996, and because of 
the full faith and credit clause of the U.S. 
Constitution, if Hawaii legalizes gay marriage -- that is 
an oxymoron -- then all the other states would see their 
laws threatened, because a couple from California or 
Illinois or North Carolina could fly to Honolulu, get a 
bogus marriage certificate, come back and say under the 
Constitution, you have to recognize our license.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Yes, I think we almost have to 
explain that a little further, because that is the clause 
through which all contracts in all of the states are 
accepted, such as drivers' licenses or marriage licenses 
or even business agreements.  Would the full faith and 
credit clause sweep this nationwide?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it would.  There is one little 
-- well, a lot of rays of hope here.  For one thing, 
states are moving very rapidly to protect themselves.  At 
least nine states have enacted laws saying, look, we mean 
by marriage one man and one woman and that is it, and we 
are not going to recognize any licenses from anywhere 
that say otherwise, and this is continuing.  I expect 
more and more states will adopt these kinds of laws.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there precedent for one state 
to say that for us we will restrict agreements from other 
states in certain areas?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, yes.  The Congress had to 
take this up because of child custody proceedings.  There 
were different varying definitions of what a child is and 
that sort of thing.  So Congress stepped in and said, 
well, look, we will amend the U.S. code and make national 
definitions that everybody can use, and that is what is 
happening now at the federal level on the marriage issue.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act, introduced in the 
House and the Senate, does precisely that.  It says that 
no state can be forced to renounce its own definition 
just because another state has taken up a radical 
redefinition, and it also defines marriage as one man/one 
woman for the federal government, which is no small 
thing, unfortunately.  Government is too big.  You are 
talking Social Security, the military, the welfare 
agencies.  The use of the term marriage and spouse is 
everywhere in the federal code.  So this would make a 
major dent in the drive to redefine marriage if the 
entire federal government goes on record as supporting 
the traditional definition of marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It seems obvious, Bob, that the 
Hawaii case could have drastic social consequences, but I 
think the question that most people would really like to 
hear you answer is what does it matter if two men or two 
women decide to go through a legalized ceremony for their 
relationship?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, that is the problem, and that 
is what we hear all the time.  Hey, how are you 
threatened?  Barney Frank says it all the time.  How are 
you threatened if I and a lover live together?  Well, you 
are threatened any time the moral order is shaken by 
activities that are immoral and hurt people.
Homosexuality by its essence hurts people.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How does it hurt people?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, because it is a breakdown of 
the moral code.  When sexuality is not channeled into 
marriage -- and we are talking about premarital sex, 
adultery, homosexuality, anything short of marriage -- 
and historical precedents show that it breaks down the 
moral order.  It breaks down the way we live.  It hurts 
the kinship structure.

<p>

Marriage was not invented to oppress 
homosexuals.  It was invented because it is the way to 
form families, and it is the building block of 
civilization, and when you have any sex outside marriage, 
you run the risk of sexually transmitted diseases, 
breaking down support for marriage within the culture, 
which has already happened in this country with no-fault 
divorce and the whole push for premarital sex.  Marriage 
has already been cheapened to the point where now 
homosexual activists think they can deal the final blow 
by expanding the definition so far that marriage will not 
mean anything any more.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A lot of the conversation on this 
issue of marriage being redefined for homosexuals has 
surrounded the point that marriage tames men.  So if we 
had marriage for gay men, they would be tamed.  But don't 
women really tame men in the context of a committed 
relationship?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  I think women help a lot, because 
men have something else to live for other than their own 
appetites and desires when they have families.  So I 
would not dismiss that out of hand, but the claim that if 
we let homosexuals marry they will suddenly behave 
themselves is bogus.  In areas where they have de facto 
gay marriage, like San Francisco, where they really 
recognize the union, the social pathologies are still 
soaring, and the gays are very clear in their literature 
that what they mean by marriage is different from what 
other people mean.  They have outside relationships.

<p>

Andrew Sullivan, the editor of the <i>New Republic</i>,
said that gay male relationships may even be superior to
marriage, because they understand the need for outside 
sexual contacts.  So they are not even talking about
monogamy.  Furthermore, other gay activists have been
even more candid, like Michelangelo Signarilli[?], who
said we need to get marriage because it is the final tool
to ram through the rest of the homosexual agenda:
teaching homosexuality to children in schools, forcing
businesses to provide benefits to subsidize
homosexuality, the whole gay agenda.  He also said, look,
we want marriage, not to live by society's moral code but 
to help destroy an archaic institution.  I mean, this guy 
is priceless, because he is actually saying out loud what 
the gay activists have been planning all along.  So in 
the name of tolerance, we are supposed to accept 
something that really will destroy marriage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, on <i>This Week with David
Brinkley</i>, California Attorney General Dan Lundgren made 
an interesting defense of marriage, where he said that 
one reason why we protected marriage, that union of 
man/woman and then the family that came from it, was 
because of the implications for that on social breakdown 
and that increased crime, in particular, was a real 
problem for societies where men and women did not work 
together consistently for the raising of children.  Would 
homosexual marriage of any kind create some kind of 
safety net against crime?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, no, it would do the opposite, 
because it would reduce the support for marriage within 
the cultural and legal codes.  Once you redefine marriage 
so that it is not even the bringing together of the two 
sexes, then the sky is the limit.  You could have three 
people, four people.  Unmarried heterosexual couples have 
piggybacked on the gay rights agenda to demand that they 
be treated the same as married couples.  If that happens, 
then the support for marriage disintegrates, and when 
marriage disintegrates, commitment is lessened.  You do 
not have the ties between the generations.

<p>

I do not think the average person really -- 
well, maybe average people do.  They are smarter than all 
the activists put together.  They know marriage is the 
glue that holds society together.  It ensures kinship 
passing from generation to generation.  We talk of our 
grandparents and our children yet to be, and there is a 
linkage there.

<p>

When sex goes outside marriage, you break that 
linkage, or if it goes into a phony homosexual type 
marriage.  I mean, you do not have that generational 
intimacy and passing on of property, names.  I mean, 
think of what a society would be with widespread so-called 
homosexual marriage.  It would be in utter chaos.
So why would we want to introduce a chaotic element into 
a society that already needs to bolster marriage?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Really at the heart of this 
controversy over redefining marriage is the traumatic 
social change of making children available for adoption 
into households with two men or two women and then the 
very powerful social message that children do not need a 
mother and a father, that as long as two guys care about 
you, or two women, that a whole lot of social 
relationships are insignificant.  Are you concerned about 
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Children are desperate for clues as 
to how to grow up, to be either men or women, and they 
look to both sexes for clues.  Boys look to their dads 
for how to grow up to be men, and they look to their 
mothers and their fathers for how women and men interact, 
how husbands and wives interact, how mothers and fathers 
interact.  They have to learn how to treat the opposite 
sex and be treated by the opposite sex.

<p>

The same for little girls.  You know, without a 
dad, they are not sure how men should be treating women, 
or without a mom -- that is their role model.  That is 
their security in developing their femininity.  If you 
take that away, you are trying to create an artificial 
gender identity by theory basically rather than by 
experience.  So when you have a household in which you 
have mom and dad replaced by just two men or two women, 
you are leaving out such an important element that the 
child knows it.  We are experimenting on children.  This 
is wrong.

<p>

Again, nobody knows this better than single 
parents, who are struggling mightily to try to replace 
that void in the child's life that they know is there, 
and a lot of parents are heroically trying to fill that 
void.  But in a homosexual household, now you are talking 
about having one sex missing entirely and a distorted 
version of sexuality and relationships presented to the 
child on a daily basis.  This is putting children at 
risk.  It is not reasonable to assume this will have no 
impact on children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The homosexual activists have 
talked a lot about the fact that they need to redefine 
marriage under the law so that they can give property 
through wills, so that they can visit loved ones in the 
hospital, but do we really need that kind of huge social 
change to accomplish those two goals?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, most of the activists greatly 
exaggerate any legal problems they already have.  You can 
leave anything you want to anybody in a will.
Homosexuals already do that routinely.  What they want is 
that family should not have an advantage in any legal 
challenge to a will, and to do that you would have to 
devalue family entirely.  You know, children coming out 
of a marriage, even if it is sundered, should have 
certain rights in an inheritance proceeding.  What the 
gay activists are saying is they should not have any more 
standing than, say, a string of gay lovers, and that is 
wrong.

<p>

As far as hospital visitation, that is not a 
federal issue.  It is not even a state issue.  That is 
between the hospital administrators and their patients, 
and there is no reason that gays should seize marriage, 
completely radically redefine it, just to have a change 
in hospital visitation rules.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It seems a bit extreme.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, it is the most compelling 
argument they have, that, oh, I can't even visit my lover 
in the hospital; isn't that unfair?  Maybe it is, but you 
do not seize marriage and radically redefine it to 
correct that one problem, if it is a problem.  You know, 
there is a reason family members have been given priority 
in visitation of loved ones.  Friends cannot make the 
same claims that family members can.  The same with 
homosexual lovers.  No matter how close they are, it is 
still not family.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, as we take a look at some of 
the serious possible changes in our culture that could 
come from redefining marriage, I think it is interesting 
to remember that the family is defined as that unit bound 
by blood, by birth, by adoption, and by marriage.  What 
do you think the most serious social consequence is if we 
change what marriage means?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, already, marriage has been 
severely weakened by many forces:  pornography, no-fault 
divorce, sex education that omits marriage as a central 
element and talks about partners.  I mean, marriage is 
already, as the author Maggie Gallagher says, on the outs 
in the society.  She calls it a post-marital culture, and 
we are reaping a whirlwind from it.  Certainly crime is 
one of the greatest aspects of that, but if we go the 
final route and say that men and women are not different 
and homosexual marriage is the equivalent of a man and a 
woman together, then we have embraced a lie.  We have 
embraced something that is so toxic that it will spoil 
the whole culture, because you cannot lie about something 
as basic as nature and get away with it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thanks so much for being with 
us today, and we are going to watch very closely what 
happens through your work on the Defense of Marriage Act.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Thanks for having me, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> shares my conversation with Captain Scott 
O'Grady.  Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I recently had the 
opportunity to speak with Captain Scott O'Grady, the Air 
Force pilot who survived 6 days and nights in hostile 
Bosnian territory before his miraculous rescue.  This 
life-changing experience occurred almost 1 year ago, and 
Captain O'Grady's life has not been the same since.

<p>

Let's hear what he has to say about life as an American hero.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Scott, thank you so much for 
joining us on <i>Straight Talk</i>. I do not think there are 
too many people who have not heard your story by now, and 
we do want to hear your story, too, but your life has 
changed a lot since you were rescued.  How is it 
different?  I mean, all your life, you are training to be 
a pilot, and suddenly you are a pilot plus more, 
something philosophical for America.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, it is something that I 
thought was just going to go away, actually, and when I 
moved out to Hill Air Force Base, Salt Lake City area, 
where I am now assigned, flying the F-16, I pretty much 
thought that a lot of the requests in the mail would come 
to an end, and they have not, and I was trying to decide, 
you know, what can I do with all of this, and I am 
working hard on trying to fulfill all the requests a lot 
of people have of me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What kind of requests do people have?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Oh, there are a lot of 
different charity organizations that would like to have 
me stop by or community organizations and schools.  That 
is what I do now is I fly the F-16 half the month, but 
the other half of the month I travel a lot, and I do 
speaking engagements; I do the schools, or just as an 
example, I will go to a fund-raiser for a charity.

<p>

I am deciding now that I need to get some 
organization.  I have some help from people that are 
helping me with all the requests, and I am going to 
narrow it down to where I am going to concentrate on two 
charities.  I am going to concentrate on still visiting 
schools and doing things for community organizations, but 
people have to realize that I am only one person, but I 
do tell them that if they would be patient, that I will 
live a long life --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And you will get there some day.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  I will get there some day.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  In a way, you have become the 
ambassador for the military to the rest of the America.  
I think the military in some ways is at a time, 
especially in the media, of a lot of criticism, and you 
have presented a symbol of what the military is proud of.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: See, I am not a spokesman for the military.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, I understand.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: And I do not even recruit for 
the military.  I do not do that.  But I will tell people 
all the time how happy I am to be serving in the military 
and how fantastic it is to have worked with all the great 
people that are in the Air Force, the Navy, the Marines, 
the Army, and the Coast Guard.  People have to realize 
that we are just like everyone else in America.  We are 
the same people.  We have the same feelings.  But yet we 
are also doing a job that does not ask the normal demands 
that a job in the civilian sector would.  We are in a job 
that could ask for you to put your life on the line to 
defend freedom, and people are dedicated enough and 
believe in their cause that if that is the call, then 
they are going to go ahead and do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I have a friend right now that is 
in Korea.  Obviously there are some tensions there, North 
Korea talking about going into the demilitarized zones, 
and there are a lot of hot spots around the world.  He 
told me that the thing that was most impressive to him 
about your experience was that you went by the book.  You 
know, you were sitting there following all these 
procedures and that this was successful.

<p>

How did your training prepare you for what you experienced?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, training is something 
that we have in the military, and it prepares us not only 
just how to run things on a day-to-day operational basis, 
but also we prepare for emergencies.  We prepare for the 
unexpected.  It is all training that is based on previous 
successes and previous failures, because you always learn 
from your experiences to be able to benefit those in the 
future, and that just does not go with military training; 
it goes with day-to-day living.

<p>

But it was a foundation for me to grab hold of, 
something that was real and tangible when everything was 
going crazy all at once in just brief short periods of 
time, but it also does not give you the motivation to get 
through a time like that.  You have to derive your 
strength from somewhere else, and the inspiration I got 
was definitely from people that I know that have gone 
through worse situations, those who have been prisoners 
of war, those who have been in survival situations, maybe 
not even in combat, and I knew that they had gone through 
hard times and could get through.

<p>

So they gave me inspiration, but really it came 
down to, for me, getting the strength to get through it 
came from faith, came from love of family, came from love 
of country.  And that is really where, when you get down 
to the bottom basics of going through a situation like I 
went through, you have to have somewhere deep inside you 
the will to live, love of life, and that is where it 
comes from.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, the President 
of the United States, accompanied by General John M. 
Shalikashvili, Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff, the 
Honorable William J. Perry, and Captain Scott O'Grady.

<p>

GENERAL SHALIKASHVILI:  Mr. President, Secretary
Perry, members of Congress, other distinguished guests,
members of the Armed Forces.  Thank you for coming, even
in this rain, and for helping us welcome home this very 
special young man, Captain Scott O'Grady, and to extend a
warm welcome to his father, Dr. O'Grady, his mother, Mrs.
Scardapane[?], her husband, Mr. Scardapane, Scott's
brother Paul and his sister Stacy, and his grandparents.
We are delighted you could all be here today, for surely
this is a very proud and a very happy moment for us all.
Welcome.

<p>

Ten days ago, like thousands of other men and 
women in uniform, performing dangerous missions in 
difficult and demanding circumstances all over the world, 
Captain O'Grady was flying over Bosnia, doing his part to 
deny the skies to those who would rain death and 
destruction upon that war-torn land below, but as we all 
now know, in the early morning hours of 2 June, the 
course of Captain O'Grady's life took a dramatic turn, 
and the next 6 days put to test every bit of his 
knowledge, every fiber of his courage, every bit of skill 
and determination, and every ounce of faith that he could 
muster, and for 6 long days, people around the world, his 
family, his friends, every American, waited impatiently 
for news of his fate, and while they were 6 long days for 
us to wait, they must have seemed like an eternity for 
Scott O'Grady.

<p>

Then, on the 7th of June, out of the darkness in 
the hills of Bosnia came that voice; this is Badger 52.
At last we had our opportunity, and so a remarkable team
that had been praying for that call sprang into action.
NATO's combined air operation center in Vicenza, Italy -- 
Americans, Italians, Dutch, French, Spanish -- under the 
direction of U.S. Air Force Major General Hal 
Hornberg[?], quickly took control and started issuing 
orders.

<p>

At Avigliano[?], Colonel Chuck Wald[?] began to 
launch air defense suppression aircraft and those that 
would provide close air support, if needed.  Others made 
sure that air refueling aircraft were in station, to 
include a French KC-135.  Still others double-checked 
that NATO AWACs and the French E-3M with Major 
L'Enfant[?] on board, were ready to provide airborne 
control and radar data, and off the deck of the USS 
Kiresarge[?], under the command of Colonel Marty Burn[?], 
into the dark foggy night rose those who would this day 
do the heavy lifting, the Stallion helos, the Cobra 
gunships, the Harriers, and the Marines of the 24th 
Expeditionary Unit, and 2 hours and 5 minutes later, 
Colonel Marty Burn reached out his hand and pulled Scott 
aboard the rescue helicopter.

<p>

Although they still had to dodge bullets and 
shoulder-fired rockets, Scott was at last on his way 
home, and the professionalism, the courage, the inner 
strength of Captain O'Grady and every member of the team 
that brought him home are vivid reminders, if reminders 
we need, that our greatest strength and the source of our 
deepest pride are our men and women in uniform, and the 
deeds of courage that we are here to salute and applaud 
are reminders, as well, of our responsibility to take 
care of them and of their families.

<p>

Scott, today is an especially great day to wear 
America's uniform, and you and the rest of your team have 
made it so.  For that I thank you and I salute you, and 
with a great deal of happiness, I welcome you home.
Welcome home, Scott.  Welcome home.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more from 
Captain Scott O'Grady after this commercial break.  Don't
go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are sharing our 
conversation with Captain Scott O'Grady as he discusses 
memories of the fateful events which changed his life 
forever.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  The first thing I want to do is thank God, thank 
God for His love.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you remember most about 
your experience?  We have heard a lot.  You were 
obviously shot down, you were behind enemy lines, and 
they were looking to kill you, and eventually you were 
rescued.  What do you remember most about that 
experience?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, if I would have come 
home and nobody would have paid attention to the story 
and I just would have returned to my family, it still 
would have been the most positive experience of my life.
The thing that people have to realize is that I do not
recommend, you know, life-threatening situations as being
something that everybody should explore, but it was 
definitely something that I was able to, like I said 
before, look inside myself and see what is really 
important in life, and the relationship you have with 
your faith, and it is not just so much having a faith as 
having trust, and then love of family.

<p>

I would have given up everything I own to be 
able to return to my family, and you realize that that is 
what is really important, those relationships, because 
materialistic things are things that you are not going to 
take with you, and it isnt until your health is 
threatened that -- you forget all the time in your day-to-day 
living how valuable your health and your well-being is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  How has it changed you now, now 
that you have had this experience, really a crystallizing 
moment where you could have lost everything including 
your life?  So how do you live differently?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Oh, I still have the problems 
as everybody else, but you just keep on constantly 
remembering what is important in life and where your 
priorities should lie, and with that, though, try to 
simplify your life to where then you can have the room 
and the space and the time to be able to concentrate on 
those relationships that are the most important thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What kind of advice would you give 
somebody from that?  I mean, what kind of tool to help 
them understand?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  I think the biggest thing is 
people have to realize that myself and other individuals 
who have gone through a situation like this, we did not 
ask for it, and we also of course prior to this would 
say, oh, gee, I could never get through something like 
that, because even now I have people who come up to me 
and say I never could have done what you did, and that is 
not true.

<p>

You would be surprised what kind of strength you 
have inside you when you are faced with an adverse 
situation, and you have to just concentrate hopefully on 
what is really important in life.  I know that everybody 
gets wrapped up in the day-to-day living, and there is 
always this to worry about and that to worry about, but 
if you take a step back and kind of look at the big 
picture, you realize that most of the things you are 
dealing with and most of your worries in life really are 
not that important.

<p>

MR. PERRY:  We are here today to celebrate true 
grit, great training, superior technology, and 
outstanding leadership.  The true grit is obvious to the 
entire country.  It was the courage and skill 
demonstrated by Captain O'Grady.  They shot down his 
plane but not his spirit.  The true grit was also evident 
in the courage and skill of Colonel Burn and the Marine 
Corps search and rescue team.  They proved that the 
Marines have landed and the situation is well in hand.

<p>

The great training was evident in the efficiency 
of the operation, reflected in Captain O'Grady's training 
and survival techniques, and the Marines' training in 
search and rescue operations.  Training is the key to 
ready effective forces, because the more you sweat in 
peace, the less you bleed in war.

<p>

Normally, the technology of greatest importance 
in search and rescue operations is our night vision 
devices.  These allow us to operate at night and give us 
the benefit of stealth.  As the Army says, we own the 
night.

<p>

However, this search and rescue operation had to 
be conducted in daylight.  So we lost the advantage of 
operating at night.  But fortunately, we had the 
advantage of another piece of technology, the Global 
Positioning Satellite, or GPS.  Captain O'Grady used the 
GPS receiver in his survival kit to determine his exact 
location to within 100 feet, and the search and rescue 
team, using its own GPS receiver, was able to set down 
virtually at the pilot's position. This allowed them to 
keep their time on the ground, the time of greatest risk, 
to only 2 minutes.  This was an amazing performance for a 
search and rescue operation.

<p>

I want also to note the outstanding leadership 
of General Jawin[?], Admiral Smith, Lieutenant General 
Ryan, and, yes, General Shalikashvili.  They were faced 
with a really tough decision.  They had planned a night 
operation to take advantage of our night vision 
technology, but Captain O'Grady's radio signal was 
confirmed just 3 hours before dawn.

<p>

So they had to make a choice, either to wait 
another 18 hours until the next nightfall to rescue him, 
and that would risk that the pilot would be captured 
during the day, or to go immediately, even without the 
advantage of operating at night.  They chose to go.  It 
was a gutsy decision.

<p>

It turned out to be the right decision, and it 
was in the best military tradition, exemplified in a 
famous letter that was pointed out to me by General 
Sullivan, Chief of Staff of the Army, the letter that 
General Sherman wrote to General Grant.  He said:  I knew 
wherever I was that you thought of me, and if I got in a 
tight place, you would come.  To Captain O'Grady, Colonel 
Burn and the Marine search and rescue team, General 
Jawin, Admiral Smith, and General Ryan, you should be 
very proud of your performance.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we 
will hear more about Captain Scott O'Grady's heroic 
experience and miraculous rescue.  Join us after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. We are sharing 
with you my visit with an American hero, Captain Scott 
O'Grady, as we hear some of his memories and trials and 
triumph.

<p>

[Videotape follows.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Could you describe for us your 
darkest moment and your brightest moment during that 
experience?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: The darkest moment was 
actually when I was on the ground for the first couple of 
hours and the people were walking very close to my 
proximity, and I heard approximately five or six 
gunshots, and they were all carrying rifles, and the way 
it was sporadically done, along with the different 
locations, the only thing I could conclude was that they 
saw something or heard something that they heard was me 
and shot at it, and that scared me, because now I am 
thinking that the probability of getting caught is going 
to be very high, but I also was anticipating the fact 
that I would be mistreated, but now, because of that 
occurrence, I thought instead of being mistreated, they 
would probably just kill me.  So that was actually the 
time of a very heightened state of fear.

<p>

Prior to that, a lot of things happened to me, 
but I just did not have time to be afraid.  Afterwards, I 
really was not afraid when I was out there.

<p>

As far as the greatest moment, it was definitely 
when I finally could hear Tio Hanford[?] come up on the 
radio and respond to my voice.  That was like being 
reborn.  It was like a bolt of energy that ran through me 
that I had never had before, because you wanted to let 
loose on every emotion possible; you wanted to laugh, you 
wanted to scream, you wanted to cry, and that was a 
fantastic and phenomenal moment in my life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Then when you returned to base and 
you got to see men and women who you knew well and who 
had really prayed for your return, what was that like?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  That was unexpected and a very 
emotional time, too.  In fact, when I got off the 
airplane and I saw everybody in the hangar, I had to go 
and get cleaned up, because, again, I was very emotional.  
So we went off, and I took a little bit of a breather, 
and then we came back and said hello to everybody, and 
that was a fantastic time.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you have any momentos from that 
experience, either a mental momento or even a physical 
momento?  Do you have anything that you can hold in your 
hand and you remember?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, I always have my cross 
on, and that was with me, and I had my Swiss army knife 
that got me through, and then my watch.  But as far as 
momentos, the biggest thing is just the memory of the 
event, and it has actually become a story to me, because 
I have been able to tell a lot of people about it, and 
there are no nightmares.  It is actually the most 
positive thing that has ever happened to me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It changed your life.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  It definitely did.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now, I know you are going to work with St. Jude's.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, I am going to try to 
start a relationship with two charities.  We have not 
done anything yet.  I am trying to organize all these 
things that are coming up in my life that I never 
expected, and one of the two charities I really want to 
set up a relationship with is St. Jude's Children's 
Hospital, also the Make A Wish Foundation.  Both 
concentrate on children which are going through adverse 
times, trying to overcome diseases that are life-threatening, 
and if that does not tug at your heart, I do not know what will.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we close, Scott, your 
experience really can relate to what these kids are 
facing.  They are going to be asked to deal with pain and 
suffering that they are pretty unprepared for.  What do 
you think you can tell them when they are looking to 
something that seems very dark to them?

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Well, the biggest thing I 
learned is you never quit, and you never even think about 
anything but a good outcome.  You always keep a positive 
mental attitude.  But for me, the reason why those two 
hit home so well is the fact that these are children that 
do not have the normal lifestyle that I had when I was 
growing up.  They do not have a normal childhood.  Here 
they are inflicted with something that they did not ask 
for, just like I did not ask for what happened to me, and 
yet have also such great life and spirit inside of them.  
It is really a treat to be able to go and be able to do 
something for those children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And their tragedies can be a great triumph for 
them, as well.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY: Oh, yes. Yes, it is definitely character-building.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Scott, thank you so much for being with us on 
<i>Straight Talk</i>.

<p>

CAPTAIN O'GRADY:  Thanks.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> 
shares how policy makers and communities can make a 
difference in stopping the breakdown of marriages in 
America.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. We now bring you a portion 
of a recent panel discussion at the Heritage Foundation, 
which tackled the collapse of marriage and its economic 
and social consequences.  Bill Mattox, the Vice President 
for Family Research Council's Policy Division, provided 
his expertise regarding this important issue.  So let's
hear some of Bill's insight on tonight's Homefront News.

<p>

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  There are many implications for 
policy makers and others for the collapse of marriage, 
and I want to take just a minute to outline a couple.  
For public policy makers, I think it is going to be 
extremely important for public policy makers to be 
cautious about making divorce law distinctions between 
couples with children and couples without.

<p>

Bill Galston[?] did all of us a tremendous favor 
several years back when he and Elaine Kaymark[?] 
presented a paper from the Progressive Policy Institute 
called "Putting Children First," which argued that on 
many of these kinds of questions, the first question we 
should be asking ourselves is how will children fare, how 
do children fare, and what ought we do to meet the needs 
of children?

<p>

I think that is a very important question for us 
to consider when it comes to marriage, for all of the 
reasons that have been cited about the negative effects 
of divorce and out of wedlock childbearing on children, 
but I guess when it comes to public policy, I am a bit 
disturbed about the possibility of making distinctions on 
this basis, considering those marriages in which a child 
is present somehow different from those in which a child 
is not, and the reason is just because I think, though it 
is clear that a child's well-being is more adversely 
affected by the break-up of his own parents' marriage, I 
think it is nevertheless true that a child is going to be 
affected by the failure of other marriages in the 
community, most especially marriages of their neighbors, 
their extended family members, their grandparents, and 
other role models in the community.

<p>

I also think, by the way, that we need to look 
at the whole question of affirmative action, of all 
things, and how it may be contributing inadvertently to 
problems of marriage breakdown in the black community, 
and there is a dramatic difference in the way in which 
minority women and minority men are being assimilated 
into the current labor force.

<p>

What you see is that minority women are much 
more likely to move into positions of promotions and get 
higher salaries than are minority men, and I think part 
of the reason for this may in fact be that with the 
current affirmative action policies dealing with both the 
subject of race and gender, that what has happened is 
that a minority woman is in a sense a two-bagger for an 
employer.  If he hires or she hires a minority woman, 
that both improves the race makeup and improves the 
gender makeup, whereas a minority male is kind of a mixed 
bag.  He improves the race mix, but it comes at the 
expense of the gender mix, and I think for that reason 
there is a subtle inclination or pressure or tendency for 
some employers to favor minority women over minority men.

<p>

Lastly, let me say that as much as we might want 
to try to tackle this through public policy, I am not 
convinced that the problem can be turned around 
significantly by public policy means.  In fact, I am 
increasingly convinced that it is going to be churches 
and other community-based institutions that will help to 
turn this around.

<p>

We need to be encouraging leaders in religious 
institutions to deal with what I believe to be a rather 
casual attitude about divorce and remarriage in both 
their doctrinal teaching, as well as in their premarital 
counseling practices, whether or not they conduct those.  
I am extremely encouraged by this idea of having 
community marriage policies where all the ministers in a 
community agree that they will not marry someone until 
they have gone through premarital counseling.

<p>

I also think there needs to be greater emphasis, 
of course, at the practical level with marriage 
enrichment programs, and I think that there needs to be 
an emphasis on relationship building across generations.  
This is something that I think can be facilitated to a 
great extent by the church.

<p>

The couples that succeed are those who learn to 
resolve conflict.  It is not that they do not experience 
the same ups and downs and have the same sort of problems 
as everybody else.  It is that they manage to somehow 
work through their difficulties, to persevere, and to 
quite often come out on the other side of those problems 
with a stronger marriage, and I think in many ways some 
of the older couples in our communities and in our 
country have the opportunity to share with younger folks 
that sense of, hey, you can make it, stick it out, work 
through these things, and can perhaps strike that balance 
that is so needed where we hang onto our romantic ideals 
about what we want marriage to be while at the same time 
confronting the sober realities of how difficult it quite 
often is.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>.  I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.  Tonight
on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we are looking at the drug crisis which
has crippled our nation, destroying communities and shattering
families.  Illicit drug use strangles the life out of many people,
and America desperately seeks solutions.  One of the newest answers
comes in the form of needle exchange programs in which drug users
who shoot up exchange used, often AIDS-tainted needles for sterile
needles.  Needle exchange programs claim to curb the spread of
the AIDS virus without encouraging drug abuse, but is that true?
Tonight, we will investigate.  You will want to hear what some
experts have to say about our continuing battle against drugs
and for lives.

<p>

But first, let's hear from Family Research Council's president,
Gary Bauer.  The political implications of character are news
this week, as analysts discuss what the Whitewater convictions
of Bill Clinton's friends will mean for his presidency.  With
years of political experience, Gary Bauer brings a special insight
into the power of the values and character issues.

<p>

Polls indicate that most Americans believe that our country
is on a downward spiral and that politicians are poor role models,
especially on moral issues.  Let's hear Gary's predictions on
where America's values are headed as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center>
<img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are here today on Behind the Headlines.
Thank you, Gary Bauer, very much for being with us.

<p>

Gary, we are talking about whether there is a future for
character and values issues today with the current political climate,
and you have been a champion of values issues for the last 20
years, but some people think that character and values issues
today are waning.

<p>

Do you agree?

<p>

MR. BAUER: I don't know.  There is good news and bad news.
I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming that the overwhelming
majority of the American people are worried about values related
issues.  I mean, that shows up in just about every poll you have.
You have two thirds of the country saying that we are headed
in the wrong direction, and when you press them on it, it usually
ends up being value related or issues related to virtue.

<p>

The bad news, however, is that there seems to be a disconnect
between that public concern and the political process.  The most
disturbing poll I have seen of all has just come out in the last
couple days by, I believe, the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and it showed
that only 22 percent of the American people think that electing
someone of high moral character to the presidency is important.
Now I wonder whether that is an accurate poll or not.  If it
is accurate, that is a pretty disturbing sign in a country that
in the past grew up talking about George Washington cutting down
the cherry tree and Lincoln walking miles to return a library
book, and so forth, and it may be a sign of the fact that we have
really drifted a great deal in recent years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Gary, it would appear that some of the cynicism
could be created by the media.  If you look back at Watergate
and at that as being a time in our nation where we said all our
politicians are crooks and liars, and now people are really taking
a lot of the attitudes that politicians are lying anyway.  Do
you see that as you go across the country, that people are assuming:
well, they are all liars, so I want to get the best liar I can
get.

<p>

MR. BAUER: That may be exactly what is at the heart of that
polling result.  I do go around the country a lot, and there is
incredible cynicism among the public.  Many times people are just
throwing up their hands and saying I give up; I have tried election
after election to find somebody that will represent my values;
I am always disappointed; it doesn't make any difference; I'm
just going to do the best I can in my home town in my neighborhood
and forget all these guys that are making all the promises to
me.

<p>

I think there is a sense in the public, too, that all politicians
do have a problem with the truth, and so why hold them up to an
unnaturally high standard by insinuating that you are only going
to elect people of high moral character?  I tend to become cynical
about these things, too, but I actually believe that there is
a difference in many races in the candidates.  I think you can
find people in both parties that have high moral character, and
I would urge my fellow Americans to not give up looking, because
it is too important to do that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In past elections, personal character was a
powerful issue, and in fact, if you look at the Eisenhower race,
Eisenhower basically ran as I am the one who is the good guy,
who helped you all in World War II, so vote for me because of
who I am, not for what I stand for.  Character has really been
powerful, and yet today it seems that policy is all that counts.
We do not even look at character at all.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, yes, Eisenhower was the ultimate character
campaign, and I think Americans very distinctly and very intentionally
voted for somebody that they thought would bring a certain set
of character values into the Oval Office.  Today, I don't know,
there seems to be this disconnect.  In my view, for example --
I am not speaking about any particular politician; I'm just making
a general point -- if there is evidence that a politician can't
keep his promises to his own spouse, then the question that comes
to my mind is why in the world would I trust that politician to
keep their promises to me, somebody that the politician doesn't
even know?  He's made no legal or faith-based commitments to me
as a voter.  I think all those things about how a man or a woman
running for office, all the things in their personal life, do
end up sending us signals about what we can expect from them in
office.  There is a fine line about how much of this you actually
bring up in a campaign.  I don't think most Americans want their
personal lives debated, but on the other hand, I think we do want
to know the character of the individual that we are electing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You mentioned earlier, Gary, two stories that
really have marked the nation's psyche, stories about George Washington
saying I cannot tell a lie, or Abraham Lincoln and his tremendous
honesty and a character that we have all nationally admired, and
it seems that a lot of these stories have marked who we are as
a people, but are they still being taught to our children?  Are
they still having an impact on our national psyche?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, this may be one of the things right at
the heart of the problem.  When I was Undersecretary of Education
under Bill Bennett, one of the things we did was go back and look
at the textbooks in use in America's schools around the country,
and much to our shock, we found that those stories that you and
I grew up with and I would suspect most of our viewers grew up
with, are not in the textbooks anymore.  You can't find elementary
school textbooks that tell the George Washington story.  These
stories are now in some ways mocked and are considered to be a
part of legend, and the character-forming role that they played
with young people has been abandoned.  In fact, we went back and
looked for a couple of dozen things, things like the great sayings
from America's past -- I regret I have but one life to give for
my country, things like that.  Those all have been taken out of
American textbooks, and I think much to our detriment.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The character issue has played a very large
role with President Clinton in the various campaigns that have
been run against him, and it was interesting over Memorial Day
Weekend that some Medal of Honor winners took out full page advertising
chastising him for trying to hide behind his symbolic title of
commander in chief to get away from a sexual harassment suit,
and as one columnist said, he takes one character flaw, dodging
the draft, and highlights it in his attempts to dodge a second
character flaw, which would be alleged sexual proclivity.  Yet,
the character issue does not seem to stick to Bill Clinton.  A
lot of people are urging Bob Dole to make it an issue.  Do you
think that it is going to work?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, you know, this is the question that George
Bush asked himself during an entire campaign.  The character issue
was a major focus of the Bush/Clinton campaign, and as we all
know, it did not work.  Bill Clinton won.  I can understand why
the Dole campaign wants to try to use the character issue now,
and maybe they will have more success with it, but I am afraid
there is not a lot of evidence, at least as of now, that this
is going to be a cutting edge issue for people.  I think character
is important.  I think politicians ought to talk about it and
continue to bring it up, but I think the Dole campaign is going
to have to find more than that if they hope to take care of the
rather large lead that Bill Clinton has opened up as of now.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At one point in our nation's history, adultery
would in and of itself be a sufficient character issue to knock
you out.

<p>

MR. BAUER: No question about it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: But today what would do that?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I don't know. I mean, I am not sure there
is one single character issue that by itself would doom a candidate.
Certainly, people still get upset about financial matters, evidence
that a candidate has cheated on his income taxes or has played
fast and loose with the public's money.  Those things still seem
to strike a responsive chord.  But in matters of sexual mores
and in marriage and those kinds of issues, the country seems to
have gone pretty far down the road as being willing to ignore
those things in making judgments about who to elect to high public
office.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When it comes to candidate Dole, it is pretty
universally believed that he has phenomenal character, and obviously
he is scarred in the service for his country, and people do think
that he has character, but when it comes to the values issues,
people sometimes question whether he will really be a fighter
for them.  Do you think that his vice presidential candidate will
be a very key factor for him, because a lot of people are looking
to that appointment to send a statement about whether he will
be a fighter for values issues.

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, first of all, let me just say about Senator
Dole that he is a dying breed in America, I think.  That is my
father's generation, and they were unique in their commitment
to their country, the sacrifices they were willing to make.  People
will have political disagreements with Senator Dole, but I think
they have to concede that there was a time when men like Senator
Dole were in the majority, and now as time passes, there seem
to be fewer and fewer people that would fit the description that
one comes up with when you look at Senator Dole's career.

<p>

On the other hand, you raise an interesting point. Senator
Dole has a reputation of being a grand compromiser and of cutting
the differences between the two sides.  Right now, I think what
Americans are looking for is somebody who will stick to their
guns and will be predictable on the kind of values they are willing
to speak up for, and because of that, I think the vice presidential
choice really is important.  I think Senator Dole needs to pick
somebody who has the same values and the same philosophy as he
does.  Otherwise, he is going to send the signal that he really
does not care that deeply about these issues; why else would you
pick someone as your running mate that disagreed with you on major
things.  So this is going to be an important decision for Senator
Dole, and I hope that he will defy the inside the beltway wisdom
on this and pick another solid conservative to be his running
mate.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What values issues have a future in this election
in your estimation?

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, I think where the values issues really
reach critical mass is when they touch on young people and what
it is we are teaching our children.  I think that any time that
Senator Dole can bring up America's youth, can talk about the
concern that I think Americans feel about where our children are
headed, the statistical evidence that something has gone seriously
wrong with how we are raising young people in the country -- those
are issues that I think are very important in the public mind.
I think it is why Bill Clinton tries to picture himself as often
as he can with children, why he has talked about getting tougher
on discipline in the schools.  He knows these issues strike a
bell with the American people, and this could be an issue that
would end up being very important before the election is over.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you once again for being with us
on <i>Straight Talk</i>'s Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. BAUER: My pleasure, Kristi.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Following this commercial break, <i>Straight
Talk</i> begins our discussion about America's drug problem and
the validity of needle exchange programs as a solution.  Please
stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape following.]

<p>

MAN: I think there definitely is a drug problem in the United
States, basically because of the irresponsibility.  People want
to use them and want to use them how they want to do it, and it
basically just gets really out of control.

<p>

MAN: Drugs are just ruining our country.  I mean, the economic
structures behind drugs that I know of is astronomical.

<p>

WOMAN: See, I think there are a lot of problems with drugs
now that they are illegal.  I think a lot of people would take
it to an extreme if they were available.  I mean, people take
alcohol to an extreme right now, and I just think it would cause
more problems.  It is much more dangerous.

<p>

MAN: I just think legalizing drugs is going to maybe take
away the demand for it, but the violence is going to be there,
and it is just going to turn our society -- it is going to keep
going downhill.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: America's war on drugs has entered a new battleground,
with some using a deadly virus as their sword, and they are winning
some ground.  Needle exchange programs are cropping up in cities
across the nation.  Currently 75 needle exchange programs reside
in 55 U.S. cities, and these programs claim to save lives.  According
to a 1995 government-commissioned study, providing clean needles
to intravenous drug users slows the spread of the HIV virus. 
Yet, many experts, government officials, and addicts themselves
question these findings, and many of those questions arise from
the examples of other countries such as Switzerland, where needle
exchange programs were implemented, along with easy access to
clean intravenous drug paraphernalia through vending machines.

<p>

In Zurich, drug users were provided a safe haven in which
to obtain needles, known as needle park, which soon became a drug
orgy of sorts for addicts, providing 12,000 needles per day before
the park closed in 1992, because of the social decay it was causing
in the community.

<p>

The addicts then sought refuge in an abandoned railway station,
where 15,000 clean needles were exchanged daily.  In that environment,
attitudes toward drug use grew lax, making it easier for drugs
to become mainstream via legalization.

<p>

Yet problems with the drug culture did not go away.  Switzerland's
30,000 heroin addicts are the highest per capita rate in Europe,
and the Swiss have the second highest HIV infection rate.

<p>

It seems America has not learned from nations' experiments.
Will we pursue policies that make drug use easy, or will we build
successful rehabilitation programs?  Do drug overdoses with clean
needles justify so far failed attempts at reducing the spread
of the HIV virus?  Will federally funded needle exchange programs
pave the way for drug legalization?  These questions must be answered
before the drug war claims more lives, some of them even today.

<p>

MAN: We are losing the battle, and until the government
switches its playing ground and switches what it is really targeting,
we are going to continue to lose and eventually lose our children,
which is going to be the biggest loss.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: No one can ignore America's battle for lives,
and tonight I am joined by some real warriors:  Shepherd Smith,
the president and founder of Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy,
who researches effective AIDS treatment and compassionate care
for those infected with the virus; also here is Lieutenant Colonel
Robert Maginnis who serves as the Family Research Council's policy
expert on America's drug problems; and we are joined by Dr. Sally
Satel, who is a psychiatrist at the District of Columbia's Pretrial
Drug Treatment Program.  Welcome to all of you.

<p>

It is certainly a dark setup piece, but I think the question
that a lot of people are asking is is there a growing drug problem
in America, because you are seeing some nightly news reports to
indicate that it is not really the issue that we all thought.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, since 1979 we have cut the number
of people in this country that are routinely abusing drugs in
half, but now since 1990 and 1991, the number of especially marijuana
users is up, and we are not really sure if that is going to lead
to an increase in heroin.  The heroin numbers are up, too, but
we are still waiting to find out if that is going to be a long-term
effect.  So we really need to come back and reexamine the things
we did well in the early 1980s to begin to turn this around. 
Clearly there is a problem, and it is an ongoing problem.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Shepherd, you have been working with this for
a while.  You know, in terms of evaluating what was successful,
what do you think was successful?

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, one reason numbers are down, HIV has claimed
a lot of lives of IV drug users.  The area of concern is young
people is where we are seeing the greatest growth today in new
drug use.  Programs that are successful are ones that show individuals
who are addicted to drugs that someone cares about them, that
there is an opportunity for them in the future if they make corrections
in their life today.  Programs that simply support the behavior
and affirm that behavior really have not shown to be effective
that we have seen.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You are working with pretrial drug treatment,
Dr. Satel.  What are you finding about drug use?  Is it going
down, and if not, why not?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, we have a waiting list that is as long
as you can imagine.  I happen to work with patients who are in
the inner city, so I believe in that group there probably has
not been much of a decline ever in the last decade or so.  The
people I work with are those who come from backgrounds where parents
were addicted.  Often they do not know their father, and their
mother was involved with drugs.  When you have patients who will
tell you, no, I don't do cocaine -- a lot of those people do marijuana,
PCP, and some heroin, but when their reason for not doing cocaine
is because they saw what it did to their mother, you know you
are dealing with a very, very compromised group of people here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Do you think that it is the loss of life that
has resulted in slightly lower numbers, or do you think that it
is the loss of maybe yuppie users, because you are saying the
inner city is staying the same.

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, I am saying in my population, yes, it has
stayed the same.  So I do not see any particular influence in
terms of drug use as a whole.  I do think that the crack epidemic
may actually be waning a bit in the inner city; again, you could
say there is almost a self-limiting effect, when one generation
sees how the previous generation has been devastated.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, but as the crack epidemic wanes,
we are finding a growth in the methamphetamine epidemic that is
moving from the West Coast here.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And for people who do not know what that is, Bob?

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: That is speed, basically.  You know,
it is manufactured here in the United States, so you don't really
have to ship it in like you do from Columbia cocaine. So there
is a very serious problem.

<p>

But going back, the mixture that we saw on the setup where
you have AIDS, an emotionally charged virus that is impacting
throughout the country, and we mix that with heroin or needle
users, you know, just a complex issue but a very frightening issue,
and we saw the situation in Switzerland, and there they were giving
out needles.  They were giving 15,000 needles a day in Latin Park[?]
there in Zurich before they shut the place down.  It was a madhouse.
I mean, there were murders.  The police would come in.  They
would turn over the cars.  There were all sorts of problems. 
Well, in this country today there is a movement to try to place
needle exchange programs in virtually every city where there is
a problem with AIDS and needle exchange.  After all, where do
most of these programs take place?  They take place in the inner
city that Sally is talking about.  They take place where you have
a high incidence of HIV.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Sure. But why not?  Why not needle exchange?
I mean, what the needle exchange people are arguing is that if
I am exchanging dirty needles with people who already do drugs
-- I am not encouraging drug use, but what I am doing is at least
cutting down the risk of AIDS.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, that is what they are going to
tell you, but the evidence -- you know, we have gone through the
studies.  In the National Academy of Science, they acknowledge
-- a couple of physicians; there are only two, two of the three
MDs on the study -- they say, look, it is not the panacea that
it is being made out to be.  There are problems.  The best solution
for this problem is to provide treatment for people who are on
drugs.  If we get them off drugs, they are not going to come down
with HIV because they have been using dirty needles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So at the very least, needle exchange is not
an anti-drug program.  I mean, at the very least, it is not trying
to stop drug use.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Not at all, and in fact, you can give a clean
needle to an addict, and it really does not stop the transmission
of HIV if they go out and share that with another infected individual.
The message has to be don't share your works, and you do not
need to give out any equipment to give that message.  But where
the programs probably have an effect is establishing a relationship
with people who use drugs, and they feel that someone cares about
them, and they are more inclined to listen to what they say about
not having sex with somebody who is infected, not sharing needles,
and in that context they have a value, but it is really independent
of the fact that they give out clean needles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Shepherd, you have been working with AIDS and
HIV for years.  You are well-known for this issue.  Do you see
any reason to read needle exchange programs as successful in terms
of decreasing actual AIDS/HIV, and following up your comment about
death?

<p>

MR. SMITH: We really have not seen evidence that is substantive
in respect to the value of needle exchange programs and reducing
HIV infection rates.  What we are concerned about is there is
a basic logic or illogic, if you will, in the AIDS community that
says affirm people where they are, meaning don't say anything
negative about their behavior, if they are having multiple sexual
partners or if they are using drugs or they are into all sorts
of different sexual activities.  You know, affirm them where they
are.  So what needle exchange does is it does not warn the individual
that the behaviors they are participating in are very harmful
to them, and we think that honesty is a good policy, that you
ought to, you know, lay the cards on the table and say this is
your life, you can have a good future, but what you are doing
is destructive and you need to eliminate that activity if you
really want to have a fulfilling life.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is not just the needles.

<p>

MR. SMITH: That's right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to talk about this more. <i>Straight
Talk</i> brings you more after this commercial break.  Don't go
away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from the Family
Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing two of America's
tragedies:  drug addiction and AIDS.  Here to explain whether
needle exchange programs can positively affect these problems
is Shepherd Smith, president of Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV
Policy; Lieutenant Colonel Robert Maginnis, a senior policy analyst
at the Family Research Council; and Dr. Sally Satel, a psychiatrist
who works for effective treatment with drug addicts.  Welcome
back.

<p>

We were discussing needle exchange programs before, and there
are a lot of things that people are attempting to get better behavior.
Like there is crime attached to drugs, and there is AIDS attached
to drugs, and yet some people argue that we are moving toward
legalization by some of these programs.  Do you see needle exchange
programs as being positive in terms of legalizing drugs?

<p>

MR. SMITH: They certainly contribute to the idea that drug
use is okay.  I mean, if the government is going to sponsor programs
to help addicts participate in this destructive behavior, then
it can't be all that bad.  Unfortunately for young people, we
haven't heard from this administration, we haven't heard from
any leaders, that these behaviors are harmful, and we are seeing
just dramatic increases, not just in marijuana use but smoking,
as well, tobacco.  They all interrelate.  Fortunately, in respect
to sexual activity among young people, we have seen maybe a peak.
It can't get much higher, but maybe we are going to turn the
corner soon.  But clearly the message of needle exchange is detrimental
to young people and their attitudes about drug usage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you see, Doctor, in your program?
People come in and they are obviously addicts.  Are you attempting
in terms of treatment to say drug use has got to stop, or are
we talking about facilitating them and making them better drug
users, like better alcohol users or better smokers?

<p>

DR. SATEL: No, we are saying drug use has got to stop.
Now remember, the population that I am working with are people
who have committed crimes.  So they are in a drug court, and actually
they have been given a choice by the judge.  You go to jail or
you go to treatment.  Believe it or not, some of them actually
choose jail, but of those who come to treatment, no, they get
urine tested twice, three times a week.  We are very strict about
an abstinence policy, and actually we are seeking in these people
for more than just stopping drug use.  We really want to resocialize
them.  We want to make them into citizens again.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In terms of some of the other gateway programs
related to AIDS and drugs, some people -- needle exchange and
also giving people drugs so that they won't commit crimes, so
here are free drugs three times a day; we are seeing that in Sweden.
Do you see any reason to believe from your population that giving
needles or giving free drugs will have any positive social effects?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Kristi, we give drugs in a sense.  We give methadone.
That is a substitute for heroin, and while I think those programs
can do a lot of good, they do reduce the commission of crime by
people who are in methadone programs, there is less AIDS transmission
of people who are in methadone programs, but about 60 percent
of people in methadone programs in New York City use cocaine,
and I actually think -- I would like to know your impression of
this, but a methadone program that I once worked at in Connecticut,
I thought that they had a fairly high threshold for dismissing
people from the program when they broke the rules, the rules being
that they used other drugs or they committed crime, and I think
the reason that the threshold was higher was because they wanted
to protect them from transmitting HIV and from contracting it.
So I think it has actually changed the profile of methadone programs,
HIV.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As in encouraging methadone use or crack cocaine
use or cocaine use?

<p>

DR. SATEL: I think it has changed the standards of acceptable
behavior in methadone programs where a patient might be dismissed,
might be said, listen, you have to leave our program if you are
going to commit crimes or use other drugs, but I think now there
may be less momentum to do that because the programs are concerned
about having people on the street now using dirty needles.  At
least before they were using the methadone and there was some
degree of safety and supervision.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It seems like, Bob, we are substituting one
pathology for another in many ways.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, I certainly agree with that assessment.
You started off by asking about what is happening in our culture
in regard to maybe legalization.  The analogous situation that
we saw in Switzerland, this year they have an election to decide
whether or not to legalize drugs.  Now they did not start off
with that.  They started off incrementally with needle exchange
programs, with heroin programs.  They give some methadone, but
they have heroin programs, with people in jail, they give them
heroin, with people in the streets that they come in every day
and up to nine times a day they get their free heroin shots. 
And those types of programs have really facilitated a change of
attitude in the culture about drugs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In what way, Bob?  Explain that.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, they look at the problem, they
say it is out of our control, we might as well facilitate this.
You know, now they want to put drug addicts, heroin addicts,
repairing cars.  One company bragged a couple months ago that
this is the way we ought to go.  There were 94 executives of the
largest Swiss companies that came out in a public statement and
said, look, we give up on this.  We want drugs legalized.  We
think the government ought to be involved in facilitating this.
We want to reintegrate drug addicts back into the culture.  Then
companies stood up and said this is what we need to do.  So our
concern with needle exchange programs, which have yet to demonstrate
that they truly reduce HIV contraction and at the same time do
not increase drug abuse, is that if we open up the floodgates
that we will never be able to put the genie back in the bottle.
It is a scary situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: One thing that I have noticed is that often
the people talking about legalizing drugs ironically and even
sadly have drug problems in their own families.  I mean, Surgeon
General Joycelyn Elders is a good and sad example of that, her
own son being convicted of drug use.  Are you seeing that that
is one of the realities of the legalization discussion, that it
is people saying, look, so much is out of control, forget it.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, when you find one pathology, you
are liable to find another.  You know, where there are drug problems,
there are also crime problems, there are also out-of-wedlock birth
problems.  You know, all sorts of problems kind of rotate around
the same types of issues.  I don't know.  It is one of the most
gripping problems we are faced with.  I was with Senator Thompson
just a week ago, and we were trying to figure out -- you know,
the senator from Tennessee -- we were trying to figure out what
to do about the juvenile problem in this country, and we are about
to explode with violence that we have never seen before.  It is
tied into the drug issue.  It is tied into a lot of the things
that are going on in the culture.  Frankly, we are not sure, but
what we do know, based so far on these studies, is that this is
not the panacea that it has been made out to be.  We do not need
to expand the horizons of needle exchange programs and follow
a course where the Swiss have already tread.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about one minute left.  Dr. Satel,
could you address that really quickly?  Are we seeing that tracking
with family histories, that drug use is a family problem that
goes generation to generation?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Again, the patients that I am seeing, very much
so.  In fact, sadly in many cases the whole family is involved
with drugs at some time, but I should also add that sometimes
having a history of substance abuse in one's family accounts for
some very passionate advocacy, as well.  So I think it cuts both
ways, often to our advantage.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That is really powerful, especially in some
of the new public service announcements out.  There are some very
vocal advocates.

<p>

We are going to talk more about this when <i>Straight Talk</i>
returns.  We will hear more about America's drug problem and the
possible solutions.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are back with more <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking to experts in
the fields of drugs and HIV/AIDS policies.  Here tonight are Shepherd
Smith, Lieutenant Colonel Robert Maginnis, and Dr. Sally Satel.
Welcome back.

<p>

Shepherd, you were talking earlier that these experts that
have been giving us sometimes bad drug policy advice or AIDS advice,
they have a lot of factors working in their own lives.  Maybe
you could explain that a little.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, the curious thing that I have found going
to international AIDS conferences and national HIV conferences
and so on is that the experts really do not want to address fundamental
problems, because they participate in a lot of the behaviors that
put people at risk in the first place.  For example, the biggest
predictor of a sexually-transmitted disease -- and HIV is an STD
-- is numbers of partners.  Yet, you cannot say at an AIDS meeting
that promiscuity is a bad thing, that having lots of partners
is a harmful behavior.  You would be ridiculed.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Why?  I mean, that seems obvious.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Because all of the experts have participated
in that behavior.  The same thing with the use of drugs.  Many
of these people are the product of the drug and sex revolutions
of the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s.  They experimented with drugs.
They did not become addicted themselves.  So they really don't
see any negative side to the use of drugs, particularly recreational
use.

<p>

Consequently, we often go back to affirming people where
they are.  It is okay to participate in that behavior as long
as you do it safely.  So that is why clean needles, condoms, and
dental dams are the answers that these folks have to this epidemic.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Rather than giving our youth a clear message
about sex, about drugs, and maybe even about alcohol.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Sure, absolutely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Let me ask you then, following up on that,
Dr. Satel, we are saying that some people have used drugs and
haven't had a bad experience, and so they are not appreciating
that others can't deal with it.  I mean, are you finding that,
that drugs and alcohol are more parallel than we thought?

<p>

DR. SATEL: I think there is an enormous arrogance, actually,
among people who have managed to use these drugs and luckily for
them, in a sense, haven't succumbed.  They are highly dangerous,
as you know, and I see firsthand people who have just abdicated
their life to this.  I mean, when you have a mother who abandons
their child in a car because of crack cocaine, I mean, a maternal
instinct is a pretty hard thing to break, but somehow a drug can
saw its way through that.  I mean, this is not recreational use,
and it is certainly not a romanticized addiction to heroin.  This
is devastating.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And yet people aren't willing to treat it in
a devastating way.

<p>

Why do you think, Bob?  I mean, why have we got this disconnect
between playful drugs and the fact that people will sell their
own children, as we saw recently in the news, a woman who sold
her children to a drug dealer to pay off a debt?

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Well, there are tragic situations all
over.  The general perception is that the risk associated with
marijuana or alcohol or any of the other drugs is not that bad,
and if you track the national surveys of mostly teenagers, you
find that the risk assessment just keeps going down.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Their attitudes toward the risk.

<p>

LT. COL. MAGINNIS: Yes, their attitude about the risk associated
with consuming these things.  Why?  Because our leaders in our
country have not been beating the drums that this is bad for you,
and the parents have in many cases come out of the 1960s where
they have been abusers themselves, and they have a guilty conscience
about it, and they just are not going to stand up there and tell
that young man or young woman that this is going to kill you,
it is going to ruin your life, and this is my experience.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The Clinton Administration has come under criticism
for weakening the message on drugs, for firing a lot of people
in the Office of Drug Policy, and Just Say No might have been
simple -- it wasn't the only part of the program, but it certainly
was a clear signal.

<p>

Shepherd, do you see some of these changes?

<p>

MR. SMITH: Absolutely. The Clinton Administration deserves
all the criticism on this issue it can get.  It devastated the
National AIDS Policy Office.  It has not spoken out to say that
these behaviors are harmful.  You know, it is so politically correct.
One of the words you cannot use in PC is normal, because that
implies that there is abnormal behavior, and so we can't say anything
negative then about behaviors that are harmful, and with our hands
tied under political correctness, we have not been able to talk
about values in respect to how children, young people, should
live.  We haven't been able to articulate relationships, what
I am obligated to you in a community to do and what obligations
you have to me, to help each other, to pick each other up, to
point out failures and to then correct our ways.  We can't do
any of those things.  So we are letting young people make decisions
that adults have difficulty making.  I mean, it is a horrible
situation, and this administration bears a great deal of the 
responsibility of where we are today.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: This administration, Dr. Satel, has focused
a lot on things like considering needle exchange and considering
any garden variety of segue program, rather than strictly dealing
with how do we get out.  You are an expert in that.  What programs
work in terms of getting people out?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, speaking of the administration for a second,
I would like to note that they also cut the budget for treatment
programs.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: So they cut the policy arm and the treatment
arm both.

<p>

DR. SATEL: Yes, they did.  Meanwhile, we may be regulating
tobacco, which gives a very bizarre message.  That is a potent
irony.  But there are programs that do work, programs that frankly
I think could work better.  For example, actually, the program
that I am involved in, which is tied in with the court system,
I think is very powerful, because it has real sanctions and a
real accountability for the individuals that are going through
it.  As I mentioned, we get urine tests, and then there are other
kinds of consequences if patients do not comply.  But there are
other kinds of treatment, and they depend on the severity of use.
I do wish we had more residential treatment programs.  There
are only about 15,000 beds in the country, and according to ONDCP,
we have something like 2 million hard-core addicts.  Now admittedly
I don't think every one of them needs a bed in a residential treatment
program, but I would say a good proportion of them do, and those
programs are long-term.  They are 18 to 24 months.  Phoenix House
is an excellent model.  It really rebuilds people.  It does not
see addiction so much as a disease but as a symptom of a disordered
life that needs --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Let's just have you comment on that quickly,
the idea that addictions are diseases versus maybe disorder or
lack of self-control or whatever.  Has that affected this problem?

<p>

DR. SATEL: Well, I think there is a lot of rhetoric about
addiction being a brain disease in fact, and while I concur wholeheartedly
that of course a drug is a toxic substance and it works on the
substrate of one's brain, so of course there are neurobiological
components to addiction, especially of course tolerance, where
you need more drug to get the same effect, and withdrawal.  Those
are clearly mediated through the central nervous system, but why
people start to use drugs in the first place and why they relapse
after months, sometimes years in fact, of being clean, that is
not something that is neurobiologically motivated.  That is a
much more complicated psychological process, and I think we underestimate
that by calling this a brain disease.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You get the last word, Shepherd.

<p>

MR. SMITH: Well, personal responsibility has to come back
into the vocabulary, and good programs need a spiritual element
to them to really show people that there is hope, that there is
a greater being that can help them through this, and that they
do have a future.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I would like to thank you all for being with
us.  As always, Bob has been a kingpin in bringing a great team
together.

ANNOUNCER: If you are weeding through the record store this
weekend, you might want to check out Hempilation[?].  It is a
new tribute album of sorts to the joys of pot smoking.  Some talented
musicians participated in the project.  Ron Tagg[?] reports their
work has ignited quite a controversy.

<p>

ANNOUNCER: At a New York party, Capricorn Records launches
the controversial new album, Hempilation, a CD that celebrates
the use of marijuana.  Groups such as the Black Crows, Blues Traveler,
and Cypress Hill sing the praises of pot on this new compilation
album.  Royalties from the sale of the CD will benefit NORMAL,
the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws.  The
group wants to decriminalize marijuana for medical, recreational,
and industrial purposes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us here 
at <i>Straight Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you 
would like to receive more information about the Family 
Research Council, tonight's guests, or the topics discussed, 
please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week we will highlight how a variety of 
people are fighting for America's children and their rights, 
and we'll meet individuals who are in this fight and speak 
up for those who don't have voices, when we bring you more

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i>, we will take you to the Stand for
Children rally, which took place just last week.

<p>

The rally's name exemplifies what we all hold 
dear, America's children, but although those sponsoring the 
event claimed to encompass all viewpoints, all groups, and 
all individuals, we found out differently.  So we are going 
to show you another event involving pro-family and pro-
children groups who were deliberately excluded from the 
Stand for Children events, because the important issue is 
not just that we stand for children but what we stand for 
and who is standing, government or parents.

<p>

But first, let's hear from the Family Research 
Council's Director of Cultural Studies, Robert Knight.  Bob 
discusses another controversy which the media for the most 
part has ignored, the Whitewater land and loan scandal 
involving President and Mrs. Clinton.  Yet recent events and 
convictions can no longer keep the scandal out of the news. 
Let's hear Bob's unique insight as a former newsie on what 
happens to scandal Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  As a journalist with 
such prestigious publications such as the <i>L.A. Times</i>, you 
have seen a lot of things happen when it comes to
politicians and scandal.

<p>

I think in terms of Whitewater, which is the 
current business scandal affecting a Presidency to date, we 
haven't seen anything quite like it since Nixon and his Vice 
President, Spiro Agnew.  And yet we are talking about 
misdealings allegedly related to money, and the coverage on 
Whitewater has been a bit slim.  How has the coverage on 
Whitewater reflected the potential for scandal that is 
there?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, for years following revelations 
of various things Clinton had been accused of during the 
primaries when he was running for President, the press gave 
a cursory examination of the charges and then pretended that 
they had covered it, and so that was old news and they 
didn't have to look at it anymore.  And meanwhile, 
Whitewater was unfolding; witnesses were coming forward.

<p>

Certainly Troopergate, which is kind of connected 
to Whitewater, with the state troopers giving affidavits 
about all sorts of odd behavior on the part of the governor, 
was ignored.  You could find out about these things only by 
reading the <i>London Sunday Telegraph</i>; the <i>American 
Spectator</i>, the conservative magazine; and the <i>Washington 
Times</i>.

<p>

Everybody else was ignoring it, and the <i>Washington
Post</i> even ordered one reporter off the story.  He had
composed a story relating the troopers' accounts, and his
story was spiked, and he came forward and said that.  It was
a rare breach in journalistic etiquette, and he had to leave
the <i>Post</i> eventually.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There have been a lot of alleged 
misdealings by Republicans when they are in office.  We see 
Ronald Reagan and Iran Contra, where he is completely 
cleared, and in the news conference in which he is cleared, 
the prosecutor says, "I found no evidence, but I believe it, 
anyway."  You see people like Ed Meese, who was cleared.  
You see a lot of figures that were under scandal, and yet 
investigators found nothing.

<p>

And then you look at what we are seeing today in 
Whitewater.  How do you compare the treatment that Democrats 
and Republicans have received when it comes to scandal?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Like night and day.  If it's a 
Republican scandal, it's front page; if it's a Democratic 
scandal, it may not even make the pages.  You're talking 
about a failed S&L that has cost the taxpayers $50 million. 
You're talking about convictions of the governor of 
Arkansas and, at the time, Governor Clinton's two closest 
business associates.  You are talking about Hillary Clinton 
as the attorney of record for the Madison Guaranty Trust 
through Rose Law Firm.  You are talking about destruction of 
records, billing records, the mysterious reappearance of 
other billing records.  These people, if they had been 
Republicans, frankly, would have been run out of office by 
now.  I have no doubt.  There is so much that is wrong here. 
And yet the media either bury the stories, wave them away 
as meaningless and not interesting to the public because 
they are so complex, and basically have played down 
Whitewater.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  This is the way the media has really 
contrasted the Whitewater debate.  On the one hand, they 
will say Democrats are claiming it's a Republican witch hunt 
into an insignificant business dealing.  On the Republican 
side, Republicans have said it is important to look into 
Whitewater because it involves allegedly using almost 
worthless land as collateral to get loan money from 
struggling savings and loans, that loan money going either 
to Clinton's campaign or Clinton's friends -- at his 
request, allegedly -- and then all these loans are defaulted 
on and repaid by the taxpayers.

<p>

Now, that is just -- you know, it is interesting 
that these two sides are contrasted as being equally 
interesting when the media pitches it.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  That is right, and the tip of the 
iceberg in Whitewater is bigger during the iceberg during 
the Reagan years, just the tip, because they are ignoring 
things like the President's connection with Dan Lassiter, a 
convicted cocaine smuggler and a guy who peddled influence 
within the Clinton Administration and worked the state 
government, the Arkansas development authorities.  That kind 
of stuff cries out for examination.  But the press is 
(yawning), "It's just not interesting enough for us."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think it is interesting to 
contrast what is happening today with Whitewater with what 
happened in 1994 in the Texas race for governor, where the 
son of the former President, George W. Bush, is accused in 
this campaign of being involved with a savings and loan, 
merely on the board, not allegations of wrongdoing but just 
that he had been there.

<p>

You contrast that today with what is happening in
Whitewater and actual allegations of taxpayers being bilked.
Why do you think that contrast is there?  How do you explain
that?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: I can only conclude from years in
journalism that it is because Bush is a Republican and
Whitewater involves Democrats.  It's that simple.

<p>

I watched it at the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> when I was a 
news editor.  I was amazed at how the two parties would be 
handled in routine news stories.  Here's how it works:  You 
might have a balance in a story, because they might mention 
and quote Democrats and Republicans in terms of equal amount 
of ink.  The Democrats would make heartfelt pleas that would 
pull your heartstrings about some welfare program or 
something, and the Republicans would be quoted as to 
strategy, not about why they opposed it, because they might 
have thought it hurt people, just that, "Well, we're going 
to make this an issue in the election."  It was all 
tactical; it was bloodless.  Wouldn't move anyone.

<p>

So you would think you would have the white hats 
here and the black hats over here, and they would say, 
"Well, the story is balanced.  We quoted both sides."  I saw 
this all the time, and it is because the media 
overwhelmingly are composed of liberal Democrats.  It is 
almost uniformly.  I have worked on both coasts.  I have 
worked at the <i>Miami Herald</i>, <i>Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel</i>,
the <i>Annapolis Evening Capital</i>, the <i>L.A. Times</i>. It's the 
same everywhere.  It is a liberal journalistic elite, and it
is not a conspiracy; they just hire their own.  They hire
people who think like they do, and they tend to muster out
people who don't.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kenneth Starr, the independent 
prosecutor for Whitewater, had come under a lot of 
controversy and scandal himself.  He was accused of being 
the tool of a Republican witch hunt.  He was accused of 
being incompetent.  And yet he has earned three Whitewater 
convictions, two of Bill Clinton's former best friends and 
the former governor of Arkansas, who was appointed as Bill 
Clinton left for Washington.  Frankly, how is that going to 
change anything?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Oh, that should change a lot, because 
at first the press were praising Starr because they thought 
he was ineffective, frankly.  They thought, Oh, good, he's a 
nonpartisan type of guy and he is not going to delve too 
deeply.

<p>

And then as he became more serious about the case, 
they began attacking him as a political instrument of the 
Republican Party.  But his conviction in Arkansas with a 
jury of ordinary men and women in the midst of a very 
corrupt system is a stunning blow to the Clinton 
Administration, and it is a stunning blow to the people who 
say that it is merely a politically driven issue.  I mean, 
something has got to be there, and he has proved there is 
something there.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Now that we have three convictions 
in Whitewater, three people very close to the President, we 
are preparing for two more cases coming up in the next 
couple of weeks.  There is a lot of speculation in the media 
that someone will cut a deal.  As a journalist, do you think 
that is possible?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Yes, I do; in fact, David Hale would
be the guy who could actually bring down the President. He
said that he was pressured into giving a $300,000 loan to
the Clinton campaign, and he pressured the McDougals into
doing it.  They have denied it, the President has denied it.
But if he is given immunity and testifies and he is 
believed, that could be big trouble for the President.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: After the convictions of two of Bill 
Clinton's closest former friends and then Governor Jim Guy 
Tucker, now formerly governor of Arkansas, Bill Clinton came 
out and said, "Look, it's not that the jury disbelieved what 
I had to say; they thought I was okay, and they released 
seven pages of statements from the jury where the jury was 
saying things like, 'Well, yeah, I believe the President.'" 
But how do you interpret that kind of action?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, none of them wanted to accuse 
the President of the United States of being a liar.  But by 
their action, they basically said we don't believe him, even 
though some of them said, "Well, we found him quite 
believable," and then they did the opposite of what the 
President said.  So I think actions do speak louder than 
words.  That was an incredible repudiation of a sitting 
President and his sense of honor and his word.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you think that the Whitewater 
story has legs, that it can carry itself through the 
election cycle?  Because now, interestingly enough, a lot of 
the journalistic pundits over the weekend were saying, "Oh, 
sure, there's another court case coming up, but after that 
it's definitely a dead story."  You know, how dead is it?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  You know, it is kind of fun, because 
the Media Research Center releases statements by journalists 
when they are in unguarded moments, and they reveal the 
agenda, and a lot of them have said for weeks, months, "Oh, 
this is a dead story.  Nobody is interested in it.  Nothing 
is really going to happen."

<p>

They were stunned by the verdict.  But some of 
them are still saying, "Well, so what?"  The big so what.  
Well, so what, indeed?  The President's closest associates 
convicted, plus an Arkansas governor.  This is huge, and it 
has got to have legs now, and in fact, if the journalists 
aren't going to embarrass themselves further, they'll take 
it up full force.

<p>

I still don't expect them to do so, though, 
because I think the partisan politics of the press is so 
rigidly liberal Democrat that they still won't give it the 
coverage it deserves.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Over the weekend I watched a lot of 
the news analysis shows, and once again the reporters 
continue to assert that Whitewater is probably going to be a 
dead story even though we have three convictions and two 
trials coming up.

<p>

One of the scandals that they thought would have 
more impact was Travelgate, the firing of White House 
employees then being accused of misconduct in the course of 
their job, then being acquitted of misconduct, even though 
the FBI was brought in, and frankly, the lesser reported 
fact that these employees worked with the journalists' 
travel plans, so a lot of journalists knew them and knew 
their character.

<p>

Scandals like Travelgate, the firing of a lot of 
attorneys across the country, all kinds of issues like that 
might have potential in this election.  What scandals do you 
think will have legs?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT:  Well, Travelgate is a scandal with 
legs, because it is ordinary people doing their jobs and 
then being accused of horrible things unjustly.  The FBI 
being used improperly by the White House to falsely portray 
these people as crooked, I mean, that is outrageous.  That 
is a breach of not only ethics; that is criminal behavior.

<p>

I think if that story is really played to what it 
deserves, that alone could bring down a President.  I am not 
sure it will, though.  Again, it hasn't been played very 
heavily.  Most people don't understand what occurred.  And, 
also, Hillary is at the core of that one.  It is not so much 
Bill Clinton as Hillary, because an aide of Hillary's has 
said that he felt pressure to do the firings from above.  He 
didn't name Mrs. Clinton, but it was clear where that was 
coming from.

<p>

So she is up to her neck in that.  She is up to 
her neck in the Madison Savings and Loan failure.  And never 
forget the cattle futures in which she made $100,000 in a 
week, unlike anybody else who invests like that.  I mean, 
there was clearly skullduggery going on and the insider 
trading.  That sort of has been forgotten, too, by the 
press.

<p>

I think we are getting to the point where there is 
so much there that people want to turn away and say, "It 
can't be true.  This is just so crooked, it's so extreme, 
that these people can't be guilty of all the things they've 
been accused of."  It's almost an overload, sensory 
overload, of scandal.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, as you evaluate Whitewater and 
Travelgate and some of the scandals and all the media that 
has surrounded it, what do you think the big picture is for 
our <i>Straight Talk</i> viewers?

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Well, I think there is a political 
danger that the Republicans will say, "You know what?  We 
don't have to address the core issues that our constituents 
care about:  the family tax break, the $500 tax credit, 
reestablishing the moral fabric of this country, maybe 
judicial reform, certainly all the economic reforms that are 
needed, cutting down big government, because we've got 
Whitewater."  You know, there is a complacency that may well 
set in, and I think if the Republicans fall for that, and 
the press acts characteristically to keep burying 
Whitewater, they could be very surprised in November and 
find out that the American people still weren't fully aware 
of it and just didn't care.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bob, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  We really 
appreciated your journalistic insight.

<p>

MR. KNIGHT: Thanks for having me.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> takes you to the June 1 Stand for Children and 
to a special stand for parents by leading pro-family groups.
Please stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segments from Children's Defense Fund's Stand for Children rally 
follow.]

<p>

CHILD: This is the day the Lord has made.  Let us 
rejoice and be glad in it.

<p>

[Song: This Little Light of Mine.]

<p>

ROSIE O'DONNELL: Fifty religious leaders, each 
with a child from his or her congregation, share the stage 
with me today.  They are here to stand for children.  It is 
time for us to make children and their rights our first 
priority.

<p>

EDWARD JAMES OLMAS:  As individuals, they, like 
all of us, have been touched by violence or by the crisis in 
health care, or by how difficult it is to obtain quality, 
affordable child care, or by the decline of our public 
school system.

<p>

IMAN: We stand for a government and a society 
that support families and their needs, not just with words 
but with actions.

<p>

MS. EDELMAN:  This is a day about unity and 
community and not about controversy.  This is a day about 
rekindling our children's hope and renewing our faith in 
each other and in our great nation's future.  It is about 
America's ideals and not about any group's ideology.  We do 
not stand here advocating big government; we stand here 
advocating just government --

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

-- government that does not give more to those who 
have and less to those who have not.  We advocate cost-
effective government that invests more to prevent than to 
punish our children's problems.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We believe that jobs and not jail should be the 
rite of passage to adulthood, and we question the family 
values of anybody that is willing to spend $20,000 to lock 
our children up but is unwilling to spend $3,500 to give 
them a head start.  We can do better.

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

We do not believe that government is <i>the</i> answer to
the breakdown of family, community, and moral values all 
over America, any more than we believe that hungry and 
homeless children are responsible for all of America's ills, 
as some of our leaders seem to think.  They say that we are 
too poor to invest another penny a day, each of us, to see 
that every one of our mothers has prenatal care and that we 
are too poor to invest, each of us, another nickel a day to 
give every one of our children health care, 10 million 
uninsured children; but that we are not too poor to give new 
tax breaks to the non-needy and to give the Pentagon weapons 
systems it did not even request.  We can do better than 
that.

<p>

[SONG LYRICS]:

<blockquote>

We are pieces of the puzzles.<br>
We are soldiers in the fight.<br>
Kids saving kids for our future.<br>
Come follow me into the light.<br>

[End of Stand for Children segment.]

<p>

[Segments from Family Research Council Stand for
Children press conference follow:]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What we are doing is adding and even 
clarifying some of what it means to stand for children.  In 
the Children's Defense Fund's comments about this particular 
rally, it has been a bit slanted.  There has been a great 
big government viewpoint; there has been a viewpoint that 
would say, frankly, standing for children means standing 
with government and standing with government programs.

<p>

But I am standing today with some of the leading 
pro-family organizations in the nation, groups that work 
every day on family issues and actually were not invited to 
Stand for Children.  As a matter of fact, Family Research 
Council, when we read in a newspaper account that we had 
been invited, addressed Marian Wright Edelman saying, "We 
would be glad to stand for children, we would be glad to 
address the issues that we think are important for the 
family.  However, we weren't invited.  Perhaps you would 
like to change that."  And that actually hasn't happened.

<p>

When more than 100 organizations that get a lot of 
tax money to have a welfare approach to children's issues 
say that they are going to stand for children, it is treated 
as though the name of the event equals what actually will 
happen.  The reality is that big government doesn't stand 
best for children; parents do.

<p>

In 30 years of excessive taxes, in 30 years of 
giant welfare programs and 30 years of greater and greater 
overbearing government control in our schools, what we have 
found is that parents have been squeezed out of their family 
cars, and Big Brother is driving, and frankly, he is headed 
in the wrong direction.

<p>

We need a $500-per-child tax credit.  We need 
parents to be empowered in education.  We need adoption tax 
credits, and we need them now.  We applaud the current 
Congress for their efforts on tax relief and for dealing 
with the burden of the overbearing budget that is going to 
come to our children.  

<p>

Unfortunately, liberal activists like the 
Children's Defense Fund prevailed upon President Bill 
Clinton to veto very important legislation.  The Children's 
Defense Fund has embraced an attitude that liberal elites do 
know better than parents, and, unfortunately for the 
children who get caught up in the welfare state, that just 
isn't true, and in particular, one of the shameful programs 
going on today is what is happening in foster care.

<p>

Foster care becomes a quasi-parent for more than 
600,000 abused and neglected children.  Ten percent wait 
more than seven years to get into adopted families.  We have 
made adoption very difficult, and children are caught in the 
crossfire.

<p>

Frankly, we need to make adoption easier.  When 
the family breaks down, we need to step in with limits so 
that these children could be set free for future families.  
We need to understand that what children need most is 
families, not government.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  If you look at the list of the 426 
national organizations that have endorsed this march, at 
least 102 of them received federal grants in fiscal year 
1993-1994.  These grants totaled about $400 million to these 
groups, and on top of these groups, you have lobbying arms 
of federal programs worth about $7 billion, whether it be 
the National Head Start Association, the Association of 
Women, Infants and Children's Supplemental Nutrition 
Administrators, groups like this are involved, and the 
reason why they are involved is very simple:  This Stand for 
Children march is the latest attempt by the welfare rights 
lobby to slickly package its message.  It realizes that you 
can't talk about poor people, you can't talk about the 
welfare state, because the American public knows very well 
that the welfare state breeds dependency, breeds 
illegitimacy.

<p>

MS. NANCE [Concerned Women for America]:  If the 
choice for American women would be they would prefer to stay 
home and rear their own children, then why aren't the 
Children's Defense Fund and the National Organization for 
Women out working for women's choice?

<p>

MS. FLAHERTY [American Family Association]:
Computer technology has made pornography more accessible 
than ever before, especially to children, who in most cases 
know better how to work a computer than their parents.  Kids 
can't walk into a porn shop, but today they don't need to 
when the equivalent of an adult bookstore can be brought to 
their fingertips via the Internet.

<p>

How can we stand for children in today's world?
Parental love, caring, and involvement are vital, of course.
But it is also imperative to enact strong pornography laws
that will keep sexually explicit materials out of the hands
of children.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  While the march is carefully timed 
to influence the 1996 elections, it may not even be accurate 
to call this march partisan.  Its chief organizers are to 
the left of Clinton.  The march may well be the last gasp of 
1960s-style paleo-liberals.  Look who is absent from the 
list.  The U.S. Catholic Conference, the national body for 
the Roman Catholic Church, and the Christian Life Commission 
of the Southern Baptist Convention, the two largest 
Christian bodies in the United States, are not sponsoring 
this event.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: As we stand, let us stand up for the 
use of instructional materials that help parents and 
children establish lasting meaningful relationships, 
instructional materials such as <i>You Are Special</i> that really
will result in developing self-esteem and self-reliance in 
children, the kind that they need in order to survive and 
meet the challenges of today.

<p>

[End of FRC Stand for Children segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We now have the privilege of 
introducing some of those whom you just saw and who stood
with the Family Research Council's own Stand for Children.
I would like to welcome Dr. Mary Johnson, principal of the
D.C. Public Schools Ballou Mathematics Science Technology
Academy and author of <i>You Are Special: A Child's Guide for
Successful Living</i>.

<p>

Also joining us is Ken Weinstein, Director of the 
Government Reform Project at the Heritage Foundation; and 
Diane Knippers, president of the Institute on Religion and 
Democracy. 

<p>

Welcome. A lot of impressive organizations and 
people. I appreciate you all joining me.

<p>

In the short amount of time -- because we have so 
much to cover in our discussion of Stand for Children -- 
each of you had a special concern, and we saw just a little 
bit of that.

<p>

Dr. Johnson, let's start with you.  Why were you 
concerned when the Stand for Children rally started to 
become publicized?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON:  Well, our organization and my book, 
<i>You Are Special</i>, are very special to all of us, and 
we are very excited about getting parents involved, having 
seminars, and letting people know about the book, <i>You Are
Special</i>, because we have gotten so many positive comments 
from parents about the value of it.

<p>

So we are constantly in the public's eye talking 
about it, sharing, giving the books to mentors, and that 
kind of thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The book itself is attempting to 
build self-esteem and values through Biblical principles.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Right. So we were excited about it 
at first, and so we wrote and said we would be happy to be 
there and we would bring materials and share literature and 
whatever, and we were kind of surprised.  We got a letter 
back saying, "Well, we'll have to let you know."

<p>

So we were a little surprised at that, but we said 
okay, but we are busy telling everybody about it and passing 
out buttons, because we support anything for children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON:  Stand for Children, work for 
children, do whatever we can to help our children.

<p>

And then later, near the end of the time frame 
just before the march, we received a letter saying that they 
were sorry, that they had decided not to include us and the 
distribution of our materials.  So we were a little miffed 
at what happened.  Then we said, "Well, I'm pretty sure 
there must be some good reasons."  And then later we found 
out about other groups.  Then we really didn't know what to 
think.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is ironic that a book that Marian 
Wright Edelman gives a quote for on the back, which talks 
about the Bible, was kept out, while the Gay and Lesbian 
Victory Fund was welcome to Stand for Children.

<p>

Ken, you took a look at some of the groups that 
were there.  What made you interested in Stand for Children?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Dr. Johnson's concerns were high 
and spiritual; mine were sort of low and corporeal.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

I noticed the list of national sponsors of the 
Stand for Children rally, and I noticed that a lot of them 
were feeding at the federal trough, and I did a database 
search of the groups at the Heritage Foundation, looking at 
how much in federal grants they received.

<p>

I was quite astonished to see actually how much in 
federal grants were actually represented last Saturday on 
the Mall here in Washington.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And you, as a matter of fact, were 
characterizing it widely, not as a Stand for Children but --

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Well, as both the last stand for 
big government and also the stand of the social service 
administrators, since, really, they were standing for their 
own programs, particularly because they fear that the 
actions of the 104th Congress are going to change the 
welfare delivery system and take power and resources away 
from them and return it instead to citizens and the 
institutions they control.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

Diane, you were interested in some of the 
community things.  We have about less than a minute left.  
What did you notice about the community side of the event?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Well, we were particularly 
concerned about the religious angle, because there were a 
lot of religious organizations that gave more legitimacy to 
this march.  But our concern was that it really represented 
the left wing of the religious establishment, and many 
mainstream religious groups were not involved.  It gave a 
very distorted picture of this march.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to hear more 
about all of this.  When <i>Straight Talk</i> comes back, we will 
bring you more after the commercial break. Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing the 
pro-family movement's Stand for Children with those who were 
excluded from the Children's Defense Fund recent Stand for 
Children rally.  Here tonight are Dr. Mary Johnson, Ken 
Weinstein, and Diane Knippers.

<p>

I would like to just start out -- you know, we 
briefly kind of gave an overview of the things that had 
concerned us.  What could have made the rally better --  
Diane, let's start with you this time -- in terms of making 
it the ecumenical, nonpartisan, pro-family event it was 
advertised?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Well, I had kind of a fantasy last 
week.  What if Marian Wright Edelman, who heads the 
Children's Defense Fund, had called James Dobson and said, 
"Look, let's have a genuine bipartisan, non-ideological 
Stand for Children, which I think our country really needs, 
and let's do it together."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And Dr. Dobson?  Tell us who that is.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  The head of Focus on the Family.
And very different ideas about what kinds of solutions, 
particularly from the point of view of government solutions, 
we need for children, but both apparently with a heart for 
children.

MS. HAMRICK: Exactly.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Then maybe we would have had the 
kind of event -- or the U.S. Catholic Conference, the 
bishops of the Roman Catholic Church, or the Southern 
Baptists, the National Association of Evangelicals -- the 
largest Christian denominations in our country would have 
felt free and comfortable to really endorse.

<p>

Instead, on the religious side, you had huge 
representation of very small religious groups.  Sikhs and 
Buddhists and Muslims are not large groups in our country.
And among particularly the Protestants, the representation 
there were the churches with very liberal hierarchies.  In 
fact, four of them -- the United Methodists, the 
Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), Episcopal Church, and United 
Church of Christ -- the leaders of those denominations also 
signed a letter to uphold Clinton's veto of the partial-birth 
abortion.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Astounding.  That is something that 
people of faith on the whole, Catholic and Protestant, 
abhor.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes, very highly -- standing for 
children in a very selective way; let's put it that way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Ken, if you could have redesigned 
the march, I guess there would have been less federal money 
involved.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  Yes, much less federal money 
involved.  There would have been conservatives and liberals 
standing up there.  The event also would not have been held 
on the Jewish Sabbath, so Sabbath-observing Jews from the 
more conservative Jewish denominations could have 
participated rather than simply members of the left wing or 
more liberal Jewish denominations.

<p>

I would have not tried to do what Marian Wright 
Edelman did, which was to launch sort of a stealth campaign 
for the Stand for Children by meeting with the AFL-CIO's 
executive committee back in February to sort of give them a 
tip about the importance of this rally and how important it 
was -- the same meeting, by the way, that the AFL-CIO's 
executive committee voted to spend $35 million to defeat 
conservative members of the 104th Congress.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Astounding. That is what is so 
interesting.  I loved your report, by the way --

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN:  Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: -- and I would encourage people to
call in at the end of the show to get it.  But it was just 
very clear.  I mean, if you look at who came from a social 
perspective -- Planned Parenthood; Zero Growth Fund, 
apparently standing for fewer children; Greenpeace, I am not 
sure, standing for children who pick up trash -- and then we 
have the majority of groups being involved in federal 
monies.  I mean, what does the AFL-CIO, the labor movement, 
have to say about standing for children that Focus on the 
Family would not have to say?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Sure, absolutely.  The AFL-CIO, 
the only way that it stands for children is by standing for 
grants to its members and for government programs that 
provide jobs for its members.

<p>

But certainly AFL-CIO, by standing for the welfare 
state and by standing for the way things have been done over 
the last 30 years that have generated the real crises that 
we see today, particularly our inner cities, you know, it is 
just sort of another failed example of the liberalism that 
we have to forget about if we are going to have a future 
that our children can enjoy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Dr. Johnson, how would you have 
redesigned the march?  How could you have made it more 
ecumenical?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Well, I am not sure, but what I wish 
had happened is that everybody who has done things for 
children, have programs for children, would just be 
welcomed; that the letter that I got would have said, "We 
cannot assure you space to display anything, but come and 
bring your materials and share.  We know about your 
materials.  Bring them, share them with the parents and 
share them with others so they will know."  And everybody, 
other organizations, not just Focus on the Family, "Bring 
materials, come in, join us in any way that you can.  We 
don't know that we can provide space for you, but just come 
on and join us and bring whatever you can so that we can 
share all kinds of materials, programs, and whatever you 
have that we know will be helpful to children."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Were you concerned that your faith 
perspective -- I mean, ABC World News, for example, showed 
the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund at their special table in 
their booth handing out their materials, and then, in an 
open-air event, they said that there wasn't a table space 
for you, which seems hard to believe.  Are you concerned 
about that?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: I was down there. There was room.
There was plenty of room.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Yes, we were concerned, but we just 
didn't understand it, and we tried not to place a judgment 
on it, and we just tried to say, well, maybe there are some 
reasons that we just don't know.  We tried to look at it as 
objectively as we could.

<p>

But, yes, we were sort of amazed at the reaction. 
We thought the letter would come back and say, "Oh, come, 
do come, please come.  We want you there.  Bring your 
materials.  We know it has a religious slant, but it is not 
geared to any particular religion, and it is geared to all 
people.  It is written for all cultures, all nationalities 
and whatever," because we sent materials along with our 
initial letter.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Oh, of course.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: "So, yes, bring it, and if you can 
find a little spot, you can find some space, you know, 
wonderful."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, I hope our listeners are going 
to have space for this book, and we're going to give an 800 
number, and again, people, you are going to want to hold 
fast to get this book.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we are going to hear 
more about the kinds of things children desperately need in 
America today.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We're back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, and we are talking to 
experts who are enlightening us on what it truly means to 
stand for children.  Welcome back to Dr. Mary Johnson, Ken 
Weinstein, and Diane Knippers.

<p>

Diane, we have been talking a little bit about
what we would have liked to have seen.  But you actually
went.

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What did you see at the Stand for Children march?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  Well, I started out on Friday 
night.  I went to the ecumenical service at the National 
Cathedral here in Washington, and then I went very early 
Saturday morning to a nearby Episcopal church where all the 
Episcopalians gathered.  We got a free breakfast and tee 
shirts.  I almost wore my tee shirt but decided not to.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We also got these little preprinted cards to send 
to our Senators, Representative, and to the President urging 
that we keep high levels of federal spending for children.  
These were convenient so we could send them in.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Ken is probably going to want to borrow these.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Exactly.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS:  The lobbying started at the 
religious events.  There were several that different 
denominations had beforehand.  When we actually got to the 
march -- I must say that it was one of the best organized, 
perhaps slickest marches I have ever been to, and with very 
effective use of children, the 2,000-children choir, the 
10,000 children crossing the bridge.  And all of this, the 
music, it was quite a celebratory event leading up to Marian 
Wright Edelman's final speech, where the bottom line was she 
got a lot of names and a lot of press coverage for a very 
one-sided political initiative that then started here in 
Washington on Monday when they started lobbying.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: As a person who evaluates daily and 
for a long time the impact of some of the liberal faith 
groups on politics, do you see this as being a direct 
connection between the intertwining of a liberal faith 
perspective and politics?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Oh, absolutely. In fact, it 
occurred to me that there was as much overt political 
activity at the religious events and as much or maybe more 
talk about spirituality and morality at the rally.  I mean, 
it was the same kind of thing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Kind of backwards, almost?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: Yes. The homilies -- I mean, I 
kept looking anywhere for distinctive messages about moral 
messages.  In the entire 24 hours, I did not hear the word 
"divorce."  I did not hear the word "illegitimacy."  There 
was no mention of the problem of father absence, either at 
the religious events or the rally.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And that is astounding.  I want to 
return to the question of father absence.

<p>

But, Dr. Johnson, in your book <i>You Are Special</i> you 
take a look at the Ten Commandments, the foundation of all 
Judeo-Christian civilized societies, and you talk about how 
to teach values.  I mean, you were there.  Did you wish that 
some messages -- what did you see and what would you have 
liked to have heard a little more about?

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Well, we were there in the 
afternoon.  I would like to have seen more information and 
more focus on how to actually help our children on a day-to-
day basis.  The rally was wonderful, the march was great, 
the Stand for Children whole concept was fantastic.  But 
what comes later?  Our children need companionship with 
parents.  They need spiritual development on a day-to-day 
basis.  And our parents, because some of them are so young, 
need training themselves to help their children develop.  
And our children need time with an adult, time that has been 
set aside for them to help them.  This has to happen on a 
regular basis.

<p>

And without this kind of emphasis on helping our 
children develop and grow daily all the time, then it is 
just not going to be effective.  Nothing is going to be 
effective that does not deal with the children on a daily, 
regular basis, or regular basis, to help them develop.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So it was more of an emphasis on 
programs versus the intimate people touch that is really 
needed.

<p>

DR. JOHNSON: Yes, right, and that is what we are 
focusing on.  Sitting with the child with a book.  Spending 
time talking to the child.  Helping the child clarify what 
is really right and wrong, and we use the Bible as our 
basis, the Ten Commandments, other Biblical principles.  But 
parents that I have talked to say this is just so valuable, 
because it helps them to sit with their children, and they 
get a real clear understanding of what is right and what is 
wrong based on the Biblical principles.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Ken, you made a very interesting 
point that for people of some faiths, you couldn't even 
participate.

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: That is correct. No, orthodox 
Jews do not engage in public secular activities from sundown 
Friday till sundown Saturday, and so I spent from sundown 
Friday till -- I was in synagogue Saturday and I missed the 
rally, which I don't regret having missed, but nonetheless, 
it was -- I mean, I decided that my religion comes before my 
work, and so I didn't attend, and I know there were other 
orthodox Jews who did want to attend but couldn't because of 
the fact the rally was held on the Sabbath.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That was the nature of the event.

<p>

I want to hear more about the programs you would 
like to see when we come back.  When we return, <i>Straight
Talk</i> shares more on how you can stand for America's
children.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. In light of the recent Stand 
for Children rally, we are talking to some of those who are 
truly fighting for the rights of America's children.

<p>

Ken, I wanted to start with you.  You took a look
at the programs represented at Stand for Children. What did
you find about the people who said they were standing for
children?

<p>

MR. WEINSTEIN: Sure. What they were standing for 
was an attempt to prevent any real significant welfare 
reform in the 104th Congress.  Also, they were standing for 
actually the more liberal elements, if you can believe that, 
in the Clinton Administration, trying to assure that their 
weight, that they had a stronger weight against the so-called 
new Democrats who actually push for some mild forms 
of welfare reform.

<p>

What they have done, in essence, is identify the 
plight of children with the welfare state and with the 
welfare state as it currently exists, and as we all know, it 
is the welfare state, more than just about anything, that 
has destroyed civil society in the inner city, in 
particular, destroyed churches, destroyed the healthy 
organizations that teach children character, and have also 
actually in many cases taken the place of fathers in the 
inner city by providing financial pay so that women can have 
children without men around.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Family Research Council 
got involved in evaluating Stand for Children for just that 
reason.  Our concern was that the best advocates for 
children are parents, and in fact we know in terms of early 
sex for teens and teen promiscuity that the best way to have 
children delay sex is to encourage them to talk about it 
with their moms and dads.

<p>

So instead of running a federally funded public 
service campaign that talks about moms and dads, talk to 
your kids; kids, talk to your parents; we run a dancing 
condom ad, and that just seems typical of the approach where 
we don't do family-building things.

<p>

Diane, what did you see?  I mean, what emphasis 
was there on family as the way to help kids?

<p>

MS. KNIPPERS: There was lip service to the family 
around the edges, but there was nothing really that gave 
support or particular advice or encouragement.

<p>

One of the things that disturbed me -- I am of the 
conviction that the major crisis facing our country, if you 
wanted to simplify it, you could say it in two words:  it is 
father absence.  There are just terrifying statistics about 
where we are headed with children being reared in single-parent 
families.

<p>

Now, this would have been a perfect opportunity to 
really lift up fathers as role models.  Instead, all the 
little vignettes of children that were in crisis, it was men 
that were the bad guys.  They were the abusers or the 
deserters of the family.  And the heroes, the people that 
intervened in the lives of children, were all women.  Now, 
we need to show men who are heroes to children and who will 
intervene.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You all are heroes, and I hope 
people are going to call to get more information about your 
organizations.  And we need to talk more about father 
absence.  Diane, we'll have to have you back.

<p>

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I'm your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on Straight Talk we are celebrating a belated 
Father's Day.  Unfortunately, fatherhood cannot claim the 
revered position it once held in our national culture.  Not 
only do many television sitcoms make a mockery of fathers, 
but the harsh reality is that thousands upon thousands of 
America's children suffer from the absence of their own 
fathers.

<p>

Our guests tonight, who are actively researching 
and attempting to change the status of fatherhood in our 
country, will discuss the fatherhood crisis and the triumphs 
and trials of being fathers themselves. 

<p>

But first, let's hear from Family Research Council 
president Gary Bauer.  As the Presidential election draws 
near, Bob Dole and Bill Clinton are raising issues and 
debating them with America's leaders. 

<p>

In the last two weeks, Gary has been in the 
forefront of those discussions as they have played out on
the front pages on the <i>New York Times</i> to the mass media.
The present controversy has involved the sanctity of life
and the politics of abortion.  Let's hear what Gary has to
say about recent events and upsets as we take you Behind the
Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

For a lot of people who watch this show and who 
follow the Family Research Council and actually you, in 
particular, they have seen over the last two weeks 
incredible media exposure from <i>Capital Gang</i> to <i>Crossfire</i> 
to the front page of the <i>New York Times</i>. The debate has been 
about Dole and abortion, the Republican Party and the right-
to-life issue.  How would you characterize the debate as it 
stands today? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think it has been actually a 
frustrating week or two in the sense that the debate has 
gotten away from 1.5 million unborn children being aborted 
every year and has now, at least it seems inside Washington, 
gotten down to dotting I's and crossing T's in the platform. 

<p>

The issue is one of the most profound issues 
facing the country, and it deserves a more noble debate than 
a debate over the machinations of a platform committee. 

<p>

The irony is that there is this tremendous 
difference between Bob Dole and Bill Clinton on the issue.  
The President, as we all know, supports abortion on demand.  
He has even vetoed a bill that tried to limit abortions in 
the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy.  Bob Dole has a 
35-year pro-life voting record. 

<p>

So my hope is that Senator Dole will just be clear 
about that so that the American people can discern what the 
differences are between the two men. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The media likes to write process 
stories, particularly about difficult issues like abortion 
and right to life.  In the last two weeks, we have seen a 
lot of coverage on the Republican platform and whether there 
should be language on tolerance or the big tent in the 
preamble or attached to the plank itself. 

<p>

But really, it is not that simple, as simple as a 
platform.  Why, in a way, is this story a big story, and 
then why is it really not as significant as they are trying 
to make the process of the platform out to be? 

<p>

MR. BAUER:  Well, look.  When you take a so-called 
tolerance line, which I think is a sort of bizarre way to 
say that something in your platform doesn't really mean what 
it says, but when you take that and apply it only to the 
abortion issue, the message you are sending is that you are 
really not serious about doing anything on abortion. 

<p>

The best analogy I can come up with is taxes.  The 
Republican platform will predictably say that they want 
lower taxes.  I certainly hope that they will say that.  If 
they added language to that plank that said, "However, we 
know some people disagree with us, and they are welcome in 
the party, too," the clear message the American people would 
get is, Whoops, tax aren't going down; the party is not 
serious about that issue. 

<p>

And, likewise, if you single out the abortion 
issue, which is a very profound issue, very important for 
the future of the country and who we are as a free people, 
and you add only tolerance language to that, then the 
message you are sending is that the issue really isn't that 
high on your priority list, and you are really not going to 
do anything about it. 

<p>

I think it eliminates one of the major 
vulnerabilities that Bill Clinton has.  I think he is 
extremely vulnerable in this issue if somebody will really 
take the debate to him and be clear and articulate about it. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That really is an incredible irony. 
Here we have a radically pro-abortion Democratic Party and 
the most liberal, most extreme pro-abortion President of all 
history, who embraces abortion in the seventh, eighth, and 
ninth month, even if the child is perfectly healthy, and we 
have a pro-life candidate with a 35-year voting record and a 
consistently pro-life party.  But why do you think the 
Republicans are reluctant to embrace what has been a winning 
issue?

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, I think the main reason is the 
way this city thinks about the abortion issue.  In 
Washington, D.C., the cultural elite of the city is 
overwhelmingly pro-abortion, whether you are talking about 
the media, the political consultants that hang on and make 
their living by telling candidates what they ought to say 
and not say, the pollsters, and so forth. 

<p>

So every major politician is constantly being told 
(that) to be pro-life is an impediment.  And when you get 
out around the country and look at who gets elected, pro-
life people do extremely well.  That is one of the reasons 
we have a Republican majority in the Congress now for the 
first time since World War II.  It is one of the reasons the 
Republicans won five out of the last seven Presidential 
elections. 

<p>

You know, Kristi, the real irony here is that 
polling data out just in the last couple of days show that 
about 30 percent of the American people think that Bill 
Clinton only supports abortion in the first three months of 
the pregnancy.  This is unbelievable to me.  Here in 
Washington, we all know that President Clinton -- he is very 
about this:  he believes in abortion on demand.  There is no 
restriction on abortion in any month of the pregnancy, for 
any reason, that Bill Clinton has been willing to sign.  And 
yet because there is never a real debate on it, one-third of 
the American people think that he wants abortion fairly 
stringently restricted. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The media likes to characterize 
abortion as a women's issue, which is ironic, because in 
polling women consistently are shown to be more pro-life.  
And if we look at people who are single-issue voters, the 
abortion issue, in terms of the right-to-life position, 
pulls 2 to 1 as an advantage for a candidate who takes that 
issue.

<p>

Why do you think, though, that the media tries to 
say abortion is a gender gap issue for Dole? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Well, no, it is not responsible at 
all; in fact, this poll is no surprise.  There has not been 
one poll in 20 years of polling -- and I have looked for 
every one of them -- that has ever shown that it is the 
abortion issue that costs a politician or a party female 
votes, because as you just indicated, on balance it ends up 
being a net plus for whatever candidate or party takes that 
position. 

<p>

I think the gender gap has got a lot to do with 
some of the budget cuts which the Republican Party 
legitimately tried to make, but polling data for years has 
also shown that women tend to get nervous when you are 
talking about cutting budgets, particularly when the 
programs being cut have some indirect effect on women or 
children or the elderly or the sick.  And that is 
understandable.  Women tend to be more sensitive about those 
sorts of things.  So I think that the economic cuts, the 
economic agenda of the party, has a lot more to say about 
the gender gap than the social issues do.

<p>

Interestingly, the polling shows that there is one 
group in America that is overwhelmingly supportive of 
abortion on demand, and that group is men between the ages 
of 18 and 25, and I would suggest that that is nothing a 
politician should be proud about.  The reason men between 
the ages of 18 and 25 support abortion on demand is it makes 
it easier for them to run away from their responsibilities 
when they get a woman pregnant.  When that woman comes to 
them and says that she needs help or wants that man to stand 
up to do the responsible thing, he can throw his hands up 
and say, "Wait a minute.  I have nothing to do with this 
from this point on.  You have a right to abort.  Utilize 
that right.  That's the end of it." 

<p>

So it has been a real boon for young men.  It has 
been terrible for women and children, and I think 
politicians ought to be clear about who has benefitted from 
abortion on demand and who hasn't. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It has been a very fiery debate for 
you, Gary, in the last two weeks.  In fact the front page of 
the <i>New York Times</i> shows Senator Dole attacking you for your 
pro-life stance.  You have had a long history in Washington. 
It seems strange to suddenly find that objectionable.  Why 
do you think that Senator Dole did attack you personally? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Kristi, I have no idea. I have worked 
closely with Senator Dole.  It is a little unusual, I think, 
for him to attack me for defending a platform plank that he 
says he believes in.  That doesn't make any sense to me at 
all.  But I have worked with him in the past; I am sure I 
will work with him in the future.

<p>

We do have, though, a core set of issues that we 
stand for:  the sanctity of life, the importance of the 
family, traditional values, teaching children reliable 
standards of right and wrong.  And the only credibility I 
can ever have in Washington is if I am consistent in 
standing for those things, even if on any given day it might 
irritate one politician or another.  Now, usually it 
irritates liberal Democrats; in this case, it irritated a 
conservative Republican.  But I can't start fine-tuning the 
core set of values that we have to satisfy people that are 
running for office.  That would quickly end any influence 
whatsoever that I could ever have in Washington. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  For the most part, the media has 
ignored the abortion and right-to-life controversy in the 
Democratic Party. Sunday in the <i>Washington Post</i>, there was 
an article of Democratic Party leaders and office holders 
saying, "Look, we have a pro-life side as well, and we, the 
pro-life members of the Democratic Party, want to address 
our convention."

<p>

You have been advising pro-life candidates for a 
long time, Democratic and Republican and independent.  How 
would you advise someone on how to handle the sanctity-of-life 
issue?  How does someone need to play that to have 
success? 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Sure. The American people are deeply 
divided over the issue, so I never want to suggest that it 
is an easy issue to handle.  But I think if you believe in 
the sanctity of human life, as I do, that you can't run from 
it.  You can't try to be all things to all people. 

<p>

I guess I go back to the man that will probably be 
my favorite President for the rest of my life, and that is 
Ronald Reagan.  Ronald Reagan was unambiguous about this.  
He was gentle in describing his position.  He wasn't harsh. 
He didn't attack women, certainly, because women have been 
exploited by this as much as anyone has.  But he was clear 
about it.  He was clear that he firmly believed that unborn 
children deserved constitutional protection, and he won one 
of the biggest landslides in American history, even though 
everyone in the country knew that was his position. 

<p>

That's the model that I would recommend to Bob 
Dole or to somebody running for the Senate or the House or 
even for a local city council race.  State your position 
clearly, do it fairly, do it with a sense of compassion.  
But don't ever run away from the defense of innocent human 
life. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Thank you, Gary, for being with us 
today on Behind the Headlines. 

<p>

MR. BAUER: Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> begins our discussion of fatherhood.  What 
does it take to be a good father?  Stay tuned to hear how 
our guests answer that crucial question. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Segment from Promise Keepers, RFK Stadium, May 25, 1996, follows:]

<p>

DR. CANALES: Whenever you are weak as a father, 
whenever you don't have what it takes as a husband, whenever 
you feel insecure, whenever you feel inadequate, whenever 
you feel like you don't have any strength, whenever you feel 
like you're not being a good enough dad, I want you to know 
that you can trust in God and He will bring you through and 
make up the difference for you and bring you out of Egypt 
into a strong and mighty situation and give you the strength 
you need to be a good dad. 

<p>

[Applause.]

<p>

Please say Amen.

<p>

MEN [Attendees]: Amen.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Right now I want you to do something 
with me.  I want you to take out your wallet, and I'm not 
going to tell you to give your neighbor money, and I'm not 
going to take up an offering, which I know you think I am, 
but I'm not.  I just want you to look at your pictures.
Take out your wallet if you've got some pictures.  Look at 
your wife and at your kids, if you've got them right there, 
and show them to your neighbor, all right?  Would you love 
them unconditionally?  Men, would you love them 
unconditionally?

<p>

MEN: Yes.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Do they have to perform for you to 
love them? 

<p>

MEN: No.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  No.  Everybody say no!

<p>

MEN: No.

<p>

DR. CANALES:  Say "I" --

<p>

MEN:  I -- 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Love" --

<p>

MEN:  Love --

<p>

DR. CANALES: "Them."

<p>

MEN:  Them. 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Unconditionally." 

<p>

MEN:  Unconditionally. 

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Not for what they do" --

<p>

MEN:  Not for what they do --

<p>

DR. CANALES:  "Or don't do."

<p>

MEN:  Or don't do.

<p>

DR. CANALES: "But for who they are."

<p>

MEN:  But for who they are.

<p>

MAN [Attendee]:  A father needs to be a man of 
integrity, a man of his word, show love for his children, 
his family, his wife, real concern for the things of God. 

<p>

MAN: I think a father should be a man who follows 
after the Lord.  He ought to be somebody who understands the 
word of God and tries to live it.  He should be somebody who 
cares about his family, his wife and his children, and is 
willing to sacrifice anything to take care of them.  Most of 
all, he cares for his children to the point that he wants 
them to be raised up to be godly women and godly men. 

<p>

BOY:  I love you, Dad. 

<p>

MAN:  I love you too, buddy. 

<p>

MAN:  Special father qualities.  Love.  I mean, to 
really be able to understand love and listen to your 
children. 

<p>

MAN:  Important characteristics that a father 
should have, I believe, are very much the ones that my 
father had, and that's just a man of integrity, a man of 
honesty, a man who's really faithful to his family and also 
a loving father who really loves his kids. 

<p>

MAN:  I guess the first one would be humble and 
understanding and able to accept their children no matter 
what, just to love them for who they are.  That's really 
important. 

<p>

MAN:  I think a father needs to be real and one 
that can show affection and love. 

<p>

YOUNG MAN:  I love you and I'm sorry about all the 
problems we've had. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MAN:  Loving, warm, gentle, comforting, and more 
importantly, a listening ear for our children, and to be 
around them and caring. 

<p>

MAN: A father should be very loyal to his kids, 
love them unconditionally, be there for them no matter what, 
supporting them when things go well and when they don't go 
maybe as well as they would have liked and just know that, 
no matter what, we're always there for them. 

<p>

[End of Promise Keepers segment.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  As we just saw, fatherhood requires 
a lot from men, and tonight's guests are here to discuss why 
many fathers have neglected that crucial role in their 
children's lives. 

<p>

I would like to welcome Terry Allen, chief of 
staff for Representative Steve Largent and father of five; 
Armstrong Williams, whom many viewers already know as a
television and radio talk show host and syndicated columnist
whose touching <i>USA Today</i> article honored his own father.

<p>

Also joining us is Bill Mattox, whom many of you 
know, FRC's Vice President for Policy, who consistently has 
made fatherhood a headlining issue and directed a national 
fatherhood campaign called Being a Dad is Important 
Business.  I would like to welcome all of you, a couple of 
days after Father's Day.

<p>

Bill, you wrote an Op-Ed not too long ago talking 
about how, on Father's Day, you get the joke cards; on 
Mother's Day you get the honoring and revering of motherhood 
and all that it is.  Why do fathers seem to get such a bad 
rap? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: Well, you know, it's funny. There 
really is a very different quality to the types of cards 
that people give at Father's day.  I mean, you do see 
sentimental cards on both occasions, but it's rare that you 
see Mother's Day cards that have any kind of joke, or if 
there is some sort of humor involved, it quite often will 
take shots at Dad, whereas it's quite routine for fathers to 
be the butt of jokes in the Father's Day cards. 

<p>

I think some of this is probably a reflection of 
the fact that men open themselves up to that kind of abuse 
by failing to sometimes come off swiftly in their duties in 
the home.  But I think a lot of it is just a reflection of 
the fact that we expect fathers to kind of roll with the 
punches and to be able to mix it up with us. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Broad shoulders.

<p>

MR. MATTOX: Yes, and want, as you say, to kind of 
keep mothers in a revered status.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Fathers don't seem to get that.

<p>

Armstrong, your column was very revering, very 
reverent, and I am going to encourage people to call and get 
a copy of it.  But as you look at your own father and at 
fatherhood in general, why do you think that fathers don't 
often get the tribute you wrote for your own dad? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, statistics would bear out 
that 70 percent of adolescent murderers are born into 
fatherless homes.  Sixty percent of American rapists come 
from fatherless homes.  I mean kids who don't do well in 
school and who have low self-esteem don't have a father in 
the home. 

<p>

And for me it was not a decision that I made; it 
was a decision that my parents made.  They took their 
marriage vows very seriously, for sickness or in health, for 
better or for worse, and till death do them part. 

<p>

The problem is not for me as a man.  I grew up 
with a father, so obviously, growing up with a father, all 
my adolescent life, obviously, I want to emulate that.  You 
only repeat the tape that's in the home. 

<p>

And with so many households today without fathers, 
many kids feel it's the norm, and you have it reinforced by 
television, by the movies, that, well, this is the norm.  
And a lot of mothers will say today, "I did a fine job.  I 
never missed a man."  But that is not true.  It takes two 
parents to raise a child. 

<p>

But this started 30 or 40 years ago, and unless we 
get back to teaching through the church and through other 
organizations that the best home is with a mother and a 
father, and to restore the man in his proper place, then it 
will never change; it will only get worse. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, Terry, I thought it was an 
interesting contrast recently when Susan Molinari comes back 
to Congress with her child and is very welcomed.  I thought 
of all the men laboring as fathers rather unremarkedly.  You 
know, women are having children and they're coming in and 
working, and it's hardly discussed at all.  You know, you're 
in a place where there's a lot of work hours.  How is 
fatherhood viewed up on the Hill and in official Washington? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, I think it is better than it 
used to be.  I think there is at least an attempt to have a 
family-friendly, or at least there's --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  More of an attempt.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  -- more of an attempt, at least an 
acknowledgement that we need to have a family-friendly 
Congress.  Whether or not we are actually there -- certainly 
in 1995 that was not the case; in 1996, the schedule is a 
little better and the hours are not as late. 

<p>

But I think, generally, it is not that different 
from where you have the attitude in corporate America or in 
society in general that, as Bill said, generally does not 
take the role of nurturer or provider as seriously; at least 
fathers are not thought of in that role as much as women 
are, and so it is a reflection of the attitude that 
individual fathers have that they are more expendable or 
they are more -- you know, if they work late, it's not that 
important, but if Mom works late, boy, the kids really feel 
it, because she is the primary care-giver.  And it's a 
reflection of the attitudes of our society and culture. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: The <i>Wall Street Journal</i> Work and 
Family column has made a big deal in the last couple weeks, 
and the last two months in particular, about men getting on 
the daddy track; you know, CEOs resigning.

<p>

But do you think that's a real trend?  Are men 
maybe just publicly reevaluating a little more, or are they 
really getting on a daddy track? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS: You know, it is true that you have 
a lot of households with both parents.  But you have 
absentee fathers.  I remember a story someone was telling me 
that there was this father who is a CEO, who is very busy, 
and he had planned to spend his kid's birthday with him for 
months in advance, and it was a 16th birthday. 

<p>

But then, all of a sudden, he got this speaking 
engagement that was going to pay him $1,000, but more 
importantly than the money, it would have afforded him an 
opportunity to sort of rub shoulders with the people that 
could really advance his career. 

<p>

And so, three weeks before the engagement, he met 
with his son and said, "Look, this engagement has come up.
I didn't realize it, but it's something that is very 
beneficial for me and it's going to help my career, so I'll 
cut a deal with you.  I'll give you the $1,000 and I'll go 
make the speech."

<p>

And the son said, "No, Dad, you keep the money.
It's more important that I spend the day with you." 

<p>

And that's a lot of what's going on, and I don't 
think it's that CEOs need to go back home and play nurturer; 
it's that they need to understand that they need to spend 
quality time with their children. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  They need to just come home in general.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Right. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Rather than quit their job. 

<p>

What do you think, Bill?  Is there a daddy track? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: I think that there is a reevaluation 
taking place among really both women and men, but I think 
particularly among men, because if you look -- especially I 
was noticing the clip on Promise Keepers -- if you go and 
talk to many of the individuals there, you'll find that 
among that kind of baby boomer cohort, there are a number of 
men who perceive that somehow they missed out and that they 
would like to devote more of their time and energy and 
attention to rearing children than perhaps their fathers 
did.

<p>

I am not altogether certain that some of the 
criticism that is often levied against the fathers of old is 
justified.  But I do think it's a healthy thing that many 
men today are taking these responsibilities more seriously 
and do appear to be willing to at least consider sacrifices 
that might not have been considered proper a generation or 
more ago. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We have about a minute left, and I 
wanted you all to respond quickly. <i>Newsweek</i>, I think, had a 
front-page and cover story on fathering, and they said that 
today's men universally think that they are better equipped 
to be fathers and are better dads.  Do you think we're 
raising a better generation of fathers, or has the self-esteem 
curriculum leaked into our national fatherhood debate?

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  That's not politically correct. 

<p>

I don't think <i>Newsweek</i> could be further from the 
truth.  I think the dads of yesteryear were better; they 
were more disciplinarian, and plus they did not have to 
compete with the media culture of today.  I mean, parents 
have a lot to compete with, with music, with entertainment, 
and with the kids' culture, the environment that they are 
in.  So, no, I would not agree with <i>Newsweek</i> on that 
predictor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to come back 
and hear the comments of the other two of you. 

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more after this 
commercial break.  Don't go away. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are celebrating 
fatherhood, and I am joined by Terry Allen, chief of staff 
for Representative Steve Largent; Armstrong Williams, who 
spans all media as a television and radio talk show host and 
syndicated columnist; and Bill Mattox, the Family Research 
Council's Vice President for Policy.  Welcome back. 

<p>

We were kind of talking about <i>Newsweek</i>'s 
assessment that today's dad is empowered to be the best dad 
that he can be.  Terry, what do you think?  I mean, have we 
invented a better father than the men of the 1940s and 1950s 
or even their ancestors?

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  I don't think so.  I hope so, but 
today's fathers are competing with a media that is openly 
hostile at times to the values that so many fathers want to 
instill in their children.  I know I run up against that.  
You know, we have a 6:30 hour where it is kind of after 
homework but before dinner and this kind of limbo time where 
the television shows that used to come on were <i>Happy Days</i>
and <i>Laverne and Shirley</i>, and now they are shows that I 
really have to watch for my children to pick up on things 
that I don't want them to hear. So it's tough. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  Right around that hour you get 
<i>The Simpsons</i> with the inevitable buffoon father.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, exactly, and <i>Married with
Children</i> and some of those.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  [Unintelligible] the ones that you 
don't pick up on. 

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes, right.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  So fathers are competing against a lot 
today that they didn't have to compete with 30 years ago. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes. At least father knew something, even if he 
didn't always know best.

<p>

Bill, what do you think?  I mean, have we got the 
perfect genetic dad now? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX: No. I think it is very difficult to 
argue that at a time when four out of ten kids are going to 
bed every night living in a home without a father present 
that we have somehow reached an age or an era in which we 
have responsible fatherhood to the max.  We are certainly 
far short of that. 

<p>

I do think, however, that there is a subpopulation 
of fathers that, in light of all the problems around and in 
light of some of the challenges that are facing them, are 
perhaps stepping up to the plate in a new and different and 
perhaps better way than men of a previous generation, not 
that men of a previous generation wouldn't have done so, but 
that the circumstances were different, the surrounding 
culture was much more favorable.  The need for strong 
fathers and strong mothers may not have been as great. 

<p>

And so I do think that there is at least a 
subpopulation that is taking this stuff very seriously, and 
that gives us a glimmer of hope when we look at the 
magnitude of some of the problems that are caused by 
fatherlessness. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS: You know, and the other thing is, 
too, long ago you never had the kind of dysfunctional 
families that you have today, and that fathers would abandon 
their children was unheard of; nor did you have women who 
would be so boisterous about being pregnant and carrying 
somebody's child that they were not married to. 

<p>

And I would not even fool myself -- I don't know 
about Terry and everybody else here -- I would never 
convince myself that I could be a better parent, a better 
father than my father.  I would not even try to fool myself 
to say that I can achieve what my father achieved, because 
to me it is almost virtually impossible.  The course, the 
game has changed. 

<p>

You have to be more tolerant.  I mean, you have 
laws that say you cannot discipline your children.  Your 
child can file an abuse suit against you.  I mean, there are 
all kinds of things more important, which is the law.  The 
law makes it difficult for you to be a parent today, and you 
have to contend with that.

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Absolutely. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: I think even what is a good father 
has lost its definition.  My own father, father of six -- I 
have to say, "Hey, Dad" -- when he would say, "How do I know 
that I love you?" in addition to all that he said, he would 
tell us, "Watch what I do.  You have food on the table, you 
have clothes on your back.  I am faithful to your mother.  
That's how you know that I love you."  And I heard him say 
that a million times, defining his love by his action. 

<p>

But today fathering can be defined as money, it 
can be defined as quality time, which I am not exactly sure 
what that is -- maybe you all do -- but how do you define 
what is a good father?  You know, our culture seems to 
picture a guy with a big credit card. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  There's a great deal of confusion on 
this question in our culture.  I think that we are 
comfortable seeing Dad take on all kinds of new roles, if 
you would look at least at some of the women's magazines and 
that kind of thing.  But I think that there is a failure to 
appreciate some of the unique and irreplaceable 
contributions that men make to family life and the fact that 
mothers and fathers are not intended to be interchangeable. 

<p>

I think one of the things that is beginning to 
stir in some of the discussion taking place at least among 
people in this town and in other places around the country 
is a kind of renewed appreciation and recognition that 
fathers do bring something different to the table and that 
we want them to. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do they bring? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Well, I think one of the things that 
they bring is the ability to help young children, especially 
boys, learn to develop self-control, especially over their 
kind of physical bodies and what not.  I mean, the scene of 
a dad, say, wrestling on the floor with children has, I 
think, in many ways been kind of seen as a nice little 
playful thing that doesn't really have a great deal of 
importance. 

<p>

But, instead, if you listen to some of the 
developmental psychologists, they'll tell you that, no, that 
sort of interplay, which we would never expect, really, of a 
mom, to be down on the floor wrestling, is quite important 
from the standpoint of helping boys to understand that they 
can use some of their aggressive tendencies in constructive 
ways but that there are limits and that when they cross 
lines and they kick or they bite or they punch in ways that 
are inappropriate, that there will be ramifications, there 
will be consequences. 

<p>

And if those lessons are taught in that kind of 
setting, then we don't often see boys of 14, 15, 16 out 
raping and pillaging. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: That's true. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  When boys, however, are deprived of 
that kind of instruction, it's not at all surprising, then, 
that their aggressive masculine tendencies would spill over 
into all kinds of destructive social behavior. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: What do you think, Terry?  That is 
fascinating.  What's the mark of a good father?  You know, 
wrestling, playing with the children and bringing something 
different to the table. 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  I would have to say someone primarily 
who takes his responsibilities seriously.  You know, the 
technique, being a father is a relationship, and it takes 
time and it takes practice, and it is in the context of that 
relationship that you are a father. 

<p>

But, first and foremost, the commitment to be a 
father and to stay a father is primarily, I think, the most 
important thing, and that commitment over time will manifest 
itself in a myriad of different ways and forms and things 
that you as a father may not even pick up on.  But the fact 
that you're there, you're consistently there, and you're 
learning to work out your own faults and helping your 
children learn to grow and be mature and act responsibly, 
that in and of itself is profound, I think. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  You know, I think -- and I can only 
go back to my own childhood and my involvement with a lot of 
young men -- I think the most important thing that a father 
can do is teach his child that he is imperfect, that he does 
not have all the answers, and that the foundation of 
everything is in the Ten Commandments of the Bible. 

<p>

"And yet, when I'm not with you," as my father 
used to say to me, "when I'm not with you and you fall short 
and you're in a situation and you don't know what to do, you 
go to those laws and those commandments," which were etched 
in my heart.

<p>

When you teach your child that -- it is critical 
that a father teaches his child an example of discipline, 
work ethic, love for humanity, and routine.  A child, 
especially a young man, must have routine in their life.  
Especially a young man should not have idle time.  You must 
teach that child to work. 

<p>

And another thing that a father should do -- and I 
am sure these gentlemen may agree with me -- is that my 
father always taught us that no young man should ever be in 
bed past 8 a.m. in the morning.  A young man should be up. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: He rises and works.

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  If he has nothing to do, he should 
find something to do.  Those are very important lessons that 
can lead to big things. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: My father was on your team, believe me.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we'll hear more about 
the joys and trials of fatherhood.  Join us after the break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[National Fatherhood Initiative PSA.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Like the National Fatherhood 
Initiative, which gave us the fatherhood public service 
announcement which we just saw, the men joining me today are 
actively working to restore respect to fatherhood.  Welcome 
back to Terry Allen, Armstrong Williams, and Bill Mattox. 

<p>

There is a tremendous love in Washington of 
government fixes for societal problems, and there are some 
things that government can do, perhaps more limited than it 
thinks.  But what can government do to help men in their 
desire to be good fathers or just to increase the profile of 
fatherhood? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, there's two things we can do 
first off, right away.  First is end the penalty for intact 
families that we have in our public assistance programs.  We 
talked about the tragedy of fatherless children and broken 
homes.  We are actually, in federal policy, encouraging 
that, promoting that, and penalizing intact families through 
the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program, which 
is more commonly known as welfare, and other public 
assistance programs.

<p>

And that is a tragedy.  And that has driven the 
demographic on the number of children that are in broken 
homes.  It's a tragedy.  It has to be stopped.  It was fixed 
in the welfare reform bill.  It was vetoed twice.  Enough 
said. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Not surprisingly.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  The second thing that we can do is we 
can address the family time famine, which the Family 
Research Council has talked a lot about, that basically in 
1950 the average family spent 2 percent of its income in 
federal taxes; today they spend 24 percent of its income in 
federal taxes.  That has driven the need for a second 
income, which creates all types of challenges for parents 
who struggle to raise children and spend time with their 
children.  So we have a famine of time that we are trying to 
find to spend with our kids. 

<p>

Those are two federal policies that we can fix 
right now to address that issue that are driving the 
demographics on fatherless families. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I was interested to see that the 
average second earner in a family, which is normally the 
woman, is bringing in around 30 percent of the family's 
overall budget, which is the tax burden of the average 
American family.  Astounding if you think about it. 

<p>

Anything else that government can do?  Or maybe 
the best thing it could do is stay out. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  Well, the government should 
encourage marriage instead of rewarding promiscuity, which 
it does, and the government should also realize that the 
best department of health, education, and welfare is a two-
parent family, and the best that the government can do is 
encourage that through its policies by giving more power to 
parents over their children and over their families; by 
giving more tax breaks to families, and is something that it 
doesn't do. 

<p>

And in the name of compassion, even with a lot of 
government programs, with these programs, especially welfare 
and the Great Society programs, it has done more to 
discourage fathers from being in the home than anything 
else.  What kind of policy would say to you that unless the 
father is able to pay child support, then and only then can 
they have any kind of interaction with that child?  Whether 
that parent can afford to pay child support or not should be 
of least importance if that father wants to spend time with 
that child.  That child needs that father interacting with 
him on a daily basis so he can see that man, because women 
cannot teach boys how to be men.  Only a man can do that. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And, you know, you are never going 
to hear that in the cultural debate today.  I mean, men have 
been reduced to money.  If money comes in from the 
government, therefore, there is no need for men. 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  We have talked to families and we 
have talked to kids, and we have talked to kids who have had 
fathers pay the money but yet they were absent, and the kids 
will tell you later on in life, "That's meaningless to me.
I didn't need the money.  I needed a father."

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Yes.  Can the government do 
anything, Bill, or can the government get out of the way? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  Well, I think that Armstrong is 
right, that there is a need for government policymakers to 
look for ways to strengthen and encourage marriage, and I am 
encouraged by the fact that a number of states are currently 
looking at divorce laws and seeking to make reforms that 
would make it difficult, if not impossible, for one spouse 
to unilaterally walk away from a marriage and leave the 
other spouse high and dry without any kind of legal 
recourse. 

<p>

I understand that there are a lot of families that 
have difficult times and are going through struggles and all 
of that, but I think it's important that we take seriously 
those marriage vows and that the state stand behind the 
promises that have been made from one spouse to the other 
and encourage as much as possible some type of 
reconciliation when problems do arise. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What do you find most encouraging in 
the national discussion of fatherhood that is taking place 
right now?  Because there are a lot more articles out there 
now.  Is there any encouraging data for people who are 
saying, you know, we've got fatherlessness as one of the 
greatest pathologies of all time facing our culture?  
Anything encouraging out there that you see? 

<p>


MR. WILLIAMS:  You know, I don't know if you 
realize this, but 80 percent of the time, when a father is 
given visitation rights with his children, he pays his money 
and he is active in the child's life.  Ninety percent of the 
time when he is given visitation rights and they both have 
legal rights to the child, they are active, and many times 
they end up maybe getting back with the mother.  But it has 
made a difference in the child's life and a difference in 
the growth.  So we need to encourage that. 

<p>

The sad thing about it -- and I don't want to 
blame this on liberalism -- we need to admit in this society 
that even though we tried policies, the whole thing to 
uplift mankind, a lot of these policies have done more harm 
than good, and we need to go back and look at these laws, 
and if these laws have not worked, if they have discouraged 
families, we need to change these laws.  We need to have the 
courage to say that we were wrong and to abandon some of 
these ideas and laws of the past.  And no one is willing to 
have the courage to step forward, because when you do, they 
will say you lack compassion.  And so people don't have the 
courage anymore to step up -- we need real men and women in 
society to stand up and say, "Hey, this does not work.  It 
doesn't matter what you call me.  Vilify me now, but the 
children will be the true winners in the future." 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We saw here in Washington, D.C., the 
Million Man March.  We saw here recently Promise Keepers, a 
national men's movement.  Do you think that the growth of 
these men's movements is going to help get men involved?  
Terry? 

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Yes, I do.  I hope, and I have seen, 
and I am sure you have seen and we have all seen some of 
that on a local level around the country, Promise Keepers 
gatherings all across the country.  It is one of those 
movements that has kind of just caught on.  It is beyond the 
expectations of the founders of the organization now, and 
they are scratching where people are itching, and that is 
encouraging to know that men are starting to take their 
responsibility seriously and there is a willingness to 
discuss, Hey, what are my responsibilities as a father?  And 
even those fathers that are committed, they are willing to 
ask, Well, are there greater commitments that maybe I 
haven't really even considered?  And that is helpful. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to go around.  I am 
sorry, we are kind of coming near the end, unless, Bill, you 
want to add one other comment.  What I would like is if you 
all -- we have a couple, just about a minute and a half left 
-- would give the best piece of advice or a great piece of 
advice that your father gave you.  You know, this is our 
Father's Day tribute, so this is an opportunity for you all 
to give a tribute to your father. 

<p>

I could say that the best thing that my dad ever 
said to me is that work is good.  You know, it's not a bad 
thing; it's not a punishment.  Work is good, and so work. 

<p>

Bill, what would you say? 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  I think the thing, the virtue that I 
think stands out most in what I think of my father is 
honesty.  He was incredibly -- I mean, he was an admissions 
officer at a major university and actually told one of my 
sisters, "Don't even bother to apply because I'm not going 
to cut you any special slack, and you don't make the grade." 

<p>

Well, you know, leaving aside whatever you may 
think of that, at the end of the day, he was someone who 
really did things by the book, who really believed in having 
integrity and being honest, and that is something that I 
think we don't see enough of these days. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: We are going to have to go quickly. 

<p>

Armstrong, your dad's best advice? 

<p>

MR. WILLIAMS:  The best advice from my father was 
that God created us all equal, even though sometimes we may 
be treated (un)equally.  No matter what the hue of our skin 
may be, or our gender, we are all the same, and you judge 
people by their hearts, not by what they look like. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Great advice.  Terry, you're quick and last.

<p>

MR. ALLEN:  Well, more than the advice would be 
the example he gave of just being someone who is faithful, 
who has integrity and is consistent across the board with 
everything he did and said. 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you so much, all of you. 

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about 
the plight of America's families.  Please don't go away. 

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

Unfortunately, America's children suffer the loss 
of fathers primarily through divorce, a topic that was 
discussed in a Family Research Council press conference 
highlighting the Annual Family Issues Survey.  Let's hear 
more as we bring you some Homefront News. 

<p>

<p>

[Segment from FRC Family Issues Survey Press 
Conference November 21, 1995, follows:] 

<p>

COL. MAGINNIS:  Divorce.  Well, divorce is 
approaching about 50 percent of all marriages in this 
country, and it is devastating families from coast to coast. 
And we have found that divorce laws in virtually every state 
in this country give more legal right to the person seeking 
the divorce than for the spouse that wants to try to keep 
the family together. 

<p>

Now, when we asked all Americans, we found that 55 
percent of them favor legislation that would reverse this 
situation. 

<p>

Also, in divorce cases that are based on adultery 
or on abuse, we found that three out of four Americans say 
we want to favor the abused spouse by giving the abused 
spouse custody over children.  They want legislation to do 
that. 

<p>

And a majority indicate that they favor giving the 
non-philandering spouse more than half of the couple's 
property and, not surprisingly, as Bill pointed out earlier, 
we found that the divorce reform is particularly strong 
amongst those that are weekly church goers. 

<p>

MR. MATTOX:  I do want to add one little footnote 
to that point that the colonel made about the divorce 
reform, and that is, not only are the religiously devout 
more likely than the average Americans to support such 
measures, divorce reform measures, but, interestingly, those 
in that 20-something generation, the generation X crowd, 
have a higher than average level of support for divorce 
reform measures.  This, I think, is quite likely a 
reflection of the fact that many of them have, themselves, 
experienced some of the negative fallout of their parents' 
divorce and are looking for ways in which to undergird 
marital stability.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the 
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are bringing you an issue which
touches the life of every mother and father.  Parental
rights have slowly diminished in our schools and our
culture, sometimes through the growth of the social worker 
state, sometimes through the courts.  Little by little, 
these rights have been placed in the hands of teachers, 
social workers, judges, and bureaucrats.  The politically 
correct mentality seems to find parents guilty until proven 
innocent.

<p>

We will show you exclusive clips from Congressman 
Steve Largent's staff briefing regarding the Parental Rights 
and Responsibilities Act.  You will hear the shocking story 
of a father of an 11-year-old girl who underwent a genital 
exam at her school without the consent or prior notification 
of her parents.

<p>

To help us understand why parents are fighting for 
their inherent rights to lovingly guide their own children, 
I had the opportunity to talk to representatives from 
several state policy councils who are increasingly hearing 
parents' cries for help. Let's take a look.

<p>

I am joined first -- let me go around, ladies 
first -- by Linda Dealy, who is on the board of directors of 
Capital Resource Institute in California; and then Joe 
Clark, who is executive director of the Illinois Family 
Institute.  We go to Steve Knudsen, who is director of state 
and local affairs for the Family Research Council and 
recently joined Family Research Council after heading a 
Texas FPC.

<p>

To my right, we have John Paulton of the South 
Dakota Family Policy Council; then Bill Brooks of the North 
Carolina Family Policy Council; and finally, last but not 
least, Paul Sienna of the Family Policy Center in Missouri.
A wonderful state, I vacation there often.

<p>

But Steve, let's go to you first.  You were at the 
local level, taking a look at parents' issues.  Now you are 
in Washington, D.C.  There are a lot of things that you 
could choose to have on your plate, but we are looking at 
parental rights and responsibilities.  Why?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Well, it is interesting, Kristi.
Our first lady has talked a lot about it takes a village, 
and I happen to think that is taking an African proverb 
somewhat out of context.  I think what that proverb is 
trying to say was that a village should support a parent as 
it raises its child.  What she is suggesting is that the 
village should raise the child.  So we have a situation here 
where governmental entities across our country are trying to 
take more and more of the child-raising responsibilities 
away from parents.  So we really need to find a way to alter 
that and actually stem the tide.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  This week, on Sunday as a matter of 
fact, the Democratic leadership introduced its family plan, 
and what is always interesting -- I mean, we are not having 
a partisan discussion here -- but so many Democratic family 
plans involve them saying this is what I am going to do for 
your family or maybe to your family, while a lot of 
Republican approaches have been this is how we are going to 
empower parents.

<p>

The Family Rights and Responsibilities Act for 
some people is difficult to understand, but how would you 
all describe it, and in particular, how do you describe it 
to the people you are talking to?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  When we talk about this particular 
issue in California, the thing that I really try to bring 
home every time is that it is called the Family Rights and 
Responsibility Act because rights and responsibilities go 
hand in hand.  When you have a responsibility for something, 
you should also have the right to fulfill that 
responsibility.  When you have a right to something, every 
right carries with it a certain amount of responsibility, 
and that is exactly where parents need to be and should be 
and should be free to be is the ones that are directly 
responsible for the oversight and raising of their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Where in your states have you seen 
the line crossed?  You know, if we are saying in the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act that parents are 
being encroached, you know, their territory is being seized, 
where are we seeing it seized?

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, we have seen it in North 
Carolina in recent years just through giving social services 
more authority.  One of the things, of course, that goes 
along with the parental responsibility is the necessity to 
exercise that responsibility, and where we see that not 
exercised in society, there is always the tendency to step 
in and say, well, what can be done, and if you are the 
government, if you have a mindset that this is the 
government's problem, then the cure is going to be 
governmental, and we do not always think, particularly when 
it comes to basic rights of parents and children, that that 
is the appropriate response.

<p>

We have seen situations where social services has 
the ability to drive by a neighborhood and basically make a 
decision on a child being in an inappropriate situation and 
then taking action to do something about that.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So you are saying they would, like, 
drive through a neighborhood and say this home looks 
inappropriate; perhaps we should check further?

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Well, or you may have a situation 
where a neighbor calls up and says, well, I saw Mr. Wood 
spank his child in the front yard, and all of a sudden 
social services shows up, takes the child into protective 
custody until they investigate the situation.  So the parent 
automatically is put on the defensive, instead of the 
presumption being that the parent was exercising what was in 
the best right of the child.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Kristi, before we go any further, I 
would like to draw a distinction between the Parental Rights 
Amendment movement, which is underway in about 28 or 29 
states right now, as well as the federal legislation, which 
is different, and that is underway here, sponsored by Steve 
Largent.

<p>

As you look at the state initiative, so far it has 
not passed in any state.  It is very difficult to pass 
amendments through general assemblies at the state level, 
and probably Colorado is further along than anyone at this 
point.  They have an initiative underway there by the voters 
of that state.  In Illinois this year, we got it through the 
executive committee of the senate, and the night before 
there was to be a vote by our full senate, in talking with 
the senate leadership decided not to call it for a vote, 
because it was very iffy, very problematic, as to whether or 
not we had that vote.

<p>

But the major distinction here that I want to make 
is that each state has slightly different language.  For 
example, ours read that the fundamental right of parents to 
direct the upbringing and education of their children shall 
not be infringed. Colorado's is different.  What is going 
on in other states is a little bit different, as well, and I 
assume we will come back and talk about the language to the 
federal legislation.

<p>

But as you look at the examples that have brought 
about the need for this, ours tend to be much more in 
education, and we have time after time seen situations 
similar to what Bill mentioned, except where educators have 
intervened in families, and probably one of the more 
flagrant ones that I recall was actually given as testimony 
at one of the hearings that was held by our legislators in 
Springfield was the Milar[?] family down in Champaign.  This 
was a family that was abiding by state law which says you 
can opt out of objectionable sex education programs.  The 
regional superintendent and the principal for that area, for 
that school, had decided to test this apparently, and so 
they refused to let them opt out.

<p>

We had to get the Rutherford Institute and some 
pro bono attorney work done, and we finally got it to the 
attorneys at the State Board of Education, and all of a 
sudden they said, okay, we will let you opt out.  So about 
four families immediately opted out of that program.

<p>

So there is a very aggressive thought process, 
very intentional process going on in the Illinois education 
system to push this, test this parental rights situation.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think sometimes parental rights is 
easier to understand historically.  In Pennsylvania, where I 
am originally from, Amish people worked very hard to have a 
separate school system.  I think we are all aware that 
Christian Scientists often have worked very hard to make 
different medical choices.  But for the rest of us, the 
lines are not always clear.

<p>

Steve, we are going to come back and talk more 
about the state initiatives, but do you see this as going 
away any time soon?  I mean, are we going to resolve it in 
the near future?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  I think this is going to be a battle 
for some time to come as some people try to redefine the 
rights and responsibilities of parents for them and as 
parents fight to maintain the traditional understanding of 
their rights and responsibilities, and like many issues that 
we deal with, there are people who ideologically will push 
this and push this and push this, and as parents who believe 
in our traditional role, it is going to be an ongoing battle 
until the hearts and minds of our country come around to 
understand the time-tested and age-proven responsibilities 
of parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we come back, we are going to 
talk more about what our parents' rights and 
responsibilities are.  Please stay with us.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  But I will tell you that I believe 
that the long-term effect of what is taking place in our 
country -- I would describe it as opposed to being a tragic 
incident that causes Congress to act in a knee-jerk fashion, 
that in fact this is more of a slow erosion of parents'
authority and their ability to direct the upbringing of 
their children that has taken place over the last 10, 20 
years, and it has become increasingly more common across the 
country, where we are now seeing cases from literally every 
state in the country where a parent's ability to raise their 
children continues to be undermined time and time again.  So 
that is why I think that we have had more difficulty in 
getting Congress to move on the Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act, although I will tell you that we have a 
good deal of momentum, and it is due largely to the 
tremendous support that we have gotten from the grassroots, 
from parents, from moms and dads all across the country that 
have been affected and are very concerned, in fact, worried, 
in fact I would even go so far as to say scared as to losing 
their ability to raise their own children and make decisions 
in directing their children's upbringing.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from
the Family Research Council</i>. I am joined by leaders at the 
state level who have been working on the Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act and some state-based parents' rights 
issues.

<p>

Paul, before the break, we were talking about what 
are our rights and responsibilities, and you had some 
legislation in your state where that is being defined for 
us.  What is happening on that?

<p>

MR. SIENNA:  Well, actually it is the Missouri 
state Goals 2000 plan, and I think the primary issue here is 
whose children are these?  The plan itself explicitly states 
that the community takes ownership of and responsibility for 
our children, and it further goes on to state that the 
teachers know best about the health and well-being of the 
children.  In fact, this academic plan contains more 
information about the health and human services of the child 
than what it does about the academic performance and 
assessment.  So this is one of the fundamental things we 
have to ask ourselves and our government:  whose children 
are they?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the government seems to have an 
answer.  You know, Steve, you wrote recently on an incident 
in East Stroudsberg, Pennsylvania, actually a town I have 
been to many times, and it is hard to believe in a small 
community like that of several thousand this could happen, 
but what happened there in terms of the state determining 
what is best for children's health?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN: Well, several years ago in a couple 
of different instances, the state mandated that there would 
be a medical test of children within the school systems at 
the first grade, sixth grade, and eleventh grade, and in 
this particular incident, several sixth grade girls were 
taken for their medical exam to be performed by a doctor 
that the school district brought in, and what happened was 
that the doctor decided that she needed to do not only just 
the overall exam but also genital exams on the girls.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And they were how old?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  This was sixth grade.  So they were 
12-year-old girls.  When the girls said no, they did not 
want to go through with that, they were still forced to.  
One tried to get out through a window.  One tried to call 
her parents.  They would not let her call her parents.  This 
was something that had not been told to the parents ahead of 
time.  I mean, the parents knew of the medical exam, but it 
was, again, one of those opt-out scenarios.

<p>

So if the note gets lost or if somehow the parent 
does not come back with the opt-out, the kids are 
automatically included.  There was no mention of a genital 
exam being performed.  In fact, the school district admitted 
afterwards that they did not know one was going to be 
performed, but they have come out now and said that they 
were within their right to perform it and so on and so 
forth.

<p>

But the bottom line is that you have 12-year-old 
girls who are being subjected to something that the parents 
had no clue was going to happen of an incredibly intimate 
nature.  Several of the girls have talked about nightmares 
since then, and different things that are going on, because 
they felt violated.  The fact that the school district has 
come out in support of the doctor, has not admitted a 
mistake, because their lawyers think they are going to be 
taken to court, you know, all those things.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  And here is the whole thing.  Who best 
cares for the well-being of these children?  Who has those 
children's best interest at heart?  You take 12-year-old 
girls who have been traumatized, literally, for the rest of 
the lives, that the schoolteachers and the doctor are going 
to go off on their merry way after these children are gone, 
but the parents are going to have to deal with and help in 
not only the healing process but the adjustment process for 
these girls for the rest of their lives on this, and this is 
something that not only did not the school not have any 
right by any rational reasoning concept to have been 
involved in this way with the children, but then for the 
legal community to side against the parents, the parents are 
left standing all by themselves.  It really does beg to the 
heart of the question of who cares the most for those 
children? Who has those children's long-term best interests 
at heart?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  John, what are you seeing?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, that is a major example, the 
East Strasbourg situation, but I think daily there are 
examples of the more common variety.  Just at the end of 
this last school year, I had a parent call me and say that 
she was upset because her daughter, her fourth grade 
daughter, was going to be going to a science fair in the 
middle part of the state, several hundred miles, staying 
overnight in a hotel, unsupervised, and she did not feel 
comfortable with that.  Understandably, she wanted to go 
along.  She wanted to take her daughter.

<p>

The school district said no.  If the daughter is 
going to go, she has to go on the bus with the other 
students; you cannot go.  There were a number of parents 
that were very upset about that, and they had to go through 
a process of several meetings, letters.  Eventually they did 
get that right back, but again, you just have to ask the 
question:  whose kids are these?

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Let me hasten to add that it varies 
very much by school district and by even school building, 
and to say that all schools are doing this is erroneous.  In 
fact, there are many teachers and some administrators that 
are very concerned about this thing that is taking place.  
So what it comes back to is each parent, each family, has to 
monitor what is going on at their school with their teachers 
and their children, because you cannot know for sure unless 
you have done the homework that you need to do as a parent.

<p>

MR. DEALY:  Which is a really good point, John, 
that yes, these are the extreme examples that we can cite 
here, but in light of that, the legal groundwork has been 
laid that this could happen anywhere, and they would be 
protected.  That is why we go back to why this legislation 
is necessary.  It is to reassert and establish once and for 
all that it is parents who have the ultimate rights and 
authority and responsibility for the rearing of their 
children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  I think that might be the consensus 
around this table, but I am reminded of a case out of 
Washington State where parents -- a child, an 8-year-old boy 
who was shy was given counseling by the school without 
parental knowledge or consent.  When the boy started acting 
strangely and they took him to their own counselor and were 
told this boy has obviously been treated, what happened to 
him, they tried to get those medical records and lost a 
court case, to see the records for their own son, from the 
counseling that they did not choose and still have no first-hand 
knowledge of.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  I think the issue here, too, gets 
back to we are hearing so much the mantra of the day is it 
takes a village, and it is okay if the village has the same 
values, but unfortunately the village that many times is 
spoken of is contrary to the values that we hold dearly as 
parents.  We are seeing situations in Missouri where kids 
who are struggling with same-sex identity issues are sent to 
a counselor who happens to be a homosexual, and that is like 
sending a drunk to another drunk for counseling.  I mean, it 
just does not seem to work out that way.

<p>

One of the things that just still concerns me 
greatly, as I have three children, in order for them to take 
an aspirin at school, I have to send a permission slip.  But 
in some of the same schools, kids can go off-campus, receive 
abortion counseling and abortions without the parental 
consent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: And let's remember, this is a 
surgery.  You know, abortion is a surgery.  They will not 
give you an aspirin, but they will take your child 
anonymously for surgery without telling anyone.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  Right.  Life-threatening in many cases.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Exactly.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  And then at the same time, we will go 
back to it, you cannot get your ears pierced as a minor.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is right.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  Without parental written consent, but 
not only can you be -- some of these schools will arrange 
for abortions for these young girls, but then they will also 
arrange for -- in California -- for the state welfare agency 
to pick up the cost and arrange for those medical records to 
be sealed so that the parents, even if the parents found out 
and wanted to get the medical records again, they would be 
sealed from the parents to be able to have that information.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are going to have to talk more 
about what parents are facing and struggling with across 
America.  Please stay with us for more <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Videotape segment of Paul Tucker's staff briefing follows.]

<p>

MR. TUCKER:  We sent our child to school one day, 
with all the expectations that she is going to be going to 
school and there will be no problem, and she was informed 
that she had to go down for a physical examination.  She 
thought, no problem, because my daughter does go to camp 
every summer.  We do have physicals every summer for our 
children, and we do have the paperwork filled out, and we 
hand that in.

<p>

My daughter decided to leave class early to go 
down to the office to explain to these nurses that she had 
the paperwork filled out, that she really did not need a 
physical.  When she informed the nurses that she had done 
so, the nurse said "we have lost your paperwork; you have to 
have the physical."

<p>

My daughter said "but I already had one." They 
said, "well, it is too bad.  You have to have one anyway."
She said, "well, let me call my mother." They said no. "It 
does not matter what your parents think, you are going to 
have this physical anyway.  It would not matter what your 
mom said." Susie said, "I do not want a physical.  I don't
want that." They had heard some rumors that there was a 
genital part of this exam, and my daughter did not want to 
have this happen to her.

<p>

They said, "it's too bad, you have to have the 
exam," and my daughter, being a real nice girl -- I mean, 
just think of your daughter.  You teach them to respect 
teachers.  You teach them to respect elders, and there are 
certain things that have to be done in life that are not 
pleasant and stuff, but this really was not one of them that 
had to be done, especially at school, and Susie knew that 
she was not of age -- she is only 11 years old -- was not of 
age to have this type of genital exam.  The girls that were 
coming out prior to this were crying and real upset.

<p>

My daughter obeyed, under the pressures of the 
school, under the pressures of people she is supposed to 
respect, and went along with this exam.

<p>

The girls were asked in a room to strip down into 
their panties and their bras and stand there with no 
covering on whatsoever, and a lot of the girls were really 
upset at this point.  They were escorted into a room one at 
a time where the female nurse and a female pediatrician was 
to examine them.  This pediatrician, we have no idea, I have 
never met her, I have never heard of her, and I do not know 
who gave the right to do this type of examination on my 
daughter.  I certainly did not.

<p>

I turned my child over to the school.  The nurses 
were in charge of my daughter at this time.  The nurses 
should have taken responsibility and stopped at that.  My 
daughter went through a gynecological exam really against 
her will, against my will, my wife's will, without our 
knowledge whatsoever, and without our written consent.  We 
had no idea this was going to happen.

<p>

We sent our child to school one day to go to 
school.  My child comes home with this story that is 
unbelievable.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. I am joined by some real 
experts in parents' rights and state-based issues, some 
grassroots leaders from across America.

<p>

Before we went to the break, we were talking about 
the things that we have seen that often abuse parents'
rights, but you know, on the other side, people would say, 
look, what we are concerned about is that there are children 
being abused, that there are children who are being 
molested, and that parents, if they are not correctly 
monitored, may be actually injuring kids.  You know, who is 
against the Parents' Rights and Responsibilities Act?

<p>

MR. CLARK: As we worked on this Parental Rights 
Amendment to the Illinois State Constitution, one afternoon 
we counted ten lobbyists working the other side of the 
issue, and at least six of them, we believe, were in the 
employ of the National Education Association or the Illinois 
Education Association.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And their interests are a little 
different than children being molested.  They are a bit more 
personal.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  They were.  They were.  In fact, 
several school administrators have come to me privately, 
Christian men all, saying that, you know, we have a concern 
about this, because it will create havoc in our schools, 
which, in fact, it will not, and we come back to that.  But 
the other groups that are leading the opposition, the 
American Civil Liberties Union and a group in Illinois 
called Voices of Illinois Children, which was funded by some 
very liberal foundations, the concern that they voice is 
that this will be the parental abuse amendment, and they say 
that this is another way for protection of parents who 
discipline, spank, or abuse physically and mentally their 
children.  Now the fact of the matter is, abuse and neglect 
are defined through some 20-some-odd pages in the Illinois 
code already, and those laws are not impacted at all, and 
once you start taking people, legislators in particular, 
through that thought process, most of them are attorneys, 
and they understand very quickly that that is absurd.  That 
is not going to take place.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That there already are laws to deal 
with the injury of children, but there is no law to deal 
with parents.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  That is right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do we think that parents are really 
going to abuse their children under cover of this bill?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  No, I do not believe so.  I think 
that, as Joe states, the laws are already written clearly.  
Where the laws are already written, we are safe.  This is 
not going to override protections in those areas that 
already exist.  What it will do is make sure that we are not 
only putting the responsibilities on parents, but we are 
giving them the proper control.

<p>

In South Dakota, we recently passed what we call 
the Grandparents' Bill for minors who have children, 
basically the parents who are the grandparents of the 
youngster that is coming along, they have the responsibility 
to provide.  It is a step in that direction.  But if we are 
putting that responsibility upon them, which I think is 
rightfully so, taking them out of the welfare system, giving 
the parents the responsibility, we ought to also be 
reaffirming their rights to raise and direct the upbringing 
of their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Absolutely.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  The point that I was going to make is 
that the unfortunate reality in the world that we live today 
is there are some parents who have abdicated the proper 
responsibility of raising healthy children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So will this bill keep them from doing that?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  This bill will not keep them from 
doing that, but this bill will -- but that is a legal and 
criminal issue, and this bill in no way affects the criminal 
justice system from going after the appropriate measures 
towards those parents.  What it does is protect the rights 
of the vast majority of the rest of us parents who do have 
the primary goal of raising happy, healthy well-adjusted 
self-reliant children from being intruded upon by that same 
social services or criminal justice system in a wrongful way.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  As a matter fact, the other thing, 
too, in following up what Joe was saying, the opposition to 
a bill such as this, the recent Stand for Children rally 
here in Washington, D.C., if you look at the list of the 
organizations that participated in that rally, it was 
anything but a place for children.  Most of the groups that 
are opposed to this are opposed to the values that made 
America great.  Yes, we need to reaffirm the values of 
parents, and to follow up what Linda said, in other words, 
with responsibility comes accountability.  We at this table 
realize that there is a greater place of accountability than 
our government, but by the same token, we do not want to 
erase the necessary laws that are there that if you have 
abusive parents, to make sure that that is dealt with within 
our society.  That has always been dealt with.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It almost seems like it is more, in 
many ways, drawing a line in the sand between the social 
worker mentality in which parents are guilty until proven 
innocent, you know, that we are assuming parents are abusive 
and are molesting and are injuring, and if we do not get in 
there to help, we are going to have problems with that.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, we had a situation in North 
Carolina where there is a particular program that I will not 
name, but basically the social workers could come into the 
home under basically the -- what they were trying to do was 
to teach parents how to parent, but while they were there, 
they had a checklist, and they would look, and they would 
observe, and there was this long list of things that was 
totally judgmental and subjective, and based on these 
checklists, they then would have the authority to go back in 
and presumably intervene in these situations.  But we have 
seen that, and we see this cropping up in North Carolina in 
little small different ways.

<p>

We have a bill, for example, this past session 
which did not pass but would take away from parents the 
right to control who had access to their children, and it 
was entitled the Grandparents' Rights Act, but it basically 
would give presumption to grandparents to be able to sue 
parents to be able to get visitation rights to children, and 
the whole thing was based on a very few isolated cases 
around the states where unfortunately we had some parents 
that maybe should have given some more rights to the 
grandparents or had better access, but there was one couple 
who said, well, what we are after is the right to have those 
children for 3 weeks unattended in the summer and every 
other weekend by ourselves.  So this was sort of an unusual 
and strange situation that led to some legislation, but you 
just never know where it is going to crop up.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  There is a lot of legislation coming 
out.  Steve, we have to go quickly to the break, but do you 
think if there was -- so many of our examples are school-related. 
Would school choice help wipe out some of this 
need, or is that only a small drop in the bucket here?

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Well, school choice is a vital 
component in my belief, because it says to the parents, we 
are giving you back an opportunity to be the guardian and 
control the upbringing of your child.  It puts 
responsibility back in the parents' courts. So it gives 
them the ball to play with.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  It acknowledges that parents know best 
for their individual children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In particular, for their own school choices.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  They know the best environment in 
which that child is going to learn and flourish, because 
parents know intimately their children as individuals, 
rather than as just names on a roll or numbers in somebody's
book.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  The government has their Social 
Security Number, and they are here to help you.

<p>

When we come back, we are going to talk more about 
parents' rights and responsibilities.

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  Most of the opposition to the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act comes from the 
education bureaucracy.  Just a little interesting fact for 
you to know as to how I view or why I think the opposition 
is there from the education bureaucracy, and that manifests 
itself either through the NEA or the PTA, librarians, those 
are the folks that I guess have been in our office most 
often, is that in 1930 in this country there were 130,000 
individual school boards, school boards that were manned by 
moms and dads making decisions on the local level as to what 
their children were to be taught and how they were to be 
taught it in their schools.

<p>

In 1993, there are now not 130,000 school boards; 
there are 15,000 school boards.  So what has happened is in 
this turf battle for determining who raises our children, 
the education bureaucracy has clearly gained a lot of 
ground.  When you replace 130,000 school boards of moms and 
dads making decisions on the local level and reduce it down 
to 15,000 school boards, the education bureaucracy fills the 
vacuum very, very quickly.

<p>

So when you introduce a bill in Congress like the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act, whose purpose it 
is to strengthen the ability of families, those moms and 
dads, to make decisions for their children, then you are 
going to get resistance from the people that had filled the 
vacuum, which in this case is the education bureaucracy.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>, and we are talking about 
parents' rights and responsibilities, whether or not the 
government recognizes them, respects them.  What kind of 
authority do parents really have?

<p>

I am sitting here with some very leading 
individuals at the state level who have worked on this both 
at their legislative level and now are interested in what is 
happening at the federal level.

<p>

We were talking a little bit earlier about the 
Rights and Responsibilities Act, and you brought up a very 
interesting concern that the people of Illinois have.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  Well, one of the first questions is 
why do we need this kind of legislation at all, and the 
point we try to make is that we are trying to reclaim some 
lost ground.  There are a couple of Supreme Court decisions 
from back in the 1920s, 1923 and 1925, that really lay out 
this concept very clearly, but state courts and some federal 
courts have ignored those as they have made decisions.

<p>

So the idea is to put this amendment at the state 
level forward to start a debate, number one, and get people 
to rethink the role of parents versus the state in who 
should be raising the kids, and then secondly, to give 
parents a whole new standing legally by amending a state 
level constitution.  Nothing happens immediately if an 
amendment is approved.  What has to happen then, as each 
school district and as each court case comes up, the judge 
or the school administrators have to rethink, now, what are 
we doing that might be in conflict with that?

<p>

I like to make the analogy of the Freedom of 
Speech in the Bill of Rights, because nobody tells you what 
that means on a day-to-day basis, yet intuitively over the 
decades we have evolved a body of law that says what that 
is, and by putting this amendment in the state constitution, 
we can see that we will get more consistent decisions out of 
state and federal courts.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  That reclaiming of lost ground that 
Joe talks about, it is kind of like human nature is like 
water.  We pick the course of least resistance.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

And what is happening here is that the government 
comes in and says let us take over.  Let us do more of this.  
We will pick where your kids are educated.  We will pick how 
to teach them sex ed.  I mean, how many parents really 
relish the idea of talking about sex with their teenage 
kids, you know, raise your hand, uh uh.  I mean, it is 
something you do not look forward to, and so the state says, 
hey, we will do that for you, and a lot of parents go, whew, 
man, right on, I'm out of here.  So what we have to do is 
come back and reaffirm the responsibilities that parents 
have, the rights that come along with those, and begin to 
reeducate parents as to their proper role, because what we 
are doing right now is we are taking that path of least 
resistance, and as long as the government continues to offer 
us more services to raise our kids, unfortunately a lot of 
parents are choosing --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  To allow them to do it.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  It is too easy.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  It goes back to this whole notion 
that people are afraid that this Parental Rights and 
Responsibility Act is going to redefine what it means to be 
a parent, and in fact, it is not going to redefine what it 
means to be a parent, because that definition has never 
really changed.  Our culture has tried to change the 
definition, but we need to go back to the original 
definition of what it is to be a parent, and that is to take 
the responsibility for our own children.

<p>

I grew up in a small town where everyone knew 
everyone, and if I was in trouble, before I got home my 
mother knew that I was in trouble, because everyone knew who 
Beverly and Charlie's kids were.  As a matter of fact, I 
accused my mother of working for the CIA, and as I got 
older, I found out that she did not work for the CIA; in 
fact, they worked for her.  She was the boss.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

But we need to get back to that original 
definition and the responsibilities associated with being a 
parent, and I think that is what this act tries to do is to 
bring that back.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  Paul touched on something, I think, 
that is crucial to the debate, and that is the sense of 
community.  The key thing that he said was that when he was 
in trouble and someone saw him, who did they call?  They did 
not call social services.  They called his parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right.

<p>

MR. KNUDSEN:  They went to the authority, and they 
called the parents, and they said here is what is going on.  
I think we need to refoster that.  We have lost the sense of 
aunts and uncles, because we move a lot.  Someone said the 
other day garage door openers were the worst thing that 
could happen to a community, because we open the door as we 
are driving in and we close it before we get out of our car.  
We no longer wave to the people that live to one side -- we 
do not even know the people that live to one side or the 
other of us.  So we need to get back to understanding that 
sense of community, to understand that the parent has the 
authority over the kids, and that we do not call social 
services, we call the parent.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  When we come back, we are going to 
hear more about the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act 
and from the state leaders who are helping make it happen.
Stay tuned.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Welcome back to more <i>Straight Talk 
from the Family Research Council</i>. We are talking about 
parental rights and responsibilities and are we having some 
of both or neither.  Frankly, this particular issue is part 
and parcel of a lot of momentum.

<p>

What are you seeing on that?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, yes, I think what we have been 
talking about here really reminds us that this bill, this 
whole parental rights movement, goes to the heart of the 
conservative movement as a whole.  That is, less government, 
more individual responsibility.  When I come back to 
Washington from South Dakota, walk around and see the 
buildings, row upon row of government buildings, I am just 
reminded of all of the work that politicians have done to 
try to solve our problems, and they have just created more.  
We need to turn more authority back to the local level, and 
the most local level of all is parents.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Why do you think that is, though, 
because clearly the government says the family is 
dysfunctional -- you know, that is such a yuppie word -- and 
the government needs to step in.  Why do you think some of 
this has kind of created problems?

<p>

MR. PAULTON:  Well, I believe it actually has been 
kind of a self-perpetuating cycle.  The government sees a 
problem and maybe has a legitimate concern about it, perhaps 
oversteps their boundaries a bit, and you know, the welfare 
examples would be classic in that sense that problems are 
addressed, perhaps even with good intentions, and yet the 
result is people turn to government even more, rely on 
government even more.  We need to at least make that 
reminder, put that reminder out there, that individual 
responsibility, parental responsibility, is ultimate.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  You just said a key phrase:
individual responsibility.  I look at my generation and what 
was going on in the 1960s, 1970s, and 1980s and how many 
people made individual choices to do what is right for me as 
a person and not for the larger community or for the family, 
and one of the best responses I have heard to that "It Takes 
a Whole Village" was coined by my predecessor in this job, 
Penny Poulin[?] back in Illinois who said it takes a whole 
family, and when you understand that and you take on the 
responsibility as an individual for your role in that 
family, then a lot of these problems go away.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA: But you know, Steve brought up a 
good point earlier about the whole idea of taking the path 
of least resistance, but many times our government has 
created this situation that causes the parents to take that 
path of least resistance.  I know Linda talked about the 
necessity in many homes where it is no longer a choice for 
there to be two parents working, and so you begin to see now 
that --

<p>

MS. DEALY:  If we were not taxed at the level we 
are, there would not be a need for many mothers to be -- 

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  So the need for daycare early and 
often comes up, and the whole idea now you find parents who 
are looking for not only that before care and after care, 
but they are also becoming proponents of year-round 
schooling, because, hey, that is a lot more convenient.  The 
thing that concerns me most about that -- we have heard the 
examples given here -- is that the school has been the 
vehicle by which parental rights have been taken away the 
most.  So we need to really -- and someone talked about it 
earlier, the individual responsibility and accountability 
that comes with us as parents to be informed.

<p>

Joe, you touched on that, for people to go back 
and to know what has gone on in their local school district.  
The best way to change this is not Washington, D.C. down, 
even though this is important.  But the best way to change 
it is for people to go to their local school district where 
they know the school board members' names, the 
superintendent's name, the principal's name.  I mean, they 
live in that same community with those folks and address it 
there.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Kristi, one of the things that I 
think we forget when we are looking at public policy, and I 
am an economist, so I tend to focus in this direction more 
than maybe some others, is the old adage, follow the money.  
One of the things that we have touched on is that these 
institutions have been built by government and by 
politicians over the last 30 or 40 years, and they are 
large, and they are powerful, and they get billions of 
dollars a year, a lot of which they use back to lobby to 
keep those funds.  So as powerful organizations, they have a 
vested self-interest to protect, and we see a lot of these 
proposals coming from these organizations, and as you 
pointed out, I believe you said you had 10 people opposing 
you from the education establishment on your parental rights 
bill in Illinois.

<p>

MR. CLARK:  That is the lobbyists, yes.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Now that is an example of the power 
that they can wield.  So we have to look at that, follow the 
money.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  At taxpayer expense, the power that 
they wield against us, with our money.

<p>

MR. BROOKS:  Right, at taxpayer expense.  And we 
have to point that out, and we have to show that what we are 
dealing with is people who are not acting necessarily in our 
best interests or in the best interests of our children, but 
in their best interests, because they are trying to protect 
their jobs, protect their institutions that have been built 
up over the years.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Right.  See, it is interesting when 
you look at it.  The average private school education costs 
about $2,000, $1,500 to $2,000, while the average public 
school education is like $5,000 to $6,000, and as a matter 
of fact, in the District of Columbia where we have metal 
detectors protecting us from ourselves, the average 
education here is around $9,000 per child.  Yet, if you look 
at the numbers at Catholic schools or private schools or 
even the homeschoolers in terms of SAT scores, blowing it 
out of the water.  Why then -- you know, and I ask this of 
you -- why then are we not more in favor of things like 
educational choice, which give power to the parents when we 
see the impact?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  Well, each of us are.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

We here are.  So the question you are asking is 
why is the education establishment not more in favor?

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  But why is society not in favor of 
giving parents authority?

<p>

MS. DEALY:  That just highlights the reality of 
what their interest is.  Their interest is not the quality 
education of the child or the student.  Their interest is in 
the whole larger picture, which is either self-perpetuation, 
protecting their own jobs and advancement, or they have a 
larger sociological agenda, to have an impact on the -- and 
they are all in there together, and I always have to be 
careful when I talk about that, because I do not want to 
discount -- when I am making complaints against education, I 
am talking about the educational bureaucracy and the 
leadership of the teachers' unions and things like that, not 
the individual teachers who too often are so oppressed by 
their own establishment that they are in there being -- 

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, they are the ones that are 
forced to do these things.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  They can be well-intentioned and have 
the best interests of the child but be held in a 
stranglehold to be able to be effective as they would like 
to be as teachers.

<p>

MR. SCIANNA:  It is not quality.  It is the 
control.  As a matter of fact, the whole issue of school 
choice, there have been situations where minorities, once 
they have been informed properly what school choice means, 
an overwhelming majority of minorities are in favor of 
school choice.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Oh, they are more in favor than the 
average population.

<p>

MS. DEALY:  We have a case in Los Angeles.  There 
is a private school that was started by a family in south 
central Los Angeles that there is a waiting list literally 
hundreds of children long to get into this school, because 
they can see the delineation between the education that 
these children are receiving there, and this is a school 
absolutely run on a shoestring, yet the parents are involved 
in the school; the people who are running it are so 
dedicated to making an impact and a positive difference in 
these students' lives, they are tripping over children who 
want to get into this school.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Well, I think it is clear that this 
is a conversation we are going to need to continue, and I 
would like to thank all my guests for being with us.  When 
we come back, we will have more from <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>.

<p>

[Videotape of Representative Steve Largent follows.]

<p>

MR. LARGENT:  If you want to be for children, then 
you need to be for parents, because nobody is for children 
more than their parents are, and that is why we have 
introduced the Parental Rights and Responsibility Act.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Thank you for joining us at <i>Straight 
Talk from the Family Research Council</i>. If you would like to 
receive more information about the Family Research Council, 
tonight's guests, or the crucial issues affecting you and 
your family, please call us at 1-800-225-4008.

<p>

Next week, we will alert parents to a new affront
against America's children as we discuss a recent court case 
which opened the world of pornography to our children over 
the Internet.  Are we losing the battle to protect our 
children from pornography in cyberspace?  We will find out 
when we bring you more <i>Straight Talk from the Family 
Research Council</i>. Thanks for watching.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome to <i>Straight Talk from the
Family Research Council</i>. I am your host, Kristi Hamrick.
Tonight on <i>Straight Talk</i> we are discussing one of the latest
in technological advancements, the Internet.  You have
probably heard about your home computer as a link to all the
information in the world's databases, but we will be taking
a look at how cyberspace allows pornography to enter your
home and reach your children through just a few strikes on
the keyboard.

<p>

Pro-family groups found some solace in the 
Communications Decency Act which made it more difficult for 
children to come across indecent material in cyberspace.
Yet, just a few weeks ago, a Pennsylvania federal court
blocked enforcement of that law, saying that it limits First 
Amendment protection of the Net.

<p>

Tonight, we will be talking to those who work 
closely with this case and continue to do battle for your 
children.

<p>

But first, let's get the inside scoop on Capitol 
Hill.  Marty Dannenfelser runs the Family Research Council's
Government Relations shop after years on the Hill.  He works 
daily with congressmen and senators, staying up to the 
minute on the issues affecting your family.  We will hear 
about the key issues that the House and the Senate are 
attempting to highlight and to avoid as we near the election 
and as we take you Behind the Headlines.

<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/net/headlns.gif" alt="Behind the Headlines">
</center>
<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Marty, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.  You have worked on 
the Hill for a lot of years and had a chance to see a lot of 
Congress sessions come to a close, and in particular to see 
the session transition into an election, most particularly a 
Presidential election.

<p>

What does that mean about the importance of the 
issues at play now, given that the session is ending, but we 
are going into a Presidential election?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Well, it makes the whole 
dynamic very politically charged, and there is a lot of 
activity that takes place that seems to advance the agenda 
of either candidate by the members of the party of that 
candidate, and it is producing quite a conflict from issues 
like health care and welfare and the whole spending process, 
the appropriations process.  All of this, I think, really is 
being worked out against the backdrop of the impending 
Presidential election.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In a Presidential election cycle, it 
seems that some of the issues are brought up more 
philosophically, just to argue about the issues that either 
candidate cares about, rather than really substantively.
Are these issues at play really significant?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  There is some of that. You 
certainly see that in this whole debate about whether or not 
we are going to have medical savings accounts in the health 
care bill and whether or not we are going to link welfare 
reform and Medicaid reform and so on.  So much of that is 
tied to the arguments that the various candidates have made.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What issues are still at play that affect families?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, one of the big issues 
that is still at play is the Defense of Marriage Act, and 
people may be aware of the situation in Hawaii where the 
Hawaiian courts are expected to mandate that the state has 
to recognize same sex marriages as legitimate marriages, and 
under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. 
Constitution, the other states, all 49 of them, may have to 
recognize those marriages.

<p>

So Congress has a bill to protect states who 
choose not to recognize those marriages and also defines 
marriage as a legal union between a man and a woman for 
federal purposes for the impact that would have on federal 
benefits and so on.  So that is a very important thing.  The 
President has said that he would sign the bill.

<p>

We now have a situation where Senator Ted Kennedy 
is trying to introduce another issue into the mix, what is 
called the Employment Nondiscrimination Act, and he has 
indicated that he will try to attach that to the Defense of 
Marriage Act, which could muddy the waters, and our hope is 
that those two issues would be kept separate and that we 
will get that bill, the Defense of Marriage Act, passed this 
year.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bill Clinton, as we know, has been 
very pro-homosexual in the agenda that he has embraced, and 
yet he came forward in favor of the Defense of Marriage, as 
did Bob Dole.  It would have seemed like the right thing to 
do would have been to force the Defense of Marriage Act 
through quickly and have them put their electoral votes 
where their mouth is.  Why didn't that happen?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  It has been partly complicated 
by the legislative schedule.  There is a desire in the House 
to move the appropriation bills.  They have to pass 13 
appropriation bills, and they had hoped to get most of them 
done before this July 4 recess, and I think they have about 
seven or eight of them done.  So that has been pushed off.
So we do hope to see some movement on the bill in the month 
of July.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Is there a lot of sentiment in 
support of the Defense of Marriage Act?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  We sense that it is very 
strongly supported by people across the board.  There is 
some activity by the Human Rights Campaign Fund and some 
other pro-homosexual groups to try to derail it and try to 
suggest that it is political, but it is very necessary, 
because we do feel that this court decision in Hawaii could 
come down as early as September, and in the absence of this 
bill, we could see all kinds of executive action by the 
administration to start implementing this and forcing the 
states to recognize these marriages and forcing federal 
programs to pay benefits to the so-called spouses of these 
individuals.  So it is very important that this legislation 
be enacted before Congress leaves town.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Another of the issues at play has 
been the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act which was to deal 
with a very limited late term abortion procedure that we 
know from the doctor that invented has been used against 
healthy viable children 7, 8, and 9 months of gestation.
When it first went through, it went through by wide margins, 
and Bill Clinton vetoed it.  There has been talk about 
bringing it back, possibly for a veto override before the 
end of the summer.  Is this a possibility?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes, the timing is not nailed 
in concrete just now, but we do expect possibly by the end 
of the summer that that will come up, and there are efforts 
to educate the public, because there is a need to turn 
around some votes in the Senate and also to hold onto those 
votes in the House.

<p>

There were two-thirds margins in the House in the 
two votes that they have taken on this legislation, but 
there will be a lot of pressure, particularly on Democratic 
members, to defend the President and to argue that his 
position regarding this health exception, which we would 
argue would make it abortion on demand, that those type of 
issues are already accounted for in the bill to protect the 
life of the mother when her life is threatened by some 
serious health complication.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: There have been some recent 
developments on the partial birth abortion ban sentiment 
come up in the military, and something very unusual has 
happened. Could you tell us a little bit more about that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: Yes, a directive went out from 
the Pentagon to the military chaplains, telling them that 
they could not participate in the distribution of postcards 
that have been prepared by the Catholic bishops, and there 
is going to be a massive distribution of these postcards at 
Catholic churches throughout the country this weekend, and 
they have been told that in the military churches that they 
cannot distribute these postcards because they suggest that 
this is political, and it is interesting that the people who 
are the top decision makers at the Pentagon are, in fact, 
political appointees.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: They are appointed by the President.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: They are ultimately appointed 
by the President.  So that raises some real questions.  The 
whole idea of separation of church and state is interesting 
in this discussion, too, because the ACLU and many liberal 
activists are constantly invoking this mantra about church 
and state.

<p>

What the founding fathers meant in that area was 
that the state should stay out of religion, and this seems 
to be a classic example of the state interfering in 
religious expression and in free speech expression, as well.
So we are very disturbed about this action and really feel 
that it has the appearance of being politically motivated 
when, in fact, the postcard campaign is really geared 
towards protecting innocent life, and churches often speak 
out on public policy issues, and to try to gag them in this 
particular case is really a very troubling action.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: At the grassroots level, there is a 
lot of support for the Defense of Marriage Act and the 
Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act, and another issue that has 
brought a lot of attention by average Americans has been the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act.  What is the 
status on that?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Well, that has had hearings in 
both the House and Senate and has a good number -- I think 
over 160 co-sponsors in the House.  There is quite a 
coalition amassed against it, largely teachers unions, child 
welfare advocates, and the like.  We believe that they see 
this as really threatening their agenda and their control 
over the agenda, and they argue that this is somehow going 
to protect parents who would abuse their children when, in 
fact, the legislation has specific language in it to make 
clear that it does not provide any protection for child 
abusers.

<p>

The education lobby, the National Education 
Association and some of the other school boards and parent 
teacher groups, are arguing that this could somehow disrupt 
the day-to-day activities in the classroom, but we feel that 
is a red herring, that the National Education Association 
and others have had a history of usurping parents rights, 
and they want to continue business as usual.

<p>

So this is the type of issue where there is a good 
deal of public support, very strong support, for the 
principle that parents' rights should take precedence over 
the state.  Now certainly there are instances where parents 
neglect their responsibilities, and then someone has to step 
in on behalf of the children, but in those cases where 
parents are exercising their responsibility, the state 
should not be interfering with the day-to-day guidance that 
parents are trying to give their children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: In an election year, one of the 
topics that every politician wants to discuss is tax relief, 
and of course, they are always for that.  Yet, despite a lot 
of support, the $500 per child tax credit has not happened.  
Is that going to come up again before the election?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  It may come up in some form.
Of course, it has already passed the Congress and has been 
vetoed by the President.  There has been some discussion of 
linking it with welfare and Medicaid reform, although that 
is starting to look less likely.  They might just do welfare 
by itself or Medicaid by itself.

<p>

Our concern is if they do not put it in a package 
that they are not going to have the savings in terms of how 
they calculate the budget numbers to get the $500 per child 
tax credit done, but there is still talk about them perhaps 
doing it as a freestanding bill, but the President has this 
situation where he does not like the Medicaid reform, and he 
would argue, I think, that if they do not get both of them 
done, well, we do not have the savings.  So I think it is 
something of a Catch-22 situation that is in front of us on 
that unfortunately.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  In all the issues that the grassroots has really been 
tracking, how would you order them for their importance in this cycle?

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER: I think the partial birth 
abortion issue really shows people how far we have come in 
the extreme abortion policy in this country.  I think many 
people have had the impression -- and some of the polls bear 
this out -- that abortion is only legal in the early stages 
of pregnancy for hard case situations, when in fact it is 
allowed virtually at any time for any reason, and to see a 
child going through the birth process, to be four-fifths of 
the way born and then stabbed in the back of the head and 
killed, that shocks people.

<p>

They had no idea that that was going on in this 
country and that that is the nature of the abortion license 
in this country that it has become that extreme.  So I think 
it is very important for people to realize how far this has 
gone, and I think that will shake them up and start to focus 
on what are we going to do about this type of policy.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Marty, thank you so much for being 
with us today on Behind the Headlines.

<p>

MR. DANNENFELSER:  Glad to be here.  Thank you.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Following this commercial break, 
<i>Straight Talk</i> begins our discussion of cyberporn.  How can 
we battle the lucrative pornography industry?  Stay tuned to 
hear how our guests answer that crucial question.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  In February, the Telecommunications 
Act of 1996 was signed into law by President Clinton.  Part 
of that act included the Communications Decency Act, which 
is simply a law that says adults have no right to knowingly 
give pornography to children over computer systems.  Well, 
the ACLU and other groups immediately filed a lawsuit saying 
that this is going to ruin our cherished freedom of free 
speech, and we have this drama played out in a federal court 
in Philadelphia.

<p>

The Supreme Court has said that we do not have to 
have that, that pornography is not a measure of our freedom.  
Rather, it is a sort of low-level type of speech that we 
need to tolerate at some levels, but certainly we do not 
need to have our children tolerate it.  Every time a new 
technology develops, first of all, pornographers rush in and 
exploit that technology, sometimes drive it, and then, 
secondly, the porn defenders come in and say, well, 
pornography law cannot apply in this technology certainly.  
Videos are different than magazines, and certainly 
pornography laws should not apply to videos.  That is what 
we heard in the early 1980s.

<p>

Well, that argument failed, and we have seen that 
with television, telephone, cable, and now we are seeing it 
with the computer and with the Internet.  So I believe that 
the challenges that are going on across the country are just 
the same challenges we have always seen and that our side 
will be successful.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Although success seems thwarted due 
to some Pennsylvania judges, our guests tonight continue 
their fight.  I would like to introduce Colby May, who is 
senior counsel in the Office of Governmental Affairs for the 
American Center for Law and Justice.  I would also like to 
welcome Bruce Taylor, who is president and chief counsel of 
the National Law Center for Children and Families.  Also 
with us is Cathy Cleaver, who is Director of Legal Studies 
for the Family Research Council and a frequent guest.
Welcome to all of you.

<p>

Let me start with a question that we asked right 
at the bump.  What can people do to protect their children 
from pornography on the Internet, given some of the recent 
court rulings?  Is there any help from government, or is it 
going to be kind of a go fish world where you have to get 
your own kind of technology?

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, at this point in time, it is kind 
of a go fish world.  I think this court relied very much on 
the idea that there were computer programs, software 
programs, available to protect or empower parents, and based 
upon that, they believe that that is the appropriate remedy, 
at least at this level.  Now, of course, I think you will 
find everybody here today probably disagrees with that and 
believes that certainly this ought to be appealed and is 
being appealed and ought to be reversed, but right now it is 
parents go out, get familiar with what programs are 
available, Surf Watch, et cetera, to protect your children, 
because right now the government is not going to step in and 
do that.

<p>

One of the things that they said in the case was 
that if industry had to help protect children from 
pornography that it would be a terrible barrier to overcome 
and an impossible barrier to overcome, and Cathy, you were 
writing about that recently.  Is this a barrier, a 
technological barrier, that the industry could not achieve, 
protecting children from pornography?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Not at all.  We know that there is 
simply a lack of will on the part of the industry, not a 
lack of ability, in coming up with ways to screen people, to 
decide whether they are an adult or a child, before you let 
them into a pornographic site.  We think that that will 
become increasingly clear as time passes that there are ways 
to protect consumers in cyberspace, there are new ways to 
protect amateur musicians who want to share their songs but 
not have their copyrights violated.  There ought to be a way 
with all this technology to put barriers up to protect 
children, and we believe there is a way.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  What kind of things would happen?  I 
have heard things like photocopy your driver's license and 
mail it in for some kind of password so that you could prove 
your age.  What kind of barriers could be put up?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Well, the CDA, the law passed by 
Congress, anticipated that the industry could come up with a 
lot of different ways, that even users could come up with 
ways to protect themselves.  The law specifically allows for 
taking credit cards or adult PIN numbers.  But beyond that, 
there are a lot of new technologies being developed like 
digital IDs and smart cards.

<p>

There are protocols being written for the next 
generation of the Internet operating system that could 
include a code that says you are an adult, or I am an A and 
my kid is a C.  So anytime anyone showed up electronically 
at a Web page or at an Internet site, they would 
automatically be known to that site as an adult or a child, 
and pictures that are inappropriate for children could be 
blocked, and adults could get right in.

<p>

So there are a lot of ways that technically they 
could do it with just a tweaking of the program, and that is 
what the CDA gave immunity for the industry to develop, and 
the industry said we want to be good Samaritans; give us the 
immunity to help parents and help children, and Congress 
gave it to them.

<p>

Now they are challenging the law because they say 
they do not want to go through that extra -- although we 
think the industry is going to fight among themselves to 
come up with certain kinds of technological abilities to 
comply with this, so whether the industry likes it or not, 
somebody is going to develop a way to comply with the CDA, 
and when they do, they are going to get rich, and that is 
going to be the incentive to do it, whether America Online 
or Prodigy and CompuServe like it or not, and it is going to 
be easy to comply with the CDA, and then I think the courts 
will like the law.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  The important thing right now, 
though, is there is nothing in place.  Parents have to fend 
for themselves, and interestingly, shockingly, in 
Philadelphia the leading software blocking system admitted 
in court -- this is Surf Watch -- that they miss 800 
pornographic sites per month.  Those are 800 adult 
bookstores on-line that your child can get into without any 
barrier whatsoever, and that is with a protective software 
device.  So parents, we cannot overemphasize how important 
it is for parents to either decide not to let their children 
on this new great technology, which is an awfully high price 
to pay for pornography.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And as you know, Kristi, the whole 
purpose of the lawsuit by the ACLU and the American Library 
Association and some of the big companies was to not have 
any obligations that they would have to fight about free 
speech.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  That is a really good point, because 
they are saying it is too much money.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  It is self-interest.  It is too much 
problem.  But they did offer to the court, they said, you do 
not need to have a law, because we have all these software 
programs.  They offered the court Surf Watch, which they 
just started developing last year.  They dug it out of the 
dustbin.  It did not work when they played it for Congress.
It failed when they tried it in the court in Philadelphia.
It failed in New York.  It is the worst of the programs.
The second generations, we hope, are going to be better. As 
Colby mentioned, these software screening things and the Net 
Nannies and the Cyberpatrol and Rated PG and Library Safe 
and some of the newer generations are much more --

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Much more effective.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Yes, they are going to be more 
effective, but parents are still at the mercy of somebody 
else who has found this pornography or who can block your 
kid, but that does not keep from finding it next door or at 
the school or at the library where they do not put these 
blocks on.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Or at another child's home whose parent is unaware.

<p>

MR. MAY:  And what is interesting is that the 
debate, it seems to me, needs to be on the responsibilities 
that people have that want to use this new technology.  We 
as a society and as a people have no problem in putting 
certain restrictions on in terms of responsibilities when 
you use cable systems, broadcast facilities, when you use 
common carriers through your phone lines and the like, and 
the idea that that same sense of balance and responsibility 
cannot apply by virtue of there being something so unique or 
so mysterious about the cyberworld that we cannot apply 
these same kind of restrictions, I find to be utterly 
unsupportable.

<p>

Frankly, I believe the Supreme Court will 
eventually reverse that and correct what this panel has done 
in Philadelphia, because quite honestly, while we all revere 
and love the First Amendment, we all recognize that as a 
people we care about ordered liberty and we care about 
people being responsible for the freedoms that they are 
given, and right now, for the court to have sort of usurped 
its judgment for the collective judgment of Congress and the 
President on this matter, if I were uninitiated to the 
ambiguities and confusions of the law, which unfortunately I 
am not -- I wish I was more innocent of it -- I would be 
wondering what in heaven's name is this court doing and why 
is it that the people cannot have an interest in protecting 
children that goes beyond the parent being responsible to go 
out and buy the software, become educated about how to apply 
it, how to install it, how to use it, and how to then 
monitor it to make sure your child or his friends have not 
gotten around it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  It is a tough thing.  I think for 
people who are watching, they may not understand it.  What 
we are in essence saying is that we are free to pollute our 
cultural environment, and parents have to buy the gas masks.  
You know, we are not surprised about seat belt laws.  We are 
not surprised that there are scrubbers on a coal mine.  We 
are not surprised that the FDA says, oh, by the way, this 
has a poisonous side effect.  But somehow with something 
like pornography, we say let the buyer beware, and parents 
must stand at armed gates.

<p>

There is a lot of weight been placed on parents 
and on the technology, but this is not going to touch on the 
chat room phenomenon, is it?  There are limits to even the 
best of technology, aren't there?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Absolutely, and a key thing that I 
think people should understand about this recent ruling is 
that what this court has said in Philadelphia is that we are 
not even allowed to enact a law that says adults should not 
send pornography by email directly to a specific child.
That is how radical this decision is.  The court says it is 
unconstitutional to even try to do that.  We are sure the 
Supreme Court is going to overturn that portion of this 
court's ruling.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: To ask you one quick question before 
we go to the break, so things that you could not send the 
child in the mail, you can email?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Correct.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  You can go to jail under any state 
law -- and state laws still apply, too.  I mean, this court 
just struck down parts of a federal statute, but state 
prosecutors can use state harmful to minors laws and state 
obscenity laws, and they should be doing that more often.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  And the Internet is a haven for pedophiles.

<p>

<i>Straight Talk</i> brings you more after this 
commercial break.  Don't go away.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. Tonight we are discussing 
pornography on the Internet, and I am joined by attorneys 
who filed briefs in the most recent cyberporn case out in 
Philadelphia:  Colby May, senior counsel in the Office of 
Governmental Affairs for the American Center for Law and 
Justice, Bruce Taylor, president and chief counsel of the 
National Law Center for Children and Families, and Cathy 
Cleaver, who is director of legal studies for the Family 
Research Council.  Welcome back.

<p>

You all have some impressive titles.  We were 
talking before about the world in which pedophiles now can 
operate on the computer system, and I think that is the 
thing that parents are most concerned about.  I mean, it is 
one thing if you are an adult and you click across something 
and you are offended and you can kill it, but as we were 
saying before, if you are a pedophile, you can email 
pornography to children that you could not mail through what 
email people call snail mail.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  That is correct, and what is equally 
disturbing is that, look, we know that pedophiles 
traditionally stalk kids in playgrounds.  Well, we know that 
computers are the child's playground of the 1990s.  That is 
where children play these days increasingly.  So it is a 
really toxic mix to have these playgrounds be a place where 
children are fair game to pedophiles.  It is very 
disturbing.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And it is hard to catch.  I mean, a 
pedophile sitting in his home in Portland, Oregon can hit on 
200 kids a day all over the country, and he can send nude 
pictures of himself or <i>Hustler</i> centerfold, and this court 
said that should be all right.  But Congress said it was a 
crime.  I think the Supreme Court is going to bring that 
crime back.  But it is a tough problem.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You were saying that as sort of a 
stalking on the Internet, and there are articles coming out 
regularly -- 

<p>

MR. MAY:  There have been articles coming out.
Fortunately portions of the law were upheld, and one of the 
portions was the use of computer networks and the like for 
stalking, and that is illegal under the Communications 
Decency Act, but what you have is the enticements and the 
ticklers that go out.

<p>

So as Bruce mentioned, I can send, as long as I do 
not engage in a dialogue with the minor child, I can send 
out material that would be enticing or otherwise interesting 
which I would then intend to be used in some pedophile ring 
or some other certainly illegal venture, and you now have 
given the pedophile or those that would use it for a very 
destructive person a great tool to do what?  To reach 
literally hundreds of children where before, without this 
electronic medium, they certainly would have no ability to 
do that, and the idea that this court believes that we 
cannot require that adults rein in their own impulses and 
own appetites to the point where when you are speaking to 
children and you know you are speaking to children, that you 
do not have indecent conversations, you do not transmit 
pornographic and indecent materials, frankly I do not think 
it is too much to ask, and I think once the American 
families and the voters understand that, they are going to 
realize -- wait just a moment.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Because it is our children we are talking about.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Absolutely.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: You know, <i>Saturday Night Live</i> had a 
skit, I do not know if you all saw -- unfortunately my 
husband and I are late night people -- of a dirty old man in 
his underwear emailing in chat rooms.  He would pretend he 
was a little girl or a little boy and would lead a 
conversation in a chat room to a sexual way, and he was 
hanging out in kids' chat rooms, and the nature of the skit 
was these children trying to respond to these dirty 
questions not really understanding, you know, how funny it
was what the kids would say back.

<p>

But would that still -- this would seem to be 
still legal, this sort of interjecting sexual themes if you 
are not intending sex to occur.  Would our children not 
still be vulnerable to these chat room conversations?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Our children now are completely 
vulnerable for any adult who wants to try his best to 
offend, to himself find some sort of sexual gratification by 
scaring or offending innocent children.  Right now, our 
hands are tied according to this Philadelphia court.  We 
must allow that to happen.  We have to stand silent.  Our 
laws have to be silent in front of this.

<p>

Recently, there was an article that talked about 
judges being our robed masters.  There is some telling truth 
to that sort of phrase.  These judges are out of touch if 
they think that is unconstitutional.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Some people look at the 
Communications Decency Act, to kind of take the other side 
for a moment, and say, look, if we start regulating speech, 
you know, today it is speech dealing with sex, tomorrow 
maybe it is speech dealing with our basic liberties, 
although it is hard to believe that Patrick Henry would have 
had a <i>Playboy</i> printing press in his basement.  But do you 
see a slippery slope here if we restrain pornography for our 
other speech freedoms?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  That is one of our favorite 
arguments.  Both of us wrote briefs.  Cathy and I wrote a 
brief for FRC, National Law Center, Enough is Enough, the 
National Coalition for Protection of Children and Families.  
Colby wrote a brief with Jim Henderson for ACLJ.  In both of 
our briefs, we laid out for the court the legal decisions of 
the Supreme Court and the FCC where they said indecency 
applies to that kind of pornography that is sexually 
explicit material -- it has to be sex acts or sex organs -- 
that is patently offensive, that is intended to offend.  It 
has no serious value.  You know, it is the kind of stuff 
that is separated from serious literature and art like you 
find in museums or libraries.  It is not AIDS information.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: How is it separated?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  Because of the way the courts have 
interpreted that term indecency.  They say if something is 
in Michelangelo's David or Ulysses or some classic work and 
it is not a sexually exploitive type of picture of sex or 
nudity, then it is not indecent, because indecency is not 
all sex and nudity; it is that patently inoffensive kind 
that is inappropriate for children.

<p>

So the court has already said -- and it reaffirmed 
it again last week in the cable decision -- that indecency 
does not apply to serious speech.  It is not AIDS 
information or medical textbooks.  So when the ACLU says, 
oh, this will ban the Venus de Milo, it is a ridiculous 
argument, because the courts have already taken it away.  
Now this panel of judges in Philadelphia bought all of that 
and almost as if they had never read the court decisions, 
and that is why we are more confident that the Supreme Court 
will reverse that, and even though we say, yeah, there are 
some software programs, and yes, parents can kick their kids 
off the Internet, our answer to that is Congress passed this 
law to make the Internet safe for kids and told adults if 
you want to have your own adult pornography, you can limit 
it to other adults.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  You need to set it up and secure it.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  And we think that we are going to 
keep fighting with more briefs in the Supreme Court and more 
activities in Congress and in the other courts until we get 
a law that is going to give kids an ability to use the 
Internet just as much as adults, and I think we will 
eventually win it.  It might take us a couple of years, but 
I think we are at least committed to fighting that until we 
get it done.

<p>

MR. MAY:  I would just add that the law here that 
we care about -- we love the First Amendment, we revere the 
First Amendment, we are engaged in a lot of First Amendment 
defense.  We certainly have done it in the pro-life context, 
representing protesters and that sort of thing for many, 
many years.

<p>

But this is a terrible problem which this court 
has just closed its eyes to and refused to realize that you 
are not talking about speech that it is protected to all 
citizens all the time, so the First Amendment implications 
are dramatically reduced.  We all the time define out what 
that is.

<p>

Here we mean -- first, let me say that there is no 
speech that is censored or struck that otherwise is, you 
know, black marker going through.  It simply says that it is 
regulated in that context, and they regulate speech all the 
time.

<p>

So here we are saying to the unique and special 
class of children which we as a people, as a society, care 
and understand need to have special needs and interests, we 
are going to require that adults -- what a surprise -- that 
adults act in responsible ways to make sure that when they 
engage in conversations or transmit material that is 
patently offensive and that the subject of which deals with 
sexual and excretory functions, and you do not direct that 
or engage in that kind of conversation with children.

<p>

That does not seem to me at any rate to be a 
particularly astounding or shocking proposition, and I think 
that is why I would respond to say it is not a slippery 
slope, because the nature of the conversations are not those 
that are automatically free willy-nilly protected to anyone 
and everyone.  Now adults can have it, but you cannot have 
it with children.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Just for people to understand, there 
are places where speech is restricted.  I mean, even the 
bill of rights is a balancing of rights.  You cannot vote 
any time you want.  There is a day to vote.  You know, you 
cannot take a loaded weapon into the middle of a hospital 
just because you want to.

<p>

When we come back from the break, let's just talk 
a little bit more about the fact that speech is not the 
untouched right.  Everything is balanced out, and let's talk 
a little bit about where speech is restricted.

<p>

When <i>Straight Talk</i> returns, we will hear more 
about protecting our children from pornography.  Join us 
after this break.

<p>

[Commercial break.]

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  We are back with more <i>Straight Talk
from the Family Research Council</i>, where we are talking about 
pornography on the Internet.  I am joined once again by 
three attorneys who are working diligently on this issue:
Colby May, Bruce Taylor, and Cathy Cleaver.

<p>

When we went into the break, we were talking about 
the fact that basically what you are saying with laws that 
deal with pornography, there are appropriate restrictions 
and, in particular, restrictions for our children, but I 
think a lot of people think of free speech and think that 
somehow our speech is unregulated.  Is the idea of keeping 
pornography from our children some new concept, or are there 
any restrictions on speech that people would be aware of?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Well, there are many restrictions on 
speech.  We do not have an absolute right to speak.  We 
cannot rent an X-rated movie to a child.  We cannot sell a 
pornographic magazine to a child.  Those are all 
restrictions on speech.  Then, of course, there are fraud 
and slander laws and laws in favor of the public safety that 
restricts speech, such as yelling "fire" in a crowded 
theater.  We can prohibit that.

<p>

Those are all limits on our First Amendment 
rights, but those are limits we embrace.  We think they are 
reasonable, and we understand we need those restrictions so 
that we know how to live together in a society.  If we allow 
people to exploit children in the name of the First 
Amendment, then that is the beginning of the destruction of 
a civilized society.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Yes, I mean, Bruce, it was interesting
as we went into the break, made the interesting observation
that the slippery slope actually works in the other
direction.  This is not a deterioration or erosion of the
First Amendment protections that we are talking about.  It
is actually flipping it the other way, and the erosion we
see is the protection of certain classes from certain kinds
of inappropriate and, certainly in this case, many cases,
illegal kinds of speech and material being provided to kids.
So we flip it the other way.

<p>

So all of a sudden it will be, well, I can go even
if I am a minor and rent that X-rated video, or I can go buy 
that X-rated book or X-rated magazine even if I am a minor.
That is the slope moving in the other direction, and that
ought to be what we are concerned about.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Do you guys see the schizophrenia in 
the nanny state which is going to make curfews and is going 
to give you all kinds of information on sex and is going to 
tell you a million things, but then it is a restrictive 
atmosphere in government today.  You know, we are going to 
punish parents if the kids screw up, we are going to 
communicate drivers' issues to you -- this is how you drive 
a car -- we are going to communicate voting restrictions, we 
are going to communicate drinking restrictions, but no 
speech restrictions?  I mean, do you guys see any 
strangeness in their attitude on that?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I think part of that is from, 
frankly, I think the ACLU has won the public debate on that 
to a large extent.  The ACLU has been able to convince 
enough people that if we touch speech, then our civilization 
will be destroyed, that people are very leery.  I mean, even 
conservatives, Christians, they think, gosh, we cannot touch 
speech.  Then we will not be able to share our faith or 
something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Then why not faith speech, though?
I mean, the same ACLU that says pornography is appropriate 
for children and embraces pedophilia kinds of information 
for children says that prayer in school will destroy 
America.  I mean, I know you have had a lot of experience 
with that, Colby.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, it is one of the freedoms in the 
First Amendment.  The free speech clause, the free press, 
all that sort of thing, they are great champions of and sort 
of this let it all hang out, who cares, sort of thing, but 
when you get to the religion clauses, the establishment and 
the exercise clauses, they have risen the establishment
clause to the point where it just gobbled up free exercise.
So the idea that in public, at least in public, I could go 
out and share my faith and say I believe in Jesus Christ or 
I am a follower of Mohammed or whatever the particular case 
may be, oh-oh, the Republic is at stake; no, you cannot do 
that, that is a real problem, and they refuse to see that 
there are free speech elements to that and that they ought 
to be on the same side in that context as they are out there 
arguing in other contexts on the free speech question.

<p>

But they do not, and it is one of those great 
ironies and one of those great inconsistencies that 
intellectuals everywhere seem to be able to deal with and 
just put in a different pocket and never be concerned about 
and go right on, and that is unfortunately what they have 
done.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR: You know, it is an odd thing that the 
ACLU even a few years ago -- everybody thought that they 
were a bunch of kooks, because they always had such radical 
opinions.  They wanted to legalize child porn and obscenity 
and drugs and guns, and they want to impose sex education 
and certain things on the public and take away the rights of 
parents to teach their kids, and yet they want to defend the 
pornographers.

<p>

What we essentially are doing with Congress and 
the courts is saying let's not change our laws.  The ACLU 
wants to repeal all the obscenity, child porn, harmful to 
minors, indecency laws.  We are saying we have had them for 
100 years.  We have never had nudity and sex on American 
television and radio; they want to put it on.  We have never 
let kids into porno movies or buy <i>Hustler</i> magazines.  They 
want to make that available.  They want to put pornography 
in the libraries.  I mean, they are fighting the revolution 
to change it.

<p>

All we are doing is saying we want to keep the 
laws that we have, and the Congress and the CDA merely 
extended the same protections that kids have in every other 
medium, print, electronic, radio, broadcasting, telephone, 
they just extended that to the Internet and said what you 
cannot sell a kid in a convenience store or you cannot show 
them on a street corner or you cannot beam to him on a 
radio, you cannot put on the Internet.  That is not a 
difference in law.  It is just the same law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Bruce, what is the status now of the 
Communications Decency Act?  We had this three-judge panel.
What is going to happen next?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  It is on a fairly fast track.  The 
government filed a notice of appeal to the U.S. Supreme 
Court.  We kind of skipped the court of appeals.  The 
government will file a brief telling the court about the 
case.  The plaintiff, the ACLU, will file a brief saying 
don't hear this case.  The Supreme Court will, sometime this 
fall, either decide to send the case back down to the trial 
court and tell them, listen, you got this all wrong, start 
over, or they will hear the case and then come out with an 
opinion, and we think they will say the same thing if they 
come out with an opinion.  There is also another challenge 
like this in New York that will probably come out with their 
opinion within the next month or something.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  An appeals court?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  No, it is another three-judge federal 
court in New York City that is hearing the same kind of 
challenge Philadelphia did.  I kind of think the New York 
court will come out with a different opinion than 
Philadelphia did.  Philadelphia was pretty radical.  I think 
the New York court will be more careful, and I think that 
between those two cases the Supreme Court will recognize 
that there are some serious issues here and send the cases 
back for them to take another look at it.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  Just for people to understand one 
more time, what was the most radical thing that came out of 
this three-judge panel, because I am not sure people 
understand.  They understand the Communications Decency Act 
was to apply to the Internet, and in particular, your 
concern was pornography.  What was the most radical thing 
about what the three judges said?

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  I think we each have our favorite 
worst parts of this opinion.

<p>

[Laughter.]

<p>

The answer is my favorite worst horrible part of 
the opinion is when the judges said that any speech 
regulation on this Internet would ruin it, would destroy the 
Internet.  My response is any speech?  No child pornography 
regulation?  We cannot protect consumers in cyberspace?  You 
know, this is a sacred realm that cannot be touched by law.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  So I can lie about maybe drug use on 
the Internet.  Yes, you can use lye in your eyes.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  So I think that reveals that these 
judges are just off kilter.

<p>

MR. TAYLOR:  My thing is that we told the court to 
interpret indecency like the FCC and the Supreme Court does 
to apply to unprotected pornographic harmful stuff for kids, 
and the court instead bought the ACLU's argument that 
indecency means museum pieces, works of literature and art, 
AIDS information, and science and medical textbooks, and it 
almost looks so absurd for the court to have the power to 
limit the reach of indecency to the kind of material that 
would not be unconstitutional, and instead in their 
liberalism, they tried to criminalize all the conduct that 
they thought should be the most protected.

<p>

It is almost like -- I don't know what they are 
smoking, but it was an odd decision in that regard, because 
they could have fixed everything they said was broken, and 
yet they broke it even more.

<p>

MR. MAY:  Well, my own personal favorite was when 
Chief Judge Sloviter[?] said that the Internet was the most 
important development for direct democracy where you could 
have multi-point communications in real-time with multipoint 
other points and have this ongoing discussion, and in 
the reality of the ongoing discussion, we have this 
incredible invigoration of democracy.

<p>

She described this as chaos, and therefore, in 
order to make sure that we preserve the chaos of the 
Internet, we have to make sure that there are no speech 
restrictions.  This is a speech restriction; it is out.  For 
me, I just found that to be absurd, because we talk about 
ordered liberty in this country.  We talk about 
responsibility in the same breath for which you talk about 
freedom, and the idea that it is chaos and that that somehow 
is the spawning ground for American democracy I find to be 
astoundingly silly.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK:  A rather narrow reading of history.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: Right.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Gary Bauer, President of the Family 
Research Council, made the interesting point after this case 
that if the Internet pollutes itself with pornography and 
all kind of insanity and false speech and 40-year-old men 
masquerading as 5-year-old girls, that eventually, rather 
than being the communications tool it is proclaimed to be, 
it will kill it, because people, families and people who 
might really use it, are going to get out.

<p>

Do you think that that is a realistic assessment?

<p>

MR. TAYLOR: I think that is why Congress passed 
the law, because just like they passed an indecency law 
saying you cannot put indecency on radio and television 60 
years ago to make TV and radio available to every home, and 
we put restrictions to protect kids in videos and magazines 
and everything else so industry can survive and so can kids, 
if the Internet becomes so toxic and unfriendly to children 
that they cannot use it safely, then what is it going to be 
in another 10 years that the next generation that could 
benefit the most will be able to use it the least?

<p>

So Congress was intending to open up the Internet 
to kids to be able to use it, not to close it, and that is 
why if it is only good for pornography -- if pornography is 
essential to the Internet, then it is not worth keeping, but 
if the Internet is good for everything else, then they will 
figure out a way to put pornography in its place so it does 
not ruin the Internet from being a universal communication.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Not to mention the majority of 
citizens in our country, women are a great minority on the 
Internet right now.  I wonder whether that has anything to 
do with the fact that pornography is completely free-wheeling. 
It always depicts women and degrades women, and 
most people on-line now are adult males making over $50,000.
It is somewhat of an elite group.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: It is, isn't it?

<p>

I have to thank my guests.  We are going to have 
to have you all back, especially after the next ruling.

<p>

When we return, <i>Straight Talk</i> shares more about 
the plight of America's families. Don't go away.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: Welcome back to <i>Straight Talk from 
the Family Research Council</i>. You may have recognized one of 
tonight's guests from her appearances on nationwide news 
broadcasts.  Tonight, we will bring you a short clip from 
one of her more challenging appearances on CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>,
debating ACLU president Nadine Strassen[?]. Let's take a 
look as we bring you some Homefront News.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Look, in 1985, the ACLU said that 
child pornography is a sacred text that ought to be freely 
traded with no restrictions whatsoever.  At least we can say 
for the ACLU that they are consistent.  But what we have 
here is a --

<p>

MS. STRASSEN:  Cathy, I defend your --

<p>

MS. CLEAVER: -- either indecency or harmful to 
minor situation.  Let's look at reality.

<p>

MS. STRASSEN:  I would like to, but you are in a fantasy world.

<p>

MS. CLEAVER:  Laws to protect children have been 
widely -- by liberals and conservatives -- under your 
agenda, Nadine, it is the bully who wins.  We care about 
children and about protecting children from pornography.  We 
are not talking about adults with this legislation.  We are 
talking about protecting children.  There is a wide 
consensus that the government has a role.

<p>

MS. HAMRICK: <i>Straight Talk</i> continues after the
