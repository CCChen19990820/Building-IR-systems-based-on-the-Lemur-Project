<TR><TD>Abstract <TD>The overall goal behind every assistance given by the Community is the promotion of economic and social development in developing countries. This goal is deduced from the objectives set by the national (or now common) foreign, economic and security-policies and interests of its member states. But during the sixties and early seventies even the jurisdiction over development        assistentence by the community was disputed by the member states. The European Court of Justice decided in favour of the Community.  A chapter is dedicated to the evolution of contractual relations between the EC and certain regional groups of countries       particularly with the Overseas Countries and Territories (OCT), the ACP-Countries, the Mediterranean, the Asian and Latin American countries. Up to today the former colonies, beside the OCT, obtained the most preferential treatment regarding trade    concessions and financial assistance. But, during the last ten years a shift in favor of the countries in Northern Africa was perceptible. Since the mid-eighties the Community promotes regional cooperation among developing countries. Treaties were signed with a large number of regional organizations (ASEAN, Andean-Pact, Gulf-Cooperation-Council, etc.). A compilation of the overall assistance given to each group completes this article.

<hr>
<p>
The Treaty of Maastricht will provide the Common Development Policy with a firm legal basis for its
objectives, ways and means to realize these objectives, and provisions regarding decision-making procedures.
This letter will first discuss the substance of the Common Development Policy under the headings of
horizontal coordination (i.e. the coherence of common EC policies), and vertical coordination (i.e. the
coordination of aid policies of the EC and those of its member states). It then discusses the distribution of
powers and the decision-making procedures of Community bodies. The present and future capacity of the EC
Commission in the area of the Common Development Policy is the subject of the next section; the last is
devoted to the proposal to establish an advisory body at EC level.
<p>
<A NAME="tow"><hr><h3>Towards more coherence in EC policies</h3></A>

The new article 130 V that Maastricht will add to the EEC Treaty states that "The Community shall take
account of the objectives referred to in Article 130 U in the policies that it implements which are likely to
affect developing countries". The implementation of this obligation will necessitate an evaluation of existing
and new Community policies from this point of view. If necessary, the Commission will have to make
proposals to adapt existing policies in order to remove negative effects on developing countries or reinforce
positive effects. Proposals for new policies and measures will have to be screened for their likely effects on
developing countries. The Council of November 1992 suggested that the Commission should make such
impact studies, particularly with respect to new proposals. The NAR supports this proposal and proposes to
subject new as well as existing EC policies to the same screening.
<p>
The institutions of the EC take a large number of decisions every day, many of them of a very technical
nature. It is not feasible to indicate for every draft decision the possible consequences for developing
countries. Instead the NAR proposes that the Commission should send a memorandum to the Council of
Ministers for the various common policies, in which the effects of existing policies for developing countries
are evaluated; the question of whether existing policies should be adapted (and, if so, how?), should be
answered. The Commission should report annually on the question of how the interests of developing
countries have been taken into account in recent and future policy proposals.
<p>
A brief review of the possible impact of common policies on developing countries is given below for a
number of areas. Common policies often affect developing countries; often this is not realized by the policy-
makers when they formulate and implement these policies. It will sometimes be difficult to define "the"
interests of "the" developing countries. A related question is, what should be done if it is established that a
proposal is not in conformity with the objectives of article 130 U? It should be determined whether a
proposal or policy, in contributing to the objectives of the EC, is structurally detrimental to (some)
developing countries. If this turns out to be the case, the NAR takes the view that the implementation of the
policy should be carefully re-evaluated. However, it may be the case that there are only short-term problems
of adaptation for (some) developing countries. In that case, taking temporary compensatory measures is a
logical consequence. This could be done in order to make it easier for developing countries to adapt to the
policy concerned, e.g. by introducing the policy over a longer period of time or by giving assistance directly
geared to facilitating adaptive measures by developing countries affected by the new common policy
measures.  
<p>
The policy areas that are reviewed below may be seen as relevant, both separately and in connection with
each other. The possible integration in the EC of new members will for instance have consequences, not only
for the areas of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), Common Commercial Policy (CCP), environmental
and monetary policies, but also for the economies of developing countries. 
<p>
Some elements of the CCP, the trade preferences, are used to stimulate development. Other elements of the
CCP have the opposite effect on developing countries. The introduction on a large scale of non-tariff barriers
hampers exports from developing countries and undermines the multilateral world trading order which has
been built on non-discrimination and the rule of law. For these reasons trade preferences have largely lost
their effectiveness. From the point of view of the aims of the Common Development Policy, particularly "the
smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy" (art. 130 U), the EC
should:
<ul>
<li>offer the developing countries transparent, reliable and easy access to its market, characterized by non-
discrimination;
<li>contribute to open and multilateral world trading order that grants the less powerful partners an equitable
treatment.
</ul>
<p>
This implies a CCP and a contractual development cooperation policy of the EC (through the Lom&#233;
Convention and trade and cooperation agreements) which, combined with the EC's GSP, gradually reserve
trade preferences more and more for the "most disadvantaged" developing countries, in conformity with
article 130 U. 1 first indent of the Maastricht Treaty. The Uruguay Round offers the opportunity for the EC
to adapt its trade policy along these lines.  
<p>
The trends in the EC in agricultural production, consumption and imports and exports show that a common
policy, viz. the CAP, can have far reaching consequences for the development of poor (and other) countries,
without much concern shown by the policymakers. This also applies to the changes in the CAP that are now
being implemented. 
<p>
The CAP enabled some developing countries to import foodstuffs at artificially low prices, which constituted
a disincentive for the authorities concerned to develop the domestic agricultural sector. Developing countries
that are net-exporters of agricultural products have lost substantial amounts for the same reason, while some
were offered artificial  export markets in the EC, e.g. for tapioca. These different interests of developing
countries have surfaced in the Uruguay Round. The NAR takes the view that the distorting effects of the CAP
is contrary to "the smooth and gradual integration of the developing countries into the world economy". The
abolition of these distortions will make world agricultural markets function better.
<p>
Although liberalization of world trade in agricultural products will bring the developing nations as a group a
net gain, some of them will lose out. Technical and financial support should be provided to protect the
domestic agricultural incomes of the countries that are losers. This support can be provided through existing
and, if necessary, through new channels. The policy of poor countries themselves is also important: they
could impose countervailing duties on subsidised EC exports. 
<p>
The Single European Act allocated some tasks in the area of environmental policy to the EC. The Treaty on
European Union formulates goals and political and legal means for pursuing this common policy. Developing
countries will be affected as global environmental problems are within the scope of this policy. The EC as a
large economic entity played an important role in UNCED (Rio de Janeiro, 1992) in preparing and
coordinating the environmental policies of its member states. The industrialized countries have a major
responsibility for the management of the "global commons" as they have appropriated a large part of these
commons in the past. Truely worldwide environmental policies can only be successful if they serve the
interests of developing countries, viz. if these countries are enabled to eradicate poverty and attain higher
levels of welfare. The NAR has discussed this issue in its recent report on Development and Environment. 
<p>
Internal environmental policy measures in the EC - such as the granting of "green" labels, the prescription of
certain ways of packaging or the prohibition of certain additives - can have consequences for developing
countries. It may be difficult for developing countries to meet these conditions while maintaining com-
petitiveness. The NAR is of the opinion that technical assistance (transfer of technologies and of know-how)
should be granted to developing countries that are affected and that transition periods should be indicated
very clearly in order to enable exporters to adapt smoothly to the new conditions.  
<p>
The establishment of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU) will lead to the introduction of one European
currency (the ECU) and a common monetary policy. As the EC is a very important actor in the international
flow of goods, services and capital, a future EMU will constitute a formidable political entity in international
economic relations. A stable international monetary climate (interest rates and exchange rates) is very
important for development and for easing the debt burden of many countries. The objectives of internal
monetary policy and the objectives of international monetary cooperation will sometimes differ.  
<p>
The stage of transition to the EMU may be particularly difficult for policymakers in the member states as
they have to meet the criteria of the Maastricht Treaty. The political tensions that may result from this
striving demand so much attention that the consequences of monetary policy for third countries is no longer
taken into account (Richard N. Cooper, Will an EC Currency Harm Outsiders? Orbis, Fall 1992, p. 521-522).
The NAR is of the opinion that the article on coherence (130 V) also applies to the common financial and
monetary policy.
<p>
The issue of migration to the Community cannot be isolated from international trade in goods and services
and the international flow of capital. A high level of international interdependence has developed with
respect to the latter three areas, which is generally considered to be a positive development. However, this
does not apply as regards the migration of labour from South (and from the East) to North. The member
states implement policies that protect the national labour markets from migration from developing countries.
This policy is in the process of harmonization and unification (Schengen). This protection gives rise to the
situation that many migrants to the EC try to enter the EC illegally or by using asylum procedures. The NAR
takes the view that the only possible way to reduce immigration - both legal and illegal - from third
countries into the EC in the long run is by ensuring that potential migrants at least have prospects of
reasonable living standards (employment, health care, education) in their home countries. The EC should
contribute to this by strengthening its cooperation with these countries, particularly those in Africa.
Improvement of export opportunities to the EC (in a non-discriminatory way), at least a stabilization of aid
flows and the promotion of investments, are means that will help to realize the stated goals. 
<p>
<A NAME="coo"><hr><h3>Coordination of member states' development policies</h3></A>

The Maastricht Treaty states that "the Community and the Member States shall coordinate their policies on
development cooperation and shall consult each other on their aid programmes, including in international
organizations and during international conferences. They may act together". The NAR supports the aim of
reinforcing coordination as it may bring a number of advantages, of which increased aid efficiency is the
most important. However, the article of the Treaty leaves several questions unanswered: what exactly should
be coordinated, at what level of decision-making should coordination take place and how are the recipient
countries involved? Coordination may vary from particular areas to overall coordination and from low to
high intensity - from a particular sector or country to all sectors and all developing countries and from the
exchange of information to common actions under shared responsibility. 
<p>
In the framework of the EC, the policy instruments of the member states and the EC as such are to be
coordinated. Before this can be put into practice, agreement on the goals of development policies is a
necessary precondition for coordination. It is evident that the member states have diverging objectives, e.g.
with respect to the promotion of donor interests versus recipient interests (E. Grilli and M. Riess, EC Aid to
Associated Countries: Distribution and Determinants, in: Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv, 1992, Heft 2, p. 214).
The consequences can be seen in differences in aid-tying, aid performance and geographic distribution of aid.
<p>
A prerequisite for successful coordination is the exchange of information on the member states' policies.
Although the Council agreed as early as 1974 on a resolution in which member states promised to exchange
information on present and future policies and to consult each other in particular with respect to countries
that receive aid from two or more member states and/or the Community, it has to be concluded that even this
rather modest objective has not been achieved. Secondly, the NAR is of the opinion that coordination of
operational activities in a particular area can take place only after common objectives and the outline of the
common approach of development policies in that field have been formulated. Policy coordination in a
particular area is a prerequisite for operational coordination in that area. 
<p>
First efforts at coordination in the past will be reviewed in this section. Secondly, the conditions for
successful coordination will be identified. Then priority areas will be discussed and some conclusions drawn
on modalities of coordination. The section is concluded by a discussion of coordination of conditionality.
<p>
<A NAME="pas"><h4>Past experience</h4></A>

Before the EC started thinking about coordination, multilateral organisations were involved in donor
coordination. The World Bank took the lead in coordinating development cooperation with countries for
which an aidgroup was created. Experience with aid coordination has also been gained by the United Nations
Development Programme (UNDP) as far as the UN agencies' activities and data collection in a specific
country are concerned. UNDP also organized Round Tables to coordinate technical aid for certain countries.
UNCTAD coordinates efforts to develop the least developed countries.
<p>
At the beginning of the eighties Commissioner Pisani tried to get the EC countries to coordinate their aid
efforts in the Third World. The food strategy concept was developed as an integrated policy framework to
provide coordinated support. The Commission has recently developed a more systematic, reciprocal form of
EC coordination in the areas of democracy and human rights, structural adjustment and the management of
counterpart funds. The DAC has also gained experience with donor coordination, particularly in three fields:
the definition of ODA and the collection of data on aid performance; secondly in the areas of policy
formulation (women and development and environmental problems) and thirdly with respect to conditionality
and particularly the rules concerning the tying of aid. 
<p>
In the case of food strategies, it was found that some EC countries continued to fight for their "own"
projects, instead of supporting jointly a whole range of projects resulting from the strategy. Secondly, the
receiving country perceived the coordination between the member states as "ganging up", limiting its own
freedom to select and propose projects. Finally, not every EC Delegation in the country concerned had
sufficient staff to coordinate the efforts of the EC member states in that particular country. Often these
efforts petered out in time because the country did not want to give in or because the Commission or the
Council changed its priorities or personnel. 
<p>
<A NAME="ope"><h4>Operational coordination</h4></A>

Operational coordination can probably best be realized by a step-by-step approach. First, it is necessary to
exchange information. Then, bilateral activities in a certain sector or at the level of conditionality in
particular countries can be coordinated. Only at the last stage will the EC be able to undertake certain
activities on behalf of the member countries. Coordination in the EC should also lead to common positions
of its member states in coordinating fora of multilateral organisations.
<p>
This leads the NAR to the conclusion that, once the objectives and outlines in a specific area of development
policy have been agreed upon, coordination shoulb be started at field level. This implies exchange of
information at country level and a leading role for the EC Delegation, particularly in those developing
countries in which the EC as such has substantial financial and technical capacities. The NAR recommends
carrying out an evaluation study of the Delegations' previous efforts to coordinate member state efforts.
<p>
New instructions for the EC Delegations are being prepared. Much depends on the letter and the spirit of
these instructions. Some of the EC Delegates have been reluctant to play a very active role in order to
acquire the support of various countries and organizations. For effective field coordination, the local
representatives of donors and of the Commission must have the power to negotiate and to engage their
governments or headquarters within the policy framework that has been previously agreed upon. Additional-
ly, financial commitments should be made immediately, so that all parties involved know that the plans will
be implemented. 
<p>
<A NAME="pol"><h4>Policy coordination at sector level</h4></A>

In its Communication to the Council and the European Parliament of 24 March 1993 the Commission
proposed three sectors and two general elements for coordination: health policies, education and training,
food security, the campaign against poverty and external financing and debt issues. During the meeting of the
Council of May 1993 it was suggested that the Council's past resolutions and conclusions be reviewed with
the aim of identifying priority areas for policy coordination. It was decided to enhance policy coordination in
the sectors of health, food security and education and training. In fields such as human rights, family
planning and support for structural adjustment, the Council stated that it had already provided for effective
policy coordination; "efforts should now primarily be concentrated on implementation". Additionally, the
Council stated that in fields where Community policy has been defined (environment, evaluation, role of
women, emergency aid) consolidation and updating may be required in the light of current or future
circumstances and past experiences. The Council provided a timetable for its discussion on coordination.
<p>
The NAR would point out that most of the coordination areas suggested by the Commission and partly
adopted by the Council are rather broad in nature (poverty, food security, health). In line with the
recommendations made earlier in this letter, the NAR stresses the necessity to start the operational
coordination from field level in specific, well-defined areas for which programmes can be formulated and
implemented. Instead of the broad, and by definition rather vague, coordination proposals in the Commission
and Council documents, some new areas of action which are more specific should be selected. Examples are
the fight against AIDS in Africa, energy policy in Sub-Saharan Africa, the support for economic integration,
e.g. the establishment of common markets of developing countries, and the tackling of certain environmental
problems. These areas are relatively new, they transcend national borders and there are few vested donor
interests at the moment. An additional advantage is that they can be approached in an innovative way. 
<p>
<A NAME="con"><h4>Conditionality</h4></A>

A specific set of problems with respect to coordination is the diverging conditionality of the member states'
bilateral aid programmes. This could in the long run frustrate both the achievement of the target of the
internal market and of establishing a common foreign policy. Aid conditionality basically relates to two
different donor objectives: first, reducing the donor countries' economic loss from the aid transfer, and
secondly persuading (or forcing) the recipient country to make certain socio-economic or political ad-
justments that it would otherwise not have made. 
<p>
The first objective leads the donor to the tying of its bilateral aid. OECD statistics (annex 1) clearly show
wide variation among EC member states in this respect. If one assumes that the tying of bilateral aid leads to
an equivalent net expansion of the donor's exports to developing countries, (this assumption has been
challenged in the literature on the basis of the argument that aid-financed imports of developing countries
probably are fungible with other imports by these countries) the different levels of tying among the member
states in fact reflect different levels of government support. The picture that emerges from the scattered
information that is available suggests that the actual return flows to the donor countries may be somewhere
between 40 and 80 per cent of the bilateral aid flows. There is reason to expect that the same applies to
procurement data of which no statistics are available.
<p>
Aid packages that have recently come particularly under attack are tied aid-cum-export credit packages,
commonly referred to as associated financing packages or mixed credits. International discussions within the
OECD framework have led to several recommendations and obligations with respect to the minimum
concessionality levels and differentiation between categories of countries; with respect to obligations to notify
and to provide information to other donors and more recently, with respect to the aspect of commercial
viability (through the "Helsinki package"). However, at the same time it has become clear that both the
actual practice of associated financing packages and their size do differ substantially between member states.
Therefore, the NAR is of the opinion that in the interest of both the donors and the recipients, EC regulations
will have to be designed, building upon the OECD rules, that prevent these differences from creating a non-
level playing field and from creating a distorted competitive situation and from creating trade distortions
between EC member states.
<p>
The second objective gives rise to economic and political conditionality. In the course of the eighties bilateral
conditionality has gradually expanded to include conditions beyond the level of individual projects and
programmes. Donors tend to focus, much more than in the past, on the macro economic conditions in the
recipient country and on the (structural) adjustment processes. The emphasis in conditionality shifted from
the micro to the macro level. In some cases donors supported World Bank/IMF structural ad-
justment/stabilization programmes in their bilateral aid policies; in other cases, however, donors explicitly
rejected this approach. Attitudes differed widely among member states, the general picture being that the
Southern member states were on average much more critical on the World Bank/IMF conditionality than the
Northern member states. 
<p>
During the second half of the 1980s and the beginning of 1990s political conditionality on top of macro
economic conditionality came increasingly into vogue. Various bilateral donors introduced conditions such as
good governance, respect for human and social rights, democratization and the level of military expenditures
into their aid packages. More recently, environmental concern has been added to the list, both at the micro
and the macro level. However, coordination among the EC member states in this area is lacking. Annex 2
may serve as a tentative illustration of both the current divergence and the accumulation of conditions
attached to aid between donors (including various EC member states). 
<p>
The NAR concludes that in all aspects of conditionality - official tying, actual procurement, associate
financing, project/programme conditions, economic, social environmental and political conditions - there is
insufficient coordination of policy among the member states. This creates substantial inefficiencies,
bureaucratic overload, especially on the part of the recipient, and weakens the donor's bargaining power. The
NAR therefore recommends effective coordination, and subsequently integration, of the whole range of
conditions attached to bilateral aid flows from the member states and the EC. The NAR warns against an
accumulation of donor demands and against extending conditionality to too many fields. Setting priorities,
e.g. in the areas of good governance and human rights, will be inevitable.
<p>
<A NAME="dec"><hr><h3>Decisionmaking procedures and powers</h3></A>

The Maastricht Treaty states that the common development cooperation policy  "shall be complementary to
the policies pursued by the member states" (article 130 U.1). This elicits the question which tasks and
powers should be given to EC bodies and which to the member states. The principle of subsidiarity (article.
3 B that Maastricht will add to the EC Treaty) is applicable here. According to this principle "the Com-
munity shall take action [...] only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action cannot be
sufficiently achieved by the Member States and can therefore, by reason of the scale or effects of the
proposed action, be better achieved by the Community". Consequently, the member states will first have to
agree on the various development objectives and will have to decide subsequently at which level the
implementation should take place. The general objectives are formulated in the Treaty on European Union.
Instruments of financial and technical aid and of structural relations with developing countries (trade, invest-
ments) are to be used. 
<p>
However, in practice the principle of subsidiarity does not give an unambiguous answer to many questions
about the distribution of powers. A fair amount of pragmatism is thus called for.
<p>
<A NAME="coh"><h4>Coherence</h4></A>

In the category of structural relations, increasing the coherence of common policies (section 1) is the most
important mechanism. This task can only be fulfilled by EC bodies as this exclusively concerns common
policies decided upon by these bodies. As is generally the case, the Commission will have to prepare
proposals for Council decisions with respect to increasing this coherence. The composition of the Council at
its meetings varies, depending on the subject matter. The NAR is of the opinion that the particular Council
that is responsible for a certain area of common policy should be responsible for realizing the coherence of
this policy within the framework of the common development policy. The Commission should report annually
to the Council and to the European Parliament on the progress made and problems that arise, in achieving
more coherence.
<p>
<A NAME="cor"><h4>Coordination</h4></A>

The Council does not have many powers at the moment: it can take binding decisions with regard to food
and emergency aid only. It can issue resolutions and declarations in other areas, but these do not bind the
member states. This situation is a consequence of the fact that development cooperation is not an area of
common policy in the formal sense of the word. After ratification of the Treaty on European Union, there
will be a much firmer basis in European law for intensifying the EC development policy. The reinforcement
of this common policy is also apparent from the new way in which decisions will be taken in this policy
area: through the cooperation procedure (article 189 C). This will enable the Council to take decisions by
qualified majority; the position of the European Parliament will be reinforced. The logical consequence of
this is, that the Council takes binding decisions (regulations and directives) with regard to the vertical
coordination of the development policies between the EC and its member states.
<p>
<A NAME="exe"><hr><h3>Executive Tasks and Commission Resources</h3></A>

The new tasks for the EC Commission in the area of the horizontal and vertical coordination of Common
Development Policy that result from the Maastricht Treaty and the recommendations made by the NAR will
place an extra burden on the already limited resources of the Commission. The question posed in this section
is by which bodies will these new tasks have to be executed. For some activities the answer is clear: it is the
task of the Commission to submit proposals to the Council with respect to horizontal coordination
(coherence) and the policy aspect of vertical coordination. As a result, this question is confined to the
implementation of aid programmes.
<p>
In recent years  the departments of the Commission that are responsible for the relations with developing
countries (DG-I and DG-VIII) have been severely criticized, particularly with regard to the implementation
of the aid programmes. The Court of Auditors drew attention to underspending, time-consuming procedures,
opaque financial procedures and the lack of financial monitoring. The main reason that is often given is that
the DGs are quantitatively and qualitatively understaffed. However, the DGs have a compartmentalized way
of working, do not have a tendency to cooperate and are hierarchically organized, which hampers both
coordination and flexibility.  A recent report - produced by an external consultant - criticized the lack of
efficiency of the EC aid apparatus. One of the consequences of this was said to be the long delays in aid
implementation (Price Waterhouse, Study of the Causes of Delay in the Implementation of Financial and
Technical Cooperation, final report, November 1992).
<p>
The recent move of a number of highly qualified officials from the aid departments to the aid programme for
Eastern Europe may be one of the recent reasons for the lack of capacity administer aid. It is not unlikely
that this and the cuts in the personnel budget the Commission has to make, will reduce the capacity of the
aid administration of the Commission even further.
<p>
A second criticism is the very limited evaluation capacity of the Commission and the fact that existing
evaluations are not used to improve the quality of aid. DG-VIII has a very small evaluation department
which concentrates its activities on evaluation and monitoring of projects and not on policy evaluation. A
recent report  showed that the evaluation department was understaffed, that the management of the DGs was
relatively uninterested in evaluations for policy development, that the EDF Committee did not receive
evaluations and that there were no adequate instruments to translate evaluations into practical action, which
resulted in a weak  "corporate memory" (Cracknell, B.E. EEC Commission and Member States Review of
Effectiveness of Feedback Mechanisms; Third Report: the EEC Commission, 15 December 1989). The
Commission has indicated that more attention is now being paid to the process of evaluation itself and the
feedback of evaluation results into the preparation and implementation of aid projects and programmmes. 
<p>
Given the shortcomings of the EC aid administration, the NAR recommends, firstly, an improvement in the
Commission departments for development aid in order to raise the quality of aid administration with respect
to efficiency, flexibility, quality and feedback; this is necessary, even if the present task of the Commission
remains unchanged. Secondly, the NAR is of the opinion that it is not desirable in the short term to add to
the tasks of the Commission with respect to the implementation of aid programmes. 
<p>
The Wissenschaftliche Beirat beim Bundesministerium fur wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung
proposes to withdraw all aid administration from the EC in the long run (Europ&#228;isierung der Entwick-
lungszusammenarbeit, in: BMZ Aktuell, M&#228;rz 1993, p. 11 and 12). The NAR does not want to go as
far as this. Depending on the expansion of joint aid programmes and/or increased coordination, a decision as
to whether to increase the aid volume channelled through the Community can be taken in the longer term. In
a situation in which Community policy on development cooperation is considerably broadened, governmental,
Community and possibly private aid agencies originating in the EC should be compared with regard to the
efficiency and cost-effectiveness of each in the implementation of a particular aid programme. The outcome
of this comparison should determine the channel for implementation of the common and/or coordinated aid.
For a number of aid activities, particularly those related to other common policies, the Community apparatus
will probably have comparative advantages; in other cases various tasks might be carried out more efficiently
elsewhere.   
<p>
<A NAME="lom"><h4>Consequences for the Lom&#233; Convention</h4></A>

For this decade, a large part of EC aid is in the framework of the Lom&#233; Convention. The NAR
stresses the advantages of the Convention: a combination of instruments (trade and aid) and the nature of the
ACP-EC relationship as a "contract" comprising rights and obligations, as wel as a framework for
institutionalised consultations. The NAR wants to maintain these advantages, but also recommends a
rethinking of the basis of the framework, well before the end of this decade when the fourth Lom&#233;
Convention expires. Such rethinking could be done along the following lines.
<p>
The Lom&#233; Convention distinguishes betwee groups of ACP countries with different needs that
accordingly receive different treatment (article 328 et seq. Lom&#233; IV). Differentiation according to the
level of development is also found in the enabling clause ("graduation and integration") that is part of the
package of the Tokyo Round of multilateral trade negotiations. The Maastricht Treaty demands special
attention for the "most disadvantaged" group of countries: article 130 U. 1. In a new Convention, this
direction of thinking should be continued and expanded in order to base the agreement more firmly on
criteria of development than is now the case. The result should be that more advantages will be given to the
poorest countries and less to the richer. In the end the advantages for the latter category will consist mainly
of the institutionalised consultations. This rethinking will lead also to adding several "most disadvantaged"
countries to the group of developing countries that is party to the Convention.
<p>
<A NAME="adv"><hr><h3>Advisory Capacity at EC Level</h3></A>

In a number of member states a "National Advisory Board, or Council, for Development Cooperation",
composed of expert representatives from the R&D sector, universities,  NGOs and public bodies, advise -or
comment- either on request or at their own initiative, on their government's development cooperation
policies. Although they may vary greatly in size, composition, mandate, procedures and independence, they
produce a wide range of advisory reports, statements, position and discussion papers which contribute to the
public and parliamentary discussions on - and thus to the formulation of - development cooperation policies
at national level, while at the same time constituting a high-quality public basis for development cooperation
activities.
<p>
In order to provide a link between current events, the development cooperation policy formulated at national
level and the necessary European Common Development Policy that is required , these councils -or similar
institutions- could initiate and coordinate the elaboration of a European development cooperation policy: one
of the instruments mentioned in section 2. 
<p>
The NAR recommends using, strengthening and extending the cooperation between these existing facilities for
independent and expert advisory work on development policy on a European scale. 
<p>
Advisory councils differ greatly in the EC countries: the activities of the councils in the United Kingdom,
Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands are well known; those in Belgium, France, Italy, Greece,
Luxemburg, Spain, Portugal, Norway and recently in Ireland (the ACDC) are less known.
<p>
A number of these councils were aware even before "Maastricht" of the contribution that closer cooperation
of their institutes could make towards 1) their own functioning on a national level and 2) thereby towards the
development of a European Development Cooperation Policy. At the initiative of Ireland, a workshop was
organised in The Hague in which the participants from seven EC member states and the European
Commission decided upon a work programme for cooperation.
<p>
However, since it was not quite clear which form the initial support by the EC would take, the momentum
was lost. The EC appears to be more interested in creating a "pool" of (individual) experts, who are available
for policy formulation activities on a "stand-by basis". In 1993 the NAR took up the initiative again and, in
collaboration with the European Centre for Development Policy Management (ECDPM) in Maastricht,
proposed that a detailed form of cooperation and networking between national advisory councils for
development cooperation and of similar institutions in the EC member states and in the aspiring member
states be worked out.This proposal was formulated along the following lines:
<ol>
<li>To make an inventarization of the activities and procedures of advisory counciles and similar institutions.
<li>To set up a mechanism for the collection and exchange of information by the participants.
<li>To prepare a workshop on a common European theme for the production of a joint report.
</ol>
<p>
The NAR intends to continue its activities to promote an EC-wide advisory capacity. In order to speed up the
implementation of these activities, the NAR proposes that: the Netherlands Government actively seek more
structural support from the EC for this activity; that the initiatives by the EC as regards the formulation of a
coordinated and coherent European development cooperation policy be linked to this networking activity. 
The next opportunity for this could be the second experts' meeting on the coherence of European develop-
ment cooperation policy, planned by the EC in the autumn of 1993. 
<p>
Moreover, the NAR proposes that in order to speed up operations and make them effective within the
framework of these networking activities, a Steering Committee should be formed consisting of a relatively
small working group of experts, that prepares and works out point 3 of the work programme: the selection
and elaboration of a joint report on a common European theme, focusing more on new and unexplored
subjects for policy coordination than on those fields which generated so many coordination problems in the
past. In line with the recommendations made earlier in this letter the NAR suggests one or more of the
following subjects for a common theme for a joint report: the operational coordination at field level, the
fight against AIDS in developing countries, energy policies in Africa, regional economic integration among
poor countries and/or the tackling of specific environmental problems.
<p>
<A NAME="sum"><hr><h3>Summary</h3></A>
<p>
<h4>Coherence</h4>

If it turns out that a common policy or a proposal for a Community policy in achieving its objectives puts
(some) developing countries at a disadvantage structurally, the NAR believes that implementation of the
policy should be carefully re-evaluated. However, it may be the case that there are only short-term problems
of adaptation for (some) developing countries. If this is so, taking temporary compensatory measures is a
logical consequence. This could be done in order to make it easier for developing countries to adapt to the
policy concerned, e.g. by introducing the policy over a longer period or by giving assistance directly geared
to facilitating adaptive measures by developing countries hit by the new common policy measures.  
<p>
The NAR is of the opinion that the particular Council that is responsible for a certain area of common policy
should be responsible for giving this policy coherence within the framework of the Common Development
Policy. The Commission should report annually to the Council and to the European Parliament on the
progress and problems with respect to the realization of coherence.
<p>
<h4>Coordination</h4>

The NAR stresses the necessity to start the operational coordination from field level in specific, well-defined
areas for which programmes can be formulated and implemented. Instead of the broad, and by definition
rather vague, coordination proposals in the Commission and Council documents, some new areas of action
which are more specific should be selected. Examples are the fight against AIDS in Africa, energy policy in
Sub-Saharan Africa, the support for economic integration, e.g. the establishment of common markets of
developing countries, and the tackling of certain environmental problems. These areas are relatively new,
they transcend the national borders and there are few vested donor interests at the moment. An additional
advantage is that they can be approached in an innovative way. 
<p>
A precondition for successful coordination is the exchange of information on the member states' policies.
<p>
The NAR is of the opinion that coordination of operational activities in a particular area can take place only
after common objectives and the outline of the common approach of development policies in that field have
been formulated.
<p>
The priority for coordination at field level implies a leading role for the EC Delegation. For effective field
coordination, the local representatives of donors and of the Commission must have the power to negotiate
and to engage their governments or headquarters within the policy framework that has been previously
agreed upon. 
<p>
The NAR recommends effective coordination, and subsequently integration of the whole range of conditions
attached to bilateral aid flows from the member states and the EC. The NAR warns against an accumulation
of donor demands and against extending conditionality to too many fields. Setting priorities, e.g. in the areas
of good governance and human rights, will be inevitable. 
<p>
<h4>The Council </h4>

The NAR takes the view that the strengthening of the Common Development Policy should be matched by a
strengthening of the powers of the Council. The Council should get the power to take binding decisions
(regulations and directives) with respect to the vertical coordination of development policies of the member
states and the EC. This will have the advantage of making this coordination lose its non-obligatory nature.
<p>
<h4>Tasks of the Commission</h4>

Given the shortcomings of the EC aid administration, the NAR recommends, firstly, the improvement of the
Commission departments for development aid in order to raise the quality of aid administration with respect
to efficiency, flexibility, quality and feed back; this is necessary, even if the present task of the Commission
remains unchanged.
<p>
Secondly, the NAR is of the opinion that it is not desirable in the short term to add to the tasks of the
Commission with respect to the implementation of aid programmes. 
<p>
It may be that in the longer term a larger aid volume is channelled through the Community. In such a
situation, governmental, Community and possibly private institutions originating in the EC should be
compared with regard to the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of each in the implementation of a particular
aid programme. The outcome of this comparison should determine the channel for implementation of the
common and/or coordinated aid. 
<p>
<h4>The Common Commercial Policy and the Lom&#233; Convention</h4>

The NAR wants to maintain the advantages of the present Lom&#233; IV Convention but proposes a
rethinking of the basis of its framework well before the expiration of Lom&#233; IV. Such rethinking should
result in putting the agreement more firmly on a basis of development criteria (see article 130 U. 1 first
indent  Maastricht Treaty). The result should be that more advantages will be given to the poorest countries
and less to the richer. In the end the advantages for the latter category will consist mainly of the
institutionalised consultations. This rethinking will lead also to adding several "most disadvantaged" countries
to the group of developing countries that is party to the Convention.
<p>
<h4>Advisory capacity</h4>

The NAR intends to continue its activities to promote an EC-wide advisory capacity. In order to speed up
the implementation of these activities, the NAR proposes that the Netherlands Government actively seek
more structural support from the EC for this activity and that the initiatives by the EC as regards the
formulation of a coordinated and coherent European development cooperation policy be linked to this
networking activity. 
<p>
The NAR proposes that a relatively small working group of experts prepare a joint report on a common
European theme, thereby concentrating on new and unexplored subjects for policy coordination.  
<p>
The NAR suggests one or more of the following subjects for a common theme for a joint report: the
operational coordination at field level, the fight against AIDS in developing countries, energy policies in
Africa, regional economic integration among poor countries and/or the tackling of specific environmental
problems.

<TR><TD>Abstract <TD>The development policy of the European Union is mostly            characterized by the colonial past of single member states and their interests in some regions. The Mediterranean on the one hand is a very important market for the Union on the other hand the Union highly depends on the energy imports of that region. Additionally the geostrategic position of the Maghreb and Mashrek countries still plays an eminent role in the negotiations on the aid by the Union. In the past the relations between the Union and the Mediterranean have highly been influenced by the international economic development and they still are. Also the political cooperation between the Union and the Middle East by supporting the Union's  economic interests in that region depends on the            political development of the Middle East.                            The relations between the Union and South America did not improve after the accession of Spain and Portugal despite all             expectations. The relations between the Union and South America are not based on a clearly structured concept but consist of      cooperation treaties with regional groups. Not the poorest        countries but the richer ones get the greatest part of the Union's financial aid - similar to the countries of the ASEAN group.  In the treaty of Maastricht of February 1992 for the first time the targets and measures of the Union's development policy were written down. The Treaty for the first time defines the development policy as one of the Union's policies but despite many demands by the European Parliament as well as by a number of member states the Treaty does not imply a greater integration of the development policy nor an increase of the budget.  The future will show, if the accession of the nordic EFTA countries which at least in the past followed a more progressive course in their development policies will effect the concept and the financial situation in a positive way.

<hr><a name="int"><h3>Introduction by the Chairman</h3>

At the end of 1990, the Irish Advisory Council on Development Cooperation (ACDC) invited its
Dutch colleagues from the 'National Advisory Council on Development Cooperation' (NAR), to
exchange, amongst other matters, views on the promotion of collaboration between the various
advisory bodies working in the field of development cooperation. During the preparations for the
workshop -which both advisory bodies had decided upon- possibilities for cooperation at EC level
were primarily considered and looked into. When inviting participants to the workshop, the NAR
decided to start with a smaller group of institutions from the surrounding countries and from countries
which, during the preliminaries to the workshop had shown interest in the idea. Due to the large
differences between these countries -as will become clear further on- in the field of advice on
development cooperation, and because of the decision to invite both government representatives and
representatives of EC institutions, the organisers ended up with a somewhat mixed group of
participants. Partly due to the limited time for preparation, one thing and another led to a less
ambitious plan, whereby the possibility of elaborating on this initiative at a later date was made
explicit.
<p>
During the preliminary preparations for the workshop, the organisers had two means in mind of
improving the more or less absent, or incidental collaboration between the institutions concerned. The
first was the improvement of the performance of national advisory structures, and the second was to
achieve this by aiming at the decision-making which takes place in the EC organisations in the area
of development cooperation. The first mentioned is most probably the easiest to organise. The second
way, although more difficult, is most likely in the long run to be more important, equal to the
increase in authority on development issues at European level. 
<p>
A series of questions arises: Who requests advice?; to whom should it be addressed, the Commission,
the European Parliament?; how are such matters to be given form; in a European advisory council
set up by the Commission? How should this council be assembled?; what authority should it have?.
These and other questions are presented and the participants are invited to give their opinions. As far
as the organisers are concerned, all options are open. It is however, our aim to answer the question
formulated in the title of the workshop affirmatively, and to take the first steps during this meeting
towards a European approach to advisory work in the area of development cooperation.
<p>
<hr><a name="adv"><h3>Advisory Structures in the European Community</h3></a>
<p>
<hr><a name="gb"><h4>United Kingdom</h4></a>

There is no formal structure in the UK equivalent to the Netherlands National Advisory  council on
Development Cooperation. UK aid policy is formulated on the basis of advice and information from
a wide range of sources. The Minister for Overseas Development is advised on aid policy by various
ODA Internal Departments. The Aid policy Department has overall responsibility for developing
ODA's aid strategy and policies. ODA also has specialist departments who lead on particular subjects
such as natural resources and an Environment Department and Health and Population Division which
are staffed by relevant experts. We also have an Economic and Social Division which employs around
50 economists and social development advisers who advise ODA's administrators.
ODA also funds research work in a number of policy and operational areas through the Advisory
Committee which consists of academics. ODA economists advise ODA on what economic and social
research projects we should fund. ODA has an evaluation system which employs independent
evaluators to look at the impact of projects and programmes concentrating particularly on lessons
learned. The Evaluation Reports, which are published, are widely circulated in ODA and new projects
have to take account of their findings. A Parliamentary contribution to British aid policy comes from
both questions to ministers and the detailed reports of specialist committees. 
<p>
Our minister and her advisers in ODA have regular informal contact with a wide range of NGO's and
academic institutions. Two of the leading bodies in this category are the ODI and the IDS. The ODI 
is an independent centre for research, information and discussion on economic and social development
issues. It is engaged in policy-related research on a wide range of issues. It produces a number of
publications, organises meetings and conferences, and runs a scheme for sending young postgraduate
economists to work in developing countries. It also provides Parliament with research and advice. Its
policy work ranges well beyond British aid, into for example the EC, GATT and Bretton Woods. It
receives grants for its research projects and other development-related activities from some 60
different sources, including international agencies, the private sector and ODA itself. The IDS is a
centre for development training and research at Sussex University. It carries out a substantial
programme of research on a wide range of development issues. It does not seek to define an IDS view
on policy questions, preferring to allow a wide range of opinions. As well as research, IDS provides
teaching for administrators, university teachers and graduates, and carries out consultancy work. It
produces publications, organises conferences and workshops and has an extensive library. It is funded
partly by ODA, partly by other sources and partly through fees for its work.
<p>
Supplementing the above mentioned and in answer to questions, an unusual situation in the UK was
noted where the NGO's are concerned.  Besides their foreign aid activities, which can be traced back
to legislation in the UK (the Charity Laws), the NGO's operate increasingly in areas of foreign policy
such as apartheid, the Middle-East question and Cambodia. Thus, tension arises between the original
activities and these more lobby-like ones. The question which arises here is whether or not there is
a risk that these new activities will jeopardise the aid and assistance work (and their financing). For
the time being this question remains unanswered.
<p>
<hr><a name="de"><h4>Germany</h4></a>

Germany has a Council of Advisers to the Minister of Development Cooperation (Wissenschaftlicher
Beirat beim Bundesministerium fr Wirtschafliche Zusammenarbeit). This council was set up in 1963
one year after the establishment of the corresponding ministry. It is the task of the council to consult
the minister on all issues concerning economic cooperation. The council expresses its point of view
on the issues either on the request of the minister or on their own initiative. It is independent of
bodies of the executive or legislative branch of the government, that is the minister, the Parliament
or the corresponding Parliamentary Committee or other institutional bodies.
<p>
The independence of the council is ensured by the recruitment procedure of new members. It is the
sole responsibility of the council to nominate new members who will then be appointed by the
minister. Members are appointed for a term of six years with the possibility of a renewed nomination.
This ensures a certain continuity in the council's work as opposed to more frequent changes of
ministers. The council's statutes make sure that its members represent different academic fields. 
<p>
Most of council members are professors at universities where  research and teaching is mainly
concerned with developing countries. Furthermore, all of the important economic research institutes
in Germany are represented in the council by the principals of the economic development sections.
The council meets at least twice a year. The working groups established by the council meet more
regularly if necessary. It is the task of these working groups, to prepare the council's plenary
discussions themselves and to consult the minister on specific issues. Not following a periodic
schedule, the council organises symposiums on certain issues with  a wider spectrum of participants.
The last meeting dealt with questions of environmental protection in economic cooperation. We
invited experts from various governmental and non-governmental organisations in order to collect
information for the preparation of our own proposal on this topic. In the last two or three years the
council has prepared, among others, expert opinions concerning the following questions: new tasks
and institutions in economic cooperation with least developed countries, rural development in the
1990's, economic development and environmental protection, the system of education in developing
countries and priorities for economic cooperation in the 1990's. Since 1964 about 50 papers on
various issues relating to economic cooperation were published by the council. Moreover, some
shorter expert opinions on actual problems have been published, for instance on the potential
consequences of the European integration for developing countries and the interests of the developing
countries in the on-going GATT round.
<p>
The priorities for the next year in our work are the following: the possibilities of influencing
international migration through instruments of economic cooperation, the relationship between aid to
Eastern Europe and aid for developing countries, the cooperation of EC member countries in their
development policy, health and population policy in Third World countries and sociocultural factors
in economic assistance.
<p>
It is difficult to say how far the council is able to influence the development policy in our country.
Council members in particular, find this a difficult question to touch upon. One of the proposals
which has been followed by the administration is the establishment of priorities on economic
cooperation in the nineties. The council's suggestion was a specification of a catalogue of criteria by
the ministry and the policy implementing institutions. This catalogue comprises criteria concerning
the political and economic order, the social policy and the role of environmental protection in
developing countries. The suggestion that has been taken up is essentially to make the distribution of
aid more dependent on the establishment of favorable political and economic conditions in these fields.
The council's studies and proposals are usually published, this involves a certain amount of influence
on public opinion and thereby also indirectly on the political process. In this way the council has
become part of the public discussion  concerning roles and methods of economic cooperation.
<p>
In answer to questions from the workshop, the German representatives gave the following
information. Although the council considers it a shortcoming, it has not as yet been able to find a
sufficient number of female participants. In general, the council is less knowledgeable on matters
concerning women and development.
<p>
The council regularly gives advice on matters, independent of a request by the minister. Some of
these lead to intensive discussions with the civil servants and others are followed-up to the letter.
Some advice is simply put aside. A rough guess is that 40 to 50% of the advice given is followed.
This fairly low percentage is due to bureaucracy (also present in Germany) and a lack of agreement
between the bodies concerned (Parliament, amongst others) regarding the priorities in the development
debate.
<p>
<hr><a name="dk"><h4>Denmark</h4></a>

First a few remarks on our cooperation with the developing countries, which is frame within which
the council and the Board on Development Cooperation work. Denmark has cooperated with the
developing countries for more than 25 years, and in all these years the participation of advisory
bodies in different levels and organisations has been tradition. Of course many individuals participate
and discuss the aims and the effects of the Danish development assistance. We have in fact had
widespread public support in the area of development cooperation.
<p>
The objectives of Denmark's governmental assistance to developing countries are described in the
Danish International Devlopment Act as the following: to support, in cooperation with the government
and taking into account the resources of these countries, their efforts to achieve economic growth in
order to contribute towards ensuring their social progress and political independence (in accordance
with the United Nations Charter Purposes and fundamental principles), and furthermore, true cultural
collaboration to promote mutual understanding and solidarity.
<p>
This is the very formal frame. The central characteristics of the Danish development assistance are
parity orientations; we only cooperate with the very poor countries. We aim towards a fairly equal
distribution between bilateral and multilateral aid, at sustainability, the full integration of women in
the development process, and in recent years, the promotion of and respect for human rights and the
support of democratization processes in the developing countries. Denmark's official development
assistance has increased steadily over the past years, and we expect to reach 1% of our GNP in 1992.
<p>
Since the mid 1960's we have had  bilateral development cooperation with many countries and in the
'80's we  cooperated with more than 60 countries. During the '80's, to enhance efficiency and
improve aid quality, an extensive planning process with respect to Denmark's future cooperation with
the developing countries was launched. The outcome was summarized in an overall plan for action
for development cooperation for a five-year period. The plan was discussed in the advisory body and
in Parliament. One of the important decisions of this process was that we decided to change all Danish
bilateral assistance to the form of grant aid. Other changes were discussed in the Standing Committee
on Foreign Affairs of the Danish Parliament. The committee recommended a gradual reduction over
a five-year period, of the number of cooperation countries to twenty-five. That means that we had to
almost sever our links with up to 35 or 40 countries. We are now in the middle of this process of
concentrating the Danish bilateral development assistance in fewer countries. We have now selected
twelve countries for our future programme for cooperating countries. It is expected that this process
will take more time and will last more than the stipulated five years.
<p>
We have two advisory bodies and they are both established according to the Danish International
Development Cooperation Act. Both bodies' members are appointed by the minister.The Board of
International Development Cooperation has nine members. It is a rather small group and they are all
appointed in their personal capacity. The minister also appoints a chairman and a vice-chairman. This
board acts in an advisory capacity to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. It publishes its annual report
on its activities and it has a monthly meeting. On the agenda of these monthly meetings there is a
wide range of subjects because the board is, especially in recent years, engaging in a discussion on
the strategies we try to implement in our cooperation countries. Especially now we are entering into
a process whereby we will establish very large programmes in the twenty countries we would like to
cooperate with. Therefore, we are changing the focus, from project-to-project discussions to  more
general and overall, sectoral discussions on the programmes in the countries we cooperate with.
Furthermore, this board receives from the administration all projects and activities on development
exceeding 5 million Danish Krona. All these activities have to be submitted to the board for approval,
and in 1990 it approved 95 proposals for project activities. This means that the board looks into the
various activities which we want to implement in the countries we cooperate with. The chairman is
authorized to grant allocation up to a maximum of 5 million Danish krona. But all activities approved
by the administration, by the chairman, and of course by the board, will be submitted to the board.
Thus, the latter sees all activities approved regarding our bilateral cooperation. 
<p>

The council has a quite different role because it is not really part of the administration's daily work.
The minister appoints the council which sits for three years, as does the board. It has a maximum of
75 members. Members are persons nominated by the public authorities, institutions, organisations, -
also individuals from NGO's who take a special interest in assistance to developing countries-, and
persons who are experts or have experience in the development cooperation work, or have some other
experience relevant to the task assigned to the council. The council's formal mandate is to follow the
board's activities. It is almost a matter of formality, but it gives the council a possibility of discussing
what has been going on in the field of development assistance the previous year. It also receives
different reports, and of course its main task is to give advice and submit recommendations. Our
system is quite different from the systems we have just heard about because it is not so that the
council sits and prepares a report  which is given as a recommendation to the minister. It is more an
exchange of views during the meetings.
<p>
In addition to the above information, the representative from Denmark made the following comments.
Although research institutions in Denmark do not as such sit in either of the advisory bodies, in
practice there is close cooperation between these institutions, for example in the organisation of
meetings, seminars etc. In the council there are representatives from the church, industry, agriculture,
the unions, the sciences and banks. An important fact is that they are not chosen because of those they
represent, or because of their political preferences; what is important is that they contribute to the
council's work in a private capacity, without receiving a salary.
<p>

<hr><a name="ngo"><h4>NGO-EC Liaison Committee</h4></a>

The Liaison Committee was established in 1974. In the beginning it was mainly  the northern NGO's
who wanted to open the EC for the co-financing of their actions in the South. That is how it started,
and as often happens, as soon as you get to know each other you also start to discuss each other's
policy. So, during the past 17 years, these two aims have become the main objectives of the Liaison
Committee, namely; firstly, to make it possible for European NGO's to operate in Brussels. Secondly,
apart from establishing the openness of the EC towards the NGO's, we have a policy dialogue on
different issues of concern for the NGO's on which we consider ourselves capable of giving the EC
an opinion on, thereby trying to influence the development policy of the EC.
<p>
There are now more than 700 NGO's. Every country has an a national assembly of development
NGO's in their relationship with the EC. In some countries it is called the NGO-EC network, others
call themselves 'National Assemblies towards the EC'. There, the different members discuss
development cooperation, their relation with the EC, and also EC policy. So these national platforms,
or national assemblies, come up with an issue and elect their president or their delegate to sit in the
Liaison Committee. The Liaison Committee consists of twelve people. This committee acts on behalf
of their national assembly and has discussions with the European institutions on the many issues. The
highest decision-making power is in the General Assembly which takes place once a year, with
delegations elected from the different member states' NGO's. 
<p>
The relationship with the EC is mainly  with DG-8. However, our contact now also goes beyond DG-
8; it goes to DG-1 (Latin America, Asia, the Mediterranean and Eastern Europe), and DG-6, for
agricultural policy. The work load of the Liaison Committee is rather heavy because the national
delegates are responsible for the organisation of their national platforms and their national NGO-EC
network, whilst at the same time, in their own countries, they have to carry out the decisions taken
in Brussels by the Liaison Committee -which meets five times a year for two days- plus the
recommendations of the General Assembly -which takes place for three days once a year-. They must
also try to influence their own governments regarding the different decisions  taken by the Liaison
Committee. We have five working groups, composed of elected experts per country, on co-financing,
on food matters -which range from the common agricultural policy to food aid-, trade, emergency
aid -which is unfortunately becoming more and more important all the time-, human resources -
originally called volunteers, but  is  now organised a little more widely-, and development education.
<p>
Although of course the European NGO's keep up close contact with the partner organisations in the
South, the Liaison Committees' working field is primarily limited to the mutual coordination of their
common interests at European level.
<p>

<hr><a name="it"><h4>Italy</h4></a>

The Italian section of the NGO-EC Liaison Committee's field of work is twofold. Firstly, the
promotion and improvement of the relationship between the Italian policy on development and Italian
society, and secondly, the evaluation of the Italian NGO's' development projects. Five representatives
of the Liaison Committee have seats in the 'Consultive Committee of the Italian Ministry of Foreign
Affairs'. During a meeting in Rome in  mid- October in 1991, the Italian participants committed
themselves to a policy on, amongst others, development cooperation at European level. This policy
is presented in a report entitled 'Development cooperation:criteria for a new policy (CESPI, paper
presented by Marta Dass, Rome 17-19 October 1991)'. The main features of this policy are twofold.
Firstly, research into the ineffectiveness of international development policy and especially that of
Italy itself. Secondly, research into the consequences for international relationships of ending the Cold
War. Seen in the Italian context, the first aspect has to do with linking the Italian assistance to Italian
workers and with the rapid increase in Italian ODA expenditure -from 0,16% of the GNP in 1981 to
0,40% of the GNP in 1990-. In accordance with international agreements, this percentage should be
increased to 0,7%.
<p>
In this context, it should also be mentioned that a clear outline of planning and aims, as well as
stipulations regarding implementation, are often omitted when setting-up development projects. There
is often a preference for physical infra-structure projects, which is not always in accordance with the
needs of the developing country concerned. In short, where Italian development projects are
concerned, more interests are served than simply those of the poorest groups of inhabitants in
developing countries, for which the help is meant to be.
<p>
Partly due to the above mentioned, the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is planning to contribute
more funds via EC' programmes. The NGO's have urged the ministry to use these funds in particular
for: waging war on poverty, sustainable development, democratization, south-south cooperation, and
refugees.
<p>
In answer to questions, the Italian delegate gave the following information. The appointment of
members of the Consultive Committee is carried out by the minister responsible for development
cooperation and is based on a nomination by institutions which are represented in the committee
(ministries and in most cases social organisations such as unions and employer's organisations,
scientific institutions, local councils and the NGO's).
<p>

<hr><a name="ie"><h4>Republic of Ireland</h4></a>

Mrs Kane, the chairperson of the Irish Advisory Council on Development Cooperation (ACDC)
started her statement by giving an overview of the reactions in the Irish press on the decission to
abolish the ACDC. 
<p>
The Advisory Council on Devlopment Cooperation was established in 1979. It was funded by annual
grants in aid from the Department of Foreign Affairs, in order to advise the government on
development cooperation through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and specifically through the
Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs.
<p>
The ACDC is also supposed to provide a forum for informal discussion on matters relating to
development cooperation and finally, to carry out the tasks at the request of the minister. For
example, we coordinated Ireland's contribution to the Council of Europe's North-South
Interdependence and Solidarity Campaign. Our councils operate for a three-year period, we have
nineteen members at the moment, we are nominated by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and the
chairperson is appointed by the minister. The members are not representative of development interest
groups, we are appointed in a personal capacity, and we include development specialists and
practitoners, academics, members of the business community, state-related bodies, employer's, unions
and so forth. We bridge academic observer's and practitioner's development cooperation and trade,
NGO's and government programmes, relief aid and project development. 
<p>
The current council, and last one, was appointed in December 1989. We have had four chairpersons,
two have been academics, (one an economist, the other an anthropologist), one was the former
director of the Institute for Public Administration, and the other a director of the Agricultural
Institute. The council meets at least four times a year, the executive at least once a month. The
working groups meet about twice a month, although sometimes more frequently. The last council met
nearly 110 times over a period of 33 months. At the moment, we give between ten and fifteen hours
a week to the work of the council. Normally the way we work, through working groups, is to prepare
reports for the government. We have prepared fourteen published reports altogether. (We have given
you a list of our previous publications). We also produce annual submissions on the Irish ODA budget
and specifically on the Bilateral Aid Programme. We hold conferences and we attend occasions like
this. Our reports are prepared either at the specific request of the minister on topics which he
suggests, or on topics which we consider are sufficiently important to draw to the attention of the
government. At the beginning of the current council's sitting, the Ministers for State and for Foreign
Affairs, asked us to undertake two specific reports. One was on gender, women and development,
and the second was an overview of the Irish Aid Programme going back over the last 18 years with
a review and recommendations for future directions of the Aid Programme.
<p>
In June 1990 we met with the Development Committee of the European Parliament and one of the
questions which a delegate asked us there was, were we a para-political body, given the nature of our
structure? I think you can see now from the kinds of criticisms we have made and our report of the
overview of the Irish Aid Programme that the last thing we are is a para-political body. It has been
said that everybody is in favour of general economy and particular expenditure. We think that
advisory councils are a particular economy. We are glad therefore to be talking here today about a
cooperative role in the establishment of a European body and we think that parallel with this, we must
talk about the importance of the establishment of such bodies in each donor country. We would be
pleased to hear any advice which any organisation has here to give us on continuing our fight to
maintain the advisory council, because we are continuing! We are particularly happy  to have heard
from the Danish representative because one of our recommendations suggests that we model our
board, within the Department of Foreign Affairs, on the Danish board. So, any kind of advice or
support that you can give to us, we would be very glad to receive and take back to Ireland.
<p>
Clarifying the previous information and in answer to the questions of members of the workshop, the
following supplementary remarks were made. In the judgement of Mrs. Kane, an important motive
for the abolition of the ACDC lies in the increasing aversion of the government (read:civil servants)
to criticism of their activities. The present members of government responsible for the Irish
development policy  are not particularly interested in the development issue. In Irish society there is
a great interest in development problems. However, there is little awareness of the fact that beside
the Irish NGO programmes -which are well-approved by the public-, the government itself also
implements a large assistance programme. Although the Irish NGO's voiced great support for ACDC,
it was not possible from within Parliament, to stop the political decision being taken to abolish the
ACDC.
<p>

<hr><a name="nl"><h4>The Netherlands</h4></a>

In the early 1960's, when there was growing public interest in development cooperation, the
Netherlands' government decided that it should try to involve as many sections of society as possible
in its aid policy. Thus the National Advisory Council on Devlopment Cooperation was installed on
the 22nd of January 1964. 
<p>
It is the responsibility of the NAR to advise the minister for development cooperation, and through
him or her the government, on Dutch development cooperation. It may make reports on its own
initiative or at the request of the minister. The council is composed in such a way as to represent as
broad a cross-section of Dutch society as possible, drawing on the academic community, industry,
politics, the trade union movement, religious organisations, etc. For its first seven years the council
was chaired by Professor J. Tinbergen. Professor E.W. Hommes has been chairman of the council
since the 12th of November 1990.
<p>
At present the council has 70 members. The minister for development cooperation appoints the
chairperson and the members. Appointment is on the basis of personal expertise and an active interest
in development cooperation. The council has its own budget of 0,5 million Dutch Guilders, out of
which the travel expenses and holiday money for the chairman and vice-chairman are covered, as well
as the organisation of workshops and expenses involved in the production and circulation of
publications etc.
<p>
The council is assisted by an official secretariat, which forms part of the Policy Planning Section (SA)
of the Directorate-General for International Cooperation at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
<p>
Recommendations are drawn up by working parties and are submitted for approval to the council's
Plenary Meeting. The day-to-day running of the council is taken care of by the bureau. This is
composed of the chairperson and vice-chairperson(s) of the NAR, a number of council members and
the chairpersons of the working parties. The bureau's tasks include forming the working parties.
<p>
Since its inception, the council has given its opinion on many aspects of development problems in
over a hundred publications. Recommendations have been made on such subjects as trade policy
towards developing countries, women in development, the role of foreign investors and the problem
of multinational companies, employment in developing countries, environmental problems and the
administrative and management capacity in sub-Saharan Africa. Its most recent recommendations are
listed in appendix IV of this report. Most of the recommendations are translated into English, French
and, occasionally, Spanish.
<p>
Once determined, advice is sent to the minister and to third parties (Parliament, the press, NGO's
etc). The minister must respond. Before making a formal, written reply, the present minister for
development cooperation reacts in the first place to the advice by having an open discussion with the
council. The whole process, both the preparation as well as the determination of the advice, is carried
out in a mutually open atmosphere between the council and the department.
<p>

<hr><a name="be"><h4>Belgium</h4></a>

Although the Belgian Advisory Council for Development Cooperation exists on paper, it must be said
that it has not as such met recently. The council was set up in 1962 at the same time as the Belgian
Development Cooperation Programme. Its task should be viewed in the light of the desired
organisational structure for Belgian Development Cooperation. The first part of which concerns a
ministerial committee which had primarily a decision-making task and secondly, the Advisory Council
whose task it was to prepare for decision-making at policy level. The official administrative machine
was established to implement the decisions of the ministerial committee. From the beginning the
Advisory Council has been confronted with problems; the ministerial committee responsible for
decision-making was never effectively established, so the functional relationship between the
committee and the Advisory Council could never exist.
<p>
The council was composed of two groups. The first of which consists of representatives of interest
groups concerned with development cooperation, namely, the NGO's, the employers and the unions.
The second group, in total about 35 members, is comprised of a number of experts/specialists in the
area of development cooperation. The Advisory Council always attempted to reach decisions on the
advice on the basis of consensus.
<p>
This strive for consensus decision-making, led rapidly to a situation in which the contents of the
advice given, consisted only of the often scanty aspects on which consensus had been reached. The
council has never been able to enjoy great interest being taken by the Belgian politicians and ministers
for development cooperation. An illustration of this is the fact that in '77 it was stated by Royal
decree that the minister for development cooperation must ask the council for advice on matters
concerning the budget for development cooperation. This has never been put into practice. Advice
issued by the council has never been published. This latter point is also contrary to the Royal decree
of 1977, which states explicitly that the advice of the Advisory Council must be published.
<p>
In short, it is true to say that the Belgian Advisory Council has never had any real influence on public
opinion regarding development cooperation, nor on policy in this field. In the '80's, the Advisory
Council gradually stopped its activities. In the mean time a number of specifically sectoral advisory
councils have been set up. One in the area of university cooperation and another in the field of the
NGO's. It is being considered whether to establish such advisory structures for other sectoral
activities.
<p>

<hr><a name="ec"><h4>European Commission</h4></a>

For about thirty years,  the European Commission has  been involved with the implementation of a
development programme. There are areas where the commission does and can carry out her work
well, and others in which this is not sufficiently the case. In the field of development cooperation,
due to lack of capacity, the commission is unable to adequately answer all the policy questions on
development. On the other hand, at European level, the policy side of development is increasingly
being discussed. The European Commission is therefore especially interested in advice from bodies
which are already active in European member states. It is convinced that independent advisory bodies
can assist in the formulation of a number of policy questions at European level.
<p>
The commission intends in 1992 -possibly on the basis of advice from existing advisory bodies in the
European Community- to propose a development policy which will be coordinated and determined
at European level. This intention must be regarded in the light of the view of the European
Commission, that there can only be question of a European Development Policy when all the
executive organisations concerned with the policy, agree on a number of basic principles in this field.
The last 25 years have shown that coordination at European level is of no use, if at that level
agreement is not reached regarding a number of elementary starting-points; especially on the issues
of aims, priorities, implementation stipulations and instruments for European development policy. The
advisory bodies as represented in the workshop, form a 'trait d'union' between current events and the
policy formulated at national level and the common development policy which should be formulated
at European level.
<p>
In the framework of the European Political Union (EPU), there has been mention of a chapter on
Development Policy and the coordination of Development Cooperation at European level being
included in the text on the Treaty. The European Commission would like make the following
interpretation: the intention is not the transfer of money or people from the member states to Brussels,
but rather that at policy level, consensus at European level is reached.
<p>

<hr><a name="exp"><h3>Exploratory discussions on Items for Common Advice</h3></a>
<p>
<hr><a name="sus"><h4>Sustainable Development</h4></a>

In 1978, long before the environmental and ecological problems were the important items in
development policy they are today, the NAR issued advice on ecology and development. The present
NAR working group on environment has already issued advice in the form of letters; one on the
tropical rain forest, one on  environment and trade and a third one on the preparations for the
UNCED conference, which will be held in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, in July 1992.  In the following,
two aspects of the issue will be elaborated on; firstly the main features regarding the environment and
development, and secondly, the conclusion that it is (almost) impossible to solve a number of these
issues adequately at national level, thus making them suitable for an approach at multilateral and
European level.
<p>
The issue of environment and development can be summarized as the dilemma between, on the one
hand poverty, and on the other hand the lack of environmental means to do any thing about it. This
means, that in order to fight poverty it is essential that the natural resources should be redistributed
in a balanced manner. In the advice which is being prepared at the moment by the NAR, attention
is given to the situation in which the poorest inhabitants find themselves and to the environmental
problems which are linked to this, as well as to the situation in which the wealthier part of the world's
population find themselves.
<p>
The starting point for the NAR's advice is sustainable development; the definition of this term is taken
from the 'Brundtland report' and is as follows: 'Development that meets the needs of the present
[generation] without compromising the ability of future generations to meet all their needs'. Two key
terms are central here: Needs, -particularly the essential needs of the world's poor-, and the idea of
limitations imposed by the state of technology, social organization and the environment's ability to
meet present and future needs. In general one may say that in the Netherlands there is increasing
awareness of the fact that when talking about international environmental issues, attention must be
paid to the pattern of consumption in the wealthy parts of the world, and therefore also in the
Netherlands. Possibilities for development are increasingly becoming viewed in the light of the
restrictions the environment places on economic growth. In other words, development will have to
take place within these limiting conditions. 
<p>
Why is a national approach to environmental problems inadequate? When studying the
Brundtlandreport one fairly quickly arrives at the conclusion that the issues mentioned cannot be
adequately dealt with, let alone solved, at a national level. The European level is the first level at
which can be worked in a meaningful way on answers to find solutions. A second illustration can be
found by looking at the general views on development. These are ready for fundamental  reviewing
but this is not a job one can carry out alone. To do this, it is necessary  to reach general consensus
within a broader context on what should, or should not, be defined as sustainable development and
on the way in which the concept should be used. A third factor is, that keeping in view the restricted,
conditional availability of environmental use, world-wide, the developing countries are in a position
to negotiate. In the future these countries will decide for an important part, what their share of the
available environment will be, since the most economic growth will take place in these countries. This
means that both rich and poor must get together and discuss the use of the restricted amount of the
available environment. A fourth point is that in order to decide the long term possibilities for
sustainable development, there must be international agreement regarding the integration of
environmental costs in economic cost-benefit analysis. Especial attention is paid in the NAR's advice
to the relationship between 'gender issues' and the environmental issue.
<p>
In an explanatory statement on the advice recently issued by the German Scientific Advisory Council
(Wissenschaftlicher Beirat), it was pointed out that the possibilities for a more comprehensive
approach to the international environmental issue via development cooperation, are fairly limited. This
is due to the fact that a series of policy issues in the environmental field lie outside the direct sphere
of activity of the Ministry for Economic Cooperation in Germany. Thus, the advice consisted of a
number of smaller changes in present policy. Otherwise, the boundaries of the present development
cooperation policy would have been crossed.
<p>
Another important point made in the Wissenschaftlicher Beirat's advice, was that the political,
administrative and legal structure in developing countries is without doubt inadequate, when it comes
to developing a responsible policy on the environment. Various possibilities of improving the
conditions from within Germany were looked into. Besides this, an important part of the advice was
dedicated to working out an Environmental Impact Statement on the development projects which were
being implemented by German development cooperation. It was also pointed out, that to avoid  a
project being approved by a EC member state whilst, on the basis of an Environmental Impact
Statement check list, it would be disqualified by another member, coordination at European level is
of vital importance. Certainly, for practical reasons this is the case. To the disappointment of the
Wissenschaftlicher Beirat, this advice is just one of the examples of the lack of interest in following
up advice, shown by either the minister or Parliament. 
<p>
The representative of the IDS from the UK, illustrated a number of environmental issues which are
being researched by his institution. The first is the dilemma which exists between on the one hand,
the interests of the environmental movement, which wants to conserve as much of the environment
as possible for the future, and on the other hand the poverty issue. Fighting poverty entails directing
a large amount of the conditionally available environment to improve the conditions of the very poor.
A second theme researched by the IDS, is that of the 'Moral Economy'. Experiences in Asia have
shown that without the interference of the government, concerted activity to protect the environment
has arisen. In contrast, in Africa for example, no such common social mechanism is present. 
<p>
Another subject where the role of the EC is of importance, is the issue of environment and trade. At
the end of the present Uruguay trade rounds, this issue will be given a prominent place on the agenda
of the GATT. However, the GATT has insufficient means to link up with international environmental
policy. Therefore this issue should be discussed at length at European Community level. This could
be an interesting area for an eventual European advisory council.
<p>
Generally speaking, it became clear during the discussion that the problem of sustainable development
is regarded differently by the various countries.
<p>

<hr><a name="mig"><h4>Migration to the Community</h4></a>

The subject of migration to the community will be introduced with the help of three items. The first
concerns migration flows in Europe, the second, the prospects, and the third the possibilities of doing
anything about these flows and the resulting problems, on a bilateral level. This latter point is related
to the advice over migration which the NAR recently issued to the minister for development
cooperation. 
<p>
The first point, migration flows in Europe: after the Second World War, as a direct consequence of
the war, some 20 million people were on the move.  The period 1950 to 1970, witnessed many
migrants from Southern Europe coming to West Europe to assist in the process of economic growth.
From the middle of the '70's, the decline in economic growth was accompanied by a dramatic decline
in the number of migrants from the South. 
<p>
At the same time, the impediments for migration increased along with the number of illegal
immigrants settling in West Europe. At the present, it's estimated that about 3 million people reside
in the European Community without the official papers. A new phenomenon, is the trade in women
for prostitution in West Europe. Not much is known about this issue, including the extent to which
this goes on. In the '80's, policy on foreign laborers changed, from policy aimed at the immigration
of labour to policy aimed at the integration of ethnic minorities in society. The numbers of refugees
and of those seeking asylum also increase. If this trend consolidates, these groups will exceed in
number, the legal immigrants in countries in the European Council. Social tension increases along
with the admission of large numbers of refugees and asylum seekers.
<p>
The second point concerns the prospects: this item should be viewed in the light of the fact that in
recent years (especially in '89) about 1,3 million refugees have settled in West Europe. Furthermore,
the disintegration of the former Warsaw Pact countries is relevant here. A number of questions arise.
Questions which concern matters at a European level. Will policy efforts be aimed at the 'integration'
of all these refugees from other countries or at the maximum return of these people? Should Europe
develop policy in order to be prepared for massive migration to the community at all? And if the
answer is positive, how? Should the migration of skilled laborers from Eastern Europe to the West
be promoted above the migration from Third World countries?  And  how then should we view policy
on development? Should development policy contain a new provision, namely that the receiving
country implement a migration policy? In practice, (as was recently mentioned by the Swedish
Minister for Social Affairs), people don't flee to wealth but primarily from poverty. 
<p>
In the framework of the NAR's advice on migration and bilateral development cooperation, the
possibilities of contributing to solutions to the migration issue in the bilateral development policy,
were looked into. The working group within the NAR came to the main conclusion that the migration
issue should be an integral part of the policy consultation carried out with the developing country in
question. Another important issue was that of the highly-educated workers. What possibilities exist
within the framework of subsidy policy, to prevent the highly educated leaving their country for an
attractive job abroad? Also looked into was the possibility of increasing tuition fees in such a way that
when students leave their country, they are required firstly to pay back the amount -which originally
had the form of a grant-as a loan, to the government which had provided them with both the
education and the loan. Furthermore, it was suggested that the developing country itself try to
increase the attractiveness of the working climate for the highly educated. Another important
conclusion the working group presented in their advice, was that the bilateral development policy is
really totally inadequate when it comes to solving the complex migration issue. Besides this, the
National Advisory Council came to the conclusion that this is a field which lends itself to an approach
at European level. 
<p>
In the discussion which followed the introduction of the NAR's above mentioned advice, it was stated
that if migration from 'Magreb-countries' is to be hindered, it is questionable whether development
cooperation policy is the appropriate instrument to achieve this. The consequence being that one
chooses to shift development cooperation funds from poor countries to countries from which migration
takes place to the European Community. Another remark concerned the cause of large- scale
migration. This lies mostly in the sudden en dramatic collapse of countries where the migrating
population lives. In addition, one can imagine the consequences for the developing countries of a
programme of 'structural adjustment', which is implemented in a  dramatically poor economic
situation, and which could lead to certain groups whose needs are not met, migrating and seeking
welfare in other countries.
<p>
Furthermore, there is also of course a situation of permanent pressure on people in developing
countries to move. The differences between poor and rich are permanent, and studies in Central
America show that between 2 and 12 million people from this region have moved to the United States
in the last years. In other words, even without large scale calamities, there is permanent pressure to
migrate to the industrialized countries. 
<p>
Another aspect which was drawn attention to during the discussion, was that of the relationship
between development and migration. Migration is a short term, political problem; development is a
long term problem. Why do people migrate? They migrate because they are in acute need. They have
no jobs. How can these be created? By ensuring that in the long term, proper development takes
place. These are solutions which take a period of 10 to 20 years, whilst, as already stated, migration
manifests itself on the short term. In other words, when migration is placed on the agenda of
development cooperation, this means that priorities will change. Priorities which are of a short-term
nature, which detracts from the long-term aim of sustainable development. A principal question was
raised regarding the possibilities of solving the migration issue via foreign aid. After all, the
contribution of foreign aid to the development of developing countries is small as such, let alone
making possible the prevention of migration. Added to this, it was remarked that it may not be so
wise to advise a minister when requested on this matter. In other words, isn't it the task of the
advisory committee to make clear that the relationship between development, foreign aid and
migration is so diffuse that it is almost impossible to make relevant statements on the matter,  let
alone give advice for policy making?
<p>

<hr><a name="eff"><h4>Effects of the Changes in Central and Eastern Europe on the Third World</h4></a>

Adrian Hewitt from the ODI, who introduced this subject, noted that it is a good idea to remember
the situation in the Third World at the time the changes in East and Central Europe took place. The
latter took place at a time that the situation was extremely bad, especially on the African continent.
Within a short time,  remarks from Africa were heard stating that the changes in Central and Eastern
Europe were expected to have particularly negative effects on their economy. Especially because
commercial and financial interests would shift from South to Central and Eastern Europe. An
important starting point for the ODI research into these effects, was not just to concentrate on the
possible shift in trade flows as a result of the changes, but also to study the possibilities for 'trade
creation'. 
<p>
Remarkable, was that in the mid of 1990 the donors reacted correctly to these changes; which means
that almost without exception, they stated that programmes aimed at Central and Eastern Europe
should be seen as completely independent from those for the benefit of developing countries.
Important exceptions to this were the United States, Italy and Sweden. An important outcome of the
ODI research was that no hard proof was found for the view that a massive aid shift from South to
East was taking place. This finding was contrary to the current opinion. A similar and comparable
conclusion could be made regarding the competition for loans. That loans benefiting the East would
be detrimental to loans benefiting the countries in the South, was out of the question. This does not
rule out increased competition in the field of commerce, something which as such need not be viewed
negatively. On the other hand, one must remember that the demand for tropical products in Eastern
Europe was severely repressed. The goods were simply not available. There may be  possibilities in
this area for extending trade in tropical products to the former Eastern bloc. 
<p>
What did change due to the upheaval in Central and Eastern Europe, was the public consciousness.
And there was especially a large shift in the attention of international policy makers from the issue
of developing countries, to the 'more modern' issue of the transition to a more market orientated,
democratically orientated establishment in Central and Eastern Europe. In this connection, it was also
remarkable how quickly the European Bank for Recovery and Development (EBRD) was established,
with in her mandate clearly politically orientated articles which one would not (often) be likely to
come across elsewhere in the international banking world. 
<p>
Along with these issues, a number of problems arise which make the mutual tuning-in of policy at
European level interesting. The first question is whether aid to Central and Eastern Europe can be
classified under 'ODA performance'. A discussion on this is taking place at this moment in the
Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the OECD in Paris. Furthermore, there is the question
of whether this aid is additional or not. It was remarked that although one could talk initially of an
additional programme, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish between programmes aimed at
the South and at former Warsaw Pact countries. Another matter is that of the aid-vacuum that has
arisen because the former Warsaw Pact countries have stopped giving foreign aid. Furthermore, there
is the matter of food assistance which was provided in great quantities last winter. Linked to this, is
the more encompassing question of how the EC policy can best support the changes in the former
Warsaw Pact?
<p>
A new impulse has been given, with the upheaval in Central and Eastern Europe, by the discussion
on the definition of 'developing countries'. A number of traditional developing countries have reached
such a degree of development that one must question whether they should still qualify to be treated
as such. On the other hand, there are parts of the former Soviet Union which, when they become
independent, will most likely fall under the definition of 'developing country'. Possibly, there are also
countries to be found in Europe (Albania) which qualify for assistance. In general, the concept of
developing country is also subject to change. Traditional criteria are supplemented by others, as for
example happened in the latest 'Human Development Report'. World-wide, much will have to change
institutionally. For example, one can imagine the improvement of international policy making; the
eventual establishment of a really international organisation for commerce, instead of a temporary
agreement, such as the GATT. Moreover, the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD itself
is more or less a product of the Cold War. There too, a number of adjustments will have to be made.
<p>
During the discussion following this introduction, the differences and in fact, the large measure of
similarity between the analyses carried out by the ODI and the NAR, were pointed out. When
calculating the effects, the NAR aimed at the long term and not at what is already manifest; there is
relatively little proof that negative economic effects are already manifest. However, long term analysis
based on scenarios -such as those of the NAR-, show that especially economically (trade and financial
flows), there could be effects which would be particularly negative for Africa. This is due to the fact
that the largest East bloc country, the former Soviet Union, possesses and exports commodities which
are similar to those of Africa, namely, oil and raw materials. In the long term, the possibility exists
that if the Soviet Union does effectively exploit them, there will be a world-wide negative price
movement which could be detrimental to Africa. Besides this -and this is even more difficult to judge
in the long term- there is the question of how governments will react to the changed situation. The
NAR's scenario analysis shows what the effects could be if enormous amounts (tens of billions of
dollars) were to be channeled in the direction of Central and Eastern Europe, for these areas and for
the South. Here too, clear conclusions can be formed.
<p>
Another important change which has taken place (and fairly sudden, compared to the situation at the
end of 1989), is that donors have altered their views on the developing countries and the issue of
Development. Donors now talk profusely of democracy, human rights, pluralities, restriction of
military expenses, and are not above stipulating conditions on their activities. Up until 1989, the
rather scandalous situation existed, that wealthy countries were prepared to do business in the
economic field and also in the area of development cooperation, with Third world countries with
politically very dubious regimes.
<p>
On the matter of the competition between East and South,  regarding international financial means
and trade, it was pointed out that there need not so much be question of a division, but more of a
global approach to the problems in developing countries, whereby universal values should be brought
forward and implemented, in a pragmatic manner. One can't help the very poor with ideology, but
by concrete measures, irrespective of the country of domicile. It is possible that ending the Cold War
will result in such saving on defence budgets that various activities which were not developed in the
past, can be now. In this connection, the  achievement of the aim that 0,7% of the GNP be spent on
foreign aid, comes to mind. From the German delegation came the remark that the items which were
brought forward during the workshop, and the accompanying documentation, will be of great value
for the preparation of the activities in this field, which they intend to develop in 1992. This is a prime
example of how European collaboration and exchange of information should take place.
<p>
The study of WIDER (Finland) was mentioned, in which the ending of the Cold War was linked to
sustainable development.  The possibility of using the 'Peace dividend' (the saving on military
expenses) for environmental investments, in such a way that a world-wide change from a polluting
method of production and consumption to an 'environmentally sound' production systems can take
place (Lal Jayawardena). From this, it became clear that -in the long run- peace dividends should be
large enough to make these investments and changes in production possible.
<p>

<hr><a name="oda"><h4>ODA performance</h4></a>

This subject was placed on the agenda at the request of the Irish delegation and was therefore
introduced by this delegation. This is an important political item on the agenda in Ireland, also
especially  because, according to the latest information from the DAC, Ireland is now gatekeeper of
the EC in the field of ODA performance. Ireland spent this year, 0,18% of the GNP on ODA, whilst
a number of other countries in the European Community have reached or surpassed the target of 0,7%
GNP.
<p>
In total, the EC  contributes to 40% of the assistance given by the international donor community.
It is for this reason that the Irish delegation feels that a discussion at European level can be important
in providing new incentives for a discussion at national level. Also in Ireland there is much pressure
to divert existing funds for development cooperation to other activities. Examples of this are
transferals for the benefit of relieving the effects of the Gulf War, assisting countries in Eastern
Europe -Rumania was especially mentioned here-, which creates the impression that politically in
Ireland, the original definition of assistance has become a sort of melting pot. In other words, even
if there were an improved ODA performance in Ireland, it is uncertain what this would involve. The
activities of the Irish Advisory Council for Development Cooperation to improve the ODA
performance have been numerous, but without result. Also, activities of the local NGO's, which
grouped themselves under the name 'Campaign Aid', aimed at improving the ODA performance of
the Irish foreign aid have had no success up to now. 
<p>
In the discussion following the introduction, it was emphasised that it could be important to make a
distinction in the ODA discussion between, on the one hand research into what is internationally
necessary (this is more or less agreed as being the 0,7%), and on the other hand research on a
scientific level into the impediments for citizens, governments and societies to reach this ODA target.
What are the concrete factors which have stood in the way of reaching this target and which strategies
could be successful in reaching it? These are areas in which an advisory council could do good work.
Another way is to act as a political pressure group  within the various countries within the
community. This lies less in the field of competence of an advisory council; there are other
organisations, other bodies necessary which can carry out lobbying activities.
<p>
Also, renewed attention was asked (see paragraph 3.3) for the arising discussion on what one should
define as ODA. The ODA definition is heterogeneous and is also subject to development and change.
The list of countries should be reviewed. Besides this, there is the discussion on and the question of
whether costs which go with sustainable development and which result from an ecologically
responsible development, should be placed within, or on top of the target. A suggestion from Norway
in this connection, is to reserve 0,1% of the 0,7% target for ecologically sound activities. This means
that with the same amount, other activities than strict development cooperation activities must be
included ('externalities'). Matters which were previously excluded, now fall under the same ODA
target.
<p>
In order to make any meaningful  correlation between the aid offered by donors and the eventual
results in the form of development in the Third World, one must look not only at the amount of
assistance offered, but also into the conditions under which aid is given and its final impact. It was
pointed out that during the last decades the growth in the amount of aid has stagnated. Why is this,
and why is there permanent pressure on the aid budget to finance all sorts of other activities ? The
answer should be seen in the light of the increasing criticism of and the discussion on the effectiveness
of the assistance. The problem here is that it is difficult to prove that the aid is effective; this is
because the amount of help given is so small compared to the size of the problems. Moreover the
ethical motives for the provision of assistance are being hollowed out. The question arises whether
it would be useful to link up with the migration issue. People from poor countries will continue to
migrate to wealthier ones, as long as there is underdevelopment in the former. It cannot be expected
that migration will decrease in the short term  with increased assistance. At least, as long as the
increase in assistance is enough to generate development. 
<p>
Another problem which can become manifest by increasing aid, is the limited absorbtion capacity.
In practice, it appears extremely difficult to distribute rapidly growing aid well, to enlarge the
absorbtion capacity in the short term. This means that requests from developing countries for
increased assistance, will be looked into carefully. It must be noted that there is absolutely no question
internationally of 'overall aid fatigue'. When analysing the development aid flows of recent years, the
stagnation can be explained for the most part by the decrease in the aid efforts of two large donors.
Two important donors, namely the United States and the United Kingdom, have decreased their aid
efforts, whilst a number have remained the same. However, the majority has increased the aid,
resulting thus in a differentiated picture of the stagnation in aid and not in a general one. In the matter
of the effectiveness of aid, one must take this differentiation into account. There are examples of how
it should not be done, but also many examples of how aid has helped. The latter must be explained
and extended in order to realise and increase the output and effectiveness of the aid (work of small
technological institutions with en enormous impact). 
<p>
Furthermore, a lance was broken for bringing development into the lime light and the attention of a
larger public, in a different way. Up until now, foreign aid is associated with dying people. Maybe
its time, after 30 years, to dispense with this picture and to concentrate on the successes. Examples
of successes are that the last 40 years the life expectation of people in developing countries has
increased by 50%, the mortality rate of children under 5 years of age has been reduced by 1/3, the
number of doctors in the same period has doubled  compared to the population growth. The last 40
years the level of literacy has increased from 33% to 60%. Ten years ago, only 10% of the children
were vaccinated, this has increased to 50%.
<p>

<hr><a name="pro"><h3>Prospects of the Coordination of Advisory Work</h3></a>
<p>
<h4>Improving Advisory Structures at  National level</h4>

When dealing with the question of how the advisory structures in the European Community can be
improved at national level, a number of options were looked at. Besides these options, a number of
variations were discussed as well as how these options could be put into practice. First, an outline
of the options will be given and then the comments on their implementation.
<p>
The first option which was discussed thoroughly was the 'pooling' of information. Information on the
activities of existing advisory structures,  reports on the work already carried out and the exchange
of work programmes, with outlines of the future work programmes of the various advisory bodies
and research institutions. During the discussion it became clear that the aim was not setting up a new
structure, but that more work should be carried out through the coordination of the existing ones. For
example, coordination in the field of a number of research projects, which can be carried out
collectively, or separately, but then at the same time.
<p>
The second option which was brought forward, was to look into the extent to which present research,
carried out for example in the framework of EADI, contains policy relevant aspects. Particularly,
attention should be paid to the specific role played by advisory bodies, namely the conversion of
existing information and research to policy modifications on development issues.
<p>
During the discussion on these and other options, it soon became clear that if one is to have any
influence at European level, it is of utmost importance that priority be given to increasing the number
of countries participating in these activities to include the whole of the community. This means that
4 or 5 more member states must be involved in the process, in the initiative regarding the
coordination of advisory structures in the EC. During the workshop, the delegate from Italy declared
his willingness to seek relevant contacts in Spain, Greece and Portugal, to inform them of the
workshop's initiative and to ask them if they would be interested in participating in the follow-up. In
addition, because of their chairmanship of the EC Minister's Council during the first half of 1992,
especial attention  should be given to approaching the Portuguese. 
<p>
The third, more pragmatic option, was to organise on an ad-hoc basis, thematic meetings on one
specific subject relevant to more than one member state. This could moreover, be relevant for the
mutual adjustment of policy advice at European level.
<p>
A fourth suggestion which was made, was to start research in which a comparison could be made
between the experiences at national level on advising in the field of development cooperation.
<p>
More in general, in response to the portrayal of the advisory situation in Ireland and Belgian, it was
pointed out that it is important that advisory structures exist or are otherwise kept in existence at
national level. In addition, it was remarked that in countries where an advisory structure does not
exist, one must avoid high expectations concerning the possibility that a decision will be taken to
found a national advisory body. The participants of the workshop decided that the chairman, on behalf
of those present, will write a letter to the Irish Government explaining the European initiative, and
stating that the members of the workshop would highly appreciate it if the Irish Government would
make a -future- contribution from Ireland to advisory work at European level possible. 
<p>
Besides the above mentioned options, attention was paid during the discussion to the question of how
to translate these into concrete actions. The first variant was the suggestion to relate this initiative via
the EADI network. This would have as advantage that connection is made with an existing network
which, due to its academic nature, has some affiliation with the work of advisory bodies. 
<p>
On the other hand, during the discussion the disadvantages of joining up with the EADI network were
emphasised. In particular, the specific nature of advisory organisations, making policy
recommendations on the basis of academic information, inhibits linking up with the EADI network.
<p>
Moreover, the variant, working via Brussels and in particular the Commission, became more popular.
Precedents from the past were pointed out, whereby some means or another had been found to bring
similar initiatives to life within the Commission. In the case of such an initiative being given enough
priority, there are possibilities of for example, stationing someone by the  Commission and of
eventually financing this from the Commission's external funds.
<p>
Furthermore, the question was raised as to why the organisations represented in the workshop don't
themselves take the initiative to work on some of the advice, instead of seeking a third party, such
as the EADI, or institutions from Brussels. Disadvantage of the latter (Brussels), is that this would
cost time, whereas the workshop prefers to lay the emphasis on a fairly speedy follow-up.
<p>
The first concrete and practical step could be the extension of the mailing-list of the different advisory
bodies and research institutions in the European Community to all those present and interested in the
European initiative. Thus, a direct connection with the above mentioned first option could be
achieved.
<p>
Concerning the implementation of the third option of organising ad-hoc meetings, the following was
brought forward. For the benefit of common advisory work, it would be important to begin a
discussion on one or two subjects with a specific European dimension. In this way an incremental
process could be started, whereby, during a period of 3 to 5 years, could be worked towards the more
powerful establishment of a European advisory structure. This would mean that during the ad-hoc
meetings, besides working on advice on one or two subjects, (whereby, particularly  activities taking
place specifically at European level come to mind), time must be spent on extending the mutual
collaboration.
<p>
This latter point, which is dealt with fairly extensively,  concerns the question: how does one ensure
that advice is followed up? It is of utmost importance that it is clear who is requesting advice and if
possible, it should be those influencing policy making. Should one consider the  Commission, or, in
the light of the discussion on development cooperation in the European Political Union, the European
Parliament, eventually the European Parliament's Commission for Development Cooperation, or
maybe the Council of Ministers.
<p>

<h4>Improving Advisory Structures at  European Level</h4>

During the discussion on this agenda item, three options became clear. A first option concerned the
organisation of a meeting whereby a subject would be placed on the agenda, and whereby an attempt
would be made to come to a unanimous determination of the position of this subject. The subject
matter would have to be particularly relevant to a policy area specifically germane at European level
(see also option 3 from paragraph 4.1). During this meeting, attention should be paid, besides the
discussion with respect to content, to the development towards a more connected group of European
advisory councils and research institutions. This option can be considered as the slowest or least
ambitious option, or as the incremental approach.
<p>
The second suggestion which was made, was to form a federation, a collaboration of the national
advisory bodies already existing in the European member states, with the aim of eventually growing
to become an advisory structure at European level. This growth process  from a national to a
European organisation is something which has already taken place in various fields, and which is
suited to the field of advice on development cooperation. When this idea of a federation gains force,
it may cause other member states of the EC, which do not have such national advisory bodies, to
enter into a discussion about whether or not they will establish one.
<p>
The third and most far reaching option, the fast option, concerns the immediate establishment of a
formal European advisory structure. One could consider representation from each member state by
one person, whereby in countries where an advisory body exists, preference be given to someone
appointed by that body. In cases where no such advisory councils exist, one could consider someone
from, for example, the academic community being delegated to this European advisory council.
<p>
During the discussion on the various options, out of which during the workshop no choice was made,
2 themes were repeatedly brought forward. The first is that of effectiveness versus democracy. The
second concerns what was called, 'the effective demand'. Who asks for advice, for whom is it
intended and who is going to use it? As far as the first theme is concerned, it was observed that there
is a trade off between effectiveness and democracy. Democracy demands that all member states be
present in European collaboration. Effectiveness, however, demands where possible that work should
be carried out in small groups, ad hoc groups of experts, working preferably non politically and not
by definition striving for consensus. A possible solution to the above which was offered, was that all
member states should be involved when determining the priority of the -to be agreed upon- agenda
items,  as well as in the final decision on advice. The research itself could be carried out by a smaller
group. As far as representation in the European advisory council is concerned, preference was given
to starting with the academic community. There are other good reasons to be given for representation
from the NGO world and other interest groups.
<p>
The question of the 'effective demand' was brought forward in the light of experiences in the EC with
the Economic and Social Committee. This should constitute a warning against establishing a European
advisory committee without clear indication of who is asking for advice and whether those making
the request are interested, or directly involved in the decision-making on European policy. Besides
this, there is the question of the involvement of the population within the EC and the EC countries'
interests in using their tax-money well. As the above mentioned has made clear, the Commission has
shown great interest in the initiative taken by the ACDC and the NAR. Germany also has shown
much interest in the establishment of an advisory approach at European level. The interest of the
commission should be seen partly in the light of the fact that in the European Political Union, a treaty
text on Development Cooperation has been included. The Commission will make suggestions
regarding the completion of these texts. In addition, the Commission needs advice from existing
advisory bodies in the EC. In anticipation of this, the advisory councils can start a discussion on an
issue manifest at European level, for which, in the judgement of the advisory councils themselves,
good advice would be extremely desirable. Examples from the past show that good advice creates its
own demand.
<p>
IDS showed willingness to look into the possibilities of organising a meeting in the autumn of 1992,
during which should be worked along two lines. Firstly, a discussion on a (preferably European)
subject. Among the suggestions were: good governance, migration, sustainable development, effects
of the changes in Central and Eastern Europe on developing countries, ODA performance, stabex,
etc. This initiative was applauded from various sides and support for the further preparation was
promised.
<p>
As a concrete result of the discussion on 'effective demand', it was suggested that the present advisory
bodies prepare an advice whereby  the communication structure in the field of development
cooperation at European level is studied. This concerns, amongst others the relationship between the
European Parliament and the national ones, the relationship of the  Commission with the Council of
Ministers. This advice could be of importance for determining the position on the activities which
should eventually be implemented by a European advisory council.
<p>
At the end of the discussion on both themes in chapter 4, the chairman stated that a number of options
had been brought forward, and that it was not intended to make a choice from one of these during
this meeting. The value of the meeting should rather be seen in the development of these options and
the stimulation of further discussion on them. In the follow-up to this workshop and a preliminary
to the following meeting in the autumn of 1992, there will be consultation with all parties concerned
regarding the matters to receive attention.
<p>

<hr><a name="sum"><h3>Summary; Objective, Conclusions and Follow-up</h3></a>
<p>
<h4>Objective</h4>

The objective of the workshop was to find an answer to the question whether there is a need and
necessity for cooperation between advisory councils on development cooperation and similar
institutions in the member states of the EC. The aim of the NAR was to answer this question
affirmatively.
<p>
<h4>Conclusions</h4>

The presentation of the statements introducing and explaining the advisory structure of each
participating country showed that there are big differences. Some councils advise on policy issues,
like the German Beirat and the NAR, others, like the Danish councils, advise on projects and
programmes. In the United Kingdom, there is no advisory council, but there is a range of academic
institutions and NGOs who have links with the Overseas Development Administration. Parliamentary
scrutiny bodies in the UK use professional advice to an important extent.
<p>
Several options were revealed on the role an advisory council can play. Should it be an academic
body, like the German council, with contacts with the policy makers of the ministry concerned or
should be more of a lobby group without any formal contacts with a ministry?
<p>
At first, the discussions on the possibilities of cooperation were held on the basis of three topics. It
became evident that although for all participating councils and institutes these were relevant issues in
the near future, they were looked upon from different viewpoints.
<p>
Furthermore, it turned out that the NGOs had already built up a European advisory structure by
creating its NGO-EC Liaison Committee based in Brussels. In fact the Italian participant in this
workshop was the national representative at this Liaison Committee.
<p>
First conclusion: There is a need for a comparative study, analysing the different advisory structures
for development cooperation in the EC countries. The European Commission could play an important
role in bringing this about.
<p>
Second conclusion: Exchange of information and knowledge is only the first step towards the creation
of a documentation and information centre. It was regarded as useful, certainly by 'Brussels', to
establish such a centre. The representatives of Commissioner Mar¡n made it clear that there is a
demand. They would like to gain access to the information and knowledge available in Europe, since
the commission expects to present more policy based papers in the coming years.
<p>
Third conclusion: Mr. John Toye, Director of the IDS, will take the initiative to organise a meeting
in the second half of 1992, when the United Kingdom holds the presidency of the EC. At this
meeting, dedicated to one Europe-wide policy issue (such as good governance, migration, sustainable
development, effects of the changes in Central and Eastern Europe on developing countries, ODA
performance, and stabex), the participants will try to mobilize and coordinate the existing knowledge
and to write an integrated report. In the sidelines of this meeting, attention will be paid to the further
institutionalisation of a European advisory structure.
<p>
During this workshop no formal steps were taken to come to an institutionalization of the exchange
of information between the participants of the workshop, although some participants, notably the
German representatives, were willing to do so.
<p>
<h4>Follow-up</h4>
<ul>
<li>The proceedings of this workshop will be made available to the participants and other interested
persons and institutions at the end of January 1992.
<p>
<li>The Italian participants offered to identify and contact those in charge of the advisory work on
development cooperation in Portugal, Spain and Greece.
<p>
<li>The workshop concluded that its chairman would write a letter to the Irish Minister of State for
Development Co-operation on the issue of the abolition of the Irish council ACDC. There is important
work to be done in the area of advisory work on aid policy. We hope that Ireland will be able to
contribute in the future through its own national advisory body for development cooperation.
The situation in Belgium also gives occasion for concern.
<p>
<li>In mid-February 1992, consultations will take place between those organising the meeting in
the United Kingdom and the chairman of the NAR. If possible, Portuguese representatives will be
involved in this meeting.
<p>
<li>There will be a meeting in March 1992 between the chairman of the NAR, representatives from
the United Kingdom and Germany, and the cabinet of EC-Commissioner Mar¡n to discuss further
steps.
<p>
<li>The Workshop stated that it would like to welcome at its next meeting, participants from all
twelve EC member states. Besides the countries already mentioned, special efforts will be made to
involve France in this initiative.
<p>
<li>The next meeting will be in the United Kingdom, autumn 1992.

<B>1 EUROPEAN UNION SUMMIT IN FLORENCE</B>
<P>
The European Heads of State and Government who attended the European
Council meeting in Florence over the weekend several issues external
relations.   When Africa was brought up the situation in the Great
Lakes Region dominated the discussion.  The Council pushed the
long standing EU position which is to call for the organisation
of a regional conference under the joint auspices of the UN and
the OAU to address the root causes of the conflicts.  There was
also support and encouragement for the EU Special Envoy to Great
Lakes Regions and for the efforts of former President Nyerere
in his endeavours to find a peace acceptable to all.  There was
also some discussion of the idea to organise a joint EU-African
summit aimed at strengthening peace and democracy in Africa. 
This idea was first put forward my European Commissioner Pinheiro
last month.
<P>
The European Council expressed the great importance it attaches
to the Mediterranean dimension of the European Union and approved
of the progress made so far under the Declaration on the Euro-Mediterranean
partnership from Barcelona 1995.  On Asia, the recent summit of
Asian and European Leaders in Bangkok was saluted by the European
Council.  The efforts of China to restructure its economy were
also noted.  The European Council made a point of stressing its
desire to see the further development of the rule of law and more
committed respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. 
It feels that the present policy of a constructive dialogue with
China is the best way to achieve this progress.
<P>
In a separate statement before the summit got under way, the Italian
Presidency of the EU issued a statement on the Great Lakes Region
and in particular on Burundi.  The ideas expressed included those
later endorsed by the European Council together with an appeal
to the Heads of State who signed the Cairo and Tunis Declarations
to comply with the undertakings they gave at those meetings
<P>
<B>2 ECONOMIC RECOVERY CONFIRMED IN AFRICA</B>
<P>
The African Continent showed signs of recovery in 1995, according
to the latest report from the United Nations body - the Economic
Commission for Africa (ECA).  GDP growth across the whole of the
continent was 2.4% in 1995, compared to 2.1% in 1994 and a miserable
0.7% in 1993.  2.4% still is not a great deal.  With the headline
figure for growth at 2.4%, the claims for a recovery seem a little
overstated.  However, a more encouraging piece of news was that
the record of the 33 poorest countries in the region have improved
dramatically.  In 1995 the average growth rate for these countries
was +2.4, compared to -2.4% in 1993 and -1.6% in 1994.
<P>
Commodities prices were relatively high in 1995, which resulted
in an increase of 11.1% in export earnings over 1994.  Another
sector which performed very well was the manufacturing industries,
which grew by 4.12%.  However, the agricultural sector, which
accounts for the daily work of most of the continents people,
was dull with a growth of just 1.5%.  This average figure obscures
regional variations including the serious loss of production in
the southern african region, which was down 7% on 1994.
<P>
The idea of a recovery looks even more limited in scope when you
consider that the population of Africa is increasing at 2.9% per
year.  Therefore the 2.4% growth in the economy represents a fall
in 
<P>
GDP per capita.  However, the results are encouraging in so far
as they are heading in the right direction.  The full text of
this report will become available on the internet in the near
future.  You can pay the ECA a visit at their webb site - http:/www.sas.unpenn.edu/African_Studies/ECA/AfEcMenu.html
<P>
<B>3 EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT SPEAKS OUT FOR HUMAN RIGHTS</B>
<P>
During its Plenary session in Strasbourg last week, the European
Parliament adopted a total of nine resolutions on human rights
issues.  The highlights  were
<P>
I) East Timor - EP condemns military oppression and calls for
the immediate release of all political prisoners.   The European
Commission in invited to draw up a report on the situation in
East Timor and on human rights violation in Indonesia.
<P>
ii) Nigeria - the EP invited the AU to isolate Nigeria politically.
 Following the killing of Mrs. Abiola the Parliament voted in
favour of an increase in the sanctions against Nigeria and for
the release of all political prisoners.
<P>
iii) Burma - The EP strongly condemns the abuse of human rights
in Burma and especially the new law approved by slorc banning
the National League for Democracy.  
<P>
iv) Burundi - The Parliament strongly condemned the killing of
three Swiss members of the International Committee of the Red
Cross and demanded an in-depth and objective inquiry into their
deaths.  However, the European Parliament urged the Commission
no to close its delegation to Burundi and to maintain its humanitarian
aid.  They also called for the creation of an international force,
the implementation of the Carcassone plan, and the provision of
assistance to re-establish a legal system.
<P>
Other resolutions dealt with China, Turkey, Belarus, and Chile
with one further resolution criticised a member state of the EU
- namely Britain - for its detention of a radical Sikh journalist
called Raghbir Singh Johal.  The Parliament called on the British
Government to either prove his complicity in cases of international
terrorism or to release him immediately.
<P>
<B>4 A NEW FISHERIES DEAL FOR MAURITANIA</B>
<P>
In the face of growing concern and campaigning action over the
effect of EU fishing deals on the development of poorer countries,
the EU and Mauritania initialed a new five year fisheries agreement
on 20 June which will come into effect on the first day of August
this year.  The agreement allows for a staggering 150% increase
in the authorised tonnage from 76,050 to 184,392.  The price to
be paid to the government of Mauritania for these access rights
is 266.8 million ECU over the five year period.  53 MECU will
come from contributions form the fishing boats themselves.  The
rest is from European tax money.  
<P>
The deal does not include rules for compulsory off-loading in
Mauritania, thereby denying the opportunity to develop a local
fish processing industry to benefit from the increased exploitation
of Mauritania waters.  There will be a brief two month biological
rest period of two moths in September/October to allow fish stocks
to be replenished.
<P>
<B>5 OED FIGURES FOR OFFICIAL AID </B>
<P>
Some new figures published by the Development Assistance Committee
of the OECD shows a continued drop in the level of official development
aid (ODA) during 1995.  At 0.27% of the GDP of  aid giving countries
this is the lowest level of aid since the United Nations adopted
the target of 0.7% in 1970.  Only the Netherlands increased its
assistance in 1995.  France continues to be the G7 member with
the highest ODA/GDP ration but here there was a reduction of 12%
in real.  
<P>
The headline figure for total ODA stood at $59 billion in 1995,
a drop of 9.3% in real terms. <HR>

<h3>Why is Finland involved in development cooperation?</h3></center>
<hr>
<p>
The primary motive for our involvement in development cooperation is a desire to help those in less fortunate circumstances than ourselves, and thereby to promote peace and prosperity throughout the world.<p>

A deepening concern for the future of our planet has emerged alongside the conventional sphere of development cooperation in recent years. More attention is being paid to global issues, from poverty and development problems to population growth and environmental protection. Refugeeism resulting from political instability, armed conflict and natural disasters has emerged as another critical problem. Crises of a global scale can only be solved through cooperation between industrial and developing countries.<p>
<hr size=3>
<ul>
<li><h4>Objectives</h4>

<img src="keihas72.gif" align=right>Development cooperation is that part of foreign policy through which Finland strives

<ul><li>to promote sustainable development and well-being in developing countries
<li>to contribute to the establishment of peace, equality, democratic conditions and human rights in these countries and
<li>to further interaction between Finland and developing countries.</ul><p>

<hr size=3>

<li><h4>Principles</h4>
The states, international organizations and other bodies with which Finland is engaged in development cooperation must commit themselves to the following three objectives:
<ol>
<li>to reduce the wide-spread poverty in developing countries
<li>to combat global threats to the environment by helping the developing countries to solve their environmental problems and
<li>to promote social equality, democracy and human rights in the developing countries.<p></ol>

The main principle of Finland's development cooperation is that a developing country is responsible for its own development. Thus the donor's role is always merely a supportive one. <a href="strategy.html">The strategy for Finland's development cooperation</a> in the 1990s was adopted in 1993.<p>

</ul>
<hr size=3>

<h3>How much public funds are spent on development aid</h3>

Finland attained the UN target level for development aid (0.7% of GDP) in 1991. The same year, the Government began cutting funds allocated for development cooperation. In 1992, appropriations were cut to 0.4% of GDP. The aim is to restore the level of appropriations to 0.7% of GDP as soon as the economic recovery so permits.
<hr size=3>
<h3>How much Finland spends on aid compared to other countries</h3>

In 1993, disbursements for official development cooperation corresponded to 0.45% of GDP, which was below the level of the other Nordic countries (Denmark 1.03%, Norway 1.01%, and Sweden 0.97%).

Cuts in funding have entailed a marked downscaling of activities. Only one in four of the 200 bilateral development cooperation projects under way in 1992 could be continued as originally planned. Other projects have had to be scaled down, rescheduled, postponed or suspended. Very few new projects have been launched. Finland has substantially reduced its contributions to UN development programmes and funds. Finland's contributions to the international financial institutions have likewise declined.


<h4>Official development aid of some OECD countries as a percentage of GDP in 1993</h4>
<pre>
Country		% of GDP
Denmark		1.03
Norway		1.01
Sweden		0.97
The Netherlands	0.81
France 		0.63
Finland		0.45
EU average	0.42
OECD average	0.29

Beleidsvoorbereidend Onderzoek Inzake Ontwikkelingssamenwerking<P> door<I> Kristien Verbrugghen</I>
</h2>
<h4>Tekst van een artikel verschenen in <I>Universiteit & Beleid</I>, vol. 9, no. 4, 1995: pp. 44-49
<p></h4>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<B>In uitvoering van de op 26 september 1994 door de VL.I.R. en Staatssecretaris voor 
Ontwikkelingssamenwerking E. DERYCKE afgesloten overeenkomst m.b.t. beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking (BVO), organiseerde de VL.I.R. in het voorjaar van 1995 de selectie van projecten voor BVO 1995. In dit artikel wordt uiteengezet hoe de selectie werd georganiseerd en wat het resultaat hiervan is. Dit artikel blikt tenslotte vooruit op 1996, het jaar waarin de Vlaamse universiteiten hun beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO vorm willen geven. 
<P>
De procedure voor de selectie van projecten voor BVO 1995 bestond achtereenvolgens uit het bepalen van drie algemene en drie punctuele thema's, het lanceren van de oproep tot de Vlaamse universiteiten tot het indienen van voorstellen, het evalueren van de 16 ingediende projectvoorstellen door de bevoegde VL.I.R.-deskundigencommissie, het formuleren van het definitief VL.I.R.-advies, het bespreken van het VL.I.R.-advies door de Stuurgroep en de definitieve selectie van 8 projecten door de Staatssecretaris.
</B>
<P>
<H4>1. BELEIDSVOORBEREIDEND ONDERZOEK INZAKE ONTWIKKELINGSSAMENWERKING 1995</H4>
<P>
<H4>Concept van beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek</H4>
<P>
Op 26 september 1994 werd door de VL.I.R. een overeenkomst ondertekend met Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking E. DERYCKE m.b.t. de organisatie van het beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek en de advisering op het vlak van ontwikkelingssamenwerking (BVO). Deze Overeenkomst regelt de bijdrage van de VL.I.R. tot de organisatie en uitvoering van wetenschappelijk onderzoek en studies die worden opgezet met het oog op de ondersteuning van het overheidsbeleid inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Het doel is enerzijds het versterken van de analytische capaciteiten van het ABOS, en anderzijds het cre&#235;ren binnen de universiteiten van kennis over de ontwikkelingsproblematiek waarop het beleid inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking een beroep kan doen. 
<P>
<H4>Bepaling van de thema's voor BVO 1995</H4>
<P>
Artikel 6 van bovenvermelde Overeenkomst stipuleert dat de Staatssecretaris, bij het begin van elk jaar, op voorstel van het ABOS en na raadpleging van de Stuurgroep "Beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek" - die is samengesteld uit vertegenwoordigers van het Kabinet, het ABOS en de universiteiten -, de thema's voor BVO vastlegt. De IODEWE - Interuniversitaire Overlegstructuur Derde Wereld - richtte op vraag van de Stuurgroep op 22 december 1994 een schrijven tot alle Rectoren en tot alle leden van de IODEWE met de vraag voorstellen voor thema's voor BVO 1995 in te dienen v&#243;&#243;r 16 januari 1995. Deze universitaire voorstellen werden, tezamen met de ABOS-voorstellen, door de Stuurgroep op 24 januari 1995 besproken, op basis waarvan de Stuurgroep een advies aan de Staatssecretaris formuleerde. 
<P>
In navolging van de eerder door de Stuurgroep genomen beslissing om het aantal thema's enerzijds te beperken en anderzijds aan te houden gedurende twee &#224; drie jaar, met het oog op het vergroten van de continuteit in het onderzoek en op een mogelijke taakverdeling tussen de Vlaamse universiteiten, werden drie algemene thema's geselecteerd : politiek-juridische dimensie van het ontwikkelingsstreven, armoedebestrijding en macro-economische dimensie van ontwikkeling. Daarnaast werden nog drie thema's bepaald voor kortlopend, punctueel onderzoek : wegtransport versus spoorwegvervoer in Afrika, universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking : een strategisch onderzoek, en twinning arrangements als vorm van ondersteuning van het onderwijs in derde-wereldlanden. Dit advies van de Stuurgroep werd door het ABOS aan de Staatssecretaris overgemaakt. Op 20 februari 1995 ontving de VL.I.R. van de Staatssecretaris de definitieve lijst met thema's voor BVO 1995. Deze lijst verschilde op &#233;&#233;n punt van het advies van de Stuurgroep : het thema "ecologie en duurzame ontwikkeling" dat aanvankelijk door de Stuurgroep, op aandringen van het ABOS, was afgevoerd, was nu t&#243;ch opgenomen als thema voor punctueel onderzoek.
<P>
<H4>Budget BVO 1995</H4>

De globale toelage voor BVO 1995 bedraagt minstens 15 miljoen BF. Hiervan is 1 miljoen BF bestemd als tussenkomst van het ABOS in de door de VL.I.R. gemaakte kosten naar aanleiding van de administratieve ondersteuning van het BVO. In maart 1995 werd door Staatssecretaris E. DERYCKE voorgesteld om van het bijkomend krediet van 100 mio BF toegekend aan universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking, 1 mio BF toe te voegen aan het budget voor BVO 1995. Hiervan zal 500 000 BF bestemd zijn voor punctueel advies b&#250;iten de BVO-thema's. Deze bijkomende uitgave moet echter nog door het nieuwe Parlement worden goedgekeurd. De Stuurgroep besliste bovendien reeds tijdens haar eerste vergadering op 20 december 1994 om, ter bekrachtiging van een eerder door de Staatssecretaris genomen beslissing, het lopend onderzoeksproject "Early warning systems" van Prof. R. DOOM (RUG) te verlengen op de kredieten voor BVO 1995, a rato van 825 000 BF. Het te verdelen budget voor BVO 1995 bedraagt derhalve minstens 13 175 000 BF, wellicht 13 675 000 BF. Ongeveer 80 % van dit budget is bestemd voor de financiering van onderzoeksprojecten kaderend in &#233;&#233;n van de algemene thema's; 20 % is voorbehouden voor onderzoek kaderend in &#233;&#233;n van de punctuele thema's. 
<P>
<H4>Vraag naar universitaire projectvoorstellen voor BVO 1995</H4>
<P>
Op 21 februari 1995 werden de Vlaamse universiteiten uitgenodigd om onderzoeksvoorstellen voor BVO 1995 bij de VL.I.R. in te dienen, uiterlijk op 3 april 1995. Onderzoeksvoorstellen dienden zoveel mogelijk te kaderen of in &#233;&#233;n van de algemene thema's of in &#233;&#233;n van de thema's voor punctueel onderzoek voor BVO 1995. Het stond de universiteiten echter ook vrij voorstellen in te dienen buiten de BVO-thema's; de kans dat deze voorstellen voor financiering zouden worden geselecteerd, was echter aanzienlijk veel kleiner dan voor de thema's die door de Staatssecretaris werden vooropgesteld. Zowel de VL.I.R. als de Staatssecretaris moedigden de Vlaamse universiteiten aan interuniversitaire projecten in te dienen. 
<P>
<H4>Prioriteitsrangschikking van de ingediende projectvoorstellen</H4>
<P>
Op 20 april 1995 werden de 16 ingediende projectvoorstellen voorgelegd aan de VL.I.R.-deskundigencommissie "Beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek", die werd samengesteld uit leden uit de VL.I.R.-deskundigencommissies "Humane wetenschappen" en "Economische en toegepaste economische wetenschappen", de VL.I.R.-Werkgroep "Ontwikkelingssamenwerking" en de voormalige VL.I.R.-Stuurgroep "Beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek". Aan de commissie werd gevraagd een prioriteitsrangschikking van de projectvoorstellen op te maken. Hiertoe heeft de commissie ondermeer gesprekken gevoerd met de promotoren van de projectvoorstellen. Hierbij dient aangestipt dat het in de bedoeling lag van het VL.I.R.-secretariaat om, op basis van de beoordeling van individuele projectvoorstellen en met het oog op het uitbouwen van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming en interuniversitaire samenwerking, over te gaan tot het vormen van interuniversitaire projectgroepen. De commissie is het secretariaat hierin gevolgd voor wat het thema van armoedebestrijding betreft : het is een verdienste te noemen dat daags na de commissievergadering de promotoren van de drie weerhouden projecten rond het thema van armoedebestrijding zich principieel akkoord hebben verklaard tot het beter afstemmen op mekaar van elk van de drie projecten. Hiertoe werd door de promotoren een intentieverklaring opgesteld. Voor wat de overige thema's betreft, heeft de commissie de individuele projecten beoordeeld en naar prioriteit gerangschikt, zonder in dit stadium interuniversitaire samenwerking expliciet in de projecten in te bouwen. De commissie ging er echter wel mee akkoord dat in het licht van de voorbereiding van BVO 1996 zou worden nagedacht over hoe de indienings- en selectieprocedures zouden kunnen worden aangepast met het oog op het uitstippelen van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming en interuniversitaire samenwerking. De VL.I.R. verklaarde zich op 4 mei 1995 akkoord met de door de deskundigencommissie opgestelde prioriteitsrangschikking.
<P>
Op 9 mei 1995 kwam de Stuurgroep opnieuw samen om, op basis van het VL.I.R.-advies, een gezamenlijk advies aan de Staatssecretaris te formuleren m.b.t. te financieren onderzoeksvoorstellen. Het VL.I.R.-advies werd op alle punten gevolgd, met uitzondering van het volgende : er werd beslist het project rond sociale clausules van Prof. D. VAN DEN BULCKE (RUCA) te verdagen naar de volgende indieningsronde omdat de vraag tot verlenging voorbarig was - het BVO 1994-project rond sociale clausules werd pas op 1 februari 1995 opgestart -, omdat de Stuurgroep de resultaten van het lopend onderzoek wou afwachten, en omdat de beleidsrelevantie voor het ABOS niet echt duidelijk was. Voorts werd beslist het interuniversitair project over universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking dat door de VL.I.R. zelf werd ingediend, w&#233;l op te nemen in de lijst van te financieren projecten, zonder het echter in de prioriteitsrangschikking op te nemen. Het project kreeg het label "buiten categorie". De Stuurgroep was het immers eens over de noodzaak om een moment van evaluatie in te bouwen in de huidige praktijk van universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking, gelet op de nieuwe Overeenkomst m.b.t. universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking die de Vlaamse universiteiten op het punt stonden af te sluiten met de Staatssecretaris. Het is echter wel de bedoeling dat tussen het VL.I.R.-project en het project van Prof. R. DEVISCH, dat dezelfde thematiek behandelt, een nauwe samenwerking en informatie-uitwisseling wordt gerealiseerd. Het advies van de Stuurgroep werd door het ABOS aan de Staatssecretaris overgemaakt.
<P>
<H4>Definitieve selectie van BVO 1995-projecten</H4>
<P>
Op 2 juni 1995 ontving de VL.I.R. het officieel schrijven van Staatssecretaris E. DERYCKE m.b.t. de definitieve selectie van onderzoeksprojecten voor BVO 1995. Met zijn selectie komt de Staatssecretaris tegemoet aan het advies dat de Stuurgroep hieromtrent had geformuleerd. De projecten zullen vermoedelijk in het najaar van 1995 worden opgestart.

<H4>2. BELEIDSVOORBEREIDEND ONDERZOEK INZAKE ONTWIKKELINGSSAMENWERKING 1996 : VOORBEREIDING VAN HET TE VOEREN BELEID VAN ZWAARTEPUNTVORMING
</H4>
<P>
<B>De VL.I.R. beoogt om in het kader van BVO 1996 een gedegen, interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO te concipi&#235;ren en te voeren, en hiermee de toon te zetten voor de komende jaren. Hiervoor rekent de VL.I.R. op de constructieve inbreng van de Vlaamse universiteiten, die recent werden verzocht hun concrete voorstellen voor thema's waarrond continu zwaartepuntonderzoek dient te worden uitgebouwd, aan de VL.I.R. over te maken.
</B>
<P>
<H4>Situering</H4>
<P>
De VL.I.R. heeft van bij het opstarten van het beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek de noodzaak beklemtoond van het uitstippelen door de Vlaamse universiteiten van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO. De visie van de VL.I.R. op onderzoek dat gericht is op de voorbereiding van het overheidsbeleid inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking kan alsvolgt worden samengevat:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>met dit onderzoek moet ingespeeld kunnen worden op beleidsvragen van de overheid;

<LI>teneinde op de vragen van de overheid te kunnen inspelen, moet het BVO dat aan de universiteiten wordt uitgevoerd, versterkt worden;
<LI>dit onderzoek moet van internationaal niveau zijn, i.e. van dermate kwaliteit dat het internationaal meespeelt. Dit veronderstelt zwaartepuntvorming  aansluitend bij bestaand onderzoek en de eigen inspanningen van de universiteiten waarbij dit zwaartepuntonderzoek moet kunnen rekenen op voldoende sterke en continue financile ondersteuning. Een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming sluit echter geenszins vernieuwing uit;
<LI>het BVO vormt op Vlaams niveau best een geco&#246;rdineerd geheel, waarbij rekening moet worden gehouden met het zwaartepuntonderzoek in Franstalig Belgi&#235; en internationaal. Vanzelfsprekend wordt interuniversitaire samenwerking rond zwaartepunten aanbevolen;
<LI>het BVO moet tevens de belangstelling voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking in de universiteiten z&#233;lf levendig houden. Daarom dient het best te berusten op onderzoekskernen in verschillende universiteiten.
</UL>
<P>
Dat het de VL.I.R. ernst is wanneer aangedrongen wordt op geco&#246;rdineerde zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO, blijkt uit het op 16 juni 1995 door de VL.I.R. aan de Staatssecretaris voorgestelde meerjarenprogramma voor indirecte universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Een dergelijk meerjarenprogramma wordt vereist door de nieuwe Overeenkomst inzake universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking die onlangs tussen de VL.I.R. en de Staatssecretaris werd afgesloten. In dit meerjarenprogramma wordt voorzien dat het BVO-budget geleidelijk zou toenemen van 16 mio BF in 1995 tot 35 mio BF in 2000, op voorwaarde echter dat hier tegenover een duidelijk geconcipieerd interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming rond een beperkt aantal thema's staat.
<P>
<H4>Themata</H4>
<P>
De Vlaamse universiteiten moeten zich derhalve beraden over het antwoord op de vraag rond welke thematieken zij continu zwaartepuntonderzoek in het BVO wensen uit te bouwen. Het antwoord op deze vraag hangt enerzijds samen met het Vlaams, universitair potentieel inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking, i.e. er dient te worden nagegaan wie op dit ogenblik bezig is met ontwikkelingsrelevant onderzoek rond welke problematiek. Anderzijds hangt het antwoord samen met het beleid dat de Vlaamse universiteiten m.b.t. het BVO willen voeren en de eigen inspanningen die zij ervoor willen leveren. Bij het bepalen van de zwaartepunten dient voorts ook rekening te worden gehouden met het zwaartepuntonderzoek dat elders rond ontwikkelingssamenwerking wordt bedreven, ondermeer door de Franstalige universiteiten, alsook met de internationale agenda's en de actualiteit.
<P>
In de loop van de maand september 1995 zal de Stuurgroep "Beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek" de voorbereidingen voor het BVO 1996 opstarten. Dit omvat in de eerste plaats het bepalen van de prioritaire thema's waarrond onderzoek zal worden uitgevoerd. 
<P>
De Stuurgroep heeft in december 1994 beslist om, vanaf BVO 1995, jaarlijks slechts een beperkt aantal algemene thema's te selecteren, die gedurende een eerste periode van 2 &#224; 3 jaar zouden worden behouden. Voor dit beperkt aantal algemene thema's zou &#177; 80 % van het beschikbare BVO-budget worden uitgetrokken; deresterende 20 % van het budget zou worden voorbehouden voor 1 of 2 punctuele thema's voor kortlopend onderzoek, die wel veranderlijk zouden zijn per jaar. Hierbij dient gewezen op het onderscheid tussen algemene en punctuele thema's. Algemene thema's zijn thema's die gedurende meerdere jaren worden aangehouden en die doorgaans vrij breed zullen worden gedefinieerd zodanig dat de mogelijkheid bestaat om op gezette tijden andere deelaspecten van eenzelfde problematiek te bestuderen. Punctuele thema's zijn thema's die jaarlijks zullen wijzigen. In het kader hiervan zal enerzijds kortlopend onderzoek worden verricht naar actuele en zeer specifieke problemen. Anderzijds zal via dit kanaal kortlopend onderzoek worden verricht om de relevantie van een bepaalde problematiek aan te kaarten, wat impliceert dat de mogelijkheid bestaat dat punctuele thema's kunnen uitgroeien tot zwaartepunten. Het onderzoek dat wordt verricht rond punctuele en algemene thema's is gericht resp. op beleidsconceptie en op beleidsvoorbereiding en -implementatie. De beslissing om het BVO aldus te organiseren, was een eerste aanzet tot het uitstippelen en voeren van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO.
<P>
Het ligt in de bedoeling van de VL.I.R. om in het kader van BVO 1996 een gedegen, interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO te concipi&#235;&#235;ren en te voeren, en hiermee de toon te zetten voor de komende jaren. Hiervoor rekent de VL.I.R. op de constructieve inbreng van de Vlaamse universiteiten. Op 17 juli 1995 werden de Vlaamse universiteiten derhalve door de VL.I.R. uitgenodigd tot het formuleren van voorstellen voor prioritaire thema's voor BVO 1996, zowel voor algemene als voor punctuele thema's, uiterlijk op 11 september 1995. Deze voorstellen zullen door de VL.I.R. als input worden gebruikt om een interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO te ontwerpen. 
<P>
Tenslotte dient vermeld dat de Stuurgroep, bij het formuleren van haar advies m.b.t. de thema's voor BVO 1996, de drie algemene thema's voor BVO 1995 - "politiek-juridische dimensie van het ontwikkelingsstreven", "armoedebestrijding", en "macro-economische dimensie van ontwikkeling" - weliswaar indien mogelijk zal trachten te behouden, maar deze toch slechts eerder als voorlopige opties zal beschouwen, gelet op het feit dat deze drie thema's met een minimum aan universitaire inbreng en in een zeer kort tijdsbestek werden bepaald.

Development Co-operation Review of Belgium<br>Summary and Conclusions<P>

<hr>
<h4>This Report</h4>
The OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) conducts periodic reviews to improve the individual and collective development co-operation efforts of its members.
<p>
The peer review is prepared by the Secretariat and involves staff from development agencies in other DAC member countries. A draft report of the team is prepared by the Secretariat and it forms the basis for a review meeting with the member.
<p>
This publication contains the conclusions as agreed by DAC following the review meeting on 24 November 1994, as well as the report prepared by the Secretariat team.
<p>
<h4>Main Points</h4>
While Belgian aid accounted for 0.39 of gross national product in 1994, volume declined by 3 per cent in real terms. Budget restrictions forced Belgium to temporarily abandon ints target for aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP by the year 2000 or shortly thereafter. The report identifies three major "areas for concern." First, the need for a clearly articulated strategy; second, a concentration on a few countries with major setbacks in the aid programme; and third, a shortage of personnel.
<p>
For several years, Belgium has been trying to concentrate its assistance to a more limited number of countries, so far with little success. Thematically, aid is directed towards social infrastructure (health and education); themes identified as having high priority in coming years are gender and environmental protection.
<p>
The AGCD administers most of the aid programme. Recently re-organised, it still faces chronic staff shortages. The AGCD has been investigating ways to decentralise the management of its field operations, notably through a joint management system that gives greater responsibilities to the recipients. Efforts alre also being made to enhance cooperation and coordination between the AGCD and Belgian development NGO's.
<p>
Within the AGCD, a monitoring and evaluation unit has been created to assess aid activities and to communicate lessons to the aid community in Belgium and elsewhere.

<hr><a name="org"><h3>Organisation of Belgian Development Cooperation</h3></a>
Official development cooperation started in the early 1960s, based on Belgium's historical
relations in Central Africa (Zaire, Rwanda, Burundi), a missionary tradition and the
importance attached to the functioning of the UN system. Public support for private
development cooperation activities has always been considerable, linked to a positive
attitude towards support for Third World problems in general. There seems to be a general
scepticism towards governmental cooperation programmes.
<p>
Net official development assistance in 1992 stood at US $ 865 million, or 0.39 per cent of
GNP. After a substantial increase in 1989/90, the volume of ODA decreased in 1992 when it
reached the 1988 level, which was the lowest percentage for two decades. With a decreasing
GNP, this is a decrease in real terms. Part of the 1992 allocations remained undisbursed.
Prospects are uncertain; increases are not expected, however. The aid volume target of 0.7
per cent ODA of GNP, repeatedly stated since 1970 was not mentioned after 1992. Multilateral
aid comprises around one-third of total ODA, with considerable variations in volume over the
years. 19 per cent of ODA was disbursed to the EU in 1992 and 18 per cent to other bilateral
institutions, mainly to the World Bank Group and as obligatory contributions to UN
institutions.

<a name="ins"><h3><hr>Institutional Framework</h3></a>

Official development cooperation is not based on an organic law but on numerous royal
decrees and administrative decisions from 1961 onwards. Several laws in other areas
concern specific components of development cooperation, mainly financing of aid. 
<p>
Depending on the domestic political situation, development cooperation is the responsibility
of a State Secretary (under different Ministers), a Minister of Development Cooperation or
the Minister of Foreign Affairs (MFA). In the present Government development cooperation
is spread over several ministries, of which the Ministries of Finance and External Trade
appear the most influential. 60 to 70 per cent of the budget is under the responsibility of a
State Secretary for Development Cooperation -or Minister of Development Cooperation, who
is not a member of the Cabinet- under the Minister of Foreign Affairs. The MFA manages the
bilateral programme, technical programmes and part of the financial and the multilateral aid.
The Ministry of Finance handles around 30 per cent: contributions to the World Bank group
and to regional banks, and state approved loans (the latter in cooperation with the Ministry
of External Trade). Around 2 per cent of the cooperation funds is managed by the Ministry
of Defence for military cooperation. The Ministry of Education handles nearly 1 per cent of
the total development budget for research institutes and universities, and specific
fellowships and expert sending programmes. The MFA handles, outside the aid
administration, part of the development budget for refugee aid, military training and for
compensation of nationalised property in Zaire. EU questions are the responsibility of the
Ministry of External Trade and European Affairs. 
<p>
Within the MFA development cooperation is managed by the General Administration for
Development Cooperation (AGCD or ABOS in Flemish) under the Minister of Development
Cooperation. AGCD, started mainly as an expert sending organisation in 1962, has since
been reorganised several times (based on studies by external consultants), in 1971, 1976,
1982, 1986 and, most recently in 1992. Since 1986 part of the AGCD officials is integrated
with the Foreign Service. The budget of the AGCD is part of the budget of the MFA.
<p>
Implementation is done by AGCD by the other ministries mentioned above ('direct bilateral
aid') and various NGOs, universities, other private organisations and enterprises,
communities, provinces and regions.  This latter category of 'indirect aid' via private
organisations accounted for 12 per cent of the AGCD's budget in 1988/89 and it is scheduled
to grow, while at the same time the number of recipient countries will be reduced. AGCD has
field offices at the embassies in around 20 recipient countries. The AGCD is organised in two
main sections, one for 'direct bilateral aid' and one for 'indirect aid', supplemented by
departments for planning, evaluation and services.  
<p>
Since 1981 two funding sources for development cooperation exist. The Fund for
Development Cooperation (FOS) is replenished from public and private funds. Bilateral
cooperation, including the AGCD activities, is financed from the FOS. It is managed by the
State Secretary for Development Cooperation in consultation with the Ministers of Foreign
Affairs and Finance, and an Interministerial Committee for the Budget. The Fund for Loans
to Foreign States (FPPE) is managed by the Ministers of Finance and External Trade, and is
replenished by public funds and income from repayments. An interministerial administrative
committee, including representatives from the Ministries of Finance, External Trade,
Economic Affairs, and Foreign Affairs, coordinates its functioning of the FPPE. Both funds
were established to enable the aid administration to implement pluriannual planning and
disbursements. It is not known whether this will be continued, since it has also created
underdisbursements.  
<p>
Policy planning is done by the 'Cabinet' of the Minister of Foreign Affairs - a 15 to 20 member
office of the Ministers choice and by the Department for Organisation, Training and
Evaluation Service of the AGCD. It is not known to what extend AGCD cooperates with
external consultants and research institutes.  
<p>
Over the years several ministerial committees for the coordination of cooperation policy have
been installed (1969, 1972, 1976, 1981, 1985). They apparently never were convened, or have
been abolished. There seems to be no mechanism for structural consultation between the
ministers responsible for components of ODA besides the two interministerial committees
mentioned above. 
<p>
Several studies, reports and policy papers on Belgian development cooperation have been
published over the years. There are, amongst others, the 1977 report of the study group on
adjustment problems, the 1982 SOBEMAP study on the AGCD, the 1988 paper 'Le dialogue
ouvert &#224; propos de la politique au d&#233;veloppement' of the Minister for Development
Cooperation, the 1992 paper 'On the path to alleviating rural poverty' by AGCD and IFAD, and
a 1994 policy paper (further details unknown), of which the part on employment has been
formulated in consultation with the employer's organisations and the trade unions. Most
policy documents focus on the implementation of aid activities in relation to the
administrative organisation of the programmes. It is not known whether there are sector and
country papers, or evaluations, and whether they are published. It is noted that statements
by ministers are more conclusive about policy developments than policy papers. Official data
on cooperation are often difficult and late to obtain. Annual reports on the activities of the
AGCD and the FPPE are presented to Parliament and are published.

<a name="adv"><hr><h3>Formal Advisory Strcutures and Mechanisms</h3></a>

One of the first three institutes for development cooperation, installed in 1962, was an
Advisory Council for Development Cooperation Policy. At the same time the Government
installed a Coordinating Ministerial Committee and an administrative aid division, which was
the predecessor of the present AGCD. Belgium was the first European country to install an
Advisory Council for Development Cooperation. The 14 member Council met regularly and
formulated recommendations. However, it never attained any status and its advice was not
sought by the Minister or the Parliament, nor by the public or the press. It was authorised to
discuss the general development cooperation programme and to make proposals for its
implementation, as well as to advise on draft legislation and budget proposals. It had a
limited autonomy and was not allowed to publish recommendations. Since 1962 several
reorganisations were decided upon, the last in 1977. In 1971 the membership was enlarged
to 35 members: 10 members nominated by the NGOs, 5 by the trade unions, 5 by the
employer's organisations, and 15 to be nominated by the Minister. The Council was also
allowed to publish its recommendations. Nevertheless, it appears not to have functioned.
Although it has not been abolished officially, it might be considered as non-existent.
<p>
Budgets, policy papers and annual reports are sent to Parliament. Parliamentary debates are
usually held around the annual budget and policy plan. As regards contents, decisions on
development cooperation policies are made mainly by the Government which does not seem
to be inclined to confront Parliament on these issues. There is no separate Parliamentary
Committee on Development Cooperation. Development cooperation is usually discussed in
various other Parliamentary Committees, such as the Committee for External Trade and
Technical Assistance, or External Relations and Defence. These Committee meetings tend
to be open for the public.

The approximately 250 development NGOs, personnel assistance organisations, solidarity
committees, and studygroups are based on Belgium's missionary tradition, former colonial
relations, the international solidarity movements and international university cooperation
groups. NGOs are actively involved in discussions and studies on development cooperation,
in implementation and lobbying. They have good relationships with the political and other
sectors of society. Project implementation is done through their partner organisations in
developing countries, either on their own funds or co-funded by the Government. To be
eligible for funding from the co-funding programme of AGCD, NGOs need to be formally
recognised by the Government. However, bilateral aid through NGOs is limited to emergency
aid. The management and funding of certain NGO-activities has been delegated to the
Regional Governments, for instance the Netherlands and French language teaching
activities. The Government has announced to step up implementation of projects through
NGOs. Structural contacts between government and the NGOs have been established,
amongst others through the installation of three Advisory Commissions in 1991. In 1993 a
Round Table of NGO and Government representatives discussed debt relief issues.
Cooperation with employer's organisations and trade unions have already been mentioned.
Topics for discussions with the Government are amongst others: actuality of information,
stated policy objectives and realisation, commercialisation of development cooperation and
the increase of Government cooperation with NGOs.
<p>
According to the 1991 OECD/EADI survey 22 institutes in Belgium qualify as Development
Research and Training Institutes. Some of the best known are: the Institut de M&#233;decine
tropicale Prince L&#233;opold, the International Institute of Administrative Sciences, and the many
faculties and institutes at the universities of Antwerp, Ghent and Louvain. They publish
numerous reports and studies on specific development issues and do consultancy services
for AGCD. Several universities are involved in training programmes for foreign students and
education projects. NGOs execute extensive programmes for development education, partly
government funded.
<p>
There are two university based umbrella organisations that have a Committee for
Development Cooperation. The Committees include representatives of universities, of the
AGCD and the Minister of Development Cooperation. The organisation in the French
speaking region is the CIUF (the Francophone Interuniversity Council) and in the Flemish
speaking region the VLIR (the Flemish Interuniversity Council). Although the details of their
specific mandates are not quite clear, the activities of both Committees may contribute to the
policy debate on development cooperation. Both organisations conduct research for
developing countries and developing projects, as well as on development policy and
cooperation management.
<p>
Over the years more informal groups have played an influential but temporary role in the
development debate, such as the Association for the Study of International Division of
Income and Employment, which formulated rural development as one of the first priorities
for Belgian development cooperation.
<p>
Some large corporations have been main contractors for development projects in the areas
of energy production, telecommunications and railway infrastructure, through the Ministries
of Finance and External Trade. The 1992 Government announced plans to limit
commercialisation of development assistance, at the same time inviting private enterprise
to play an active role within the objectives of development cooperation.

Nieuwe Overeenkomst Inzake Universitaire Ontwikkelingssamenwerking (UOS)<P>door <I>Jo Bastiaens</I>

<h4>Tekst van een artikel verschenen in <I>Universiteit & Beleid</I>, vol. 9, no. 4, 1995: pp. 35-43
<p></h4>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
Op 12 mei jl. -nog voor de verkiezingen- gaf de Ministerraad van de Regering DEHAENE I zijn fiat aan een aantal opmerkelijke voorstellen van de toenmalige Minister voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking, dhr. E. DERYCKE, met betrekking tot de vernieuwing van de universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Deze voorstellen betroffen enerzijds een ontwerp van Koninklijk Besluit betreffende de hervorming van het beurzenbeleid, en anderzijds twee nieuwe kaderovereenkomsten tussen de Belgische Staat en de Vlaamse resp. de Franstalige universiteiten die de krijt- en krachtlijnen van de UOS vastleggen voor de komende vijf jaar. De nieuwe overeenkomsten kwamen tot stand na voorafgaandelijk overleg met de VL.I.R. resp. met de CIUF. De overeenkomst met de Vlaamse universiteiten werd ondertekend op 18 mei jl., deze met de Franstalige universiteiten op 19 mei. 
<P>
<H4>1. Situering</H4>
<P>
Met de ondertekening van de nieuwe overeenkomsten wordt een voorlopig einde gesteld aan de impasse die de universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking sedert een aantal jaren kenmerkt. De vroegere 'Algemene Overeenkomst tussen de Belgische Staat en de Vlaamse universitaire instellingen betreffende hun samenwerking inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking' was immers formeel be&#235;indigd in december 1986, ofschoon zij tijdens de daarop volgende jaren met stilzwijgende instemming wel verder werd toegepast. Herhaalde pogingen om tot een vernieuwing van deze overeenkomst te komen liepen telkens spaak op de problematiek van de communautaire verdeling van de kredieten voor universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Uiteenlopende inhoudelijke visies in het Noorden en het Zuiden van het land omtrent de prioriteiten en klemtonen inzake UOS vormen evenwel mede de grondslag van dit twistpunt (zie verder).
<P>
Toenmalig Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking, E. DERYCKE, bracht in 1994 het overleg met de VL.I.R. op gang betreffende de toekomst van de universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. De VL.I.R. van zijn kant formuleerde in juli 1994 een 'Advies over de Toekomst van de UOS'  dat een omstandig overzicht biedt van de visie die de Vlaamse universiteiten aanhouden ten aanzien van het beleid inzake universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking. De VL.I.R. kreeg de gelegenheid zijn visie en idee&#235;n omtrent de UOS uiteen te zetten tijdens een gesprek met de Staatssecretaris op 8 november 1994. Tijdens dit gesprek werd afgesproken om het overleg omtrent de vernieuwing van de Overeenkomst terug op te starten. 
<P>
Tijdens het overleg werd tevens overeenstemming bereikt omtrent een aantal inhoudelijke krachtlijnen en basisprincipes met het oog op een modernisering van de UOS. Deze hadden o.m. betrekking op de politiek van institutionele samenwerking met prioritaire centra, de invoering van een systeem van programmafinanciering voor bepaalde onderdelen van de UOS, de financiering van buitenlandse studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden door ABOS, de modaliteiten van evaluatie en identificatie van samenwerkingsprogramma's, de geografische concentratie van de universitaire ontwikkelingsprojecten. In hetgeen volgt zullen we trachten samen te vatten hoe deze punten uiteindelijk geconcretiseerd werden in de nieuwe overeenkomst. Ook zullen we even stilstaan bij de voorstellen van de VL.I.R. omtrent de financi&#235;le invulling van dit kaderakkoord. Tenslotte bekijken we ook de wijze waarop de communautaire problematiek al dan niet werd aangepakt.
<P>
<H4>2. Modernisering van de UOS</H4>
<P>
De Overeenkomst bevat een aantal nieuwe elementen waarmee een modernisering wordt betracht van de UOS:
<P>
<I>a. Rol van de overheid resp. van de universiteiten</I>
<P>
De nieuwe Overeenkomst brengt belangrijke wijzigingen met zich mee voor wat betreft de respectievelijke rol en taakverdeling van de Overheid en de universiteiten op vlak van de organisatie van de UOS. Zo bepaalt het akkoord dat het ABOS de gouvernementele UOS zal afbouwen en in de plaats een grotere verantwoordelijkheid en initiatiefrecht zal toekennen aan de universiteiten. Projecten van UOS waarbij ABOS optreedt als opdrachtgever of uitvoerder, hetzij via onderaanneming, hetzij via Universitaire Technische Samenwerking (UTS), zullen in de loop van de overeenkomst worden vervangen door programma's die worden uitgevoerd in het kader van de zgn. indirecte UOS , d.w.z. activiteiten die tot stand komen op initiatief van de universiteiten. Reeds vanaf 1997 zullen de lopende UTS-projecten na het verstrijken van de duur van de interventie ofwel worden stopgezet, ofwel worden overgeheveld naar de indirecte samenwerking. Een specifieke ad-hoc Stuurgroep ABOS/VL.I.R. zal worden opgezet die dit proces dient te begeleiden. Een en ander impliceert alvast dat er ook in budgettair opzicht een herschikking zal plaatsvinden binnen de begroting UOS van de directe bilaterale samenwerking (ie. de post UTS) naar de indirecte UOS (zie hiervoor tabel 1).
<P>
Hoewel als gevolg van deze herschikking de -in deze sector traditionele- bevoogding door de overheid belooft te verminderen, dient er anderzijds op gewezen dat de overeenkomst ook voor de indirecte UOS de spelregels heeft gewijzigd. De Overeenkomst bepaalt namelijk dat de Vlaamse universiteiten zullen proberen hun activiteiten zo dicht mogelijk te laten aansluiten bij het beleid van de Belgische Regering. Hiertoe wordt een paritair samengestelde Stuurgroep opgezet die verantwoordelijk zal zijn voor de algemene co&#246;rdinatie, opvolging en eventuele bijsturing van de activiteiten van de indirecte UOS. Ook zal de Stuurgroep jaarlijks advies uitbrengen aangaande de verdeling van de budgettaire enveloppe van de indirecte UOS over de onderscheiden begrotingsposten. De Stuurgroep zal zich daarbij laten leiden door de indicatieve meerjarenprogrammatie die deel uitmaakt van de overeenkomst (zie verder). Het Voorzitterschap en het secretariaat van de Stuurgroep zullen worden waargenomen door de VL.I.R.
<P>
Verder voorziet de Overeenkomst in een nieuwe projectenformule van UOS die niet langer beantwoordt aan de traditionele vorm van indirecte samenwerking -waarbij de universiteiten zelf exclusief initiatiefnemer zijn van de samenwerking (cfr. het model van de 'eigen initiatieven')- doch die eerder gestoeld zal worden op basis van een geregeld overleg tussen de overheid en de vertegenwoordigers van de Vlaamse universiteiten. Hierbij gaat het meer in het bijzonder over de programma's van institutionele universitaire samenwerking overzee.
<P>
<I>b. Institutionele universitaire samenwerking met prioritaire centra overzee</I>
<P>
Deze nieuwe samenwerkingsvorm behelst het opzetten van duurzame samenwerkingsrelaties tussen de Vlaamse universiteiten en een aantal bevoorrechte partner-instellingen in de derde wereld -ook wel 'prioritaire centra genaamd'- met als doel bij te dragen tot de institutionele versterking en verbetering van het algehele functioneren van de lokale universitaire instellingen. Hierbij zal een bijzondere aandacht worden besteed aan de uitbouw en opwaardering van het universitair onderwijs van de derde cyclus ter plaatse, alsook aan het stimuleren van Zuid-Zuid samenwerkingsverbanden tussen verschillende universiteiten in de regio.
<P>
Naast de institutionele universitaire samenwerking, blijft ook de thans gangbare projectenformule van de 'Eigen Initiatieven' (zie elders in dit nummer) behouden, zij het dat deze op termijn sterk zou worden ingeperkt ten voordele van de institutionele concentratie. De Overeenkomst bepaalt in dit verband dat vanaf 1999 minstens 80% van de middelen voor projecten overzee zou worden voorbehouden voor de institutionele samenwerking met prioritaire centra. Voorts zal in het kader van de 'Eigen Initiatieven' ook een nieuwe mogelijkheid worden ingelast om kleinschalige samenwerkingsactiviteiten uit te voeren in de ontwikkelingslanden. 
<P>
<I>c. Geografische concentratie</I>
<P>
Inzake geografische concentratie, stipuleert de Overeenkomst dat de institutionele universitaire samenwerking uitsluitend georganiseerd kan worden in de concentratielanden en -regio's van het offici&#235;le Belgische ontwikkelingsbeleid. De VL.I.R. dient er bovendien naar te streven om minstens 50% van de budgettaire middelen aan te wenden voor samenwerkingsprogramma's in Sub-Sahara Afrika. Voor wat betreft de 'Eigen Initiatieven' zijn de geografische restricties anderzijds heel wat minder streng. Deze kunnen immers ook gesitueerd zijn in ontwikkelingslanden die niet behoren tot de concentratielanden van de Belgische ontwikkelingspolitiek. Ingeval evenwel projecten worden voorgesteld voor samenwerking met universiteiten in landen die behoren tot de zgn. 'Middle Income Countries' , dan dient een relatief zwaardere inbreng van de lokale partner-instelling te worden bedongen en dient het principe van kostendeling te worden toegepast.
<P>
<I>d. Programmafinanciering</I>
<P>
De Overeenkomst voorziet dat voor een gedeelte van de kredieten voor UOS -met name deze bestemd voor 'institutionele universitaire samenwerking overzee' (zie hierboven)- de organisatie van de samenwerking zou geschieden op basis van een programmafinanciering. Programmafinanciering betekent dat de Overheid, in overleg met de universiteiten en de VL.I.R., jaarlijks een algemeen programma vastlegt dat het algemeen inhoudelijk en sectorieel kader schept waarbinnen de universitaire samenwerkingsprojecten zich inschrijven. De concrete invulling en het beheer van deze activiteiten wordt evenwel overgelaten aan de VL.I.R. die daartoe ook zelf de beschikking krijgt over de nodige middelen. Vanzelfsprekend blijft er vanwege het ABOS toezicht bestaan op de aanwending van deze overheidsgelden.
<P>
<I>e. Evaluatie</I>
<P>
In zijn Advies van juli 1994 stelde de VL.I.R. dat "Het in het geheel niet te rechtvaardigen (is) dat de 'Eigen Initiatieven Overzee' niet op geregelde tijd ge&#235;valueerd worden." De VL.I.R. is van bij de aanvang vragende partij geweest voor meer systematische evaluaties van al de activiteiten inzake UOS, en dit vanuit het perspectief van de continue zorg voor de kwaliteit van de universitaire samenwerking.
<P>
De expliciete bepalingen betreffende de noodzaak van een regelmatige opvolging en evaluatie van de activiteiten in het kader van de UOS, alsook de toezegging om hiervoor de nodige middelen vrij te maken, blijven niettemin een belangwekkende nieuwigheid in het geheel van de ontwikkelingssamenwerking. De Overeenkomst voorziet dat de beoordeling van de projecten en programma's overzee op verschillende manieren tot stand kan komen:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>via een externe evaluatie: ABOS zal jaarlijks, op advies van de Stuurgroep minstens &#233;&#233;n externe evaluatie organiseren;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>via een gezamenlijke opvolgingszending VL.I.R./ABOS: per jaar zal minstens &#233;&#233;n dergelijke missie plaatsgrijpen;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>via een opvolgingszending georganiseerd door de VL.I.R.
</UL>

<I>f. Opleiding van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden</I>
<P>
De Overeenkomst voorziet striktere criteria voor de financiering van de opleidingskosten van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden aan de Belgische universiteiten, en kondigt een wijziging aan van het Koninklijk Besluit van 10 augustus 1981 dat deze betoelagingsvoorwaarden formeel regelt. De hervorming van het beleid terzake valt uiteen in een aantal onderscheiden luiken:
<P>
<UL>
<LI>algemeen wordt prioriteit verleend aan de opleiding ter plaatse, inzonderheid voor wat betreft de universitaire basisopleiding. De opleiding in Belgi&#235; van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden zal bovendien niet worden aangemoedigd indien in het land of de regio van de student de mogelijkheid tot de beoogde vorming aanwezig is, a fortiori indien deze opleiding geen ontwikkelingsrelevant karakter heeft;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>voor wat betreft de ABOS-bursalen, wordt een herziening aangekondigd van het gangbare beurzenstelsel. Hierbij zou o.m. in grotere mate voorzien worden in de mogelijkheid om naast de beurzen voor studies in Belgi&#235; ook lokale beurzen te voorzien, d.w.z. beurzen voor postgraduaat opleidingen in het land van herkomst, dan wel in de regio;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>de betoelagingscriteria voor de financiering van de opleidingskosten van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden worden op tweevoudige wijze verstrengd: enerzijds wordt de lijst van de landen van herkomst van financierbare studenten beperkt tot de concentratielanden, anderzijds wordt het niveau van de opleiding bij voorrang op de derde cyclus bepaald;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>de financiering van de universitaire opleidingskosten van de ABOS-bursalen gebeurt ad 100%, terwijl de financiering van de opleidingskosten van de niet-ABOS-bursalen begrensd wordt, en in ieder geval geen re&#235;le groei mag kennen ten aanzien van het begrotingsjaar 1993.
</UL>

Voor de Vlaamse universiteiten verandert er in dit opzicht overigens weinig of niets, aangezien zij deze beleidsopties reeds sedert jaren onderschrijven en op vlak van de opleiding van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden reeds een selectief en ontwikkelingsge&#246;rienteerd onthaalbeleid voeren, bv. in het kader van de Internationale Cursussen- en stageprogramma's, maar ook in het raam van andere voortgezette academische opleidingen, doctoraatsopleidingen en specialisaties. 
<P>
<I>g. Andere aspecten met betrekking tot de UOS</I>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>de Overeenkomst voorziet een jaarlijkse toelage voor het secretariaat van de VL.I.R. die de uitvoering van de bijkomende taken inzake organisatie en co&#246;rdinatie van de activiteiten inzake UOS moet garanderen.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>de participatie van de Vlaamse universiteiten aan de onderzoeksactiviteiten in het kader van de multilaterale samenwerking wordt als zodanig niet geregeld door de nieuwe Overeenkomst. W&#233;l wordt hierover een bijzondere overeenkomst in het vooruitzicht gesteld.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>de VL.I.R. stelde in zijn Adviestekst van juli 1994 de institutionele versnippering van het landschap voor UOS in Vlaanderen aan de kaak. De tekst van de nieuwe Overeenkomst gaat slechts ten dele in op deze problematiek, met name voor wat betreft de VL.I.R. en het ABOS (UTS). Opvallend in dit verband is overigens dat bijna gelijktijdig met de ondertekening van de overeenkomsten met VL.I.R. resp. CIUF, ook met de VVOB (Vlaamse Vereniging voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking en technische Bijstand) en zijn Franstalige tegenhanger APEFE (Association pour la Promotion de l'Education et de la Formation &#224; l'Etranger) conventies werden afgesloten. De krachtlijnen hier zijn meer concentratie (geografisch, inhoudelijk, sectorieel), mogelijkheid tot zendingen van korte duur en een sterkere decentralisatie van verantwoordelijkheid. Het lijkt er alleszins op dat, althans wat Vlaanderen betreft, de vraag naar meer co&#246;rdinatie van het geheel van de UOS nog een tijd aan de orde zal blijven.
</UL>
<H4>3. Indicatief budgettair meerjarenprogramma</H4>
<P>
De nieuwe overeenkomst bepaalt dat "de VL.I.R. een budgettair plan zal voorleggen dat een weerspiegeling is van de klemtonen die de Vlaamse universiteiten voor de jaren 1996-2000 wensen te leggen wat betreft hun activiteiten inzake indirecte universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking". De overeenkomst wijst tevens het globaal budgettair kader aan waarop de VL.I.R. zich bij de opstelling van dit plan zou kunnen richten. Hierin komt de beleidsoptie tot uiting waarbij een geleidelijke transfert van middelen van de directe (ie. Universitaire Technische Samenwerking) naar de indirecte UOS zou worden nagestreefd.
<P>
In uitvoering van deze bepalingen, legde de Raad tijdens haar vergadering van 16 juni ll. een voorstel van budgettair meerjarenprogramma vast (zie tabel 1) dat enerzijds vertrekt van een projectie op basis van een aantal parameters uit de Overeenkomst, maar dat anderzijds ook uitgaat van een aantal bijkomende beleidsaccenten en ori&#235;ntaties die vanuit de VL.I.R. worden voorgesteld. Daarbij gaat het inzonderheid over de volgende krachtlijnen:
<P>
a. uitgaande van het VL.I.R.-basisprincipe volgens het welke het zwaartepunt van de kredieten voor UOS voor acties ter plaatse dient te worden voorbehouden, wordt voorgesteld om het totaalkrediet voor projecten overzee (Subtotaal 1.2.3) relatief sterk te laten toenemen, nl. van 50,4% naar 60,5% van de indirecte UOS.
<P>
b. wat betreft de opleidingsactiviteiten in Belgi&#235; (krediet ICP) wordt voorgesteld om, op grond van de algemene aanbevelingen van de ICP-evaluatiecommissie van september 1992 resp. november 1994, uitdrukking te geven aan de optie om het thans versnipperde aanbod aan ICP's te herorganiseren middels een interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming. In concreto wordt voorgesteld dat het betreffend krediet zou toelaten om een beperkt aantal interuniversitaire programma's uit te bouwen rond thematische zwaartepunten. De organisatie van ICP's in Vlaanderen zou tevens meer systematisch gekoppeld worden aan de institutionele samenwerking met prioritaire centra. Bij de projectie werd uitgegaan van 7 &#224; 8 dergelijke opleidingen aan een gemiddelde kostprijs van 10 MBF per jaar. Daarnaast zou het krediet kunnen worden aangewend voor specifieke en kortlopende stageprogramma's. De voorgestelde absolute daling van het ICP-krediet gedurende de overgangsjaren 1996 en 1997 is ingegeven door de vaststelling dat de betrokken post in de ABOS-begroting thans overgebudgetteerd wordt. Het totaal bedrag aan vastleggingen voor het jaar 1994 (meest recente gegevens beschikbaar) bedroeg 91,5 MBF daar waar in totaal 116 MBF in de begroting stond ingeschreven.
<P>
c. inzake het Beleidsvoorbereidend Onderzoek (krediet BVO) wordt voorgesteld om dit onderzoek op termijn middels interuniversitaire zwaartepuntvorming rond een beperkt aantal prioritaire thema's te versterken. De Raad vindt dat het basisonderzoek omtrent de ontwikkelingsproblematiek in de individuele instellingen een voortdurende aandacht voor deze thematiek moet levendig houden, zij het dat dit bij voorkeur op een in Vlaanderen geco&#246;rdineerde wijze zou plaatsvinden, zodanig dat in deze een minimale kwalitatieve capaciteit kan ontstaan. In concreto, wordt voorgesteld dat het budget voor BVO geleidelijk zou toenemen van 16 MBF (1995) tot 35 MBF (2000).

<P>
Het VL.I.R.-voorstel van indicatief meerjarenprogramma werd op 29 juni voorgelegd aan Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking, R. MOREELS. Vermits de Overeenkomst pas definitief van kracht wordt na de formele goedkeuring van het budgettair meerjarenplan door de Overheid, wordt thans met belangstelling uitgekeken naar de reactie van Staatssecretaris MOREELS. De VL.I.R. rekent er alvast op dat de nieuwe overeenkomst met de Belgische Staat ook door de nieuwe beleidsverantwoordelijke effectief zal worden uitgevoerd.
<P>
<H4>4. De communautaire problematiek</H4>
<P>
Universitaire ontwikkelingssamenwerking onderscheidt zich volgens de VL.I.R. van andere vormen van internationale wetenschappelijke samenwerking, doordat zij essentieel een dimensie van solidariteit insluit, die volop gericht moet zijn op de zelfontwikkeling van de betrokken landen. De Vlaamse universiteiten hebben er in het licht hiervan steeds voor geijverd dat de klemtoon van de UOS in de ontwikkelingslanden zelf moet liggen, en bijvoorbeeld niet op de basisopleiding in Belgi&#235; van studenten uit ontwikkelingslanden. Deze optie werd ook steeds concreet gemaakt door een principi&#235;le voorkeur voor activiteiten ter plaatse -o.m. in het kader van de 'Eigen Initiatieven' of via institutionele samenwerking met prioritaire instellingen overzee- en door een selectief en ontwikkelingsge&#246;rienteerd onthaalbeleid ten aanzien van buitenlandse studenten in het kader van de zgn. Internationale Cursussen- en stageprogramma's (ICP's).
<P>
Hoewel een aantal van deze principes in de nieuwe overeenkomst met de Franstalige universiteiten (CIUF) eveneens -zij het schoorvoetend- werden opgenomen, kan niet ontkend worden dat deze visie in het Zuiden van het land vooralsnog op weinig steun kan rekenen . Overigens heeft de VL.I.R. aan de Franstalige universiteiten nooit het recht ontzegd om inzake UOS een andere visie te verdedigen en een ander beleid te voeren, maar vindt hij integendeel dat beide Gemeenschappen in de UOS hun eigen accenten zouden moeten kunnen leggen. W&#233;l betreurt de VL.I.R. stellig dat dit tot nog toe aanleiding heeft gegeven tot een communautaire scheeftrekking van middelen, mogelijkheden en kansen om bij de UOS betrokken te worden. Dit moge blijken uit de geglobaliseerde cijfergegevens terzake die volgens onze berekeningen nog steeds een substanti&#235;le Vlaamse achterstelling aan het licht brengen in de grootorde van 38% N - 62% F (zie tabel 2).

(1)	VVOB en APEFE sturen Belgische deskundigen uit naar ontwikkelingslanden. Hoewel niet alle experten worden tewerkgesteld in de universitaire sector, vertegenwoordigt deze -althans wat VVOB betreft- een relatief belangrijk aandeel in hun werking. Voor de VVOB wordt dit aandeel op 50% geraamd. Omdat vergelijkbare cijfergegevens niet beschikbaar zijn voor wat betreft de APEFE, worden in de tabel de totalen weergegeven van de resp. ABOS-toelagen.<p>
(2)	Uitgezonderd de niet opgesplitste kredieten.

<P>
Niet al de kredieten uit deze tabel ressorteren onder de bevoegdheid van de Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking. Een bijzondere plaats wordt immers ingenomen door de federale gelden (1,8 miljard BF in 1995) die ingevolge de financieringswet van de jongste staatshervorming (1989) aan de Gemeenschappen worden toegekend voor de financiering van buitenlandse studenten waarvan een groot gedeelte afkomstig is uit de ontwikkelingslanden. De communautaire verdeling van dit krediet, dat jaarlijks overigens nog verder toeneemt ingevolge een wettelijk vastgelegde indexering, werd 'versleuteld' (80N-20F) en 'vergrendeld' tot in 1999, vermoedelijk als onderdeel van het globale communautaire akkoord dat aan de Staatshervorming vooraf is gegaan. Het betreffende federale krediet staat thans ingeschreven op de Begrotingsdiensten van de Eerste Minister als 'Dotatie aan de Gemeenschappen'.
<P>
De bijzondere kredieten ten laste van de Begroting van de Eerste Minister voor de financiering van buitenlandse studenten behoren formeel niet tot het voorwerp van de nieuwe Overeenkomst. Niettemin stelt deze expliciet dat zij "op geen enkele wijze afbreuk doet aan het recht van de Vlaamse universiteiten om, met verwijzing naar de communautaire verdeelsleutels inzake Wetenschapsbeleid en Onderwijs, een evenwichtige verdeling te blijven eisen van de beschikbare middelen voor activiteiten in het kader van de ontwikkelingssamenwerking tussen de universiteiten van de beide Gemeenschappen".
<P>
De VL.I.R. stelt dat uiteindelijk alleen de communautarisering van de UOS volwaardig een einde kan maken aan de voortdurende, financi&#235;le discriminatie van de Vlamingen in deze sector. UOS sluit immers onmiddellijk aan bij het universitair onderwijs en onderzoek, die beide reeds gecommunautariseerde aangelegenheden zijn. Bovendien vertegenwoordigen financi&#235;le middelen in deze even zo veel kansen en mogelijkheden, vooral voor jongeren, om in internationaal verband activiteiten te ontplooien en ervaringen op te doen die gericht zijn op de ontwikkelingsproblematiek. De rechtvaardige verdeling van deze middelen, op grond van een bevolkings- of daaraan gerelateerd criterium, is dan ook voor de VL.I.R. een kwestie van rechtvaardigheid &#233;n van essentieel belang.

Tintin returns to the Congo:<br>Belgium wishes to resume
its influence in Central Africa</h2>
<h4>by <i>Jos van Beurden</i>
<p>
Full text of an article from <i>Vice Versa (a quarterly
magazine on development work published by SNV)</i><br>Vol
29, No. 5, 1995: page 11</h4>
</center>
<hr>
<b>In recent years the Belgian presence has been
increasingly less evident in Africa. But the Secretary of
State for Development Cooperation, Reginald Moreels, wishes
to change this. And policy has been drawn up with this in
mind. But the aid budget also needs to see a dramatic
increase in the years to come.</b>
<p>
There was a time when Belgium had considerable economic
interest in Africa. But this now has the air of something
from a past era. Africa has practically ceased to play any
part in Belgian business. Only 1.22 percent of the entire
Belgian export goes to Sub-Saharan Africa, while 2.53
percent of imports come from the continent. The interests
of the Belgian business community have shifted in favour of
countries such as Vietnam or Indonesia.
<p>
The Belgian military presence in Africa has also faded. The
Military-Technological Cooperation Agreement with Burundi
was terminated way back in 1972 following massacres
perpetrated by the Burundian army. The agreement with Za&iuml;re
came to an end in June of 1990 following the blood bath in
May at the University of Lubumbashi. The agreement with
Rwanda was suspended in April of 1994 following the Belgian
withdrawal. "From a military point of view, France has
taken over the Belgian position," explains Jean-Claude
Willame, formerly a Professor in Za&iuml;re and now employed for
many years at the African Study and Documentation Centre in
Brussels. "The French presence in former Belgian Africa
continues to give rise to resentment." If Belgium now also
chooses to intervene from the airport of Zaventen, the
paratroopers will arrive no later than 24 hours after their
French colleagues.
<p>
Development aid dropped. Of all the bilateral aid given
between the years of 1970 and 1990, two-thirds went to
former colonies with intense concentration on Za&iuml;re. After
the break with Za&iuml;re, that share fell considerably. Up to
that point, what Africa policy there was was geared towards
maintaining the Mobutu regime.
<p>
"Unlike France, for a long time Belgium had no African
policy at all. The Congo was never a Belgian colony," says
Willame. "It was the colony of a few Belgian individuals:
King Leopold II, the Miners Union, the General Company (La
Soci&#233;t&#233; G&#233;n&#233;rale) and a handful of adventurers. There
exists in Belgium no African debate which can be compared
with the bickering in the Netherlands over Indonesia and
Surinam. At one point Minister Tindemans of Foreign Affairs
presented a memorandum on African Policy, only ten members
of parliament showed any interest."
<p>
The Dehaene Cabinet wants to change all this. It refuses to
restrict African policy to evacuation orders for Belgian
citizens in situations of crisis. At the beginning of this
year there appeared: Belgium and Sub-Saharan Africa: Agenda
for a new Dialogue and new Cooperation. On 12 October 1995
the general policy document was issued by the brand-new
Secretary of State for Development Cooperation, Reginald
Moreels. Until recently Moreels was director of the Belgian
section of Doctors without Borders.
<p>
"Belgian policy documents are different from Dutch policy
documents," observes Belgian development expert Geert
Laporte. "They are shorter, possibly less profound, but
certainly not less clear. And when it comes to
implementation we are equally as good. Our ambitions are
more modest, more sober and less idealistic." This
conclusion also applies to the two documents referred to.
Both testify to a rupture. In retrospect, aid, intervention
and pressure have not led to sustainable development, good
management nor to the constitutional state. Thus something
other is required. In place of the massive efforts of
Belgian development workers, there is now a call for
Africa's endemic capacity to be developed. The traditional
project managers have to make way for strategic, long-term
thinkers both in Belgium and in the recipient countries.
Bilateral aid no longer goes solely to national
governments. Local authorities and non-governmental
organizations are also in the running. Paternalism is
making way for partnership.
<p>
Nice words, no doubt. The motives behind the new policy are
also nicely packaged: the permanent pressure of migration
by Africans, people that Europe is unable to accommodate,
and who simultaneously deprive Africa of its most important
capital, and the threat of armed conflict which needs to be
stemmed. Peace is a fundamental condition for sustainable
development. However, it would also appear that the new
opportunities for the Belgian business community are
certainly no less important. The Belgian business community
is betting on the fact that standardization will press
ahead rapidly in Za&iuml;re. It wants to start work again in the
diamond mining in Za&iuml;re. Not only that, the scent of
opportunity is also in the air in South Africa. For
Flanders South Africa is even a focus country.
<p>
Belgium is keen to regain the influence in Central Africa
that it relinquished to the French and to once again assume
the role of a driving force. The official bilateral aid to
Za&iuml;re has not yet been resumed, but considerably more money
is to be made available for Non-Governmental Organizations
(NGOs) in healthcare and education. Immediately after
presenting his memorandum, Secretary of State Moreels flew
to Rwanda - with the highly esteemed journalist Els de
Temmerman as advisor, she will hold the post for a year in
order to discuss the return of refugees and the Rwanda
Tribunal.
<p>
Host to and very much a member of the European Union, the
Belgians see an important role for the Organization for
African Unity. It is the African troops rather than the
French which must take over the work of the Belgians.
Brussels is even ready to assume the role of godparent to
the African intervention units. Much to his dismay,
Reginald Moreels will have to make do with 0.32 percent of
the Gross Domestic Product for the time being, even if he
writes that this is to be increased to 0.7 of the GDP by
the year 2000. As the director of Doctors without Borders,
Moreels called for a Minister for Development Cooperation.
For now he has had to make do with a Secretary of State.

Zwaartepuntvorming in het Beleidsvoorbereidend Onderzoek Inzake Ontwikkelingssamenwerking
<P>door <I>Kristien Verbrugghen</I>
</h2>
<h4>(Tekst van een artikel verschenen in <I>Universiteit & Beleid</I>, vol. 10, no. 1, 1995: pp. 40-44
<p></h4>
</center>
<hr>
<P>
<H4>1. Situering</H4>
<P>
In de zomer van 1995 werden de Vlaamse universiteiten alsook de IODEWE (Interuniversitaire Overlegstructuur Derde Wereld) door het VL.I.R.-secretariaat verzocht om voorstellen van thema's voor het beleidsvoorbereidend onderzoek inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking (BVO) 1996 bij het VL.I.R.-secretariaat in te dienen. Deze voorstellen zouden dan als input worden gebruikt om een interuniversitair beleid van zwaartepuntvorming in het BVO te helpen concipi&#235;ren. 
<P>
De visie van de VL.I.R. op onderzoek dat gericht is op de voorbereiding van het overheidsbeleid inzake ontwikkelingssamenwerking kan alsvolgt worden samengevat :
<P>	
<UL>
<LI>met dit onderzoek moet ingespeeld kunnen worden op beleidsvragen van de overheid;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>teneinde op de vragen van de overheid te kunnen inspelen, moet het BVO dat aan de universiteiten wordt uitgevoerd, versterkt worden;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>dit onderzoek moet van internationaal niveau zijn, i.e. van dermate kwaliteit dat het internationaal meespeelt. Dit veronderstelt zwaartepuntvorming aansluitend bij bestaand onderzoek en de eigen inspanningen van de universiteiten waarbij dit zwaartepuntonderzoek moet kunnen rekenen op voldoende sterke en continue financi&#235;le ondersteuning. Een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming sluit echter geenszins vernieuwing uit;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>het BVO vormt op Vlaams niveau best een geco&#246;rdineerd geheel, waarbij rekening moet worden gehouden met het zwaartepuntonderzoek in Franstalig Belgi&#235; en internationaal. Vanzelfsprekend wordt interuniversitaire samenwerking rond zwaartepunten aanbevolen;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>het BVO moet tevens de belangstelling voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking in de universiteiten z&#233;lf levendig houden. Daarom dient het best te berusten op onderzoekskernen in verschillende universiteiten.
</UL>
De VL.I.R.-Werkgroep "Ontwikkelingssamenwerking", die zich moest beraden over het antwoord op de vraag rond welke thema's de Vlaamse universiteiten de komende jaren zwaartepuntonderzoek in het BVO wensen uit te bouwen, had zich in eerste instantie akkoord verklaard met de volgende vijf algemene thema's :
<P>
 
<OL>
<LI>armoedebestrijding,
<LI>politieke, juridische en culturele dimensie van ontwikkeling,
<LI>economische dimensie van ontwikkeling,
<LI>duurzame ontwikkeling, en 
<LI>onderwijs, opleiding en onderzoek.
</OL> 
De Werkgroep ging er bovendien vanuit dat het de bedoeling moet zijn bij het concipi&#235;ren van een beleid van zwaartepuntvorming elk algemeen thema te verfijnen naar &#233;&#233;n of maximum twee subthema's, wat een selectie van subthema's impliceerde. De Werkgroep oordeelde dat het antwoord op de vraag rond welke thema's zwaartepuntonderzoek dient te worden uitgebouwd, ondermeer samenhangt met het Vlaams, universitair ontwikkelingsrelevant onderzoekspotentieel, alsook met het beleid dat de Vlaamse universiteiten m.b.t. het BVO willen voeren en de eigen inspanningen die zij ervoor willen leveren. Tenslotte dient ook rekening te worden gehouden enerzijds met het zwaartepuntonderzoek dat elders rond ontwikkelingssamenwerking wordt bedreven, ondermeer door de Franstalige universiteiten, en anderzijds met de internationale agenda's en de actualiteit. De criteria voor de selectie van subthema's werden derhalve afgestemd op deze vooronderstelling : er werd gekeken naar het bestaande universitair onderzoekspotentieel m.b.t. deze subthema's (i.e. de onderzoekservaring terzake en de bestaffing van de onderzoekseenheid die zich met dergelijk ontwikkelingsrelevant onderzoek inlaat), naar de bereidheid van de universiteit om dit onderzoek ook via eigen middelen te ondersteunen, en naar de relevantie van het subthema binnen het geheel van het BVO. 
<P>	
<H4>2. Geselecteerde thema's m.b.t. zwaartepuntonderzoek in het BVO</H4>
<P>
Op 20 oktober jl. keurde de VL.I.R.-Werkgroep "Ontwikkelingssamenwerking" het voorstel goed dat door het VL.I.R.-secretariaat was uitgewerkt op basis van de universitaire voorstellen, de informeel door het ABOS voorgestelde thema's voor BVO 1996, de door Staatssecretaris R. MOREELS als prioritair aangekaarte thema's in zijn beleidsnota, de ABOS-referentietermen voor de BVO 1995-thema's en de BVO 1995-thema's van CIUF.
<P>
Hieronder wordt het voorstel integraal weergegeven.
<P>
<HR>
<P>
<center><H4>Voorstel m.b.t. thema's voor zwaartepuntonderzoek in het kader van BVO<BR>
	(Oktober 1995)</H4></center>
<P>
<H4>1. Armoedebestrijding</H4>
<P>
<I>Algemeen</I>
<P>
Armoedebestrijding staat opnieuw vrij hoog geplaatst op de internationale ontwikkelingsagenda (cfr. Sociale Top van Kopenhagen, maart 1995), zo ook op de nationale agenda, gelet op de recente uitspraken van Staatssecretaris R. MOREELS. Het is evenwel niet vanzelfsprekend om deze centrale doelstelling te integreren en te operationaliseren in de werking van het ABOS. De effici&#235;ntie en effectiviteit van armoedebestrijdingsprojecten op micro-niveau worden immers in grote mate geconditioneerd door de macro-beleidscontext. In dit verband dient verwezen naar de globale macro-economische context van de mondialisering van de economie als structuur wijzigende context van ontwikkelingssamenwerking, alsook concreet naar de structurele aanpassingsprogramma's en andere economische stabilisatie- en hervormingsprogramma's die worden opgelegd door het IMF, de Wereldbank en andere multilaterale donoren en kredietverstrekkers. Maatregelen in het kader van dergelijke hervormingsprogramma's hebben vaak een aanzienlijke impact op projecten van bilaterale donoren. De koppeling van macro-economische ontwikkeling aan de armoedeproblematiek is essentieel voor een evenwichtig ontwikkelingsproces. 
<P>
Uitgangspunt voor de concrete uitwerking van dit algemeen thema vormt de vraag naar de effecten van ontwikkelingsprojecten op de spreiding van de voordelen van ontwikkeling en ontwikkelingssamenwerking onder de verschillende groepen in de lokale samenleving, waarbij bijzondere aandacht dient uit te gaan naar de spreiding van deze voordelen onder de armste groepen van die samenleving. Indien donoren op een coherente wijze een beleid van armoedebestrijding willen voeren, dan hebben zij een instrument nodig dat hen toelaat de situatie in het hulpontvangend land correct te beoordelen, koppelingsmechanismen in werking te stellen en de effici&#235;ntie ervan te evalueren, teneinde hun beleid bij te sturen indien en waar nodig.  
<P>
Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema. 
<P>
<I>Specifieke subthema's </I>
<P>
1. Bijdragen van donoren tot de ontwikkeling van een sociale economie in de gegeven macro-economische context. Specifieke aandachtspunten vormen :
<UL>
<LI>werkgelegenheid, inkomensverdeling en werkloosheid;
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>de rol van multilaterale donoren, publieke overheden en NGO's bij de uitvoering en het beheer van projecten in het licht van armoedebestrijding.
</UL>
2. De organisatie en ontwikkeling van basisgezondheidszorg.
<P>
<H4>2. Politieke, juridische en culturele dimensie van ontwikkeling </H4>
<P>
<I>Algemeen</I>
<P>
Het betreft onderzoek naar de politiek-juridische dimensie van ontwikkeling, inzonderheid in de Afrikaanse context, met daarbij ruime aandacht voor culturele tradities. Toch gaat het hierbij niet uitsluitend om formele structuren. In verschillende landen wordt het effect van ontwikkelingssamenwerking doorkruist en vaak tenietgedaan door conflicten langs etnoculturele breuklijnen. Hoe hierop praktisch het best ingespeeld wordt via ontwikkelingssamenwerking, dient te worden onderzocht. Er moet voorts worden nagegaan hoe, in geval van conflicten in het algemeen, de overgang van noodhulp naar permanente ontwikkeling best dient te worden georganiseerd. Voorts dient ook aandacht te worden besteed aan de ontwikkeling van een civiele maatschappij.
<P>
Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema. 
<P>
<I>Specifieke subthema's </I>
<P>
1. Politieke stabiliteit : conflictpreventie en -beheersing, en de rol van ontwikkelingssamenwerking hierin
2. Democratisering : 
<UL>
<LI>de opbouw van de civiele maatschappij, o.m. door de ontwikkeling en versterking van cultureel ingebedde plurale rechtssystemen, met daarbij aandacht voor de rechtszekerheid
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>lokale bestuursvormen, goed bestuur en decentralisatie.
</UL>
<H4>3. Economische dimensie van ontwikkeling</H4>
<P>
<I>Algemeen</I>
<P>
De mondialisering van de economie heeft de context van ontwikkelingssamenwerking grondig gewijzigd. Afrika bleef tot nog toe evenwel in grote mate verstoken van een participatie in de internationale groeidynamiek die vele andere ontwikkelingslanden (e.g. in Zuidoost-Azi&#235; en Latijns-Amerika) de afgelopen jaren kenden. Een van de grote uitdagingen voor een ontwikkelingsbeleid bestaat er derhalve in om de economische ontwikkelingskansen voor de Afrikaanse landen te maximaliseren in deze internationale context. Sinds kort hebben experten en internationale organisaties erkend dat ontwikkeling zonder een valorisatie van de rol van het bedrijfsleven weinig uitzicht biedt om echt duurzaam te zijn. Het BVO-onderzoek rond dit globaal thema zou zich concentreren op de voorwaarden voor een economische groei- en ontwikkelingsdynamiek. Hierbij zal in het bijzonder aandacht worden besteed aan het entrepreneurship in ontwikkelingslanden. 
<P>
Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema.
<P>
<I>Specifiek subthema </I>
<P>
Entrepreneurship in ontwikkelingslanden : impact van buitenlandse directe investeringen bij transfert en diffusie van technologie in de lokale economie; groeiremmende factoren bij de ontwikkeling van industri&#235;le ondernemingen in Afrika; internationalisering en privatisering; rol van ontwikkelingssamenwerking bij deze ontwikkelingen.
<P>
<H4>4. Duurzame ontwikkeling</H4>
<P>
<I>Algemeen</I>
<P>
Het betreft onderzoek naar duurzame ontwikkeling in de context van de ontwikkelingsproblematiek en het opvolgen van de internationale agenda terzake, alsook onderzoek naar de beleidsimplicaties hiervan voor de Belgische ontwikkelingssamenwerking.
<P>
Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema.
<P>
<I>Specifieke subthema's</I>
<P>
1. Verstedelijking en duurzame ontwikkeling : knelpunten inzake de implementatie van Agenda 21 in het Belgisch ontwikkelingsbeleid, met nadruk op stedelijke planning, woonzekerheid, decentralisatie en milieudraagkracht in middelgrote steden in onwikkelingslanden.
2. Capaciteitsopbouw inzake leefmilieu zowel in de ontwikkelingslanden als in het ABOS.
<P>
<H4>5. Onderwijs, opleiding en onderzoek </H4>
<P>
<I>Algemeen</I>
<P>
Uitgangspunt vormt de vraag hoe in de derde wereld, en in Afrika in het bijzonder, enerzijds het onderwijs in zijn verschillende vormen en op de verschillende niveaus, en onderzoek en ontwikkeling/technologie anderzijds een lokale ontwikkelingsdynamiek kunnen ondersteunen. Meer in het bijzonder zal worden nagegaan op welke wijze ontwikkelingssamenwerking kan bijdragen tot een grotere socio-economische en culturele verankering van onderwijs en onderzoek, dit zowel wat betreft organisatiemodellen, onderwijsinhouden als pedagogische en onderzoeksmethodologie&#235;n.	
<P>
Speciale aandacht dient te worden besteed aan de rol van de vrouw in het kader van dit thema. 
<P>
<I>Specifieke subthema's</I>
<P>
1. Integratie van het basisonderwijs in de socio-economische realiteit van ontwikkelingslanden
2. Onderzoek en ontwikkeling/technologie als factor in het ontwikkelingsproces van derde-wereldlanden, met daarbij bijzondere aandacht voor de opleiding van het lokaal onderwijzend personeel en voor de bijdrage van de universiteiten tot de invulling van de onderzoekscomponent van de lokale universiteiten
<P>
<H4>3. Voorbereiding BVO 1996</H4>
<P>
Dit voorstel van de Vlaamse universiteiten zal, tezamen met de voorstellen van thema's resp. van het Kabinet voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking en het ABOS, worden besproken door de Stuurgroep "Beleidsvoorbereidend Onderzoek" tijdens haar volgende vergadering op 13 november 1995. In deze Stuurgroep zijn zowel de universiteiten als het Kabinet voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking en het ABOS vertegenwoordigd. De Stuurgroep zal uit de drie lijsten een selectie van thema's maken en deze aan de Staatssecretaris voor Ontwikkelingssamenwerking voorstellen als prioritaire thema's voor BVO 1996. Eens de Staatssecretaris de lijst van thema's definitief heeft goedgekeurd, zal de oproep aan de universiteiten tot het indienen van voorstellen worden gelanceerd. Indien het overleg in de schoot van de Stuurgroep vlot verloopt, moet het mogelijk zijn de oproep te lanceren nog vóór het einde van het jaar.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. NETHERLANDS FOREIGN MINISTRY PUTS OUT BOOKLET
ON DUTCH PRESIDENCY OF THE EU</FONT></B>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2> </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=2>The Foreign Ministry
of the Netherlands has published a booklet on the current Netherlands
Presidency of the EU, outlining the Presidency's agenda. Priorities
identified, concerning internal affairs, are: the Intergovernmental
Conference; preparations for European Monetary Union and preparations
for enlargement of the Union. External affairs priorities are
listed as: the Middle East peace process; the follow up to the
Barcelona Conference; development in the former Yugoslavia and
transatlantic relations. The booklet states that the Dutch Presidency
will also focus on other areas determined by the need for continuity
and coherence.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> On development co-operation, which notably is not
one of the priority areas, the Presidency will primarily seek
practical ways of achieving coherence in policy, especially external
policy. The Dutch are to adopt an integrated approach on three
themes which are on the agenda of different councils: food security/fisheries,
development co-operation/conflict management, and migration and
development.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> Specifically, the EU's relationship with Africa,
is described as being given increasing attention, with the EU's
adopted position on preventive diplomacy and conflict prevention
in response to a Franco-British initiative. The Netherlands Presidency
will work to secure support from fellow EU Member States for the
imposition of an arms embargo in the tension filled areas of sub-Saharan
Africa. Talks are also under way on convening a Euro-African Summit
for Heads of States.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> On the Barcelona Process the Netherlands will help
prepare a follow up (Barcelona II) to the 1995 Conference on EU
relations with the Mediterranean region, scheduled for April in
one of the Mediterranean countries. The Presidency aims to improve
the structure of the follow up activities and achieve concrete
results in the implementation of the Barcelona Declaration. The
Declaration encompasses security, political, socio-economic and
cultural issues. The Netherlands will highlight measures to build
confidence in the political and security field, liberalisation
of trade, and matters relating to democratisation and good governance.

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. SOUTH AFRICA TO REJECT  EU PROPOSAL ON A FREE
TRADE AREA?</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> According to government sources, South Africa is
expected to give its formal response to the European Union's proposal
on the eventual establishment of a free trade area and other aspects
of the trade dimension of the bilateral agreement between the
two areas. The sources revealed that South Africa will reject
the EU offer made, as a basis of negotiation, last June. Allegedly,
the main reasons for South Africa's refusal are: a) the  EU's
proposal does not correspond to the objective of the negotiations,
namely, the development of South Africa after its democratic transition
phase; b) a free trade agreement would be of more benefit to the
EU due to its trade surplus; c) the agreement would be detrimental
to the economic interests of South Africa's neighbours, which
are members of  the South African Development Committee and the
South African Customs Union; and d) the exclusion of 40% of agricultural
goods from the free trade area contravenes WTO rules.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The South African government has in the past, repeatedly,
expressed its dissatisfaction with the EU's position on the issue.
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT ELECTS NEW VICE-PRESIDENTS</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The European Parliament this week elected Jose Maria
Gil-Robles Gil Delgado as the new President of the Parliament.
Mr Gil Delgado a Spanish Christian Democrat replaces German MEP,
Klaus Hansch. Fourteen vice presidents were also elected. They
are: Ms. Fontaine (France, European Peoples Party), Ms Perry (France,
Socialist), Mr Martin (Britain, Labour), Mr Anastassopoulos (Greece,
European Peoples Party), Mr Gutierrez Diaz (Spain, United Left),
Ms Schleicher (Germany, European Peoples Party, Mr Imbeni (Italy,
Socialist) Mrs Hoff (Germany, Social Democrat), Mr Verde i Aldea,
(Spain, Socialist), Mr Avgerinos, (Greece, Socialist), Mr Marinho
(Portugal, Socialist), Mr Capucho (Portugal, European Peoples
Party), Mr Haarder (Denmark, Liberal) and Mr Podesta (Italy, Union
of Europe).<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. EP SATISFIED WITH RESULTS OF WTO MINISTERIAL
CONFERENCE</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2> The European Parliament on Thursday 16 January discussed
the results of the recent WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore.
During the discussions, Jacques Santer, the President of the European
Commission expressed his satisfaction, on the whole, with results
of the WTO meeting. According to Mr Santer 'the Commission's actions
in Singapore have ensured that the initiative in favour of less
developed countries has not been purely and simply buried.' He
however conceded that the Conference did not make the breakthrough
the Commission hoped for on relations between environment and
trade and on fundamental social standards. German Christian Democrat
MEP, Peter Kittelman, who is the Rapporteur on the WTO, also welcomed
the results of the Singapore Conference, but warned developing
countries and newly industrialised countries against the temptation
of using their competitive advantage to protectionist ends. Mr
Kittelman also noted that the extension of the suspension of the
Helms-Burton act by US President, Bill Clinton, confirmed EU policy
on the issue as just.<BR>

<P>
<B>1. ACP/EU JOINT ASSEMBLY PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR LOME CONVENTION
AFTER THE YEAR 2000</B>
<P>
<B> </B>The ACP/EU Joint Assembly on Tuesday 1 October invited
 EU and ACP political leaders to launch a broad public debate
on the future of co-operation between the ACP and the EU after
the year 2000. A report by the Joint Assembly's rapporteur on
the subject, Mr. Firmin Jean-Louis, described the continuation
of co-operation between the EU and ACP (with some necessary adjustments)
after the Lom&eacute; IV expires in the year 2000 as vital. This
is due to the past Lom&eacute; Conventions' successful contribution
to the North-South dialogue. 
<P>
 Among the issues that should be considered in the debate are
the specific natures and particularities of the various ACP countries,
the involvement of non-governmental bodies in financial and technical
co-operation, the encouragement of regional co-operation amongst
the ACP countries and the fostering of private initiative in the
development process. 
<P>
 Mr. Firmin Jean Louis earlier noted that ACP-EU co-operation
had so far not resulted in great improvements of the socio-economic
situation in most ACP countries. 38 ACP countries are still listed
among the 47 poorest countries in the world. He called for increased
partnership between government, civil society and local organisations.

<P>
 Mr. Richard Cheltenham, a Barbados representative, voiced his
hope that the Lom&eacute; Convention facilities STABEX and SYSMIN
will be maintained, stating that the Convention should not be
revised downwards. Mr. Francis Wurtz, a French representative,
 called for aid to be focused on self-sufficiency in food, technological
transfers for processing raw materials and development in infrastructure
that will foster development. He urged the EU and its Member States
to work towards the cancellation of the ACP debt. He also stated
that the European public should be made aware that lasting growth
in Europe is dependent on development in Third World countries.

<P>
<B>2. DISPARITY BETWEEN EUROPE'S TOP DECISION MAKERS AND THE GENERAL
PUBLIC IN THEIR OPINION OF THE EU</B>
<P>
<B> </B>A  first-time survey of Europe's top decision makers carried
out by <U>Eurobarometer</U> has revealed a great difference between
how decision makers and the general public view the EU. 94% of
the decision makers defined as elected politicians, high level
civil servants, business and labour leaders, the media, academics
and religious and cultural leaders consider EU membership as advantageous.
The strongest support for the EU among decision makers was found
in Germany (98%) and the weakest in Sweden (84%). Amongst the
general public the EU's strongest support was in Ireland, Italy
and the Netherlands (75%) and weakest in Austria and Sweden with
27% and 29% respectively. 
<P>
 Decision makers and the general public also differed on what
they considered priority issues in the coming years, with the
former stating the establishment and maintenance of peace as the
main priority followed by fighting unemployment, while the general
public considered fighting unemployment over the maintenance of
peace as the top priority. On the issue of a single currency,
85% of  decision makers are pro monetary union while only 53%
of the general public want a single currency.
<P>
<B>3. ACP/EU JOINT ASSEMBLY CALLS FOR COMMUNITY POLICY ON IMMIGRATION</B>
<P>
 The ACP/EU Joint Assembly on Monday 30 September condemned immigrant
policy that puts an emphasis on xenophobia and the mistrust of
foreigners. The Joint Assembly urged the European Community to
establish a common immigrant policy recognising basic rights to
housing, freedom of speech, freedom of association, reuniting
of families, education and protection against discrimination and
arbitrary deportation. 
<P>
 The Assembly called on the Union and its Member States to increase
aid to ACP states and create a healthy environment that would
discourage migration from the ACP countries to Europe. It also
urged ACP and EU Member States to introduce harsher penalties
for all those who exploit immigrants and take advantage of  their
precarious situation. 
<P>
<B>4. EU HUMANITARIAN COMMISSIONER ATTACKS SILENCE ON HUMAN RIGHTS
VIOLENCE IN AFGHANISTAN</B>
<P>
 Emma Bonino, the European Commissioner for Humanitarian Aid,
has attacked the silence from the UN, the USA and some EU Member
States such as Sweden on the violation of human rights and restriction
of the rights of women in Afghanistan after the Talibans seized
power. On Wednesday, 2 October she appealed to the EU and the
UN to react on the matter and described the issue as one of western
hypocrisy. Mrs Bonino stated &quot;if such a situation occurred
in Sudan or Iran, the reaction would be different&quot;. She added,
&quot; When a situation of violation of human rights continues,
there is a major risk that this will result in humanitarian crisis,
together with a political crisis&quot;. 
<P>
 Last July the Commission approved of a 7 million ECU aid package
for public health projects, mine clearance and for financing of
part of the World Food Programme in Afghanistan. Mrs. Bonino expressing
her concern a bout distribution of this package, stated that &quot;Since
11 September, not a single convoy has been able to get through
to Kabul&quot;. 
<P>
 
<P>
<B>5. WESTERN SAHARAN REFUGEES TO RECEIVE 6.5 MILLION ECU FROM
EU </B>
<P>
<B> </B>The European Community Humanitarian Office, ECHO has granted
an aid package of 6.5 million ECU to the Western Saharan, refugees
in Algeria. The aid will assist some 150 000 people displaced
by the fighting between the Polisario Front and the Moroccan army.
The greater part of the package will be used to finance food,
and medical aid (5 million ECU). The rest will go towards the
repair of public buildings destroyed in recent floods.

Software and help

<br clear=all><br>


<h3>LISTENING</h3>

In order to sample the audio features live over the Internet you need the Shockwave browser plug-in.  It is available free from Macromedia:


<b><a href="http://www.macromedia.com/shockwave/download/" target=mm_window><br clear=left>
<font size=2>Download the Shockwave plug-in</font></a></b>
<br clear=all><br>

Macromedia provides its own <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/technotes/shockwave/" target=mm_window>shockwave technical support page</a> which will give you all the information you need about hardware requirements, installing and using the Shockwave plug-in.
 
<h3>PLAYBACK</h3>

Audio features are encoded in high quality RealAudio 3.0 in order to give them the best local playback potential.  You must have the RealAudio player installed on your computer.  It is available free from Progressive Networks:


<b><a href="http://www.realaudio.com/products/player/index.html" target=mm_window><br clear=left>
<font size=2>Download the RealAudio Player</font></a></b>
<br clear=all><br>

For more information about RealAudio, consult the <a href="http://www.realaudio.com/help/FAQ/" target=mm_window>Frequently Asked Questions</a> index.  There is also extensive <a href="http://www.realaudio.com/help/library/"  target=mm_window>technical support</a> available on the site.

<h3>RECORDING AND REBROADCASTING</h3>

Once you are equipped with the correct software, all you need to do is to record the local audio playback from your computer to whatever system you are using.  Your computer will have an 'audio out' or a 'headphones' socket on the back - simply connect this to your recording machine.

<h3>QUALITY</h3>

Audio features available here have been recorded to a much higher quality than would be possible with live over-the-Net playback - there simply isn't the bandwidth available for high bit-rate audio streaming, so we are offering features for download and local playback instead.  The quality should be about AM-quality - slightly below conventional FM broadcast quality.

<b>Suggested intro/cue material:</b>
Elections are due again in Kenya, but political dissidents complain that the electoral process is deeply flawed and will serve merely to reinforce President Daniel Arap-Moi's grip on power.  One of these dissidents is Koigi wa Wamwere, who is the country's best-known opposition politician, and who has spent much of his life in prison because of his views.

<p>
<b>In:</b> What are the obstacles to free and fair elections...<p>

<b>Length:</b> 2 mins 54 secs<p>



<b>Out:</b> ...engulfed in a fog of fear.<p>

<b>Back announcement:</b> Koigi wa Wamwere, interviewed by free-speech campaigner Philip Spender.  This feature was provided by the OneWorld Radio News Service.
<p>


<b>Background information:</b> Koigi wa Wamwere is a writer and a polician.  He is the former MP for the town of Nakuru, about 120 miles from Nairobi.  He has spent more than ten years in prison on charges varying from treason to armed robbery, after trials which have been condemned as unfair by human rights groups.  His wife and three children live in exile in Norway, and Koigi wa Wamwere has stated publicly that he expects to be murdered by the security forces when he returns to Kenya. <p>

<b>Suggested intro/cue material:</b>
If you eat soya beans, and most of us do without even realising it as soya bean oil is used in many food products, then you should be concerned about the increase in genetic manipulation. To find out more about this complicated subject I asked molecular biologist, Professor Lucas Reinders, what Monsanto, the company which designs these new-style soya beans, has really done to them.
<p>
<b>In:</b> These beans have been altered...<p>

<b>Length:</b> 1 min 54 secs<p>



<b>Out:</b> ...not completely convincingly established.<p>

<b>Back announcement:</b> Prof Lucas Reinders of the University of Amsterdam, interviewed by Francis Rolt.  This feature was provided by the OneWorld Radio News Service.
<p>


<b>Background information:</b> Professor Lucas Reinders is a member of the advisory committee to the Dutch government on genetic issues.  He was interviewed in December 1996 by OneWorld's Radio Correspondent Francis Rolt.  The issue of genetically manipulated food crops exploded on to the world agenda during the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's Rome Summit in November 1996, after environmental activists stripped naked in front of the United States Agriculture Secretary to protest at the domination of the conference by agribusiness interests and concerns.  Soya beans are only one of the crops to face genetic modification.  Others include maize (corn), which has been altered by Ciba-Geigy to resist the corn borer pest; the 'Flavr-Savr' tomato, which was engineered to last longer on supermarket shelves, and new varieties of oilseed rape and sugar beet.<p>

<b>Suggested intro/cue material:</b>
The child sex industry is an international trade - which is one reason why it's so hard to bring people to trial. The British charity Christian Aid has worked with a number of organisations in the Philippines to try and stop the child sex trade. And the organisation's Martin Cottingham told OneWorld's Anuradha Vittachi  how he went undercover to amass evidence against one British sex tour operator.

<p>

<b>In:</b> Michael Clark was a travel agent...<p>

<b>Length:</b> 2 mins 25 secs<p>



<b>Out:</b> ...in October '96.<p>

<b>Back announcement:</b> Martin Cottingham of the charity Christian Aid, interviewed by Anuradha Vittachi.  This feature was provided by the OneWorld Radio News Service.
<p>


<b>Background information:</b> The issue of child sex tourism hit the world headlines after the World Congress Against Sexual Exploitation
of Children was held in Stockholm, Sweden in the summer of 1996.  Christian Aid has been working to combat child sex tourism in co-ordination with local and international NGOs.  Martin Cottingham is Christian Aid's press officer and was directly involved in exposing Michael Clark's activities in the Philippines - for which he has now been given a long jail sentence.  Anuradha Vittachi, the Editor of OneWorld Online, interviewed Martin at the OneWorld Online offices in November 1996.

<b>Suggested intro/cue material:</b>
In November 1996 Max Havelaar imported its first bananas to The Netherlands - and they were an immediate hit. The fair trade organisation Max Havelaar is already well known in Holland for buying coffee and cocoa from farmers' cooperatives and companies in developing countries which promise environmentally sustainable production, and fair wages and working conditions. Francis Rolt went along to the Max Havelaar offices in the Dutch town of Utrecht and asked Rita Oppenhuizen about their latest stamp of approval for bananas.

<p>
<b>In:</b> We have a quality seal...<p>

<b>Length:</b> 1 min 35 secs<p>



<b>Out:</b> ...trading bananas who are more healthy for the workers.<p>

<b>Back announcement:</b> Francis Rolt talking to Rita Oppenhuizen about fairly traded bananas.  This feature was provided by the OneWorld Radio News Service.
<p>


<b>Background information:</b> From 19 November  1996 more than 700 shops across Holland were selling bananas with the Max Havelaar stamp of approval, which guarantees that production was socially and environmentally responsible.  Eight supermarkets in Holland agreed to include the bananas, which are marketed under the name Ok&eacute;.  Despite that fact that farmers in Ecuador and Ghana receive about twice as much for producing the Ok&eacute; bananas as they do normally, they are still  competively priced in the shops.
OneWorld's Radio Correspondent Francis Rolt talked to Max Havelaar's press and publicity officer Rita Oppenhuizen in December 1996.

According to Azeem Azhar of <i> The Guardian On-Line</i>, the researchers reckon that Internet usage keeps on growing - by as much as 10% each month.

Thirty long years, I might add, during which time it was one of the few things in the world which I could rely upon. It was a tangible constant, unlike other things I might mention, such as wives, families and children; a series of unfortunate events, none of which had any direct bearing on this story. The only thing with which this matter could be compared is that fascination which we call love, for it was such an obsession.<p>One might consider 30 years to be a little long to write something as simple as a story. It is a long time; a lifetime in your case. Why did I do it? What kept me at it ? The long sleepless nights, the frustrations, the crumpled sheets of paper, not to mention the eternal domestic conflicts incurred by such a hopeless pursuit? The stories became my life, it is as simple as that and my life became the stories. Everything else fell outside the limits of that ring of light. And who could not say that he did not regret having been blind?<p><center><img src ="ni_pix/269_amnesia1.gif" ></center><p>You ask me, so I will tell you: the world fell apart long before you were born. The image which had been so preserved for, well for as long as anyone could remember, was suddenly shattered. Before the world as we know it now came into being, there was another world; very similar in many ways, but on the whole quite different. Of course it looked much the same as it does now; a blue ball bobbing along in that inky black ocean of space. They even sent some poor fools out there to take a photograph, just to prove the fact; which goes to show just how primitive they were in those days. It is still the same floating ball, perhaps not quite as blue, a little more grey maybe, like everything else.<p>A lonely, heart-broken place was the world into which you squeezed; plagued by suffering and war of every description. Time began to accelerate and as it did so, so it seemed that the dream to whose task humans had set themselves began to metamorphose, to change shape. It stretched and it bent, this way and that, like a star folding in on itself, like a box, or one of those black holes which sucks in all of its own light. The world suffered a series of catastrophes, some of them freaks of nature, but the majority of them were human-made. People began to question the role of humans in the scheme of things and there was a resurgence of shallow religious soul-searching.<p>By this time of course I was completely dedicated to what was to become this story - or stories, for in truth it was like a finely woven tapestry - although I was not aware of it at the time. I embarked on a series of projects, each one completely absorbing in its own right, and each one but a tiny step along the way, although it was not until later that I was able to see this.<p>We had entered the age of the Information Revolution, as it was called. It was no different from any of those other infamous events that dot the charts of history. Yes, people cheered and waved their banners; metaphorically speaking of course, slogans bounced around the globe like decapitated heads in sixteenth-century Paris. <p>Things happened very quickly. The world was divided, no longer by borderlines that ran along the earth, but byinvisible strata that filled the air likeclouds which you could not quite grasp. The transglobal and the local becameinterchangeable. Everyone was either on the move, or thinking about it. There was no longer any difference between what happened right in front of you and what happened on the other side of the world. A similar thing happened to reality - people could no longer tell the difference between inter-space and the real world; which of them after all was real? Philosophy could not help us and neither could religion.<p>I see that I am already in danger of becoming side-tracked. Of course everything was relative. Those parts of the world which were excluded from this new exchange simply vanished. That is to say nothing was ever heard from them. No-one knew whether people still lived there anymore and thus they ceased to exist. Of course one aspect of this revolution was the dissolution of countries as such. They had been crumbling for a long time and with the instability and general decay of the less wealthy regions of the world, it seemed wiser to form new conglomerate blocs. Like everything of course, this never worked out the way it was planned, but was rather an absurd parody. No sooner were they formed and secure than they began to eat away at themselves from within.<p>No matter; the world had grown much smaller, and it was to continue to do so. The poor and the rich lived side by side, if not on top of one another. New feudal states were formed around individuals, corporations and mercantile banks. They formed their own subcultures within the main cultural sphere. Where wealth resided they constructed the equivalent of kingdoms; huge shining towers of glass and steel. These contained everything necessary for the existence of the inhabitants. Because of the difficulties of travel, people stayed at home, where it was safe and comfortable and they really had no need of anything. It was this isolation which brought about the Information Revolution itself, which had actually happened some decades before, only no-one had actually noticed. The second time around it was no longer radical, but it was far more powerful, because it was necessary.<p>They constructed a series of invisible nets which they threw around the world. They tore down the stars and threw up hundreds of gleaming alloy orbs to hold the threads together. People spoke to one another across thousands of miles of empty space. They could not open a window, but they could make babies with someone on the other side of the world without leaving their room. This net grew of course, something like a giant tuber or beanshoot maybe, growing thicker and stronger as it circled the planet. And inside this was concealed all the radiance and brilliance of humankind; the achievements of centuries.<p>In the old days they used to fight over land, but land had by now been deemed worthless. A series of hypothetical lands appeared and were subsequently the focus of heated frenzy. For a time, all that counted was knowledge about these lands; worlds within worlds and since no-one dared to go out and find these places, no-one could really prove whether they existed or not. Information was being shovelled back and forth like iron ore or stone. It clogged up the mind the way lead fumes used to, like coal dust in the lungs.<p>It was out of this that our group was formed. We were radical in those days, our motto was 'Communication, not information!'. We got together to adopt a country. This was the way of things then. Since the collapse of the UN in a scandal whereby countries had been sold off to a chain of mafia-like charity organizations there was nothing to stop anyone wishing to involve themselves this way. This was not really so bad. Private investment had been what governments had been doing anyway. It cleared the air. Outside the places where wealth resided the world had also splintered into tribes and camps of the most primitive and bizarre form. There were countries devoted to the worship of whales; different forms of superstition; political ideologies; sexualorientations of every kind; automobiles; cosmologies; cutlery; in fact anything one could think of. Somewhere inside all this confusion there was humanity and it was this to which we were determined to devote ourselves. <p>By now some of the problems I was up against might be clear: no matter how fast I worked, it seemed to be slipping out of my hands at every turn. We decided to withdraw, to return to a timescale measured by the rise and fall of the sun. It soundssimple-minded, and perhaps it was, but it was all we could do.<p>Then came the Last Great Plague, a virus that raged through the electronic archives eating up everything it could find. An epidemic of such proportions that nothing could withstand it. Everything was lost; the entire sum total of human existence was gone forever. Books had long since been recycled into toilet paper and what have you. Writers and intellectuals had been siphoned out to make way for technologists whose knowledge was worthless without the archives to activate them. We were left with nothing.The great cities of past civilization were closed to us. The language which they used was a hybrid form so that although we knew the foundation upon which it was based, we could not decipher the layers of slang and new words. We were alone, and from this came the stories.<p>The future was no longer somewhere in the far off distance, but here and now. Where the stories came from, nobody really knew, but they began to grow, building upon one another naturally and of their own accord. They were our story, collectively, alone. They helped to pass the long starlit evenings; stars for which we only had the ancient names. Each story was a guide, a pointer toward something that we called ourselves. The history of the world was to begin again.<p>I have no idea where you are or whether you will ever find this, or even whether you will be able to decipher this message; but know that I have not given up, that I am still working, and one of these days this work will be done and there will no longer be any need to wince at the word memory: for we will have regained our ability to remember.	<p><hr><font size=-1><b>Jamal Mahjoub</b> is a Sudanese-British writer living in Denmark.

<html><head><title>oda Aiding the Earth</title><!!keys: ODA+Rio de Janeiro+Earth Summit+forestry+biodiversity+climate change+desertification></head><body><img src="oda_pix/oda_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by </i>  <a href="oda_info.html"> Overseas Development Administration </a><hr><h2>Aiding the Earth</h2><h3>Rio to Reality</h3><p>The Western Ghats, a chain of forested hills in Karnataka, south-western India, are an ecosystem under stress. They have been used for wood and other forest products. This has left them degraded and over the years they have become less able to meet the needs of local people or to provide a home to wildlife. A £25 million ODA project is helping the Indian government to establish new ways of managing the forest, emphasising greater participation from everyone involved, from state officials to village women who gather firewood. This has led to a quiet revolution in the hills. Forest rangers who once acted as forest police now work with villagers to plan and manage the forests and new trees are being planted. This benefits the forest ecosystem and also boosts the local economy through the sale of nuts, leaves and bark.<p>At Rio, Prime Minister John Major identified five key areas in which the aid programme would promote sustainable development and environmental objectives. These were forest management, biodiversity, population, sustainable agriculture and the efficient use of energy. By 1994 the ODA had redesigned or revised strategies for each of these, which are shaping Britain's help to developing countries as they put Agenda 21 into effect.<p>More than 150 countries met at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 and produced Agenda 21, a wide-ranging plan of action for sustainable development into the next century. At the heart of Agenda 21 is the idea of national sustainable development plans. All sections of the community should be involved in producing these plans which stress the need for cooperation between everyone from governments and non-governmental organisations to businesses, trade unions, local communities and scientists. Participation and cooperation are the keys to successful sustainable development.<p>The Western Ghats project is just one example of this cooperative approach to conservation in 1994. Since the Earth Summit people everywhere have become more aware of the need to ensure that economic development and conservation go hand-in-hand. 1994 was an important year in the process of turning Rio into reality, because it saw the first working session of the UN Commission for Sustainable Development (CSD) which was established to monitor how well all countries are meeting the aims of Agenda 21.<p><b>Forests</b><br>Forests are the richest ecosystems on land. They are home to a huge variety of species, especially the rainforests. Forests also play a vital role in regulating world climate by absorbing carbon dioxide. They protect water sources, prevent soil erosion and are major sources of all-important raw materials and economic wealth. Rio introduced international guidelines for protecting them.<p>Currently, the ODA is working on about 200 forestry projects in 45 countries at a cost of over £157 million. Many, like the Western Ghats, encourage sustainable forest management. Others support agroforestry, which combines sustainable agriculture and forestry.In September 1993, Britain and India signed the Indo-British Forestry Initiative. A highly successful workshop was held in July, which produced guidelines for countries to follow when reporting to the CSD on forestry. <p><b>Biodiversity</b><br>  The enormous variety of plants and animals is not just a feature of beautiful wildlife programmes. Biological riches also feed, clothe and heal us and are the basis of our economic development. Britain ratified the Rio Biodiversity Convention in June 1994, and produced its own Action Plan in January 1994 to show how the Convention will be implemented in the UK.Between 1991 and 1994 the ODA spent over £34 million to help conserve biodiversity in developing countries. Projects range from habitat conservation to support for national conservation plans and systems.<p><b>Climate change</b><br> Greenhouse gas emissions from industry and agriculture are heating the Earth's atmosphere and triggering potentially serious shifts in world climate.  Britain ratified the Rio Climate Change Convention in 1993, and Britain's own strategy for action was published in 1994. The Convention aims to balance the need to control emissions with the desire to maintain development.<p>Last year the ODA funded research on methane emissions from rice cultivation and the potential impact of climate change on coral reefs and tropical crops. And for some years, the ODA has helped people from developing countries participate in meetings of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which researches and reports on the problem.  <p><b>Energy efficiency</b><br> Improving efficiency in producing, distributing and consuming energy is one of the best ways of controlling atmospheric pollution and global warming.  Using less energy also cuts costs - a plus for any national economy. Through its strategy for energy efficiency, the ODA's work last year focused on all these issues, and concentrated too on alternative energy sources such as wind power for pumping water. Between 1991 and 1994 the ODA spent over £140 million on projects that promote energy efficiency.<p><b>Ozone depletion</b><br>	 The use of CFCs and other chemicals has torn holes in the atmosphere's ozone layer, leaving plants and animals vulnerable to harmful radiation. To help developing countries meet the extra costs of phasing out these chemicals, Britain had, by the end of 1994, committed £27 million to the Montreal Protocol Fund.<p><b>Desertification</b><br>	Overgrazing, poor farming techniques and drought in dry regions, particularly in Africa, have degraded the land. This can severely reduce the land's capacity to support both people and animals. The importance of a renewed international effort to combat land degradation was recognised at Rio and in June 1994, the Desertification Convention was adopted. It emphasises the need for planning that involves local communities' full participation in a wide range of activities from soil conservation to tree planting. Britain has signed the convention and is working closely with developing countries on many of the issues that it covers.<p><b>Protecting the global environment </b><br>The Earth Summit recognised that some environmental issues are global and therefore need global responses. But developing countries are clearly less able to respond than industrialised countries - they have less access to resources and need to concentrate those they have on national development. The international community recognised this and established the Global Environment Facility. The GEF helps developing countries meet the additional costs of protecting the global environment, including their responsibilities under the Climate Change and Biodiversity Conventions. To date, Britain has committed a total of £130 million to the GEF.<p><b>Research</b><br>The ODA's Environmental Research Programme started in 1991 and is now well established. It is supporting research into such areas as the effects of climate change on tropical agriculture and on coral reefs, population and the environment and the relationship between tourism and conservation.<p>Findings from research carried out under the ODA's Strategy for Research on Renewable Natural Resources help developing countries to increase the productivity of their renewable natural resources, in ways that are both sustainable and environmentally sound. British universities and other institutions work closely with the ODA on this research, which includes crop and livestock production, forestry, fisheries and post-harvest issues.<p>The <a href="http://www.nri.org/">Natural Resources Institute (NRI)</a> is the ODA's executive agency that handles most of its scientific work. This includes:<ul><li>assessing and managing resources and farming systems  developing approaches to pest control that minimise the use of  harmful chemicals and safeguard users, consumers and the environment.<p> <li> using food science to create a link between producers and consumers by investigating post-harvest problems and finding solutions.<p>  <li>The ODA also commissions research on policy and institutional issues aimed at increasing the impact of its natural resources programmes.</ul><p><b>Sustainable agriculture </b><br>Abdul tends his crop of chilli peppers. Aid has made it possible for him to earn a living and support his family. Agenda 21 highlights the importance of ensuring that food production for today'spopulation is not at the expense of the natural resources on which future generations will depend. <p>Under its sustainable agriculture strategy, the ODA supports projects that work with farmers like Abdul to maintain or enhance the productivity of the land, sea, rivers and lakes, while improving long term food security. Over the last three years, the ODA has spent over £100 million on sustainable agriculture projects.<p>One cold water tap providing the only source of sanitation for several households is a typical state of affairs for families living in Shanghai's huatongs Ð small single-storey houses. But the Shanghai Environmental Project aims to put an end to these conditions.  The ODA, together with the World Bank, is financing this large-scale engineering venture with Britain's contribution currently running to almost £2.5 million.<p>Thousands of bicycle fish traders in Sri Lanka used to lose much of their daily stocks because the little ice they could afford would melt en route. The ODA through the NRI developed small lightweight insulated boxes to replace the traditional wooden carrying boxes. They are now being produced locally and have significantly improved the money these low-paid traders make. Contact with the NRI project has brought traders together to form a trade association for the first time.<hr>©Copyright: ODA 1995<hr><a href=index.html"><img src="oda_pix/oda_logo2.gif"> ODA Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<html><head><title>Dual AIDS theory explains Third World epidemic</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff"><img src="panos_pix/panos_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="panos_info.html"> Panos </i> </a><hr><h2>Dual AIDS theory explains Third World epidemic</h2><h3>By James Deane, director of the AIDS programme at Panos</h3>Kampala: There are two largely distinct AIDS epidemics, claims Professor Max Essex of the Harvard AIDS Institute - one affects the industrialised world, and the second affects developing countries. <p>This theory, if correct, would help explain why HIV has spread so rapidly in developing countries, where 90 per cent of all HIV infection is found, and why it has spread more slowly in the industrialised world.<p>It would also mean that the industrialised world is still vulnerable to a large-scale AIDS epidemic and it could pose problems in developing an effective AIDS vaccine.<p>The controversial theory also raises questions around the widely-held belief that the rapid spread of HIV in developing countries is due largely to the presence of untreated sexually transmitted diseases. <p>Essex's theory, discussed in Kampala at the recent International Conference on AIDS in Africa, suggests that there might be important differences among existing strains of HIV.<p>Scientists have identified as many as nine different strains circulating in different parts of the world. Essex has studied five of these strains and argues that one - the so-called B strain - is comparatively difficult to spread through  heterosexual intercourse. It is this B strain that is found mainly in Europe and North America, where HIV has been spread mainly through intravenous drug use and through male-to-male sexual contact.<p>In contrast, the other main sub-types - A, C, D and E - are found mainly in those developing countries in Africa and Asia where HIV is believed to spread predominantly through heterosexual intercourse. Key characteristics of these sub-types allow them to be spread particularly easily by sexual intercourse, Essex says.<p>His argument is that the virus from these sub-types grows particularly well in what are called langerhans cells, which exist in high density in the vagina and foreskin of the penis. This makes it easier for the virus to be transmitted during sex. By contrast, the B strain of the virus does not grow as well in these cells. All types of the virus seem to grow equally well in blood cells known as monocytes.<p>	To illustrate his theory, Essex points to countries such as India where the epidemic of the B strain of HIV has been comparatively limited despite having reached the country first. The C strain, though, has spread very rapidly, infecting well over one million people in less than 10 years. In Thailand, the B strain appeared first but has spread relatively slowly; the E strain has spread very rapidly since it appeared in the late 1980s.<p>	Conventional explanations for the AIDS epidemic in heterosexual populations of Africa and Asia include socio-economic factors and widespread sexually transmitted diseases, the sores and ulcers of which are believed to facilitate HIV infection. <p>	If Essex is right, then the sub-types that have so far not been prevalent in industrialised countries could, once established, spread much more rapidly than the B strain. <p>	Essex's ideas provoked scepticism among some conference delegates. <p>	"These theories can seem convincing in the laboratory," said Dr Philippe Mayaud of the African Medical Research Foundation, "but we know from practical experience on the ground that sexually transmitted diseases are a key factor in the spread of HIV. When we treated those diseases, the number of new HIV infections fell."<p>	Mayaud has been closely involved in a recent project in Mwanza, Tanzania, where the number of new HIV infections was almost halved after services to treat other sexually transmitted diseases were improved.	While Essex acknowledges that sexually transmitted diseases play a significant role in the spread of HIV - most studies point to a three- to five-fold increase in vulnerability of HIV infection if someone already has a sexually transmitted disease - he argues that this is not enough to explain the speed at which HIV is spreading in the developing world compared with industrialised countries. <p>	"The differences are much more than three- to five-fold in the transmission of heterosexual cases," he argues. They are, he says, more like 100-fold or 200-fold or even 400-fold.<p>	"Furthermore, in some places such as Thailand, the appearance of sexually transmitted diseases appear to be less important than in sub-Saharan Africa."<p>	If Essex's theory is correct, it could have important implications for the development of an AIDS vaccine. The vaccines at the most advanced stage of testing are currently being tried out in Thailand. However, most of these are based on sub-type B only, although some preliminary trials with a vaccine based on a combination of B and E strains are also underway.<p>	Dr Jose Esparza, director of vaccine development at the World Health Organisation, says that some experts believe a vaccine produced against one sub-type may protect against other sub-types.<p>	"There are two candidate vaccines currently being tested in Thailand," he says. "These are the only - and perhaps last - opportunity to show whether this particular type of vaccine can induce some protection. <p>	The vaccine trials "should be conducted for three reasons," Esparza says. "First they may work and we can't know if they work unless we try them. Second, the vaccines may not be very good but we may learn something about the type of immune response that may protect against HIV infection. Third, those vaccines may not work, but we had better know that and the only way to find out is through experimentation."<p>	Essex is optimistic that a vaccine that will be effective in developing countries will be found, and hopes it can be done within five to seven years. <p>	"But to do that, leaders at the highest levels of both Western and developing nations will have to get together to agree some kind of formula, not only for vaccine design and testing but also for ultimate distribution of a vaccine."<p>	The most compelling argument for many Western countries to invest in such a vaccine may be Essex's claim that they have escaped a major AIDS epidemic so far because the most efficient strains of HIV have not been present there.<p>	It is, Essex says, in the "best interests of Western governments and leaders to recognise this problem because I believe that it is likely that other strains of HIV will be moving into the West - indeed they are already." <p>

Children stroke her soft hair. Overhead, a gentle sun breaks through the clouds. It could be any rural scene in Britain.<p>Except it isn't. This is Uganda in east Africa, and the cows have names like Kisakye (God's love) and Kisa-Kya-Katonda (God is grace).<p> The cows enjoy it here. At around 50 inches of rainfall a year there is plenty of grass for them to eat and the high altitudes mean the sun is warm rather than scorching hot.<p>Farmers enjoy owning the cows, too. For them a cow is often the only way to provide milk, with its valuable protein and vitamins, for their families.It also gives them the chance to sell any left-over milk to pay for schooling and other necessities.<p>Most of these cows didn't start out in Uganda. They came from Britain, via a small charity, Send a Cow, which was set up in 1988 by a group of west country farmers. <p>They were concerned that civil war in Uganda had depleted the country's stocks of cows and that many farmers, with years of livestock experience, couldn't afford to replace the cows they'd lost.<p>Under the scheme farmers in Britain donate cows to the charity. In recent years, the charity has also sent semen and bulls, to help farmers breed sturdy cross-breeds.  <p><h4>Supporters</h4>Funds for its work come from supporters, including schools and Third World groups, and the ODA, which matches pound for pound any money raised.<p>Most farmers donate black and white Friesian cows although some light brown Jersey and Guernsey cows are also sent. <p>Each cow is carefully checked by vets before boarding a Boeing 707 from Gatwick airport. Once the cows arrive in Entebbe they are put into quarantine for around two weeks before meeting their new owners. For many people, the first sight of their cow is an emotional one."You don't know how much I love you, you make me happy," is how one group of children greeted their new addition. <p>Most new cow owners are women. Women like Kizza Mirab, a widow who lives on the edge of Kampala city in Uganda. Her cow - and the calf it bore - means she has enough milk to feed her six grandchildren and still have enough left over to sell.<p> <i>"I am thankful for my grandchildren's sake and I am thankful for my life because I am a diabetic and I feel so much better now," &nbsp;</i>she says. <p>Leicestershire farmer Anthony Herbert, Send a Cow's chairman,  reckons that the animals have a better life than back home.<p><i>"Cows are treated more like family pets than they would be in Britain where they are part of a large dairy unit," &nbsp;</i>he says.<i> "They are content in the hot weather, too. In fact, you're more likely to find them discontent on a wet, rainy, cold day."&nbsp;</i><p>Everyone who is allocated a cow gets training to help them prepare for the big day. Once the cows arrive, they are kept in enclosures and fed on grass. This 'zero grazing' means that they don't damage the local environment.<p>Calves are passed onto other families to spread the benefits around the local community. The cows also provide extra employment, as farmers often pay someone else to collect the food and water for the animals.<p>Some benefits are less obvious. Anthony Herbert recalls: <i>"One marriage guidance counsellor told me that the cows were even helping people's marriages - people felt more secure financially and they had a greater sense of purpose." &nbsp;</i><a name="women"<p><hr><p><center><h2>WOMEN WORK FOR FAIRER WORLD</h2></center>Many women in developing countries work harder than men, in the home and outside. Many have fewer rights and are less educated. But slowly, women are demanding change. In September, women  - and men  -  from all over the world are descending on Peking, China, for the fourth world conference for women.<p>The British aid programme is helping women in developing countries to increase their opportunities and rights. These case studies show what this means.<a name="men"></a><p><hr><p><center><h2>MEN PLAY A ROLE, TOO</h2></center>Working with women doesn't mean ignoring the men. Men in Blantyre, Malawi, are learning about family planning and related health issues. The sessions developed because men were not allowing their wives to go to family planning clinics.  <p>So a local organisation Banja La Mtsogolo (Family of the Future) set up the 'Man to Man project'. Male health workers met groups of men at work. Now more women are attending the clinics - and their husbands are coming with them and getting involved in family planning decisions, too.<a name="skills"></a><p><hr><p><center><h2>WOMEN IN GHANA BOOST THEIR SKILLS</h2></center>Most women in Ghana do paid work. Yet more than two thirds of them have no formal education. <p>Being unable to read  and write or cope with numbers makes their work far more difficult. Women traders and farmers can be cheated because they can't read the scales that tell them how much their crops weigh, or add up what they are owed. <p>But things are starting to change. The Government of Ghana launched a nationwide literacy project to teach reading, writing and numeracy to adults. The World Bank and the ODA helped with the project, which was aimed at adults, particularly  women from the poorest communities. "I feel high when I put my folder under my arm on the way to school," said one woman.  Another one said: "My husband always brought me an aspirin if I didn't feel up to going to class. He also helped me with my homework."<a name="seeds"></a><p><hr><p><center><h3>FARMERS GROW SEEDS</h3></center>Winter in the hills of Nepal is hard work for the women farmers. Food for the animals is scarce, so the women spend most of the day collecting fodder and wood from the forest.<p> The forests are becoming over-used, so the women have to search further away from their villages. The solution? A community plantation near home, a reliable source of fuelwood and fodder.<p> The idea came from local people, who worked with staff at the nearby Lumle Agricultural Research  Centre to solve the problem.<p>As part of the scheme, women from 23 villages chose the seeds and seedlings they wanted. <p><i>"The group plantation has made our lives a lot easier. We now have more time for other jobs, and even for our families," says Anita Pun from the remote village of Khibang.&nbsp;</i><a name="booklet"></a><p><hr><p><center><h4>FREE BOOKLET</h4></center>These case studies are taken from the ODA's latest booklet: <i>Making aid work for women, &nbsp;</i> 24 pages of case studies  and colour photographs featuring ODA projects that focus on women.<p>Free copies are available from<br> Julia Horsnell, Information Department,<br> ODA, 94 Victoria Street, London SW1E 5JL.<p><hr><p><center><h3>WORD WATCH:</h3></center>  <b>Development terms explained</b><p>Economic development is about increasing the <i>surpluses&nbsp;</i> produced, so that people can enjoy better standards of living...<p><h4>Surplus</h4>Extra food or goods produced by a family or a community which can be sold or invested. Most societies produce surplus goods. Very few societies operate a subsistence economy, where everything they grow or produce is used for their own daily needs.<p><p><hr>©Copyright: Oda 1995<hr><p><center><TABLE BORDER=5><TR><TD><a href="oda_info.html"><img border=0 src="oda_pix/oda_logo2.gif"></a></TD><TH><a href="index.html"> ODA Home Page</a></TH><TH><a href="ssch_schools.html">School Section</a></TH></TR></TABLE></center><p></body></html>

<H3>La plate-forme autrichienne du Comit&#233; de liaison ONGD-UE se pr&#233;sente</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR>
<P>
Peu apr&#232;s l&#146;adh&#233;sion de l&#146;Autriche &#224; l&#146;Union europ&#233;enne le 1er janvier 1995, la plate-forme UE des organisations non-gouvernementales de d&#233;veloppement autrichiennes (ONGD) a &#233;t&#233; cr&#233;&#233;e. A cette &#233;poque, les ONGD autrichiennes les plus importantes s&#146;&#233;taient d&#233;j&#224; unies dans le cadre d&#146;un groupe de travail de coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement efficace, l&#146;AGEZ. 
<p>
C&#146;est ce groupe qui prit l&#146;initiative qui d&#233;boucha sur la fondation d&#146;une plate-forme UE afin de jeter les fondements d&#146;une repr&#233;sentation d&#233;mocrati-quement reconnue des ONG autrichiennes au sein du Comit&#233; de liaison &#224; Bruxelles.
<p>
Au d&#233;but, tout le monde &#233;tait vivement int&#233;ress&#233; par cette plate-forme UE, en particulier les ONG de taille plus r&#233;duite qui n&#146;&#233;taient pas membres de l&#146;AGEZ et esp&#233;raient ainsi obtenir un acc&#232;s ais&#233; aux fonds de l&#146;UE. Mais ce ne fut pas la seule raison qui poussa plus de 30 organisations &#224; rejoindre la plate-forme UE. Il y avait &#233;galement des consid&#233;rations relatives &#224; la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, mais elles se sont transform&#233;es en frustration, partiellement en raison du fait que 
l&#146;acc&#232;s aux &#147;fonds du grand Bruxelles&#148; s&#146;est av&#233;r&#233; beaucoup plus difficile que ce qui &#233;tait initialement escompt&#233;. Certaines organisations ont quitt&#233; la plate-forme UE, d&#146;autres en feront probablement autant d&#232;s l&#146;instant o&#249; le cofinancement du Comit&#233; de liaison les obligera &#224; verser des contributions beaucoup plus &#233;lev&#233;es &#224; leur plate-forme nationale.
<p>
Toutefois, en d&#233;pit de ce changement d&#146;attitude, il n&#146;en demeure pas moins que, au cours des deux derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, la plate-forme UE s&#146;est av&#233;r&#233;e &#234;tre un instrument sp&#233;cialis&#233; suppl&#233;mentaire plut&#244;t utile pour traiter les questions de d&#233;veloppement europ&#233;ennes. L&#146;intention n&#146;a jamais &#233;t&#233; de cr&#233;er une nouvelle structure repr&#233;sentative des ONG parall&#232;le &#224; l&#146;AGEZ, mais de travailler en &#233;troite collaboration avec l&#146;AGEZ dans le domaine de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement europ&#233;enne et dans leurs t&#226;ches repr&#233;sentatives respectives tout en limitant autant que possible les frais administratifs. Par cons&#233;quent, la plate-forme UE ne dispose d&#146;aucun secr&#233;tariat ni d&#146;aucune autre structure administrative permanente.

<H3>Mode d'organisation</H3>

L&#146;assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale des plates-formes se compose de quelque 30 organisations membres qui se r&#233;unissent deux ou trois fois par an. L&#146;assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale &#233;lit un groupe de travail compos&#233; des six d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s du Comit&#233; de liaison, des repr&#233;sentants des groupes de travail permanents du CL et du secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral de l&#146;AGEZ. Ce groupe se r&#233;unit tous les deux ou trois mois.
<p>
La plus grande partie du travail de la plate-forme UE est accomplie par les membres du groupe de travail et leurs organisations en collaboration avec le secr&#233;tariat de l&#146;AGEZ. C&#146;est ce qui fait &#224; la fois la force et la faiblesse de la plate-forme autrichienne. Dans ce mode de travail d&#233;centralis&#233;, de nombreuses questions relatives &#224; la politique de d&#233;veloppement europ&#233;enne sont trait&#233;es sur une base socio-politique beaucoup plus large et par un plus grand nombre d&#146;ONG que ce qui se passerait si un seul secr&#233;tariat propre &#224; la plate-forme s&#146;acquittait de cette t&#226;che.
<p>
La plate-forme UE a donc confi&#233; toutes les questions relatives au d&#233;bat sur la politique du d&#233;veloppement &#224; un groupe de travail sp&#233;cialis&#233; de l&#146;AGEZ.
<p>
La documentation compl&#232;te engendr&#233;e par cette collaboration avec l&#146;UE est soigneusement compil&#233;e par la Fondation autrichienne pour la recherche au d&#233;veloppement (OFSE, une organisation membre de la plate-forme), et repr&#233;sente le plus important et le plus grand centre de documentation sur la politique de d&#233;veloppement.

<H3>Relations avec les institutions gouvernementales</H3>

La coop&#233;ration avec les minist&#232;res autrichiens a toujours &#233;t&#233; excellente et les ONG autrichiennes, ainsi que de nombreux membres de la plate-forme UE, ont travaill&#233; en coop&#233;ration &#233;troite avec l&#146;Etat autrichien dans le domaine de la mise en oeuvre des projets. Etant donn&#233; qu&#146;il n&#146;existe en Autriche aucune institution gouvernementale officielle charg&#233;e de la mise en oeuvre des projets, les ONG et d&#146;autres institutions non-gouvernementales (des entreprises priv&#233;es, par exemple) assument de nombreuses t&#226;ches dans le cadre de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement officielle et sont &#233;galement financ&#233;es par l&#146;Etat autrichien.
<p>
La proportion &#233;lev&#233;e de fonds publics accord&#233;s &#224; ces organisations, qui sont &#233;quip&#233;es de mani&#232;re professionnelle en ce qui concerne la mise en oeuvre des projets, constitue d&#233;sormais un obstacle au cofinancement de l&#146;UE, &#233;tant donn&#233; que nombre d&#146;entre elles ne disposent pas de ressources propres. Au cours de la derni&#232;re d&#233;cennie, elles n&#146;ont pas eu besoin d&#146;un financement sur la base de ressources propres &#233;tant donn&#233; qu&#146;elles pouvaient compter sur le financement public. C&#146;est pourquoi, certaines ONGD autrichiennes ne r&#233;pondent pas &#224; tous les crit&#232;res qui sont actuellement &#233;tablis par le Comit&#233; 
de liaison pour d&#233;finir une ONGD.

<H3>Une approche critique</H3>

Au cours des deux derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, les ONGD autrichiennes ont &#233;t&#233; vivement encourag&#233;es par l&#146;adh&#233;sion autrichienne &#224; l&#146;UE et la coop&#233;ration &#233;troite que cela a engendr&#233; avec le Comit&#233; de liaison. Cela a permis une meilleure compr&#233;hension du fonctionnement d&#146;une ONG et a d&#233;bouch&#233; sur de nouvelles mani&#232;res de g&#233;rer et d&#146;alimenter le d&#233;bat en mati&#232;re de d&#233;veloppement (en particulier sur la toile de fond de la Conf&#233;rence intergouvernementale), ce qui &#233;tait &#233;galement un des objectifs principaux de la plate-forme UE en 1996. En 1997, elle s&#146;int&#233;ressera principalement aux probl&#232;mes de Lom&#233;, un nouveau sujet sur lequel l&#146;Autriche va se pencher.
<p>
La discussion interne concernant la fonction et les t&#226;ches du Comit&#233; de liaison &#224; Bruxelles et le r&#244;le &#224; jouer par les plates-formes nationales, ainsi que la mani&#232;re de coop&#233;rer se poursuivra certainement en 1997. En qualit&#233; de nouveau membre de l&#146;UE, l&#146;Autriche se posera probablement davantage de questions que d&#146;autres pays concernant l&#146;int&#233;r&#234;t et la n&#233;cessit&#233; d&#146;avoir l&#146;une ou l&#146;autre institution europ&#233;enne &#233;tant donn&#233; que, jusqu&#146;&#224; pr&#233;sent, nous nous &#233;tions plut&#244;t bien d&#233;brouill&#233;s sans &#147;Bruxelles&#148;.
<p>
Ceci ne signifie pas pour autant qu&#146;on remet en question l&#146;int&#233;r&#234;t de l&#146;int&#233;gration europ&#233;enne en tant que telle, mais qu&#146;on s&#146;interroge sur certaines d&#233;formations et certains effets secondaires que les Etats membres traditionnels consid&#232;rent comme normaux. Les ONGD autrichiennes ont l&#146;intention d&#146;adopter comme principe de base une approche critique des structures existantes, y compris dans le cadre de leur coop&#233;ration avec le Comit&#233; de liaison.

Its role as a major donor has been particularly important in several geographical areas, notably sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, and in key sectors such as education, agricultural research, health and population, and private enterprise. The United Kingdom has many prominent institutions in the development field and an enormous amount of expertise, building on long experience in developing countries."<b>Development Assistance Committee,</b> OECD, February 1994</i><p><hr><p><h3>A Dramatic Message</h3> The Igawilo Clinic is part of the ODA's Health and Nutrition District Support project in Mbeya, Tanzania. It has around 20 full-time members of staff, working in the clinic and outside, serving a community of 20,000 people. It treats over 200 people a day, mostly women and children. In addition to providing immunisation and treating day-to-day ailments, the clinic runs a health education programme. Family planning, sexually transmitted diseases and nutritional issues all feature strongly in monthly awareness campaigns. The health staff convey these messages through a novel medium - a drama group, formed and performed by local people.<p>Awareness of development and environmental issues at home was given new life this year with the launch in April 1994 of the ODA Roadshow bus - Aid that's really going places.The bus - donated by Badgerline - has carried the development theme into many schools, town centres and exhibitions throughout Britain and brought the aid message to hundreds of schoolchildren.<p>Forests in Indonesia will be a little safer thanks to a recent £38 million British aid project there.  Indonesia is home to the world's second largest rainforest. Timber is one of the country's principal export industries and provides livelihoods for hundreds of families. However, the industry requires constant and efficient policing to prevent illegal logging and devastating forest fires. The radio communications project, managed by Philips Communication Systems, has provided the Ministry of Forestry in Jakarta with the means to keep track of illegal activities and maintain contact with its 100 regional offices, 200 branch offices and 600 local centres. Aid for this project was provided under the Aid and Trade Provision which finances projects of industrial and commercial importance to Britain - thus benefiting developing countries directly while helping Britain win contracts abroad. In 1993/94, over £85 million was spent on the ATP.<p><b>Lifeline to small business</b><br> With the introduction of electricity, stallholders in New Market, Dhaka, Bangladesh, can now stay open all hours. They get their electricity from the Greater Dhaka Power project to which the ODA has given over £63 million. Many other people in the area are also better off now that they have electricity. Growing industries such as garment manufacture, brick-making, printing and steel are benefiting from improved services. And strengthening the cityÕs industry should mean thousands of new jobs and training opportunities, desperately needed in an area where most people live on or below the poverty line.<hr>©Copyright: ODA 1995<hr><a href=index.html"><img src="oda_pix/oda_logo2.gif"> ODA Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

What role, if any, can foreign donors play to encourage democracy in Africa south of the Sahara?
Sound political institutions are normally developed at home. If they are imported, they have to be
assimilated into local culture if they are to succeed. On the whole, the recent introduction or
reintroduction of multi-party systems in Africa has not produced economic recovery and it may not
have produced the purely political results which reformers had hoped for. Of paramount importance
in Africa is the way in which foreign and local pressures and interests combine in the formation of
institutions, including the new political institutions of democracy.
<p>
This paper begins with a brief account of democratisation in Africa and will show how it marks both
a rupture and a continuity with older traditions. It then tries to isolate those factors which may not
figure in classical definitions of democracy, but which are important for the success or failure of
democracy as part of a system able to produce stable government, social justice and material
prosperity. We will assess briefly the experience of democratisation of some African countries before
considering what donors have contributed and what actions they might anticipate in the future.

<P>
<B><a name=1.1></a>1.1 Foreign policy</B>
<P>
Since the loss of its colonies, both diplomats and scientists
have come to view The Netherlands as as a European middle power,
but nevertheless as <I>a nation of significance</I>. The combined
attack of Britain and France in 1672 brought an end to the dominant
European power The Netherlands were in the 16th and 17th centuries.
Henceforth collective security to protect an opportunistic commercial
policy was sought. The loss of the colonies in the East Indies
was generally seen as the final end to the possibility of playing
a major role in world power struggles and, from 1949 on, The Netherlands
became an ordinary European nation. Nevertheless the economic
power and the strategic position of The Netherlands with regard
to its <I>Hinterland</I> Germany, give it a special position behind
the superpowers. This economic power is reflected in the <I>Great
Powers in a Small Country</I>, including Royal Dutch Shell, Unilever,
Philips, Akzo/Nobel, DSM. This economic power has also entitled
The Netherlands to director's posts in the IMF and the World Bank.
And it has generally been expected that the reconstruction of
Germany after World War II would restore The Netherlands to its
lucrative position as a distribution country: A centre of European
north-south trade in the 15th and 16th centuries, The Netherlands
serve as a world port for central Europe now.
<P>
 There have been some fierce debates with regard to the character
and content of Dutch foreign policy and the policy changes that
have occurred since World War II. Given the commercial power of
the country and its interest in uninterrupted trade, Dutch foreign
policy can generally be described under the rubric of <I>Peace,
Profits and Principles</I>. The principles though, only came to
the fore when they did not intervene with the profits. Moreover
peace and principle play their most important roles in public
and political discussions and debates, while profits are mostly
emphasized in the execution of foreign policy.
<P>
 A first point of contention is, if there is a major difference
between the neutral position of The Netherlands at the beginning
of the 19th century and its Atlantic, NATO-oriented foreign policy
since World War II. In my opinion, there is no break in the policy
as continuity can be clearly found in the old Dutch search for
collective security in order to protect foreign trade. In its
fear of continental imperialism -- wether from Spain, France,
or later Germany, The Netherlands has always sought alliances
with potential protectors such as Britain. Only the short-term
commercial advantages sought by Dutch merchants might bring policy-makers
from this line. With fierce continental power struggles and no
superpower at hand, the most logical line of defence for Dutch
commercial interests is neutrality. Power relations after World
War II clearly changed and, the most logical line of defence now
became alignment with the most dominant superpower, one who would
and could rule the seas, which was the United States. The Netherlands
therefore changed its neutrality after World War II to become
<I>The Most Loyal Ally</I>.
<P>
 The Atlantic stand has remained the central line in foreign policy.
Only in the seventies, when the US-intervention in Vietnam got
out of hand and the dictatorial practices in some NATO member-states
came more to the light, did the vocabulary change a bit. The NATO
decision of the beginning of the eighties to station cruise-missiles
encountered huge public resistance, but the Dutch government nevertheless
decided to station 46 missiles on Dutch territory. It has become
increasingly difficult to reconcile the pro-Atlantic and pro-European
policies. The 'NATO first and Europe second' stand seemed to be
most logical for collective security. In view of the moere recent
changes in commercial interests, that have been shifted almost
totally to Europe however, the stand should be probably the other
way around. More than half of the Dutch national income stems
from foreign trade with about three quarters of this coming from
Europe.
<P>
 The ethical content of Dutch foreign policy represents a second
point of contention, and is currently in the focus of debate as
the new cabinet reverifies Dutch foreign policy. It is often stated
that the calvinist heritage behind Dutch foreign policy biases
it towards principles rather than interests or profits.Along these
lines the conservative liberal (VVD) party-leader, Bolkestein,
has recently argued that national interests should play a major
role in the conduct of foreign policy. A certain amount of &quot;multilateral
naivety&quot; is certainly imbedded in Dutch foreign policy in
recent years, where diplomatic activity has been only sparsely
successful in meeting at least short term Dutch interests (e.g.
contribution to the EC, number of votes in the EU, location of
EU organizations). The multilateralism of The Netherlands sometimes
appears to have fostered a quite uncritical attitude towards international
forums.
<P>
<B><a name=1.2></a>1.2 Evolution in foreign-aid priorities 1965-1995</B>
<P>
For most authors writing on Dutch foreign policy the foreign aid
programme is seen as that part of foreign policy that no any doubt
belongs to the territory of principles. A review of the history
of the Dutch foreign aid programme, however, shows this to be
a rather naive view.
<P>
 The Netherlands is internationally seen as a humanitarian aid
donor: it spends more than the UN-target of 0.7% of GNP on foreign
aid; in the eighties this was between 0,9 and 1,0%; a large part
of the aid goes to the least developing countries; The Netherlands
is a strong supporter of international organizations, also of
UN-organizations; a significant part of its sectoral spending
is presumed to go to basic human needs, the so-called social sectors.
The Netherlands is generally viewed as similarly to the Scandinavian
countries in this regard.
<P>
 This idea of a Scandinavian-like Dutch aid programme has been
largely fuelled by Dutch government's presentation of its foreign
aid-programme, but also by scientific publications directed at
non-Dutch audiences. Voorhoeve's (1979) 'Peace, Profits and Principles'
is a clear example of this. Dutch foreign aid is in his view a
clear example of the representation of principles in Dutch foreign
policy. Similarly Bertholet c.s. (1984) has completely overlooked
the economic/commercial interests present in Dutch foregn-aid
policy from the beginning. With their analysis they put Stokke
(1984) more or less on a wrong footing when he, relying on them,
states: &quot;Except for the colonial background, the origin and
rationale for Dutch aid had much in common with those of the Scandinavian
countries.&quot; The aid-programme came under sharp attack from
aid organizations, politicians as well as research groups in The
Netherlands itself in the sixties and seventies because of its
commercial underpinnings, but this critique does not appears to
have ever reached the international audiences.
<P>
In the period from 1949-1960 -- the twilight zone between colonial
politics and the formulation of a new development policy -- Dutch
development cooperation only existed out of a small programme
with limited funds. Furthermore The Netherlands showed a clear
preference to a multilateral approach, because the demand for
its tropical expertise would be proportionally larger than its
share in development capital. In 1965 a first Minister without
portfolio responsible for aid to developing countries was appointed.
In 1966 this Minister Bot published his first report, which would
remain the backbone of policy until 1973. The shift towards bilateral
aid became very clear in the 1966 report. It paid no attention
to the pros and cons of bilateral aid, nor to the resistance to
it that previous governments had displayed. It simply noted that:
'The central conflict in the debates which were held previously,
namely that between bilateral and multilateral aid, is now no
longer controversial' (Report on aid to Less Developed Countries,
1966). Bilateral aid expanded steadily. the Ministry of Economic
Affairs already administered 20% of the project programme in order
to finance projects initiated by trade and industry. The influence
of Economic Affairs in the actual spending of aid money expanded
until 1973, because the bilateral financial aid programme came
also under its responsibility.<HR>

<P>
In May 1973, Jan Pronk -- a pupil of Tinbergen's and representative
of the 'New Left' in the Labour Party -- became Minister for Development
Cooperation. A number of conflicts over competence were resolved
even before the formation of the cabinet was completed. For instance,
Pronk came to share the responsibilities for the World Bank and
the development banks with the Ministry of Finance, and he alone
was now responsible for financial aid. It was only in the White
Paper on Bilateral Development Aid, an appendix to the 1977 Budget,
that the new goals and framework for and of the development cooperation
policy came to the fore. Development aid was to be &quot;for the
poor, as much and as directly as possible&quot; (Report on Bilateral
Development Cooperation, 1976). This change in policy can be seen
as the second turning point in the history of Dutch development
cooperation (after the first in 1965), because &quot;Dutch aid
policy is now finally being explicitly formulated&quot; (Bol,
1976). Nevertheless, the report was not a radical break with the
past for there was too much emphasis on quantity rather than on
quality. It missed both an evaluation of the aid provided previously
and &quot;a translation of broad aims into practical policy proposals&quot;
(Bol, 1976). Organizational problems provided a preference for
large projects in which a lot of aid money could be spent and
projects brought in by the Dutch business community. Despite the
humanitarian outlook thus, the commercial interests in the Dutch
aid programme were quite high. The% of aid actually spent in The
Netherlands itself decreased a little bit, from about 90% in the
beginning of the seventies to about 75% at the end of the seventies.
<P>
 Minister De Koning entered in office in 1978 and he was quick
to make a change in the policy goals. The aid continued to be
directed at &quot;the most direct improvement of the position
of the target groups&quot;, but was now also intended to &quot;stimulate
political and economic self-reliance&quot;. This two-track directive
became the central guideline for policy (Budget Paper, 1979).
Relative to Pronk's policy, this widening of the policy goals
could be termed more in accordance with implemented policy, they
also respresented a decline in idealism.
<P>
In the government agreement of the first Lubbers-cabinet in 1982,
it was emphatically stated that: &quot;Dutch development cooperation
shall have to respond to the possibilities and capacities contained
in the Dutch economy and society&quot;. In April 1984 the White
Paper entitled <I>Reverification of bilateral policy</I> was published.
This report indicated that the goals of development policy should
be pursued &quot;in a balanced synthesis of both policy tracks,
those of poverty alleviation and the promotion of self-reliance.&quot;
It was further indicated that this should take place in the form
of &quot;structural poverty alleviation&quot;. The White Paper
met with a lot of criticism, which was mainly directed at the
strong emphasis on the role of the private sector in the aid programme.
<P>
 In July 1986, the second Lubbers Cabinet came into office. A
flood of publications proposing a change in the duties of the
Minister of Development Cooperation and a reorganisation of the
Ministry had occurred beforehand. These changes were not, however,
undertaken during the cabinet formation. CDA-chairman Bukman,
who had previously been active in farmers' organisations, had
indicated an interest in this post and he duly received it. This
period was to become the blandest period in the history of Dutch
development cooperation. Neither in his budgets nor his speeches
did this minister demonstrate any sign of originality. He leaned
heavily on his staff, and dullness was the order of the day.
<P>
<B><a name=1.3></a>1.3 Recent changes and current objectives</B>
<P>
In November 1989 the third Lubbers cabinet came into office. The
cabinet was a coalition of CDA and PvdA, with Jan Pronk as Minister
for Development Cooperation for the second time. Since then, three
events have contributed to a new and dynamic period in Dutch development
cooperation: the publication of the White Paper <I>A World of
Difference</I>, continued attempts to diminish the budget for
Development Cooperation, and the cancellation of Dutch aid to
Indonesia. One can again speak of a turning point in the history
of Dutch aid.
<P>
 September 1990 saw the publication of the lengthy report entitled
<I>A World of Difference</I>. This White Paper contains an analysis
of the place of development cooperation in a decade distinguished
by the end of the Cold War. Three developments are highlighted
as making development cooperation different than in the Cold War.
First the fading boundaries created by the disappearance of the
military-political blocs. These have changed the face of the political
world order and will, for example, place the issue of human rights
higher on the agenda of western development. Second, increased
risks being created by the population explosion, the exhaustion
of natural resources and the overly heavy demands being placed
on the environment. Third, the smaller margins as the national
economic policy in developing countries in particular, is more
and more determined by the world market.
<P>
 It was concluded that &quot;sustainable poverty alleviation&quot;
should be the central goal of Dutch development policy. Three
items were thought to be of central importance for poverty alleviation.
The first of these was the investment in people and their productive
potential; the second was provision of basic needs; and the third
was broadening poor people's participation in political decision-making.
Three elements then constituted sustainable development: growth
of production, equitable distribution and the maintenance of the
environmental utilisation space.
<P>
 The translation into concrete proposals is perhaps the weakest
part of the White Paper. In the two last chapters devoted to the
implementation of the new policies the Minister is clearly hindered
by the lack of evaluations of several aid instruments and the
lack of integration of the existing evaluations coming from other
donors. A marked naivete with regard to the workings of aid in
practice is also apparent.
<P>
 Three years later, a new White Paper appeared under the title
<I>A world in conflict</I>. The optimism that was part and parcel
<I>A world of difference</I> had totally vanished. Rather than
the bricks of the Berlin Wall falling, the guns of Liberia, Sudan
and Somalia now determined the tune. Pronk saw conflict in the
Third World spreading like a bushfire. In Pronk's eyes the Cold
War had also mitigated conflict in the Third World. One now had
to think about establishing collective security prior to poverty
alleviation and development. The barriers between foreign policy,
defence policy and development-cooperation should therefore be
minimized and vertical bureaucratization should come to an end.
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs should also be prepared to pay
for peace enforcement and peace keeping out of the aid budget.
<P>
 In 1994, the christian democrats and the socialists suffered
a heavy blow in the parliamentary elections. After a long period
of cabinet formation the so-called 'purple coalition' emerged
as the first cabinet without the christian-democrats in the present
century. Pronk returned to his post as Minister for Development
Cooperation. The government parties could not come to an agreement
with regard to defence and development-cooperation policies. A
reverification of foreign policy was therefore announced and this
reverification was expected to be finalized prior to summer of
1995.
<P>
<B><a name=1.4></a>1.4 Trade promotion</B>
<P>
As is already indicated in the preceding trade promotion was an
important ingredient in the foreign-aid programme of The Netherlands
since the beginning. This situation changed dramatically in 1973,
however, when the Ministry of Economic Affairs lost its hand in
the allocation of aid. Officials from this ministry are still
present at negotiations with aid-receiving countries, but their
influence is rather small because of country programming.
<P>
 The preceding says little about the tying status of Dutch aid.
Aid that is untied officially, can nevertheless be tied in practice.
Among the DAC-members The Netherlands occupies a special position
with regard to this point. Most Dutch aid is partially untied,
which means that it can be spent on goods and services from The
Netherlands or any of a group of developing countries -- the Eligible
Source Countries, which are more or less the same as the list
of aid-receiving countries from the DAC. In the past some protests
arose from the Dutch business community with regard to the purchase
of goods (e.g. fertilizer) in North Africa and Middle Eastern
countries. This protest was supported by the Ministry of Economic
Affairs, but secretly because the ministry did not want to offend
these Middle Eastern countries and thus harm the interests of
Dutch agribusiness (Hoebink, 1988).
<P>
The degree of trade promotion in the foreign-aid programme can
not be measured by examining special programmes of development-related
export credits or low-conditionality loans alone, because these
programmes constitute only a minor part of the total foreign-aid
programme. The best indicator of trade promotion is the so-called
'flow-back%age' or that part of the bilateral aid budget that
is spent in The Netherlands on Dutch goods and services. This %age
is very difficult to discern, however. It is not presented in
the official figures for the DAC. Also, in a highly internationalized
economy such as the Dutch one, it is very difficult to say what
is Dutch. The value-added to the Fokker plane -- one of the controversial
deliveries under Dutch aid throughout the sixties, seventies and
eighties -- is less than 50%, for example.
<P>
 In the initial years of the foreign-aid programme the 'flow-back%age'
was quite high. It was some 90% at the beginning of the seventies.
It gradually decreased to about 75% at the end of the seventies,
55% in the mied-eighties and 40 to 45% at present (Hoebink, 1988;
DAC-Memorandum, 1994).
<P>
 The reorganization of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the
end of the seventies represents a very important turning point
in this context. The aid to a particular country was put in the
hands of single country desk and therefore easier to oversee.
'Old wood' projects running for years with little result, were
also then removed. The space for Dutch business in the identification
of (its own) projects was drastically reduced. Another factor
contributing to the diminished flow-back %age was the economic
crisis starting at the beginning of the eighties in developing
countries. This meant that donor countries could only finance
new projects when local costs were also paid for. While the%age
of Dutch aid spent in The Netherlands decreased, the %age of aid
spent in the aid-receiving countries increased to 8% and 35% in
other developing countries.
<P>
<B><a name=1.5></a>1.5 Aid distribution</B>
<P>
The volume of Dutch aid has been high since the seventies. The
total budget was set in 1973 at 1,5% of the National Income. This
meant that between 0,95% and 1,0% of GNP was spent on ODA, placing
The Netherlands behind Norway, Denmark and Sweden in generosity.
<P>
 From 1982 onwards, the budget has been under continuous pressure.
First, a system of cash ceilings was imposed which meant that
old commitments and allocations could only partly be met. Thereafter,
increasinly more non-ODA items were paid out of the budget. The
foreign-aid budget has been relatively free of budget-cuts and
thus a source of jealousy for other ministers and politicians.
<P>
 In recent years, Minister Pronk has had to cope with continual
attacks on his budget. This is in spite the fact that the government
programme of the CDA/PvdA-cabinet explicitly stated that the budget
for Development Cooperation should not be more 'contaminated',
thus not resolving budget problems of other ministries out of
the foreign-aid budget. The CDA pleaded continuously, as first
suggested by the Minister of Foreign Affairs -- Van den Broek
-- in September 1989, for an increase of aid to Eastern Europe
at the expense of developing countries. The CDA's foreign affairs
commission and party chairman, Brinkman, sided with these pleas
despite resistance from the CDA youth organisation and church
circles. Pronk succeeded in resisting this attack in the spring
of 1992, the extra aid to Eastern Europe was not removed from
his budget. He did, however, have to start paying the salaries
of teachers teaching the Dutch language to foreign immigrants,
as well as the efforts of the Dutch military-contingent in Cambodia.
This contradiction of the government programme has been to the
tune of several hundred million guilders. In the previous year,
the budget was already reduced to 1.4% of the Net National Income
with the cancellation of loans to developing countries. The budget
decreased from 0,92% in 1990 to 0,81% of GNP in 1995.
<P>
 The distribution of aid among aid-receiving countries has been
a continuous source of fierce debates in The Netherlands. While
the distribution across the different sectors was more or less
accepted without discussion, the parliament and Minister for Development
Cooperation continuously quarrelled about country choice, criteria
for this choice, etc. Udink was the first minister to be confronted
with this problem, which had been dragging on for some time. Among
the first criteria used for the selection of countries were the
trade relationship to The Netherlands and the request for specific
technical expertise from The Netherlands. The final list of criteria
consisted of: the existence of a consortium or consultative group,
the current level of development, and the economic relations of
The Netherlands with the countries in question. In practice, however,
the existence of aid-relationships and trade relations with The
Netherlands played the most important role.
<P>
 In his 1975 budget Pronk outlined three criteria for the selection
of the so-called concentration countries: the degree of poverty
in the country in question; the actual need for foreign aid; and
&quot;the degree to which the country in question is adopting
policies that are especially beneficial to the poor (or whether
there is a socio-political structure that offers perspectives
for this, recognizing that policy is ultimately more important
than such structure).&quot; In practice, there was little change
in the countries selected to receive aid. The third criterion
was sacrificed for political reality. It was unthinkable, for
example, that such countries as Indonesia or Pakistan be struck
off the list. Only in the case of Cuba and Jamaica Pronk could
apply the third criterion. The greater policy flexibility Pronk
actually introduced, corresponded to the wishes of the employers'
organisations who had not felt much for the limited selection
of countries in the past and wanted to be able to take advantage
of the export opportunities where they occurred.
<P>
 Minister De Koning was quick to change the policy of concentration
on specific developing countries. In the 1979 budget, it was stated
that &quot;the current number of 17 concentration-countries is
too large&quot; and the advantages of concentration (knowledge-building,
more rapid decision-making, more effective provision of aid) were
thus annulled. The new criteria for inclusion, which also became
threshold-criteria for exclusion, were formulated as follows:
the criterion of poverty -- no higher income per capita than 550
dollars; the degree to which policy aimed at distribution was
implemented; the degree to which human rights were being respected
(Budget Paper, 1979). In doing this Pronk's first criterion was
given a sharp expression as the country's level of development
in GNP per capita; his second criterion (the need for aid) was
struck from the list; the (famous) third criterion had been slightly
toned down; and a new criterion (human rights) which Pronk had
seen as part and parcel of his third criterion, was added. The
result of implementation of the first threshold criterion was
the removal of Colombia, Jamaica, Peru and Tunisia from the list
of concentration countries as of 1 January 1979. Cuba had already
been removed from the list immediately because of the presence
of Cuban troops in Angola and in accordance with the election
promises by the VVD. After some discussion, Colombia was again
included in the list. The striking thing about the selection was
that the first criterion was strictly applied, while the second
and third criteria were certainly not applied as threshold criteria.
There was simply no mention of these criteria in the budget description
of the situations in the countries in question.
<P>
 Minister Schoo again reduced the number of concentration countries,
which would now be called programme-countries. The criteria for
selection were now: a per capita GNP not exceeding 795 dollars;
the implementation of a social and economic policy that is clearly
aimed at progress; and the possibiity of sustainable development
relations with the country in question. The last criterion clearly
reflected the possibilities for trading links. Both the distribution
criterion and the human rights criterion were dropped. Three countries
were struck off the list (Colombia, Zambia, and Burkina Faso),
but these would still receive aid via regional programmes. The
reverification-report identified three regions for aid namely
Southern Africa, the Sahel, and Central America (to which the
Andean region was later added). Aid should henceforth be provided
only to programme-countries and programme-regions. In all these
activities, moreover, the possibility of contributing with Dutch
expertise, services and goods would also be taken into consideration.
<P>
 Pronk again changed the situation in 1990 and 1993. The number
of programme countries was reduced to four (India, Bangladesh,
Pakistan, and Indonesia). Indonesia ended its aid relation with
The Netherlands in 1992. New sector countries were introduced
to receive money from special programmes, including development-related
export funds (China, Philippines, Nepal, and Sri Lanka). Seven
regions were also indicated for cooperation (Mekong, Sahel, Nile/Red
Sea, East-Africa, Southern Africa, Central America, Andean Region).
Emergency aid to ex-Yugoslavia and Somalia brought new countries
on the list again. And last but not least fourteen East-European
and Central Asian countries were added to the lst in 1993 in part
because they were member of the Dutch voting group in IMF and
World Bank (White Papers, 1990 and 1993). Although fifteen countries
were omitted from the list, the total number of countries receiving
Dutch aid had become 60 (58 in 1989); Dutch aid was more thinly
spread than ever (see Table 2).
<P>
 The regional distribution figures from 1992 show most bilateral
aid to go to Africa (41% in 1992) and Asia (36,4%), with Latin
America receiving 18,4%. With some minor modifications, this is
the general picture for the past few years. 
<P>
 In terms of sector distribution, emphasis has always been on
agriculture, in part because of large fertilizer shipments (see
Table 3). Water supply has been a second important sector. In
the eighties, Integrated Rural Development Projects became important
programmes. As far as the social sectors are concerned, education
dropped sharply in the eighties, largely because of decreased
funding for vocational training schools, and financing confined
to university co-operation.Investments in health initially went
down following a critical evaluation with regard to the delivery
of hospital equipment. Health support increased gain, when programme
aid included essential drugs. Due to several political crises,
in former Yugoslavia and Ruanda among other places, the amount
of emergency aid has rapidly increased in the last years.
<P>
<B><a name=2></a>2. ORGANIZATION AND STAFFING</B>
<P>
<B><a name=2.1></a>2.1 Ministry and embassies</B>
<P>
The Netherlands has a Minister <I>for</I> Development Cooperation
that is to say, a minister without portfolio. This means that
the Minister for Development Cooperation has no budget of his
own and no ministry. The development cooperation budget is a special
category in the budget from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The
Directorate General for International Cooperation or the aid agency,
is one of the three directorates within the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs (the others are the Directorate General for Political
Affairs and the Directorate General for European Cooperation).
The Minister for Development Cooperation has a final say in nearly
all (about 85%) of the expenditures out of his part of the budget
for foreign affairs. The remainder of the budget for instance,
expenditures by multilateral banks or about 8% fall under Finance
or other ministries (Erath/Kruyt, 1988). The general level of
the Foreign Affairs budget is determined by the government, which
can also delegate certain expenditures to development cooperation
(for example, expenditures for the receipt of political refugees
or Dutch language training for asylum seekers. The Minister for
Development Cooperation has little to say abou the recruitment
and transfer of personnel. Only technical advisors and sector
specialists detached to the embassies can be recruited by the
Minister for Development Cooperation.
<P>
 The management system is highly centralized, which leaves little
room to manoeuvre and little delegation of responsibility to the
embassies. <I>Identification</I> and <I>supervision</I> are officially
the tasks of the embassies, while project <I>preparation</I>,
<I>approval</I> and <I>evaluation</I> are the domain of the ministry
and its country desks. In practice, however, the country desks
are heavily involved in the first tasks as well. The Subdirectorate
for Technical Advice has the official task of giving specific
sector recommendations and suggestions. In the eighties, however,
the country desks made little use of this information, because
the subdirectorate was understaffed and lacked the necessary country-specific
knowledge (IOV, 1994).
<P>
 The Directorate General for International Cooperation has a matrix-structure
which means that aid to a specific country is provided in the
form of a country allocation and also out of budgets for special
programmes. There have beem special programmes for Balance-of-Payment-support,
rural development, industrial development, urban-poverty alleviation,
training and education, the environment, and women and development.
In 1990 and in 1994, several of these programmes were omitted,
which left the programme for Balance-of-Payment-support, research,
urban-poverty alleviation, and women and development behind.
<P>
<B><a name=2.2></a>2.2 Staff levels and recruitment</B>
<P>
The rapid expansion of aid under Pronk created organisational
problems. The increases in the aid budget were not matched by
increases in the administrative capacity needed to inspect and
guide the new outlays. While the aid budget more than quadrupled
between 1970 and 1978, the number of staff only increased from
238 to 303. It was calculated that, per person, Dutch civil servants
were responsible for a larger and broader amount of aid than their
colleagues in other donor countries (Verloren van Themaat, 1978).
The Inspection Unit described this in its latest report as a budget
rising from DGld. 1 billion in 1970 to DGld. 6 billion in 1990
and the staff for the ministry and embassies rising from 360 to
625 (IOV 1994).
<P>
 63% of the expenditures of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on
personell and administration are paid for by the budget for development
cooperation which suggests that 63% of the staff and supporting
services are devoted to development cooperation (as can be seen
in table 4). The Netherlands has ten large embassies; three of
them are related to aid (Jakarta, New Delhi, Paramaribo). There
are 34 Dutch middle-sized diplomatic posts and only three have
important development-tasks (Bogota, Dar es Salaam, Dacca).
<P>
 In the seventies, the situation was particularly acute in the
Subdirectorate of Financial Aid, where 19 civil servants were
responsible for the distribution and inspection of the entire
bilateral financial aid sum. This had to lead to a greater pressure
for expenditure, less control over spending, and an ever larger
'reservoir' of alolocated but unspent aid money. It eased the
way for large projects where a lot of aid monies could be spent,
and for projects brought in by the Dutch business community.
<P>
 As already mentioned the Minister for Development Cooperation
has little influence on the recruitment of new personnel. This
is because the political department of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs is charged with the selection of staff. This is done in
a traditional manner by selecting generalists who can be assigned
tasks in all fields of foreign policy and recruiting mainly law
and history students trained in Leyden and Utrecht. In the last
5 years, less then 10% of recruited personnel had a development
background while more than 60% of personnel has development-cooperation
tasks. The minister's ability to select his staff is limited to
sector specialists for the ministry and the embassies. In recent
years, therefore, the number of development specialists in the
embassies increased sharply.
<P>
  In the eighties, the personnel at the ministry and the diplomatic
posts were replaced and transfered every three years. Replacements
were not necessarily from a development-cooperation job to another
development-cooperation task or job, but could be to any field
of foreign affairs. It was actually recommended that one should
not stay for one's career in a particular field, say development
cooperation, for a long time. To the detriment of building institutional
continuity and memory, this policy of integration was supported
by the union of diplomats. In the nineties, this personnel policy
has changed. The replacement periods have been extended to four
years, and it is more usual now to make a career in one policy
field.
<P>
 A final problem is one of management at the highest level. The
top officials (Director General for International Cooperation
and one Supplementary Director) are recruited from the high ranking
diplomats and thus bring little experience with the running of
large and complex organizations to the job. The aid agency is
such an organization, and steering problems have been found to
lead to undue interference with regard to some issues and negligence
with regard to other issues.
<P>
<B><a name=2.3></a>2.3 Subcontracting and consultancy</B>
<P>
Up until the mid eighties, large parts of the Dutch-aid programme
were executed by the ministry itself. The experts wre sent out
and supervised by the ministry and the embassies themselves. In
1984 minister Schoo decided that all activities should, in principle,
be subcontracted to the private sector. Subcontracting to governmental
organizations should be limited to those fields where the private
sector did not operate. The motivation for this policy was the
understaffing of the DGIS.
<P>
 In 1988, the IOV evaluated this policy of subcontracting. It
concluded that subcontracting had gone up from 45% of the men
months paid by the Ministry to 61%; own execution had gone down
from 55 to 39%. In contrast, the participation of the larger commercial
consultancy bureaus had dropped from about 50 to 40% (IOV, 1988).
This trend is confirmed by another survey showing especially the
medium and small (even one-person) bureaus to have profited from
the policy of subcontracting policy (Hoebink/Schulpen, 1990).
The IOV-survey also showed the levels of subcontracting to differ
largely across the country desks with almost full subcontracting
in India and Indonesia and very little subcontracting in Tanzania
and Sri Lanka. Given the practice of subcontracting, the workload
of the DGIS, however had not diminished, was the conclusion of
the IOV.
<P>
 One could say that the subcontracting of development activities
in the bilateral programme gave the Dutch consultancy sector a
springboard to internationalization of its activities. It is the
only sector of the Dutch economy that has, in this way, profited
by the large volume of Dutch aid. Dutch consultancy firms have
also -- as a result -- been able to reap an ever larger number
of contracts from the World Bank, regional development banks,
and UN-organizations. Dutch consultancy firms have moved into
the Top 200 of International Design Firms with about 10% of the
total turn-over. NEDECO and Nethconsult were recently represented
in the top 10, while Fugro-McClelland, DHV, Euroconsult, NACO,
Haskoning and Delft Hydraulics were among the top 100 (Hoebink/Schulpen,
1990).
<P>
<B><a name=3></a>3. COUNTRY PROGRAMME PLANNING</B>
<P>
<B><a name=3.1></a>3.1 Country Programmes</B>
<P>
It was only at the end of the seventies that The Netherlands introduced
country programmes and even later that it introduced a more detailed
programming of its aid to these concentration- or programme-countries.
In 1977 the first multi-year programmes were written, but with
rather little body. In the beginning of the eighties, only one-year
programmes were written. The first real four-year programmes were
developed in 1986, sent to parliament and so open to the interested
public. Country programmes for 1986-1989, 1989-1992 and 1992-1995
have since been published. The latest series consists of 12 volumes,
ranging from 25 to 135 pages, five for programme countries (India,
Indonesia, Pakistan, Bangladesh, The Philippines) and seven for
regional programmes (Central America, Andes, East-Africa, Sahel,
Southern Africa, Nile and Red Sea, Mekong). 
<P>
 A normal programme will describe the political and socio-economic
policy of the aid-receiving country quite extensively. A picture
of the Dutch-aid programme the target sectors and regions, the
special features (rural development, environment, women and development,
urban poverty alleviation, education and research) and other sectors
that are of relevance for the programme, arte then presented.
Country programmes are in the initial phases discussed with academics
and other interested resource persons and NGOs. The paragraph
on the Dutch-aid programme seems to cover mainly the existing
programme and not to reflect an evaluation of the country-programme.
<P>
 Detailed studies of the programmes in Tanzania and Sri Lanka
(Hoebink 1988) have shown it to be very difficult for the country
desks to keep up with the plans presented in the programmes. The
concentration on sectors and on certain types of aid appeared
to be problematic. In Sri Lanka for instance a concentration of
aid on a few sectors, in order to be efficient and deal with problems
of understaffing, gave rise to quite some debate with the ministries
of Economic Affairs and Agriculture and with Dutch private companies.
There was also a constant struggle to diminish the amount of programme
aid. 80% of Dutch aid from 1975 to 1980 consisted of programme
aid. In 1983, The Netherlands paid for nearly 11% of all programme
aid received by Sri Lanka. After the Tamil-pogrom of July 1983,
the minister was under heavy pressure from parliament to diminish
programme aid to Sri Lanka substantially. Only four years later,
the promised level of about one third of disbursed aid was reached.
<P>
<B><a name=3.2></a>3.2 Negotiations and coordination</B>
<P>
The Netherlands has yearly consultations with all of the aid receiving
countries. Since 1989 these have mostly occurred in November or
December. The consultations were moved to the end of the year,
as many problems arose with spending the allocated aid-volume
(cash-ceiling) in a budget-year, when the consultations were held
in the spring. In the South Asian countries a mid-term review
is often also held. The consultations consist of a discussion
on the general policies of the aid-receiving country, a discussion
on the ongoing projects and on sector policies and a discussion
on new commitments. In the light of IMF and World Bank policies,
in the eighties general macro-economic policies increasingly became
an issue in the aid-negotiations, with the African countries in
particular. Similarly, human rights became an issue in the second
half of the eighties and nineties, in particular in some so-called
grey countries (Pakistan, Indonesia, Sri Lanka).
<P>
 In general, one could say that the yearly negotiations with regard
to aid commitments were much more tough in the Asian countries
than in the African countries. Countries such as India and Sri
Lanka, for instance, consistently try to get as much 'free to
spend aid' (balance-of-payment support, programme aid) as possible
(IOV 1994; Hoebink 1988). The government of India several times
managed to reallocate project-funds to import-support, for example
using spending-pressures in The Netherlands.
<P>
 With respect to the coordination of the relevant programmaes,
The Netherlands usually follows the policy advice of IMF and World
Bank quite uncritically. If The Netherlands deviates from this
policy, it is usually with regard to the social impact of adjustment
programmes. The Netherlands does not go as far as the Scandinavian
countries taking more distance and aligning themselves more with
the UN-agencies. There is very little coordination with other
EU donors. With regard to certain hot issues (for instance, acute
human rights violations) negotiations may be undertaken to come
to a European point of view particularly in aid consortia or aid
groups. Coordination with those donors also active in a particular
sector, are virtually absent.
<P>
<B><a name=4></a>4. PROJECT MANAGEMENT-CYCLE</B>
<P>
<B><a name=4.1></a>4.1 Structures for preparation and approval</B>
<P>
Aid management follows the normal project cycle used by nearly
all donors. For about the last ten years, the different responsibilities
in the different phases of the cycle are clearly delineated on
paper and laid down in an instruction handbook of some 400 pages
('Procedurebundel'). From 1989 onwards a project to more clearly
delineate the responsiblities between the different levels and
to regulate administrative procedures was initiated. In 1992 and
1993, some major changes were made in the instructions. In 1992,
the so-called D-Test (Development-test) and a new administrative
computer system were introduced. In 1993, it was attempted to
simplify the procedures by making a a list of points to attend
to and imposing more strict financial procedures. Th emphasis
was largely on auditing.
<P>
 The embassies are officially responsible for <I>identification</I>.
The idea for a new project is submitted to a small 'development
and management test' at first, to see if it fits within the general
policy goals and country programme planning. This is done by one
of the staff members under the supervision of the head of the
development cooperation department of the embassy. If the proposal
passes the test an identification memorandum is drawn up under
final responsibility of the head of the embassy. In the Ministry
the regional director than decides together with the country desk
if the proposed project should be considered further.
<P>
 The embassy is also largely responsible for the second phase
of <I>formulation/preparation</I>. The head of the development
cooperation department of the embassy will invite the local authorities
to write a project proposal and - if necessary - offers support
from The Netherlands. The embassy comments and advices on format
and outline of the proposal. When the project proposal is sent
to The Netherlands the <I>appraisal</I> phase of the project cycle
starts. This phase is the responsibility of the DGIS alone.
<P>
 In practice, several other agents are involved in identification.
The Dutch business community is the first agent. It gets involved
by winning tender procedures or by bringing local authorities
into contact with their products. This was particularly the case
in the seventies, when the local authorities had problems to spending
tied Dutch aid. A second agent are local authorities presenting
clear cut projects sometimes stemming out of Five Year Plans or
other planning instruments. This is more the case in Asia than
in Africa and is particularly true for Indonesia, which presents
its donors with so-called Blue Book containing projects that could
be financed. The sector-plans of international donors and especially
the World Bank constitute another source of identification, when
these organizations are looking for co-sponsors for specific parts
of a programme. Project-leaders or consultants willing to stay
longer or looking for new contracts constitute a final important
group involved in identification. In this case the Identification
Memorandum and the D-test may be performed by the group itself.
<P>
 At the start of the <I>appraisal</I> phase, the country desk
will draw up an appraisal memorandum. This memorandum constitutrd
the basis for a decision on the project, as well the basis for
its final structure and evaluation. The memorandum must provide
clear answers to questions regarding long term goals, project
goals and targets, input, organization and results. Feasibility,
sustainability, sensitivity, institutional backing and risk control
are keywords for approval. A D-Test concludes the memorandum and
shows the contribution of the proposed project to poverty alleviation,
gender and ecological issues. The appraisal memorandum is written
by a member of the staff from the country desk and approved by
the regional director. If the project is politically sensitive,
a part of new policies or in volves more than DGld. 5 million,
it must be presented to a committee including of the regional
and other directors, the directors general and the minister.
<P>
 In a newly introduced phase called the <I>modalities</I> phase,
the tasks and responsibilities of the aid-receiver, the executing
agent, the country desk and the embassy should be clearly delineated.
Judicial and policy responsibilities, supervisory, management
and executive tasks should be laid down in contracts and letters.
Five modalities of implementation are defined (from implementation
by the aid-receiver to implmentation by the donor). Research on
the financial control structures in seven aid-receiving countries
learned that only in two of them (South Africa and India) the
auditing was of a reliable quality. The fifth and sixth phases
of the project cycle are <I>implementation and supervision</I>
and <I>evaluation</I>. Yet a seventh phase was introduced of <I>finalization/transfer</I>.
This phase was formulated in response to the fact that the projects
were often not officially ended and the project goods transferred
to the local authorities.
<P>
 It was a long time before special features were built into the
identification and approval phases of the project cycle. In the
second half of the seventies, the ministry had research done on
gender issues in three aid-receiving countries. Due also to a
lack of women-power in the WID-bureau, it was not until the mid-eighties
that gender-assessment became a serious issue in the identification
and approval of projects (Brouwer, 1983; I.Baud, 1989). The situation
was even worse with regard to ecological considerations. Serious
attention in the form of policy, staff formation and project choice
was not paid to ecological issues until 1990 (Hoebink, 1991).
<P>
<B><a name=4.2></a>4.2 Evaluation and feedback</B>
<P>
Since the mid-seventies, the DGIS has an evaluation unit called
the Inspection Development Cooperation in the Field (IOV). It
consists of 11 persons and is a semi-autonomous body within the
directorate, which means that it makes its own decisions in concordance
with the minister with regard to what to evaluate. In the execution
of the research though, a panel-committee in which stakeholders
as the country-desks are represented, has a steering function.
In 1994, he unit had a budget of DGld. 3.5 million, about 0.06%
of ODA. The unit produces three to four large reports a year,
often based on two or more years of study. The reports are written
by one of the 11 inspectors, typically together with an external
expert. The field research for the evaluations, which consists
of short term missions, is also performed by external consultants
most of the time. The topics covered by the evaluation unit in
the last fifteen years are sectoral (drinking water, livestock
projects), programmes or instruments (programme aid, export subsidies,
evaluation and monitoring) and countries (Tanzania, Mali, India).
<P>
 In the beginning, the project evaluations were quite critical
and also the identification, approval and monitoring by the DGIS
itself were quite critically reviewed. The reports were confidential
in those years, although the summaries were sent to parliament
after some time. In the mid-eighties it was decided not to publish
the project-evaluations anymore, but only the final report on
sector, programme or country aid. The field research for these
evaluations is typically rather short and often quite superficial.
Even after Chambers presented us all the biases by which rural
appraisal is deformed, one could read a sentence as follows what
we could call a 'landrover-bias':
<P>
 'It is difficult to ascertain precisely, on the basis of quantitive
data, the impact of the estates on the neighbouring areas. The
general visual impression is that the nearer people live to the
estates, the more prosperous (or rather: the less poor) they seem
to be' (Van de Laar, 1992).
<P>
It means that most of the research is largely built on file-studies
and not on real impact-assessment.
<P>
 Feed-back is generated by a wide circulation of the evaluation
reports, internal discussions of them, as well as discussions
in parliament. Some sector reports, on livestock for example,
led to the formulation of a totally new sector policy and new
sector policy papers.
<P>
 Apart from the evaluation done by IOV, the country desks also
commission evaluations, better be called project reviews or mid-term
or final-term reviews. Several hundred of the more than 4.000
activities sponsored by the DGIS are evaluated in this way each
year.
<P>
<B><a name=5></a>5. PARLIAMENT AND PRESSURE GROUPS: ACCOUNTABILITY</B>
<P>
<B><a name=5.1></a>5.1. Parliament and political parties</B>
<P>
Up until the last elections, parliament had a special committee
for development cooperation. In 1994, this was abolished and development
cooperation became an issue for the Standing Second Chamber Commission
on Foreign Affairs. One can say that apart from a very few specialists
- the members of parliament know little about development cooperation.
Even the foreign affairs specialists for the various political
parties are often unaware of the specific problems, goals and
targets of Dutch cooperation policy. The specialists in development
cooperation are genraly retegated to the back bench and rank under
the foreign affairs specialists.
<P>
 Although development cooperation has always had its place in
Dutch political debates, this cannot be said of official party
documents. The elections programmes generally stick to stating
official goals and motives for development cooperation and repeating
that The Netherlands should at least pay the same amount or more
than in the last four years. The Labour Party has the most active
internal discussion with one commission on development cooperation
and several regional commissions. Apart from this the Labour Party
also has a special foundation (the Evert Vermeer Foundation) to
deal with education and lobbying on development issues. The Christian
Democratic Party also has a special commission for development
cooperation. Its scientific bureau and also that of the conservative
liberals (VVD) published a few reports dealing with development
cooperation issues in the last fifteen years. The interest in
development cooperation in political parties does not appear to
be overwhelmingly and does not reflect debates in civil society.
<P>
 The parliamentary discussions that have occurred, have not been
particularly deep and are mostly related to the same range of
issues or a special issue appearing in the news at that time.
The issues adressed the most in the last 25 years have been: the
volume of aid, the concentration of aid on specific countries
and organizations, development education in The Netherlands, human
rights violations and - increasingly in the past few years - the
quality of aid. With regard to the volume of aid, one could say
that large aid-spending went uncontested until the end of the
eighties. In keeping line with austerity cuts experienced by the
other ministries, however, development cooperation came also under
fire. It were not development cooperation specialists, but foreign
affairs specialists of the Christian Democratic and Labour parties
who requested greater spending of aid from the development budget
in Eastern Europe. They were not successful, but, as stated before,
the volume of non-ODA nevertheless increased dramatically in the
last ten years. A brief analysis of written questions posed to
Minister of Development Cooperation leads to the idea that 'the
initiative of the morning paper' rules parliamentary intervention
on development issues. It should be possible to trace the favourite
newspapers of members of parliament on basis of the questions
they rose. That is, a broad range of issues also appear before
parliament almost by coincidence.
<P>
<B><a name=5.2></a>5.2. Pressure and interest groups</B>
<P>
As might be clear from the preceding, the most powerful interest
group involved in foreign-aid policy was the Dutch business-community.
It is the Commission for Developing Countries of the Employers'
Organizations that set the tune for Dutch export interests from
the beginning of the sixties. It was supported here by the Ministries
of Agriculture and Economic Affairs which were defending export
interests in interdepartmental committees or in negotiations with
developing countries. One should keep in mind that this Employers'
committee is not representative for Dutch industry in general,
but that only some large firms with substantial aid-contracts
are represented in it. Continuing points of interests of these
business-groups are: nor or little concentration of aid on specific
developing countries, more business involvement in the identification
of projects, the constitution of special programme with regard
to investments, the provision of aid in the form of goods and
services from industries in economic problems.
<P>
 A second pressure group are the old missionary and traditional
christian organizations and some private aid organizations who
are involved in co-financing programmes of the Dutch government.
In general, they are defending the volume of aid and the aid to
specific countries. Their relations are particularly close with
the Christian-Democratic and Labour Party.
<P>
 Third World solidarity groups are a final pressure group, but
their influence is decreasing fast since the mid-eighties. Some
of these - the India Working Group, for example - did focus their
action primarily on Dutch foreign aid by publishing critical analyses
of the aid programme. They were, actually, able to obtain policy
change, when their research was supported by empirical evidence.
Most solidarity groups, however, had little influence on Dutch
foreign aid. Especially the lack of impact of environmental groups
is striking.
<P>
<B><a name=5.3></a>5.3. Transparency and Dutch foreign aid</B>
<P>
For those willing to know and not afraid to stumble around in
the aid-jargon or to get lost in the acronyms of a wood of organizations,
Dutch aid can be as transparent as a glass of water: many documents
are open to the public; especially minister Pronk, but also other
aid-officials are willing to have a public debate and eager to
go into discussion; for researchers there is the Law on Public
Information, giving them a personal (research-)interest in information
and thus an access even to the most recent files and documents.
<P>
 Still, there are very little critical studies on Dutch foreign
aid. Most publications are comments on general policy outlines,
based on little research, and not evaluating specific projects
or programmes. This is partly due to little interest for the subject
in the Dutch academic community. This can be demonstrated by the
fact that up until now no critical research on aid-effectiveness
was sponsored by the organization for scientific research in the
Tropics (WOTRO). But also there is very little sponsoring out
of the aid-budget for long-time aid-related research; contract-research
being mostly short term.
<P>
<B><a name=6></a>6. RELATIONS WITH THE EC AID PROGRAMME</B>
<P>
<B><a name=6.1></a>6.1. Visions on the EU aid programme</B>
<P>
The Netherlands always were a staunch supporter of the integration
of development cooperation in the European Treaties. This positive
attitude came from a traditional multilateralist inclination in
Dutch policy, as well as the combination of trade and aid in the
European programme and the parity relations which condition the
execution of European aid. The Netherlands therefore pleaded continuously
for an increase of EDF and other European development-cooperation
funds. All the same time the Lom&eacute; Treaty and other European
instruments of development cooperation were seen as stemming from
the post-colonial period and therefore arbitrary.
<P>
 In several White Papers this positive and uncritically attitude
was demonstrated. Even the White Paper on <I>The Quality of European
Aid</I> (1984) did give only obligatory paragraphs on aid-evaluation
and -effectiveness. The latest document presenting the official
Dutch view of 1992 had the same content. The critical reviews
of European aid by the European Exchequer seemed to have had little
influence on the Dutch stand until recently.
<P>
 In the last years, Dutch policy towards the European commission
seems to have changed. The Netherlands are prepared to spent the
same amount on European aid, but they are very critical on the
actual execution of the EU aid programmes by the European Commission.
The Commission is seen as arrogant, also towards developing countries,
and dictatorial. It seems to be an accepted view that the commission
is centralizing aid efforts and coordination too much, although
it has not the institutional capacities to do so. It is acknowledged
that there is little material to substantiate claims for a lower
European aid-effectiveness. A critique is, however, that the Commission
is not evaluating critically enough.

<A NAME="int"><H3>2.1  INTRODUCTION</H3></A>
<p>
It is universally acknowledged that education is the force that
will, more than any other, shape the future of a society or a
nation.  Education has long been recognised by Irish people as
a worthwhile end in itself but also as the sine qua non for
effective participation in society and as a referent for change
and development of society.  It is for these reasons that
education has always been a priority sector for Irish ODA and for
Irish missionaries and NGOs.
<p>
The Irish Aid Advisory Committee (IAAC) felt it appropriate,
therefore, to undertake a study on education and development at
this time, and to work towards the development of a clear policy
on Irish Aid educational assistance to developing countries.
<p>
As outlined in Section One of this Report - IAAC commissioned a
study by Ms Cathy Gaynor entitled Irish Aid and Education:
Strategic Challenges, which was followed by a Consultative
Seminar which debated and discussed issues pertinent to the
future development of Irish Aid to education in developing
countries.  In this Section, IAAC presents their considered
opinion and recommendations following discussion of the
consultant's report and the views expressed during the ensuing
consultative process.  This Section prioritizes key issues, makes
specific recommendations and identifies further steps in the
process towards an effective Irish Aid policy on educational
assistance to developing countries, in line with overall
priorities set for Irish Aid in the Strategy Plan of 1993.
<p>
<A NAME="eff"><H3>2.2  EFFECTIVE DELIVERY OF IRISH AID</H3></A>
<p>
Given the expansion in the Irish Aid budget and the high level
of bilateral aid expenditure on education, it is now appropriate
and timely to analyze the human resource implications for Irish
Aid of developing and implementing a policy on education.  
<p>
It would be appropriate that a locus within the Irish Aid office
be established with overall responsibility for policy and
projects across the education sector.  This "locus" could take
of the form of an education advisor(s), with expertise in
education, located in Irish Aid; who would be supported by a
voluntary Steering Committee on aid to education - possibly a
sub-committee of IAAC. 
<p>
This "locus" would have the responsibility for the continuing
development and implementation of overall education policy in
Irish Aid. Such a policy will, of necessity, be flexible in
nature and will continually evolve and adapt to meet changing
situations both here and in host countries. 
<p>
Other areas of work for such a "locus" would be the initiation
of on-going consultation and dialogue, in host countries and in
Ireland, on educational policy development and strategies for
implementation, (including between multi-lateral and bilateral
aid and NGOs); the development of better instruments for
assessing, monitoring and evaluating education projects and
programmes supported by Irish Aid; and the monitoring of all
funding for educational projects and programmes to ensure that
the criteria for aid allocation are consistent with overall
policy and principles of Irish Aid to education.
<p>
The initial strategy in the development of a comprehensive policy
should be the adoption of this current Report as a starting point
for developing principles and priorities for Irish Aid
involvement in education.
<p>

<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 1</H4>
<p>
     - that a permanent structure on education in Irish Aid be
     established with responsibility for:
          a)  continually evolving and developing Irish Aid
          policy on education;
          b) monitoring criteria for all aid allocation to
          education projects and programmes;
          c) establishing effective procedures for the
          continuous monitoring and evaluation of education
          projects and programmes supported by Irish Aid;
          d) developing structures and strategies to facilitate
          networking and collaboration between all those
          involved in education in the developing world.
<p>
<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 2</H4>
<p>
     - that this Report from IAAC, which is based on Ms Cathy
     Gaynor's study and the ensuing consultative process, be
     adopted as the starting point for the development of a
     comprehensive policy on education in Irish Aid. 
<p>

<H3>2.3  EDUCATION IN THE IRISH AID PROGRAMME</H3>
<p>
Throughout the consultative process, there has been agreement on
one central theme, namely the role of education in the
development of communities and nations, and the need to make the
right to education a reality for all of the world's citizens.
<p>
The development of the capabilities of individuals through formal
and non-formal education is essential to the overall process of
capacity building in developing countries and thereby to the
process of sustainable social and economic development. In light
of this, the current substantial level of Irish Aid to education
should be maintained, even in an expanding aid budget. 
Furthermore, a broad spectrum of education indicators should
continue to be a major consideration in the selection of
countries for Irish Aid assistance.
<p>
<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 3</H4>
<p>
     - that the current level of Irish Aid support to education
     projects and programmes be maintained.
<p>

<p>
<A NAME="pri"><H3>2.4  PRIORITIES FOR IRISH AID TO EDUCATION</H3></A>
<p>
All indicators point to the need for ongoing dialogue and debate
on the nature and proportion of Irish Aid by level of education
and, while this should be based on country specific needs, there
must be development of an overall Irish Aid strategy in this
regard.
<p>
This strategy should continue to place major emphasis on primary
& basic education.
<p>
In this context, it should be remembered that provision of basic
education includes support for projects and programmes aimed at
reaching those whom the formal education system has failed, ie.
non-formal education interventions.  There is ongoing debate as
to whether official Irish Aid should directly support non-formal
educational interventions, or whether it should concentrate its
efforts on building up and improving the formal education
institutions of the host country.  Two points must be made in
this context: 
<p>
     i) Many educationalists believe that non-formal education
     has contributed significantly to democratic practice and
     development in the developing world and a wealth of
     information and experience exists among NGOs regarding non-
     formal education theory and practice.  There is, however,
     clearly a need to further clarify the complimentary roles
     of formal and non-formal education and a study similar to
     that undertaken by Ms Cathy Gaynor (which focused largely
     on the formal education sector) should now be undertaken
     with specific reference to the non-formal sector education. 
     This study should analyze the need for non-formal education
     in developing countries, examine current Irish involvement
     in non-formal education, both official and non-
     governmental, and should identify future strategy and
     policy for Irish Aid support for non-formal education. 
<p>
     ii) Irish Aid support for NGOs engaging in non-formal
     educational activities should be strengthened.
<p>
While support for basic education must be kept high on the
political agenda, there is just argument which views education
as a holistic process with all levels inter-linked.  Logically,
in an education system, secondary and tertiary levels of
education are important for effective delivery of primary
education (eg. for the training of teachers) and for building the
capacity needed to plan and manage educational development. 
Furthermore, in the wider development spectrum, capacity building
and sustainable development will never be achieved without the
higher levels of education being supported.  In light of this,
support for secondary education and tertiary education should be
decided on a country-specific basis, taking into account national
and regional needs and demands.
<p>
With regard to higher education, Irish Aid must be seen to
support ways of increasing access by disadvantaged groups,
including women, to higher education.
<p>

 <H4>    RECOMMENDATION 4:</H4>
 
     - that Irish Aid to education should place major emphasis
     on support for primary and basic education.
<p>

<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 5:</H4>
<p>
     - that support for secondary and tertiary education be
     maintained where necessary and appropriate.
<p>
<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 6: </H4>
<p>
     - that a study be undertaken on non-formal education in
     developing countries and that the importance of non-formal
     education continue to be recognised by strengthening
     support for NGOs engaged in non-formal educational
     activities.
<p>
  Also at higher level, Irish Aid should support teacher
education programmes and mechanisms and structures for improved
management of education.  In line with this, a proportion of the
fellowship budget should 
be allocated to fellowships which directly support strengthening
of the education system. Also with regard to fellowships, the
process for selection of fellows should be critically analyzed,
local and regional centres of training and research should be
strengthened and the value and effectiveness of returned fellows
to host countries should be monitored.
<p>

<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 7: </H4>
<p>
     - that a proportion of the fellowship budget be allocated
     to fellowships which directly support the education system
     in developing countries and that the fellowship scheme be
     continually monitored to ensure its effectiveness.
<p>
Other areas of educational intervention which should be
considered by Irish Aid include - educational provision for pre-
school children, remedial and special education and education of
refugees and displaced peoples.
<p>
In summary, however, while the holistic rather than sectoral
approach to education is laudable, the limited nature of Irish
Aid resources must be borne in mind, hence a policy on Irish Aid
and education must identify specific areas for prioritization in
order that the focus can be on the quality and relevance of the
education provided and that develop coherent strategies can be
developed under a broad policy umbrella.  It must also
acknowledge the need for dialogue and co-ordination between the
major donors to education in developing countries.  Irish Aid
should also seek to exert influence on multi-lateral agencies,
especially the EU and UN, in relation to allocation of support
for education - particularly where the policies of multi-lateral
agencies inhibit or compromise the effectiveness of Irish Aid
programmes.  There must also be active Irish Aid participation
in efforts to develop EU policy on education and training in
developing countries and to co-ordinate member state activities
in this field.
       
<p>
<A NAME="key"><H3>2.5  KEY PRINCIPLES IN IRISH AID TO EDUCATION</H3></A>
<p>
All Irish Aid support for education should be based on three
principles:
<p>
- an increase in host countries capacity to plan and manage    
  education;
- improvement in educational access and equity; and 
- improvement in the quality of education.
<p>
Regardless of the level or type of educational intervention,
these three key principles, vital to effective aid allocation,
should be borne in mind at all times.  
<p>
All Irish Aid supported educational projects should be reviewed
and appraised with the aim of promoting greater access for girls
and women to education systems and higher female continuation
rates.  Furthermore, reporting on efforts and achievements in
relation to redressing gender imbalance should be mandatory for
all education and training projects.    
<p>
In terms of capacity-building, Irish Aid should support the
provision of teacher training, educational institutional
development and support for development of a favourable education
policy environment.  In this regard, the shift away from long-
term Irish technical assistance towards the use of short-term
highly-skilled consultants should continue with greater use being
made of host country skills and expertise.  
<p>
Also in the area of capacity building and partnership, host
countries should be supported to identify and analyze the
educational needs of their country in partnership with local
people's organisations (to ensure that the needs of local
communities are expressed in the needs of Government).  
<p>
It should also be ensured that control of programmes is held by
the recipients of aid rather than by the donors and that host
country priorities always take precedence in the identification
of educational interventions.  However, in this regard, Irish Aid
should also strive to ensure acceptance and application of the
principles of gender equity, capacity development and partnership
by national and local authorities. 
<p>
Having regard for this, there is need for a reconsideration of
the implications of the APSO target of 2,000 personnel overseas
by 1997 as aid must never become supply driven.  There is also
need for formulation by APSO of a coherent strategy on its
support to the education sector which is consistent with Irish
Aid policy in this regard.  
<p>
<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 8:</H4>
<p>
     - that all Irish Aid support for education should be based
     on three principles:
<p>
          -    an increase in host countries capacity to plan
               and manage education;
          -    improvement in educational access and equity; and
          -    improvement in the quality of education.
<p>
<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 9:</H4>
<p>
     - that APSO develop a strategy on its support to the
     education sector consistent with Irish Aid policy.
<p>
<A NAME="con"><H3>2.6  CONCLUSION</H3></A>
<p>
Taking all of the above points into consideration and bearing in
mind the recommendations emanating from Ms Cathy Gaynor's Report
and the consultative process, an Irish Aid policy on principles
and priorities for Irish Aid involvement in education should now
be developed.  This policy must build on the existing body of
research as well as field experience, consultation and dialogue. 
It must be agreed by all partners and provide a base of
fundamental principles which will issue forth into concrete
action for education and change in the developing world.

<p>

Billions of people in the world's poorest countries are enslaved by debt.
Debts run up by governments on their behalf.  Debts which started as easy
credit pushed by rich lenders.  Debts which the poor will never be able to
repay.  Debts which enrich lenders, but leave children malnourished, while
families live in desperate poverty.
<p>

Jubilee 2000 believes the time has come to do something about it.
Our aim is to celebrate the new millennium by lifting the burden of
unpayable debt from the poorest countries.  We have produced 
a clear, workable Jubilee Proposal calling for:
<p>

<ul><li>a one-off cancellation
<li>by the year 2000
<li>of the backlog of unpayable debt
<li>owed by the world's poorest countries
<li>agreed through an independent, transparent process

<h1>Debt and the Rwandan Genocide</h1>

<!---PICTURE (P.14) --->

<font size=4>The events which led up to the genocide in Rwanda had been set in motion
long before.  During colonial times, communal lands in Rwanda were
converted into individual plots to grow cash crops - the most important of
which was coffee.  After independence this cash crop economy continued,
with coffee alone bringing in more than 80 per cent of Rwanda's foreign
exchange earnings.</font>

<h3>1970s and early 80s</h3>

The economy grew at about 4.9 per cent per year (1965-89).  School
enrolment increased.  The recorded inflation rate was one of the lowest in
sub-Saharan Africa at less than 4 per cent per year.  In most areas people
had enough food from their own plots and farms, so imports of cereals,
including food aid, were minimal until the late 1980s.

<h3>1989</h3>

Coffee prices plummeted in the space of a few months by more than 50 per
cent.  Famine swept across the country.  Meanwhile, shops in the West were
selling coffee at more than twenty times the price paid to the Rwandan
farmer.
<p>

Government income fell drastically, and the country found itself in deep
debt. It was forced to turn to the IMF.  A plan recommended by the World
Bank in 1988 was finally adopted.  Under this plan, trade was liberalised;
the currency devalued; subsidies to agriculture were lifted; state
enterprises were privatised and civil servants were dismissed.

<h3>1990</h3>

In September the Rwandan Patriotic Front - a rebel army of exiles - entered
Rwanda from Uganda.  In the same month the Government decided to devalue
the Rwandan franc, but waited.
<p>

In early October, while Government troops began fighting with the RPF, the
IMF agreed to deposit millions of dollars of 'aid' into the Central Bank.
Much of this money was probably used to buy arms.  In the same month the
Government devalued the Rwandan franc by 50 per cent.  The armed forces
increased overnight from 5,000 to 40,000 men - mostly recruited from the
newly unemployed.

<h3>1991-94</h3>

The fall of the Rwandan franc triggered inflation and the collapse of real
earnings.  Inflation increased from 10 per cent in 1989 to 19.2 per cent in
1991.  Export earnings dropped by 50 per cent between 1987 and 1991.  The
number of recorded malaria cases increased by 21 per cent because of
shortages of antimalarial drugs.  Imposition of school fees led to a
massive decline in school enrolment.
<p>

Outstanding external debt, which had already doubled since 1985, increased
by 34 per cent between 1989 and 1992.
<p>

The economic crisis reached its peak in 1992 when the Rwandan farmers
uprooted 300,000 coffee trees because they could no longer make enough
money from coffee sales.  In June 1992, a second currency devaluation was
ordered and fuel prices rose.  Coffee production fell by another 25 per
cent in a single year.
<p>

Meanwhile, inappropriate food aid from the West was dumped on the local
markets.  The entire agricultural system was pushed into crisis.  Neither
cash crops nor food crops were economically viable.
<p>

In 1992 the World Bank's International Development Association ordered the
privatisation first of Rwanda's state enterprise Electorogaz, and then of
the state telecommunications company.  The money from the privatisation was
to go towards debt servicing.
<p>

Ethnic tensions were rising.  Electricity workers were dismissed and the
price of electricity rose at once, paralysing services in the cities.  The
economic shock therapy was disastrous.  In 1994 hundreds of thousands of
Rwandans died in a brutal and catastrophic civil war.

<h1>Latest News from the House of Debt</h1>

<h2>Creditors reject poorest nation Mozambique</h2>
Mozambique is recovering from a long and destructive civil war, which ended
only four years ago.
She is defined by the World Bank as the poorest nation in the world.  At the
end of 1995 the stock of external debt totalled $5.3 billion and her Gross
National Product stood at $1.2 billion. She is, in effect, bankrupt: she
cannot pay her debts.  And yet, in November she failed to qualify for real
debt relief at the Paris Club of bilateral (government to government) creditors.
<p>

The IMF are not best pleased with Mozambique.  She has 'slipped' on her IMF
programme and, unfortunately, it is the IMF who effectively determine
whether she should get debt relief. DCN and Jubilee 2000, together with our
partners in Europe, mounted an effective lobby in support of her being
allowed to qualify immediately, but to no avail. Not only did Mozambique
fail to qualify, but she was also denied the full 80% Paris Club relief
promised under the HIPC Initiative for bilateral debt.
<p align=center>

<p>


Between 1997 and 2015 Mozambique's debt service to the IMF and World Bank is
expected to increase from $58.6 million per year to $92.1 million per year.
>From 1997 until 2003 average annual (global) debt service payments will soar
to $190 million. Between 1990 and 1995 they stood at an average of $57 million.
<p>

Since 1990 Mozambique has called a halt to borrowing (except from the IMF
which provides her with the foreign currency essential to buying oil). She
has had 12 years of successive Paris Club re-scheduling. Despite this - or,
in part, because of this, debt owed to OECD creditors has ballooned by
almost a billion dollars in ten years. In 1993 Mozambique's arrears
constituted 81% of debt service due.
<p>

And the IMF and World Bank have still to decide whether she would be
entitled to debt relief by the year 2000.

Dear [name of your MP] or [name of Senator] or [Michael Camdessus, IMF Director]

<p>
I am writing to express my concern about the terrible burden of Third World
debt on many poor countries around the world.  The lives of people in many
countries struggling to pay back their debt are made a misery by their
poverty which grows from year to year.
<p>

It is commendable that the (British Government) (IMF) has made proposals for debt
relief recently, but I believe that there is much more to do.  I
would like to ask that you consider a new proposal for the new millennium.
I am supporting the Jubilee 2000 movement, which proposes cancellation of
the backlog of unpayable debt of the poorest countries by the year 2000,
focusing on sub-Saharan Africa.  This would give a fresh start
to those in deep debt, but as it would be a one-off, associated with the
millennium, it wouldn't set a precedent for repeated cancellation of debts.
<p>
Furthermore I believe that the existing process for dealing with indebted countries is unfair.  It is driven
entirely by creditors who are not neutral in the negotiations for debt relief.  Indeed they play the role of
plaintiff, jury and judge.  I want an end to this injustice.
<p>
[last paragraph for MP]<br>
I would be grateful if you could pass this letter on to the (Chancellor) and
let me know if you would agree to campaign in Parliament for more extensive
measures for Third World debt remission.
<p>
[last paragraph for Senator or IMF Director]<br>
I would be grateful if you would inform me as to what further measures you will take to address the debt
crisis.<p>

Yours sincerely

<h1>How it all began</h1>
<h2>Causes of the Debt Crisis</h2>

Many people know what it feels like to owe money, even if only to a
building society for a mortgage.  But it's a different matter altogether to
be deeply in debt and unable to repay it.  And even worse to be in that
situation if someone else ran up the debt and left you to carry it.
<p>

When individuals become deeply indebted, we draw a line under the debt.  That line is called bankruptcy. It is
a line beyond which we do not allow
people to fall. No such line can be drawn in international law. When poor
countries become deeply indebted they fall into an abyss of ecomonic degradation. Their governments
owe vast sums to Western governments
and international, Western-controlled institutions.  These same institutions then take on responsibility for
determining levels of debt relief.  
<p>
This is unjust. It's time we did something about it.
<p>

<h3>In the beginning...</h3>

How were these huge debts amassed?  And why are governments still making so
little headway in the struggle to pay them off?

<h3>Born in the USA</h3>

In the 1960s the US Government had spent more money than it earned and to
make up for this decided to print more dollars.  So the world's stocks of
dollars fell in value.
<p>

This was bad news for the major oil-producing countries, whose oil was
priced in dollars.  The money they made from exports now bought less.  So
in 1973 they hiked their prices.  They made huge sums of money and
deposited it in Western banks.

<h3>Banking on the future</h3>

Then the trouble really began.  As interest rates plummeted, the banks were
faced with an international financial crisis. They lent out the money fast,
to stop the slide, and turned to the Third World, whose economies were
doing well but who wanted money to maintain development and meet the rising
costs of oil.
<p>

Banks lent lavishly and without much thought about how the money would be
used or whether the recipients had the capacity to repay it.  Third World
governments, for their part, were pleased to take advantage of loans at
very low interest rates - below the rate of inflation.

<h3>Dictators' development</h3>

Some countries, like Mexico and Venezuela, took out loans to repay previous
debts.  But for others, this was the first time they had borrowed from
commercial banks.  Many intended to use the money to improve standards of
living in their countries.

<p>

In the end, little of the money borrowed benefited the poor.  Across the
range, about a fifth of it went on arms, often to shore up oppressive
regimes.  Many governments started large-scale development projects, some
of which proved of little value.  All too often the money found its way
into private bank accounts.  The poor were the losers.

<h3>Heading for disaster</h3>

In the mid 1970s, Third World countries, encouraged by the West to grow
cash crops, suddenly found that they weren't getting the prices they were
used to for the raw materials they sold, like copper, coffee, tea, cotton,
cocoa.  Too many countries - advised by the West - were producing the same
crops, so prices fell.
<p>

Then interest rates began to rise, pushed further by an increase in US
interest rates.  Meanwhile oil prices rose again.  The trap was sprung -
Third World countries were earning less than ever for their exports and
paying more than ever on their loans and on what they needed to import.
They had to borrow more money just to pay off the interest.

<h3>Caught in the trap</h3>

In 1982 Mexico told its creditors it could not repay its debts.  The
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank stepped in with new loans
under strict conditions, to help pay the interest.  The IMF is a
Western-dominated creditor, which in effect acts as a Receiver but unlike a Receiver makes short-term
loans to help
countries pay off other loans.
<p>

This pattern was repeated over and over in the following years as other
countries found themselves in similar situations to Mexico's.  But their
debts continue to rise, and new loans have added to the burden.
<p>

Essentially, the poorest countries have become bankrupt. 






<h3>Enter the troubleshooters...</h3>

When Mexico defaulted on its debt repayments in 1982 the whole
international credit system was threatened.  Mexico owed huge sums of money
to banks in the US and Europe, and they didn't want to lose it.  So they
clubbed together and got the support of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for a scheme to spread out or reschedule the debts.  
<p>

Since then the IMF and the World Bank - the two main international financial institutions
- have been involved in lending money and rescheduling debt in countries
which, like Mexico, cannot pay the interest on their loans.
<p>

But their loans add to the debt burden and come with conditions.
Governments have to agree to impose very strict economic programmes on
their countries in order to reschedule their debts or borrow more money.
These programmes are known as Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs).
SAPs have particularly affected the countries of sub-Saharan Africa, whose
economies are already the poorest in the world.
<p align=center>

<br>
<small>&copy; "Thin Black Lines"</small></p>
<p>


<h3>SAPping the Poor</h3>
SAPs consist of measures designed to help a country repay its debts by
earning more hard currency - increasing exports and decreasing imports.  In
a few countries SAPs appear to have had some good effect; in most they have
worsened the economic situation.  In all countries applying SAPs, <b><a href="silent.html">the poor
have been hit hardest</a></b>.
<p>

In order to obtain more foreign currency, governments implementing SAPs
usually have to:

<ul><li>spend less on health, education and social services - people pay
for them or go without
<li>devalue the national currency, lowering export earnings and
increasing import costs
<li>cut back on food subsidies - so prices of essentials can soar in a
matter of days
<li>cut jobs and wages for workers in government industries and services
<li>encourage privatisation of public industries, including sale to
foreign investors
<li>take over small subsistence farms for large-scale export crop
farming instead of staple foods.  So farmers are left with no land to grow
their own food and few are employed on the large farms.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Jubilee 2000 proposes ...</h3>
a one-off cancellation of the backlog of unpayable debt for the world's
poorest countries - which either cannot be paid, or can be paid only with
enormous human suffering.  This wouldn't be setting a precedent for
cancelling all debts repeatedly.  Rather, it would be a once-only gesture
to mark the millennium, a gesture showing that creditors and debtors alike
have made mistakes and that the slate needs to be wiped clean.  The procedure for agreeing this debt
relief should be undertaken by an independent body, perhaps under the UN.  The procedure will be open,
transparent and fair. This would
change millions of lives, without taking away the responsibility of debtors
to pay their future debts.

<li>For a billion people, development is being thrown into reverse. After
decades of steady economic advance, large areas of the world are sliding
back into poverty.
</ul>

Millions of people around the world are living in poverty because of Third
World debt and its consequences.
<p>

Latin America owes £365 billion in debts to other countries and banks (36
per cent of what it produces - its Gross National Product), while
sub-Saharan Africa owes £140 billion (83 per cent of its total GNP).
These enormous debts mean that repayments to Western Creditors take priority and ordinary people
suffer: in poor health, in restricted access to education, in lack of
employment and in limited ability to trade and provide for themselves.

<h3>Health</h3>

Spending on healthcare has fallen in many of the world's poorest countries
since the 1980s.  This often means that people have to pay for healthcare,
so the poorest cannot afford it and simply go without.  In Zimbabwe
spending per head on healthcare has fallen by a third since 1990 when a
Structural Adjustment Programme was introduced. In Uganda, £2 per person 
is spent on healthcare, compared with £11.50 per person on debt repayments.
<p>

Some improvements in health gained over the 1960s and 70s have been turned
back or stopped in many countries since the 1980s when the debt crisis
broke.  The number of children who die before the age of five, or before
the age of one, has risen in many deeply indebted countries, including Zimbabwe, Zambia,
Nicaragua, Chile and Jamaica, after decades of falling numbers.  Diseases
thought to be eradicated - tuberculosis, yaws, yellow fever - are making a
comeback in some countries as treatment and vaccination coverage declines.

<h3>Education</h3>

As schools are forced to charge fees, fewer people are able to send their
children and education is mainly available only to the better-off.
<p>

In sub-Saharan Africa the damage to education has been particularly
significant: the percentage of 6-11 year olds enrolled in school has fallen
from nearly 60 per cent in 1980 to less than 50 per cent in 1990.  In
Tanzania, school fees have been introduced as part of a Structural
Adjustment Programme, leading to a drop in primary and secondary school
enrolment.

<h3>Employment</h3>

The IMF encourages hard-pressed governments to cut back spending and
downsize government departments.  This often means a rise in unemployment
and a cut in wages.
<p>

Real wages in most African countries have fallen by 50-60 per cent since
the early 1980s.  In Mexico, Costa Rica and Bolivia average wages have
fallen by a third since 1980.  And unemployment has risen in many countries
in Africa and Latin America since the 1980s - in Zambia, Tanzania and
Ghana, over 20 per cent of the working population are unemployed.  High levels of unemployment are
counterproductive as there are fewer taxpayers to contribute to the public purse.  So governments raise
less through taxation.

<h3>Trade</h3>

SAPs mean that countries must increase their export crops - and as many
poorer countries are encouraged to grow the same crops, they cause a glut
on the international market and prices fall.  So the workers on plantations
and farms get lower wages than ever.
<p>

Mexico first grew maize as a staple crop thousands of years ago.  But
today, thanks to IMF economic policies, it has to import 20 per cent of
this staple food from the USA.
<p>

The IMF encouraged Mexico to replace its vital food crops with cash crops -
like strawberries and exotic fruits.  The IMF also made sure that any trade
protection for the country's agricultural goods was lifted.  So Mexico's
export crops now compete with those from the USA, which, as in many
northern countries, are highly subsidised and protected, using all
available techniques to improve their quality.
<p>

Mexico is the loser, and the poor suffer.  Almost 20 per cent of Mexicans
have no cash income; more than 30 per cent make less than the minimum wage
of $3 a day.

<h1>Too Little, too late</h1>
<h2>Political Responses to the Debt Crisis</h2>

Since the late 1970s there has been a growing concern in the West that the
Third World will not be able to pay back much more of its debts.  A number
of people from various countries have come up with plans to try to ensure they do.
<p>

None of these plans have been adequate to deal with the whole debt problem.
So although some improvements have occurred, mostly in South America, the
problem remains.

<h3>The Brady Plan</h3>

By 1989 debts to commercial banks were no longer worth their value on paper
because the banks had written off large chunks of them in theory, assuming
they would never be repaid.  Brady argued that the banks should reduce the
actual value of the remaining debt for larger debtor countries, so that
they had less to pay.
<p>

The banks would do this in one of two ways:
<ul type=square><li>by writing off some of the debt with the help of funds from the IMF
and World Bank
<li>by rescheduling some of the remaining debt by converting it into
bonds - which could be sold on the secondary market.
</ul><p>

In terms of total debt stock this plan has not helped debtor countries.  As
commercial debts have fallen, multilateral debts have risen.  Resources
continue to flow out of these countries to pay interest on Brady Bonds.
Debt service was lowered to levels which were already being paid, so no
actual benefit accrued to the debtor country.

<h3>Trinidad/Naples Terms</h3>

John Major originally proposed that creditor countries cancel half the debt
owed to them by the lowest income countries, while rescheduling the rest.
This could have resulted in debt relief worth £18 billion to the poorest
countries.  
<p>

Later he went further and proposed two-thirds debt remission.
In the end, 67 per cent cancellation was agreed at the G7 Summit (a meeting
of the seven main Western powers) in 1994.  
<p>

However in practice, this level of reduction has only been applied to a small proportion 
of poor countries' debts.  Creditors have been very reluctant to offer debt relief. Countries have to keep
to stringent Structural Adjustment Programmes 
to get debt relief and were not exempt from any repayments to the IMF or World Bank.
<p align=center>
<br>
<small>&copy; "Thin Black Lines"</small></p>
<h3>The Highly Indebted Poor Country (HIPC) Initiative</h3>

In October 1996, there was a major shift by the IMF and the World Bank when they produced a debt 
relief initiative which contemplated for the first time the cancellation of debts owed to them.  Britain's
Chancellor proposed that the Initiative should be financed through the sale of IMF gold.   The Initiative
proposed  80% debt relief by the key creditor countries (Japan, the US, Germany, France and the UK). The
World Bank announced the establishment of a Trust Fund to finance the Initiative.
<p>

The World Bank has committed resources to the Trust Fund.  The IMF has not.  Instead it will offer cheaper
loans to pay off expensive loans.  There has been no agreement to sell IMF gold.  And the Paris Club of key
creditor countries has not yet begun to implement 80% debt relief.
<p>

The plan is therefore very limited in effect.  Only 3 countries are likely to see any benefit before the year
2000 and they will have to maintain strict Structural Adjustment Programmes.  According to Christian Aid,
only 6.4% of the the total debt of 41 poorest countries will be tackled, while at the same time debt
service is due to rise and commodity prices to fall.

<h1>Bringing it all back home</h1>
<h2>The impact of the debt crisis on all of us</h2>



The debt crisis is clearly a disaster for the people who live in Third
World debtor countries.  But what about the rest of us?  The fact is that
many of the results of international debt boomerang back to hurt the rich
world as well as the poor.
<p>

Susan George explains in her book, The Debt Boomerang, how six boomerangs
affect the Western world and the creditor countries as much as the indebted
countries: the environment; drugs; bailing out the banks; lost jobs and
markets; immigration; conflict and war.  The following paragraphs highlight some
of the issues she covers in the book.

<h3>Killing the Earth</h3>

Serious environmental destruction began in many Third World countries in
the 1970s and 1980s.  Easy money was available from industrialised
countries for 'development'.  Much of it was spent on large dam projects,
power plants and charcoal driven industries.  These usually didn't help the
poor, and did damage the environment.
<p>

As debts mounted, what poorer countries needed most was foreign currency to
pay back their debts.  One easy solution was to milk the earth's resources
for the hard cash they brought in, and cut back on environmental
conservation programmes.
<p>

Third World countries have done this by:
<ul type=square><li>heavily overusing soil to grow cash crops, often forcing small
farmers off their land
<li>producing more crops on small areas of land, often using chemical
fertilisers, and so degrading the soil
<li>allowing overfishing of their waters, so that fish stocks are damaged
<li>allowing multinational companies logging rights to their forests,
destroying the lifestyle of those who live there
<li>chopping down forests to make room for beef cattle grazing or crop
farming.
</ul><p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=6>
<TR>
<TD>
<font color="red"><b>FACT:  It is the world's largest debtors who are chopping down their forests
the fastest. Brazil is the world's largest deforester and one of its largest debtors,
owing US$112 billion.  It is cutting a staggering 50,000 sq km of forest
every year.</b></font>
</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>

<h3>Debt and the Dole Queue</h3>

As Third World countries struggle to pay back their debts, they have to
export as many goods as possible and cut back on imports.
This might seem like a good way to earn money.  In fact they don't earn as
much as they should, because many Third World countries are exporting
similar products, flooding the market.  So prices have been plummeting over
the last few years.
<p>

It is not only debtor countries who lose out by the 'earn more, spend less'
principle.  The countries demanding repayment also suffer economically.
Western countries are losing out on earnings from some factory and farm
produced goods because it is so much cheaper to import them from the Third
World.  At the same time they are not able to export equipment and other
manufactured goods to Third World countries which used to be trading
partners, because these countries have no money to buy them.  So jobs are
lost and unemployment rises.
<p>

<TABLE BORDER=1 bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=6>
<TR>
<TD>
<font color="red"><b>FACT: Before the debt crisis broke, Europe sold about a fifth of its exports to
the Third World, particularly Africa.  By 1990, it was only a little more
than a tenth.</b></font>
</TD>
</TR></TABLE>

<h3>Dirty Drugs</h3>

Millions of Americans and Europeans regularly use illegal drugs.
Governments across the Western world have poured money into the struggle
against drugs.  The narcotics market in Europe is expanding rapidly,
contributing to social breakdown and violent crime.
<p>

But for all their strategies to fight against drug trafficking, no
government has come up with a solution which tackles one of the factors
making it possible - international debt.  Almost all the major
drug-producing countries also have high international debts.  To repay
debts they need hard currency from the sale of commodities - like cocoa,
whose value has been falling.  Meanwhile, cocaine prices have been rising.
So countries turn to the drugs trade - to raise foreign currency and to
survive.
<p>
<TABLE BORDER=1 bgcolor="#CCCCCC" cellpadding=6>
<TR>
<TD>
<font color="red"><b>FACT:  Bolivia is one of the poorest countries in Latin America with and the highest 
child mortality rates on the continent. The country has to spend half of all its (legal) export income
on paying its debt. 40 per cent of Bolivia's workforce depend on the drugs trade for a living.</b></font>
</TD></TR></TABLE>

<h3>Banking on debt</h3>

Commercial banks have suffered very little from the accumulation of unpaid
debts.  This is largely because Western taxpayers (mostly without knowing
it), inflation, and currency speculation have cushioned the blow for them.
<p>

In most countries banks have been able to write down their unpaid third world debts 
in the accounts as losses .  This means they pay substantially less tax.  Yet the debt still remains and
The debtor country has to continue repaying it. While the weight of the bank's loss is in part 
made good by the taxpayer,  the burden for the debtor country is enormous.
<p>

Another way that banks can gain tax relief on a loan which is not being
repaid is through selling the debt.  In a bizarre system of exchange, one
bank can sell the debts owed to it at a reduced price to another bank which
feels confident it will eventually be repaid at a higher rate than that
discount price.  This is called the secondary market.
<p>

The banker who sells the loan can then claim tax relief on the 'loss' he
has made by selling the loan at a reduced price.  Yet again, the debtor
country gains nothing.
<p>

<b>British Banks</b><br>
The four main high street banks in the UK - Lloyds, Natwest, Midland and
Barclays - have all been involved in lending to the Third World.  For these
banks, though, the worst of the crisis is over.  All of them have sold off
large proportions of their debt by one means or another.  Lloyds, Midland
and Barclays have all made substantial profits from selling, exchanging and
making provision for Third World debts.

<h3>Unjust War</h3>

Britain uses export credits to subsidise arms sales to the South. In
1993/4, 50 per cent of all export credits provided by the DTI to
exporters were for arms sales. In time, these credits become debts for
poor countries. 96 per cent of the debts owed to Britain by poor countries are owed to the
Export Credit Department of the DTI.
Many Third World countries have become deeply indebted because of high
military spending.  And as wars escalate, they are less able to repay the
money they owe.  One estimate suggests that between 1960 and 1987 Third
World governments borrowed around $400 billion dollars to fund arms imports
from industrial states.
<p>

The Third World arms trade has declined after a peak in the late 1980s.
Most of the dictators who invested so heavily in arms are no longer in
power and today's governments are not buying as many arms as they once did.
But the debts are still left to pay.
<p>

Debt can also lead to and contribute to war.  As countries become poorer
because of their debts, one route that people take is violence and protest.
As this escalates, it can end in war - and does in many countries of the
Third World.  As the debt crisis broke in the early 1980s, violence in many
indebted countries around the Third World erupted into war or escalated
dramatically.

you would like more information about Jubilee 2000's campaign.


<a name="news"></a>
<h3>The Latest News:</h3>

<b>April 6th - Jubilee 2000 Day of Action</b><br>
Sunday April 6th will mark the 1000th Day before the millennium.  Various
events are being planned.  In London we hope to unveil a Jubilee clock on a
famous landmark - marking time to the Millennium and calling for a debt free
start for a billion people.  We are also planning to launch an action on the
Oneworld supersite over the weekend.  Make sure you log on! If you would
like to plan something take action (html) and let us know.
<p>

<b>April 26th - Jubilee 2000 Workshop, LSE</b><br>
The fun continues throughout April with our first annual conference.  The
aim is to equip our members with the latest information on date and to share
campaigning skills and ideas.  This year the workshop will be chaired by
Susan George, who is both a Jubilee 2000 patron and renowned for her books
on debt.  We are also privileged to have Paul Vallely, International
Journalist of the Year for his coverage of the famine in Ethiopia and author
of the Book "Bad Samaritans: First World Ethics and Third World Debt."  We
will also have speakers from the South who will speak from first hand
experience of the impact of debt.  The cost will be £10 waged (£5 unwaged).
We have limited space so strongly recommend you send us your cheque to book
a space now.

<p>

<b>Broadsheet Backing</b><br>
Over the Christmas period, writers in both the UK Guardian and Independent newspapers gave strong
backing to the
Jubilee 2000 campaign.  Ros Coward of the Guardian called Jubilee 2000's proposals "a step towards the
future" which makes "other proposals to celebrate the millennium parochial".  Paul Vallely of the
Independent called on readers to join Jubilee 2000
with its "practical programme of realistic measures.  All they need to work is political will."
<p>


<a name="sofar"></a>
<h3>The Campaign so far</h3>

Jubilee 2000 was started by a number of Christians who believed radical action was needed to address the
devastating impact of debt.  Recently it focused around the year 2000 as a useful focus for a campaign 
calling for a one-off remission of debt along the lines of the Jubilee year described in Leviticus.
<p>

It started in April 1996 with the support of the Church aid agencies: Christian Aid, CAFOD and Tearfund.
Since then it has been endorsed by the Church of England Synod, the URC, the Methodist Council and 
is in the process of being endorsed by all the other major denominations.  It has also established strong
links with refugee and anti-racist groups and is linking up with many other national, trade union women and
community
organisations.
<p>

Jubilee 2000 Campaigns are being launched worldwide. There are  currently campaigns in Ireland, Austria, 
Germany, Ghana and Kenya and we are supported by groups in USA, Canada, France, Tanzania, New
Zealand, Australia and many other countries.  New groups/contacts are made every week.  At the same
time, there has  
been a great deal of lobbying of influential decision makers in various governments, the international
financial institutions and other important bodies.  As a result we have established an important network
of supporters who share our objectives.
<p>

We are actively seeking out supporters. However many of our contacts are a result of individuals
contacting us
about getting their local church, trade union, community group to support Jubilee 2000.  So if you are
involved in 
an organisation which may support us, do <b><a href="form.html">get in touch</a></b>.  Only a truly
mass movement will succeed in the
vital objectiv of a debt-free start for the world's poor.
<p>

Our main action at the moment is collecting signatures for a global Jubilee 2000 Petition (which we hope
will be
the world's largest). We intend to collect millions of signatures and submit them to the 1999 G7 Summit
which will be held in Germany. In the UK, we are raising the awareness of Jubilee 2000 amongst British
Parliamentary Candidates in
the run up to the UK General Election.  However we are also planning more events later this year to give
ourselves a high public profile.
We will have more details later.




<a name="footsteps"></a>
<h3>Following in the footsteps of the slave trade abolitionist</h3>

Throughout the centuries, when people have joined forces to change society 
they have often, against all odds, succeeded.  One of the closest parallels to 
the debt crisis is the Atlantic slavetrade.  It, too, was a system of international 
oppression accepted forcenturies as a normal and necessary part of trade and life. 
 And it, too, resulted in the West benefiting from the resources of the southern
hemisphere while southern countries, and particularly sub-Saharan Africa,
were devastated.
<p>

But in 1833 the slave trade was abolished in all British possessions.  It
was not because of one powerful individual or institution, but because of
the concerted effort of thousands of people who had become convinced by the
uprisings and leadership of slaves and by the passion of individuals like William Wilberforce that the status
quo was wrong and could be
changed.  Powerful people in Parliament, like Wilberforce, took up the
cause, but it needed the agreement and support of thousands of ordinary
people to ensure the destruction of the slave trade.
<p>

In the same way, the oppression of Third World debt could be ended by the
year 2000.  Then the world could begin the new millennium with new hope for
the poor, and a new start for international relations.
<p>

One major hindrance to the abolition of slavery was the powerful plantation
owners in the West Indies whose interests were best served by preserving
the slave trade.  It gave them pervasive power in the nations from which
slaves came; it gave them trading advantages and ensured that they could
produce good crops and receive good prices for them.
<p>

In the same way now it is in the short-term interest of many Western
nations to maintain strong influence over the poorer countries of the
world.  Justice demands that richer countries give up unfair privileges,
held at the expense of the poor. If creditors agree to remission of debts, the
removal of a restraint on growth could allow poor countries to compete on
fairer terms and reduce their dependence on the rich parts of the world.
<p>

There are people in positions of power in both North and South eager to see
a fairer world with debts cancelled and the balance of power between creditors and debtors altered.  But
the support of thousands of
people in the North is needed to pressurise decision-makers in creditor governments into carrying through
such a fundamental change.

<h1>Membership</h1>


Jubilee 2000, part of the Debt Crisis Network, is an educational charity
with a campaigning wing.  We are not a fund-raising movement - we will not
ask you to go out and collect for Jubilee 2000 or inundate you with appeals
for money.  What we will ask you to do is take action.
<p>

We do not want to take funds away from charities working in long-term
development.  In fact we are working very closely with NGOs such as Christian Aid, the World Development
Movement, and
 Tearfund who have been campaigning on debt for some time. Nor do we plan to raise 
money to pay off Third World debts. Instead, we hope to build up a large active membership 
base until the end of the year 2000 when all contributions to our campaign will cease.
<p>

Membership will bring three benefits:

<ul><li>It will enable us to keep you  informed of the issues and of our
progress with a free Debt Cutters Handbook, relevant, eye-catching newsletters 
and updates.  It will allow us to co-ordinate activities, workshops and action days.
<li>As membership increases, the pressure we can bring to bear in high level
negotiations will increase.
<li>Regular membership payments will enable us to maintain a small central
office with staff, produce a steady supply of information, fund research
and promote Jubilee 2000.  Individual donations are welcomed to enable us
to promote this work.
</ul><p>

<h1>Resources</h1>

<b><a href="form.html">Debt Cutters Handbook</a></b>:  This is our key resource and the basis for some 
of the information on this web site.  It contains a clear history of the debt crisis, 
case studies of the impact of debt and ideas/resources to raise awareness about debt in 
your workplace, church, community centre and so on.  There are two versions: a general 
version and a church version.
<p>
<a name="charter"></a>
<b><a href="charter.html">Charter</a></b>:  After consultation with various NGOs, economists,
diplomats
and politicians 
Jubilee 2000 has produced a workable charter calling for the remission of unpayable debts owed by 
the world's poorest countries by year 2000.  47 Countries are eligible under this initiative.  It has 3
key elements:
<ol><li>promoting understanding that responsibility for high levels on indebtedness lies with creditors as
well as debtors
<li>establishing a new independent process to determine debt relief which will include the views of civil
society and ensure the direction of resources to relief of poverty.
<li>calling for more action to be taken on recovering resources diverted by corrupt debtors and lendors.
</ol>

<b><a name="petition">Petition</a></b>:  A major focus of the campaign will be an international petition
which we hope will be the largest
petition ever.  Currently several British aid agencies are planning to circulate our petition,  and they are
being 
distributed worldwide through international NGOs who are supporting Jubilee 2000.  They will be presented
at the G7 (key industrial powers) Summit in 1999 in Germany. <b><a href="form.html">Order</a></b> or <b><a href="petition.html">print</a></b> your

<h2>Jubilee 2000</h2>

<h3>Charter</h3>

Proclaim liberty throughout the land to all its inhabitants. Leviticus 25:10 <p> 


The aim of the Jubilee 2000 Charter is:<p> 

 	<ul><li>To liberate the poorest nations from the burden of the backlog of unpayable 
debt owed by their governments to other governments, to international 	financial
institutions or to commercial banks.

	<li>To achieve such liberation, and a return to sustainable development, through 
the unrepeatable one-off remission of unpayable debts of  the poorest countries 	by
the year 2000.

	<li>To provide a focus and catalyst for harmonising and mobilising international 
co-operation, support and actions to promote and achieve this Charter's aim. 

	<li>To promote understanding among creditor nations that responsibility for high 
levels of indebtedness rests with creditors as well as debtors.</ul><p>

The purposes and principles underpinning the Jubilee 2000 Charter are: <p>

	<ul><li>To correct the perverse operation of the international financial system
whereby 	the poorest countries are transferring  scarce resources to rich countries and 
institutions in surplus -  through, inter alia, the Paris Club, the London Club of 
Banks, the IMF and World Bank.

	<li>Through the remission of  the burden of unjust and unpayable international 
debts, to promote economic and social justice and fundamental human rights, 	for the
poorest peoples of the world, now afflicted by such bondage.  

	<li>By such means, to promote the right of all peoples to economic self-
determination; in particular the principle that in no case may a people be 	deprived
of their own means of subsistence. 

	<li>By such means, to restore balance, fairness, equity and discipline to relations 
between international creditors and debtors, to the benefit of creditors as well as
debtors.  

	<li>By such means, to promote the maintenance of international peace and 	security;
help remove causes of conflict and movement of populations -		by  averting the
social and economic disintegration of the poorest and most indebted nations.   

<li>To draw lessons from attempts being made in countries around the world, to regain
resources that have been diverted corruptly, and use them to offset part of the
outstanding debts, and also for productive purposes. This would require the active
co-operation of the creditor nations to which these resources have been diverted through
secret bank accounts.   As well as determination on the part of debtor nations to
establish probity in financial management. </ul><p>

Jubilee 2000's Priorities and Procedures for debt remission by the year 2000:<p>

 	<ul>Subject to the arbitration process referred to below, remission of 100% of the 
backlog of unpayable bilateral, multilateral and commercial debts to be 	provided to
each severely indebted, low or middle income country with strong 	indicators of
deprivation.   This to be achieved through a comprehensive, 	coordinated
approach.</ul><p>

Eligible countries to be those with GDP per capita at purchasing power parity (as defined
by UNDP in Human Development report)  of $2000 or below which meet at least two of the
following criteria: <p>

	<ul>(a)	net present value of total external debt of 50% or more of GNP;<br> 

(b)	net present value of total external debt of 200% or more of exports of 	goods and
services net of imports of food and fuel;<br>

(c)	net present value of  public and publicly-guaranteed external debt of 	200% or
more of total government revenues. </ul><p> 

 	In addition remission on similar terms, to be provided to countries with 	GDP per
capita at purchasing power parity of between $2000 and $3,500 which meet three of the
criteria listed in paragraph 12.<p> 	

	Consideration to be given to countries in exceptional circumstances which do 	not
meet the above criteria.<p>

 	Remission to be based on debt outstanding on 31st December, 1993 plus any 
additional interest due on that debt up to the year 2000<p>

Procedure for managing the remission of unpayable debts: <p>

   	<ul>The precise details of remission (including calculation of the unpayable 
backlog of debts) to be worked out in consultation with both debtors and 	creditors for
each debtor country.<p> 

	Actual remission of debts could be agreed in each case by a small Committee of 
Arbitrators nominated in equal numbers by both creditor and debtor. The 	debtor
representatives should include at least two representatives from civil 	society. 
Appointments to the Committee will be overseen and monitored by 	the UN, or any other
suitably impartial international body, which shall, for the 	duration of the
arbitration, guide the proceedings of the Committee of Arbitration.<p> 

 	The deliberations leading to agreement on remission of the backlog of 	unpayable
debts to be transparent and well-publicised.<p> 

 Implementation of each debt remission package to be the responsibility of the debtor
government, rather than creditors, and to be managed in co-operation with donors and
creditors. This Consultative Group of debtor, creditors and donors to give debtor
governments the leading role in assessing and improving their debt management. The
Consultative Group to be accountable, through the UN, (or the designated body) to the
Committee of  Arbitrators for the long-term management of the debt remission
package.</ul><p>

Conditions for the remission of unpayable debts: <p>

	<ul>In arriving at their decision to remit the burden of the backlog of unpayable 
debts of the poorest countries, arbitrators will take into account for each debtor 
country that country's probity, economic management, social policies and 	human rights
record.<p>

We propose that debt remission should be made conditional upon governments utilising the
financial resources that become available, for investment in basic human needs. Targets
for improving access to primary health, basic education, and water and sanitation should
be established along with the costs of meeting them. UNICEF's engagement with government
in developing national plans of action for achieving the goals set at the World Summit
for Children is a model which should be followed, with debt relief linked to specific
expenditure targets. </ul><p>

But it still needs good leadership. Here the <b>NI</b> looksback on the six Secretaries-General, from the visionary to thesheep, the campaigner to the crook.</i><p><b>Trygve Lie (Norway) 1946-52</b> The first Secretary-General (SG) was by far the most outspoken.His strength reflected the high hopes of the time for the newinternational organization in the aftermath of a devastatingwar. But Lie's readiness to wade in with his own opinions on anyand every world issue had mixed  results. In supporting (invain) Communist China's right to take its seat at the UN afterthe 1949 Revolution he was admirably clear-sighted and preparedto stand up to the US. But ultimately his passionate advocacy ofthe US/UN position in the Korean War won him the enmity of theSoviet Union, who refused to take part in UN activities when hewas present, forcing him to resign.<p><b>Dag Hammarskjold (Sweden) 1953-61</b>Hammarskjold was the UN's finest leader. More carefullydiplomatic than Lie, he was just as prepared to take independentinitiatives and not simply serve the major powers. He behavedwith credit during the Suez Crisis, when two of theveto-holders, Britain and France were clearly at fault. And hewas largely responsible for the whole idea of peacekeeping,which is not provided for in the UN Charter - the first UNpeacekeeping force was deployed in Egypt in 1956. The perils ofpeacekeeping were soon evident during his intervention in thecivil war following the Belgian Congo's independence in 1960.The UN soon found itself 'taking sides' and imposing 'peace'through military force. The intervention also cost Hammarskjoldhis life - he died in a suspicious plane crash in NorthernRhodesia while on his way to meet secessionist rebels. His Congopolicy incurred the wrath of the Soviet Union. Hammarskjld'sidealistic response was that he was there to serve the interestsnot of the great powers but of the small states.<p><b>U Thant (Burma) 1961-71</b>The major powers now informally agreed that no future SecretaryGeneral should have the power and presence of Hammarskjold. UThant was the first fruit of that change of policy, being quietand bureaucratically inclined, almost never speaking at SecurityCouncil meetings. He presided over 10 further years of Cold War,years in which the UN was frozen into immobility on thepeace-and-security front. But these were also the years in whichnewly independent countries of the South joined the organizationin droves, full of hope that they could harness it in the causeof global justice and equality. The presence of a leader fromthe South symbolized that new phase for the UN, as did U Thant'sown most daring initiative - his repeated and passionatecriticism of the US war in Vietnam.<p><b>Kurt Waldheim (Austria) 1972-81</b>Waldheim will be remembered less for his work at the UN than for the accusations of involvement in Nazi war crimes which dogged his later career as President of Austria. He was arguably the least distinguished of all the UN's leaders. Publiclydiplomatic, even obsequious to the major powers, in private hewas vain, with a violent temper. During his term the UNSecretariat lapsed in standards as the quality of senior staffwas continually diluted by backscratching 'political'appointments and hints of corruption - staff morale in New Yorksank ever lower.<p><b>Javier Perez de Cuellar (Peru) 1982-91</b>Perez de Cuellar, a sensitive, soft-spoken aesthete, was boredstiff by budget discussions, which notoriously sent him tosleep. The perilous financial basis of the UN, forever dependenton an increasingly hostile US, was never likely to be turnedaround in his term of office. And it may also be no coincidencethat during his decade the World Bank and the IMF - UNorganizations both - started to set the global economic agenda,thereby undermining the UN's humanitarian development work.Perez de Cuellar concentrated instead on the 'good offices'function of the Secretary-General - the power to act as anindependent mediator in international disputes - and achievedsome success in later years in this role, most notably in ElSalvador.<p><b>Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) 1992</b>Boutros-Ghali is the most forceful UN leader since Hammarskjold,as 'hands on' as Perez de Cuellar was 'hands off'. Staff in NewYork have already been shaken up by his reorganizations and hemay pay more attention than his predecessors to the nitty-grittyinternal reforms which are so badly needed. But he would neverhave been appointed had he not been considered 'sound' by thenewly dominant Western powers on the key issue of the globalfree market. His use of the UN's post-Cold War freedom ofmanoeuvre has been generally disastrous, as in Somalia andRwanda. He does seem to recognize that the world is going to beever more war-torn if the basic needs of the poor are not met.If his concern were serious he would lead a campaign to bringthe World Bank and the IMF to heel, starting perhaps at theSocial Summit in Copenhagen. But don't hold your breath.<p>©Copyright New Internationalist 1994<hr><pre><a href="index.html#NItop1"><img src="ni_pix/nilogo3.gif"> NI Home Page</a> <a href="NIissue262.html"><img src="ni_pix/niunsymbol.gif"> NI Issue 262 Contents</a><hr></body></html>

<h2>HUMANITARIAN AID: THE ROLE OF BRITAIN'S ODA PROGRAMME IN COMPLEX EMERGENCIES<br>BARONESS CHALKER'S ADDRESS TO THE JOINT SERVICE DEFENCE COLLEGE, GREENWICH, ON 16 JANUARY 1996</h2>

<hr>
<p>
Thank you for this opportunity to speak on humanitarian aid.  During my tenÊyears in the Foreign Office, I have probably seen some of the most harrowing sights around the world.  I shall not forget the horrors of Goma in Zaire,  with its all-pervasive stench of death, nor the wanton destruction of the architectural gem which was the city of Mostar, in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  In northern Iraq, the plight of the displaced Kurds in frozen hills was desperate.  In Angola, the human cost of conflict was evident in a ward-full of limbless children.  Last week in Sierra Leone, in addition to 6,000 registered displaced people in a camp on a disused clay factory site, there were a further 10,000 unregistered squatters, who begged or stole food to survive.
  <p>

On the positive side, I have been privileged to see many of the best life-saving humanitarian operations that are beacons of hope.  The courage of the Sisters of Charity in Kigali was outstanding.  They risked all to protect scores of children.  Trained volunteer and professional deminers face the dangerous daily toil of grappling with some of the estimated 100 million mines around the world.  Our convoy drivers driving along the frozen mountain tracks of central Bosnia have shown immense skill and courage as have the ingenious gas and water engineers making safe connections across divided Sarajevo.  Doctors' and nurses' dedication, whether on the frontline in Somalia, Chechnya or Afghanistan, exceeds all normal belief.  We, who live in peace and comfort, with food and clean water, warmth and shelter, owe a great debt.
<p>

As Britain's Overseas Development Minister, I can be justly proud of our track record in humanitarian aid.  It is speedy, flexible and generous.  ODA responds every year to some 50 to 100 emergencies of many different types.  It makes more than 300 grants.  In the last financial year this totalled some £334 million in 71 countries.  Regrettably, this is not a sign of success, more a sad reflection of growing need.  
<p>

Across the globe, 300 million people are affected by disasters, and this figure is growing by 10 million each year.  An increasing proportion are the victims of violent conflicts; last year there were 56, mostly internal, wars compared to 46 in 1990.  Civilians bear the brunt of these crises.  At the beginning of the century 90% of war casualties were military, nowadays 95% are civilian.  Conflicts also trigger large population movements, posing a threat to the security and livelihoods of whole regions.  Refugee numbers increased from 13 million in 1989 to over 23 million last year, with a further 26 million internally displaced: 50 million people driven from their homes, and often separately from their families too.
Today, I will discuss mainly those humanitarian crises associated with armed conflicts. I shall focus on three key aspects of the ODA's Programme's approach to alleviate human suffering. These are: Prevention, Preparedness and Response.  Finally I shall say a word about longer term assistance.


<h4>Conflict prevention</h4>

Complex emergencies occur in some of the poorest parts of the world.  The concept of "human security" seeks to link the explanation for conflicts to poverty, inequality, population and environmental pressure.  I am not sure that such linkages always work; for example, the wars in Sierra Leone and Sri Lanka are quite different. But it is right that we should move beyond focusing on the plight of the victim to questioning why individuals are fighting.   Better conflict analysis could improve the targeting and design of assistance. In coming months, ODA will be strengthening its ability to do this, through a dedicated programme of research and better preparatory knowledge. 
<p>

British foreign policy and diplomacy, including through our influence in the UN Security Council and in other fora such as the EU and the Commonwealth, is directly concerned with preventing conflict and promoting peace.  The Development Programme can play an important complementary role through what has been called "citizen based" or informal diplomacy. In Sierra Leone we encouraged the British NGO 'Conciliation Resources' to bring together church, labour and women's groups to consider their practical contribution to peace-making.  For many of them, this was the first time that they had been asked to participate at all.

<p>

We should not forget the role of traditional conflict resolution mechanisms which exist even in the most war-damaged societies. Southern Sudan has a very long history of internal conflict. But traditionally, there were checks and balances including their local equivalent of the "Geneva Convention" with strong taboos against killing children and women.  Modern warfare has weakened traditional bonds and led to the progressive deterioration of what we now call the "rules of engagement".  The brutalising effects are only too evident. However initial work by Oxfam and UNICEF shows that traditional mechanisms for peace and justice can be re-activated. In Afghanistan, women say that if they had more schools to occupy their male children, fewer of them would be press-ganged into the various militias. 
<p>

These are direct examples of what the Development Programme can do in conflict resolution and prevention.  But we should be under no illusions that external aid or diplomacy can always bring internal conflicts to an end. As we have seen in the former Yugoslavia or Somalia, this will depend on the balance of interests among the communities at war.  More broadly, the best guarantor of peace is a healthy civil society. Central to this is sound public administration responsible to a government which is accountable to its citizens.  ODA's assistance for building up sound practice, known as "Good Government", is promoting stability in different ways but in many countries. In Malawi, we encouraged and supported the country's first democratic elections.  In Ethiopia, we are helping to re-establish a civilian police force.  In Angola we offered training for journalists to promote a responsible, independent media.  In Rwanda, we are working with other donors to re-establish the judiciary; and, in neighbouring Uganda, a civil service reform programme has done much to regain the public's confidence in the country's fragile institutions.  In these and other countries we also fund the resettlement of demobilised soldiers.
<p>

Let me now turn to the second theme: preparedness. 


<h4>Preparedness</h4>

In an emergency, the urgency of human need compels swift reaction.   Relief operations are usually conducted under intense pressure. But without sound information and analysis, not to mention effective coordination on the ground, speed can hinder rather than help, and can cost further lives.  It was with this in mind that five years ago, I launched our own Disaster Relief Initiative with three key elements: assessment, co-ordination and rapid deployment.   This encouraged the UN to set up its own arrangement in the shape of the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Co-ordination Team (UNDAC).  The UK is an active supporter of the UNDAC system; we have made available the services of six trained British experts [including my own Adviser, Dr Kapila, who is with us today!] who are on standby to participate, at short notice, in UNDAC missions to complex emergencies and natural disasters anywhere in the world.  This has proved its worth in some 17 missions since 1993, responding, for example, to the crisis in Rwanda, and to the floods in Laos and China, and the earthquake in Indonesia.
<p>

The importance of investing in preparedness was proven during the massive exodus of some 500,000 refugees from Rwanda to northern Tanzania as well as 1 million to Zaire in April 1994.  At the request of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, ODA was able to deploy, within days, technical equipment and expert personnel for off-loading aircraft in Mwanza, an up-country airstrip. This allowed hundreds of tons of urgently needed relief supplies to be brought in. Our aircraft handling team was subsequently re-deployed to Goma and then Kigali.  These jobs done, the equipment is now in store, ready for use in future emergencies. ODA also finances the British Red Cross to maintain relief stockpiles - including tents, blankets, high energy biscuits - in the UK. We also support the emergency stockpile of the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs in Pisa in Italy. Alongside material aid, ODA also has a fully self-contained Emergency Logistics Team.  It has its own survival, communications and access to transport capability, ready for immediate deployment anywhere in the world. 
<p>

Effective preparedness must include the use of improved early warning of conflict, instability and tension.  The DHA has a list of 144 indicators to help identify potential trouble spots.  It is not enough to know that a humanitarian emergency is unfolding. In practice, it is always difficult to know when and how to intervene. Thus we need to work more on identifying specific triggers to violent conflict, and develop appropriate mechanisms for response. I should be interested in your views.  
<p>

Now to the third component of ODA's programme for humanitarian assistance: the actual response to emergencies. 


<h4>Response</h4>

The basic task of humanitarian aid is to provide the essentials of food, clean water, basic health care, clothing and shelter. This we do through providing cash, supplies, and experts through NGOs, UN and Red Cross agencies, and our Embassies worldwide.  All relief actions affect longer term prospects, positively or negatively.  It is too simplistic to view disasters as temporary interruptions in the march of progress.  The reality for many of the poorest war affected communities is and will continue to be one of long-term uncertainty and crisis. 
<p>

Sound design of relief programmes aims to strengthen the local ability to cope. It encourages the beneficiaries to take responsibility for themselves. To treat them as passive victims only fosters further dependency. In Kenya, for example, livestock  provided to Somali refugee women has helped households to regain self-sufficiency and the dignity and pride which goes with this.  Humanitarian relief is also an opportunity for investment. Even during the protracted fighting in Somalia, food aid in support of work schemes has helped to repair roads and put farmers back on their land.  Local demining training in Angola brings the chance of growing adequate and local food supplies, even surplus for urban communities.
<p>

Humanitarian aid can be an instrument of peace; sometimes the results can be dramatic.   In 1994 Afghanistan had its first nationwide immunisation campaign. This was a remarkable feat of diplomacy and logistic management by the World Health Organisation and UNICEF.  For one week at least, the guns were silenced and even tanks and military aircraft were mobilised to move vaccines and medical supplies. Two million people, mostly women and children, benefitted.  Though the cease fire did not last, some of the links between former colleagues - turned - bitter enemies, were re-established.
<p>

Nearer to home, recent weeks have seen successful negotiations for a settlement of the conflict in the former Yugoslavia. This year will be crucial in determining whether this will result in a lasting peace.   If this happens, there is the prospect of significant international aid for reconstruction. This should encourage the commitment of all sides to the agreements that they have signed.  Local people seem determined to persuade political leaders in this way.  
<p>

The cost of conflict includes the personal trauma of individuals and families. Much hard work is needed to re-establish inter-communal trust. Humanitarian aid can help bind some wounds. In Bosnia, we funded the NGO,  Marie Stopes International, to help widows rebuild their lives though, of course, they will never be able to forget their loss and suffering. In Rwanda, amidst the chaos of the exodus to Zaire, an estimated 100,000 children were orphaned or separated from their parents. Save the Children Fund is working with the Rwanda Government and the International Committee of the Red Cross in a long-term programme of family reunification.
Objective information is one of the first casualties of conflict. We have countered the poison of extremist radio in Rwanda by helping to set up an independent UN Radio.  In Afghanistan, ODA has backed the BBC in adapting the style of "The Archers"  to broadcast some very special soap-operas. These contain health, mines awareness and conflict resolution messages. The programme has proved extremely popular with people on all sides.  But not everyone has access to radio, and batteries can be hard to get, even if they can be afforded. An innovative solution was required. This has emerged in the shape of a spring-powered "Wind-Up Radio" developed by a South African company with ODA help; its lifetime use is six times cheaper than that of a conventional radio as it is not subject to the vagaries of battery supplies or mains electricity. We have agreed to purchase the first 3000 units of the prototype to test amongst refugees and other conflict affected groups. 
<p>

One of the most serious challenges today is the growing threat to the humanitarian spirit behind our life-saving operations.  I am appalled by the increasing numbers of incidents where aid workers and civilians are deliberately targeted for attack or even taken hostage.  International protocols oblige governments and other authorities to provide them with protection. But, in reality, all current crises have seen blatant disregard of these conventions. It is partly a matter of education.  The illiterate child soldiers of Liberia are hardly likely to be aware of the finer points of international humanitarian law. But much more can be done. The UK is a committed supporter of ICRC which has a particular mandate in this area. We were also one of the first to back the UN Human Rights Field Operation in Rwanda - the largest such exercise in the world. 
<p>

Finally, I should touch on the  military - humanitarian interface.  In recent years, we have seen greater use of the military in direct support of disaster response operations.  The ships and helicopters of the Royal Navy were invaluable in rescue operations during the floods in Bangladesh in 1991 while, at exactly the same time, other formations were at work in Turkey and northern Iraq in "Operation Provide Comfort".  Just a few weeks ago, the Royal Marines and the West Indies Guardship were helping in Caribbean waters with the still-active volcano threat on Montserrat.  
<p>

In complex emergencies, British forces are at the forefront in UN peace-keeping operations, I have been proud to see their work in Bosnia, Angola, and Rwanda. But extension from a peacekeeping role to undertaking humanitarian aid delivery is not straightforward, as there are local and international sensitivities to take into account. These require careful thought in the context of the specific deployment. 
<p>

One factor in deciding on whether or not to deploy military assets is that of cost. For example, civilian chartered aircraft (apart from being selected for the task) are usually cheaper than any military equivalent. The same is true for the deployment of civilian medical, engineering and logistic specialists, compared to their uniformed counterparts. The military are a valuable highly trained resource.  It makes sense therefore to reserve their use for specific situations where they have added value to offer.  This may be for security reasons, or because of special expertise that is not available elsewhere.

<h4>Conclusion</h4>

Of my three themes, Prevention is really a long-term development objective.  If clean water, basic sanitation, health and education and food are available, there is a real chance of a longer term focus for life in the village and town.  But without these components, the pressures of illness, squalor and misunderstanding can quickly reinforce jealousy and animosity, turning them into intolerance and violence, which lays the foundations of rebellions, or even massacre as in Rwanda.  In my experience there is no substitute for sustainable development giving incentives for improvement, but we shall always need to be ready to respond to natural and manmade disaster.
<p>

I have said that I am proud of our record in humanitarian aid. But in an ever more complex world, expectations are high and the challenges do not diminish. There are no grounds for complacency.  We shall continue to improve the quality of the humanitarian aid we provide. More than this, we shall continue to work with purposeful intent - with military and civilian colleagues alongside all our partners in the UN, and among NGOs, at home and abroad - to address the underlying causes of conflict and complex emergencies.

<p>
The Irish Aid Advisory Committee has a mandate which includes the undertaking of research
on issues of relevance to Ireland's Aid Programme and the provision of expert advice to the
Minister for Foreign Affairs on matters relating to development cooperation and policy
aspects of the aid programme. This study stems from a concern about the lack of a clear
policy on Irish Aid educational assistance to developing countries. Given the extent of Irish
Aid, and of the Irish NGOs, involvement in educational projects and programmes, both
formal and informal, and the educational challenges currently facing developing countries,
the IAAC felt it appropriate to undertake a study in this sector at this time. It is expected that
this report can facilitate the development of a clear and consistent policy on educational
assistance which is in line with overall priorities set for Irish Overseas Development
Assistance  in the Strategy Plan of 1993. The report is not in itself a suggested policy
document.
<p>
This study was commissioned by the Irish Aid Advisory Committee and was carried out
between September and November 1994 by a consultant, Cathy Gaynor. The consultant
reported to a sub-committee of the IAAC, which reviewed drafts of the study as these were
prepared, including a draft of the whole report. The comments and suggestions of the
steering committee were considered in developing and finalising the report.
<p>
The scale of this study was modest in terms of budget and relied substantially on existing
sources of data from books, articles and other written materials plus discussions and written
responses to a short questionnaire from individuals and agencies in Ireland. The consultant
would like to acknowledge the help given by the agencies contacted and by Irish Aid officials
in Dublin and overseas who provided information and assistance throughout.
<p>
The help provided by the Educational Research Centre at St Patrick's College, Drumcondra,
the Development Studies Information Centre, University College Dublin and the Resource
Centre, Agency for Personal Service Overseas was invaluable in identification of the wide
range of publications consulted in the study. The support and contribution of other
individuals involved in Irish assistance to education in developing countries and the logistical
and administrative support of Catherine Gately, Executive Secretary of IAAC is gratefully
acknowledged.  
<p>

<A NAME="es"><h2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h2></A>

1.   This study was commissioned by the Irish Aid Advisory Committee. It examines the
dimensions of a policy and strategy for Irish Aid support for education in developing
countries. It provides an overview of current issues in education in developing countries and
of recent Irish involvement, both official and non-governmental, in the education sector. This
report outlines the findings from a literature review and from discussions with, and
information provided by, Irish agencies and individuals. Recent trends in Irish Aid to
education are analyzed and suggestions are made on possible principles and strategies for
future Irish Aid to education. It is hoped that the report will facilitate the process of
formulation of an Irish Aid policy on education and its implementation.
<p>
<h3>Issues</h3>

2.   At global level there have been improvements in education. Enrolments have
increased over the last two decades though most progress was made in the 1970s with a
marked slow down in the 1980s. There has been a reduction in the size of the gender gap
which exists between males and females in relation to enrolment and to years of schooling.
Progress has been made in lowering pupil/teacher ratio, in localisation of curricula and
examination systems and in raising literacy levels. These achievements were obtained as a
result of heavy investment by governments in education.
<p>
3.   Enrolments, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa, have stagnated recently and the
quality of education has apparently declined. This stagnation since the 1980s has taken place
against a backdrop of austere structural adjustment programmes, increasing levels of
indebtedness, population growth and, frequently, drought and social or political upheaval.
Despite considerable investment, coverage remains low, teaching conditions poor and
learning achievements unsatisfactory. The lowest enrolment rates, at all levels, are in Africa.
Gender, ethnic, location and poverty based disparities still exist in access to education in
many developing countries. These are more severe at higher levels of education. There is
little provision made for children with learning difficulties or for early childhood
development.
<p>
4.   There is concern about the quality of education and the low standard of inputs to non-
formal and formal education at all levels. Teaching standards, teaching materials, buildings
and supplies are very poor. Public expenditure on education has declined and per-pupil
expenditure has declined markedly at all levels of education. Teacher morale, motivation and
performance are declining. The profession has lost status and there are still many unqualified
and undertrained teachers. Despite low levels of pay in many countries, the cost of meeting
teacher salaries places great strain on education budgets. Many countries are experimenting
with cost-effective approaches to teacher education which, it is hoped, will also lead to
improved performance.
<p>
5.   The rapid expansion in education in many countries has created problems for the
system. Management of education, at national and school level, is in need of improvement.
Most countries need to formulate coherent national educational action plans. Increased
capacity, at all levels, is called for. Technical assistance (TA) to education has not delivered
as expected. Despite heavy investment, by many donors, in this form of support to education,
it did not lead to improved local capacities. There is now a shift towards using more short-
term, higher skilled TA in an advisory capacity. Some countries with rapidly expanding
education systems will continue to need teachers as "gap-fillers" until sufficient local teachers
are trained to meet requirements.
<p>
6.   Financing of education is a concern in most developing countries, but particularly
those undergoing Structural Adjustment Programmes (SAPs). Due to declining public
investment in education, families are having to contribute more to the cost of schooling. An
increasing number are unable to afford to send their children to school. In some countries
poverty, together with decline in quality, have led to a drop in demand for education,
particularly in the poorer and more remote regions. Many governments are now seeking to
increase private funding of education and some donors are funding recurrent costs.
<p>
7.   Allocation of government resources and donor support by level of education, in Sub-
Saharan Africa, has tended to favour higher education. Since the 1990 World Conference on
Education for All (WCEFA), attention has focused on basic education, formal and non-
formal. This is argued on equity and economic-return bases. There are valid arguments for
the need for increased, not decreased, resources at all levels and many donors are seeking
to have a more balanced approach. The link between education and employment is a concern
which dominated the literature from the mid 1970s to mid 1980s. Experiments, overall, with
vocationally-oriented schools did not improve job prospects and were found to cost more than
conventional schools. There has been a recent shift away from this approach. There is
concern about, but very little quantification of, the brain drain of educated personnel, mainly
graduates, from the least developed countries. Some argue that the fellowship programmes,
run by governments and donors, should be better utilised to ensure effective capacity
development by focusing on institutional and system development rather than supporting
training for individuals. 
<p>
8.   There is much disappointment and disillusionment with non-formal education and
considerable questioning of the claimed achievements, particularly in relation to literacy.
Many argue that the approach, when attempted, was underfunded, lacked clear goals, was
inadequately planned and was implemented without properly trained tutors or the right
materials. There are arguments for reform, rather than abandonment of non-formal education.
Non-formal education is seen as necessary in order to reach the large numbers whom the
formal system has failed. Success tends to happen around well identified needs, adequate
backing and financial resources and, usually, when combined with economic benefits.
<p>
9.   Priorities for educational development have altered significantly in the last decade.
In response to this situation, many host governments and donors are changing their policies
for the educational sector. The current dominant policy themes include improving access and
equity, quality improvement and capacity development in the education sector. An increased
focus is emerging on developing national capacities, on the improvement of educational
planning and management, on partnerships between donor and host country institutions, on
provision of short-term professional training, on support for primary education and on
provision of basic skills. There is increased recognition of the need for a long-term time
frame and for donor funding of recurrent costs. The World Bank report on education in Sub-
Saharan Africa in 1988 and the World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) in 1990
have been very influential in setting the present educational agenda. Donors are now giving
higher priority to education, especially basic education. The World Bank, Unicef, UNESCO
and UNDP have all indicated their intention to increase their share of funding which goes
to education. Many bilateral donors have revised previous policies and/or produced new
policy documents on education for the 1990s.
<p>

<h3>Irish Aid to education - analysis of recent practice</h3>

10.  Ireland has traditionally given high priority to education in its official aid to
developing countries. Of Irish ODA channelled through multilateral agencies, only a very
small proportion, slightly more than three per cent in 1992, goes to education. Irish bilateral
disbursements to education and training have remained at or above one third of total, at least
since 1982, and this has been maintained during the recent expansion of the aid programme.
There are three main channels for disbursement of educational assistance in the bilateral aid
programme (BAP). The chief means is through projects in priority countries. Existing and
new priority country programmes give attention and support to education with average
expenditure on education reaching 37 per cent in 1993. The level of funding channelled to
education through the NGO co-financing scheme has increased considerably, as funding for
this scheme increased, though the share to education declined in the 1990s from 36 per cent to 22 per cent
in 1993. Expenditure on training for host country nationals in Ireland has increased, over the
last five years, from 6.5 per cent to its present share of 8.4 per cent of the BAP. The number of
fellowships has also increased. Only a small proportion (about 8 per cent) of fellowships, over the
last five years, relate directly to the education sector. There are approximately two males to
every one female awarded a fellowship in recent years. According to statistics kept on all
foreign students in Ireland, by the Irish Council for Overseas Students (ICOS), the number
and proportion of students from Africa is declining rapidly.
<p>
11.  The main focus of Irish Aid education projects has traditionally been into higher
education, which accounted for 58 per cent of the total in 1989. Support for primary education has
grown rapidly in the 1990s to become the main recipient, at 43 per cent of total, in 1993. In that
year higher education took second place with 24 per cent of total. Technical and vocational
education and training receive modest but consistent support, around 16 per cent each in 1993, but
secondary education is hardly supported on the BAP (1.2 per cent) and non-formal education has
received no support at all. Analysis of technical assistance levels in education was not
undertaken but overall numbers have dropped from 78 in 1989 to 61 in 1993, despite a big
increase in budget.
<p>
12.  The Agency for Personal Service Overseas (APSO) funds Irish people rather than
projects. Development workers are placed by APSO with overseas governments or co-
financed to work with Irish NGOs and other bodies. APSO has always supported the
education sector, particularly at second level through provision of teachers, and about one
third of assignments have traditionally been in education. As part of the Programme for a
Partnership Government, an expanding budget has been promised to APSO until 1997. The
Agency has undertaken to try to reach 2000 assignments by the year 1997. This would
represent more than a four-fold increase in numbers over five years. The scale of the planned
increase has been questioned by some. The increase will mean greater numbers in education,
at all levels, and APSO expects to have 295 assignments in education in 1994, almost a
doubling of the 1992 figure. There has been an increase in share of APSO assignees at third
level and a decrease at secondary level over the last five years, with very little change in
share at primary level. This situation mainly reflects donor requests as APSO does not have
a stated policy on education apart from an expressed intention to increase numbers at all
levels, but particularly in teacher training and in English as a foreign language ( APSO's
Strategic Plan 1994 to 1997).
<p>
13.  Though not part of Irish ODA, Higher Education for Development Cooperation
(HEDCO), plays a considerable role in Irish support to the education sector in developing
countries. At present  HEDCO is implementing 17 projects on behalf of Irish Aid, the World
Bank, the EU and the UN development agencies. On these projects, links have been
established between third-level institutes in seven developing countries and 19 such
institutions in Ireland. Around 64 per cent of HEDCO's annual budget comes from Irish Aid and,
in 1994, in excess of IR1 million from other donors was channelled into education and HRD
projects in developing countries. About half of HEDCO's projects focus directly on the
education sector and the remainder on other sectors. Current projects support different levels
within the education sector, with greatest emphasis on strengthening of third-level institutions
and teacher education.
<p>
14.  There is a long tradition of involvement in education by Irish NGOs, including
missionaries of many denominations. Education remains the main sector of involvement for
Irish missionaries, despite a decline in numbers from the 1970s. Missionary numbers in
education in developing countries dropped from 1005 in 1990 to 810 in 1994. Approximately
two thirds are in Africa, with the remainder mainly in Asia and just seven per cent in Latin
America. Missionaries are involved at all levels of education and in both formal and non-
formal education. There is a recent trend away from formal institutions into non-formal, with
localisation of school management and staff. Many missionary organisations report an
increasing poverty focus and attention to girls education. Concern was expressed, by several
missionary organisations, about the effects of SAPs, decline in per-capita support to
education by governments and the consequent difficulty for families to afford schooling. 
<p>
15.  Some Irish NGOs, such as Trocaire and Christian Aid, have traditionally funded only
non-formal education. However both report that, in light of the austerity circumstances of
the 1990s, they are reassessing their positions on support to formal education. Trocaire
channels in excess of IR1.2 million into non-formal education each year. Concern is the
largest Irish NGO and, in 1993, expended about IR3 million on education and women's
training. There are numerous other smaller NGOs which support education and training,
sometimes within a particular sector such as health or agriculture. Support for formal
education by NGOs is almost totally at the primary level. 
<p>

<h3>Suggested principles and priorities</h3>
<p>
16.  It is clear that education and training play a major role in promotion of social and
economic development and that Irish Aid support for the sector is justified in the context of
the general policy guidelines as set out in the Strategy Plan (1993). Following the experience
of the 1980s, and prompted in particular by the WCEFA, there has been a reassessment and
adjustment of policies on education by host governments and donors. Furthermore, it is
argued that Irish Aid policy on education has evolved in recent years and that making the
new emphases more explicit, through development of a policy document, can only improve
the effectiveness of Irish Aid support to education. On that basis a number of suggestions on
policy and priorities are made. A summary of recommendations is contained in the next
section. Following are the main suggestions:
<ul>
<li>that education continue to be a priority sector for Irish Aid and attract one
          third of funding.
<li>that country-specific strategies, taking local needs into consideration, be
          adopted for Irish Aid involvement in education.
<li>that support for education be based on three principles of access/equity;
          quality; and capacity development and that policies be framed which address
          these goals.
<li>that priority be given to basic education, both formal and non-formal, with an
          overall balanced approach to support for different levels of the sector.
<li>that gender issues be addressed in all Irish Aid supported education projects.
<li>that the time scale for support be increased.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Suggested strategies</h3>

17.  Developing a policy on education, and ensuring commitment to that policy, will
require wide-ranging consultation, much wider debate than this study was able to generate,
appropriate research and consideration and resolution of a number of issues. Decisions will
have to be taken on structures, strategies and mechanisms. Several suggestions are made for
further consideration. Amongst these the main ones are:
<ul>
<li>that additional educational expertise and a locus on education within Irish Aid
          be identified to facilitate and monitor progress.
<li>that Ireland exert every influence on multilateral donors to increase aid to
          education.
<li>that the implications of a programme versus project approach to educational
          support by Irish Aid be examined.
<li>that coordination, networking and collaboration within and between Ireland,
          developing countries and other donors should be actively supported.
<li>that the position on technical assistance, including the APSO target of 2000
          assignments by 1997, be reviewed.
<li>that better instruments to assess, measure, appraise, monitor, evaluate and
          report on progress in education be developed which will ensure
          implementation of policy.
</ul>
<p>
18.  Finally, there is scope for formulation of additional policy-related papers on particular
issues in education and training. The scope of this study was broad and there is need of more
in-depth analysis of a range of issues which could have a critical influence on the
effectiveness of Irish Aid to education.
<p>


<A NAME="sum"><h2>SUMMARY  OF  RECOMMENDATIONS</h2></A>

<A NAME="pri"><h2>PRINCIPLES AND PRIORITIES FOR IRISH AID INVOLVEMENT IN EDUCATION</h2></A>
<p>
<h3>THE POLICY FRAMEWORK</h3>
<p>
1.   Education indicators should be a major consideration in selection of countries for Irish
Aid assistance.
<p>
2.   Country-specific strategies for Irish Aid involvement in education should be developed
for each priority country.
<p>
3.   The level of Irish bilateral educational aid should remain at or above one third of
bilateral aid expenditure, even in an expanding aid budget. Every effort should be made to
safeguard educational aid in the event of an overall decline in Irish bilateral aid.
<p>
4.   It is recommended that Irish Aid support for education be based on three principles
which are improvement in educational access and equity, improvement in the quality of
education and increase in host country capacity to plan and manage education.
<p>
<h3>ACCESS AND EQUITY ISSUES</h3>

5.   Irish Aid should continue to place emphasis on primary education, particularly in
assistance to the poor and to remote communities where access to education is limited.
<p>
6.   Irish Aid support for the provision of basic education should include support for
projects and programmes aimed at reaching those whom the formal system has failed.
Options include support for functional literacy, awareness raising and training for democracy
in addition to skills-based non-formal training.
<p>
7.   The guidelines for NGO co-financing should be changed to support this type of
training.
<p>
8.   Irish Aid should continue to address gender issues in education within mainstream
projects and programmes. 
<p>
9.   All Irish Aid supported education projects should be reviewed and appraised with the
aim of promoting greater access for females. Reporting on efforts and achievements in
relation to redressing gender imbalance should be mandatory for all education and training
projects. 
<p>
10.  There needs to be an active dialogue with national and local authorities in relation to
policy and practice with regard to girls' and women's education.
<p>
11.  Support to secondary education should be a country-specific priority for those priority
countries in which there is limited access.
<p>
12.  Irish Aid should seek to support ways of increasing access by disadvantaged groups,
including women, to higher education.  Cost-effective methods of delivering higher education
should be investigated and supported where possible.
<p>
13.  Support for technical education should be decided on a country-specific basis, taking
into account national and regional needs and demands.
<p>
14.  There is need for ongoing dialogue and debate on the proportion of Irish Aid by level
of education. This should respect country-specific needs but should also support development
of an Irish Aid position and targets by level of education which can then be monitored and
reviewed.
<p>
15.  Consideration should be given to the possibility of providing Irish Aid in the area of
educational provision for pre-school children, children with special needs and for
unaccompanied minors where situations have led to the exclusion of such children from
family and community support. 
<p>
16.  Consideration should be given to supporting research and pilot projects on alternative
delivery systems at all levels of education.
<p>
<h3>QUALITATIVE ISSUES</h3>

17.  Irish Aid should support pre-service and in-service teacher education programmes and
assist priority countries to explore innovative teacher training delivery systems for  primary
and secondary levels and for non-formal education. Other means of supporting teachers to
perform better, such as teacher centres and incentive schemes should also be considered.
<p>
18.  Consideration should be given to Irish Aid support for increasing the availability of
textbooks and other teaching materials at primary, secondary and non-formal education
levels. Given the costs of such measures, collaboration with other donors or support for
small-scale pilot projects feeding back to national level are recommended.
<p>
19.  Country-specific priorities and mechanisms for Irish Aid support to improved
management of education should be developed bearing in mind the twin goals of supporting
improved management at local level and better management at national level.
<p>
<h3>CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT & STRENGTHENING OF EDUCATION SYSTEMS</h3>

20.  Irish Aid to education should support the priorities of national governments.
<p>
21.  A comprehensive approach to capacity development in the education sector is required
involving provision of training, institutional development and support for development of a
favourable policy environment by, for example, supporting or organising conferences and
seminars on key issues in education.
<p>
22.  The time scale for such capacity building is more likely to be 10-15 than 5 years.
<p>

23.  Involvement of Irish institutions in capacity development for the education sector in
developing countries should be actively encouraged and their capacity to deliver should be
developed.
<p>
24.  A proportion of fellowships which directly support strengthening of the education
system should be prioritised. Additionally, local or regional centres of training and research
should be strengthened and used and part of the fellowship budget should be allocated for
local or regional training.
<p>

<A NAME="str"><h2>STRATEGIES AND MEASURES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A POLICY ON
EDUCATION</h2></A>

<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF IRISH AID POLICY ON EDUCATION</h3>

25.  IAAC and Irish Aid should initiate a process of further consultation on development
of Irish Aid policy on education. 
<p>
26.  Educational policy and interventions should be built on a body of research as well as
field experience. This research should be encouraged and supported by Irish Aid in local and
in Irish institutions. 
<p>
<h3>IRISH AID COORDINATION IN RELATION TO  EDUCATION</h3>

27.  The human resource implications of developing and implementing a policy on
education and of spending one third of budget on education need to be addressed.
<p>
28.  There needs to be a locus within Irish Aid for appraising projects in the education
sector, for exchange and dissemination of information on education, including between
multilateral and bilateral aid, and for facilitating and monitoring progress.
<p>
<h3>BILATERAL AND MULTILATERAL SUPPORT TO EDUCATION</h3>
<p>
29.  Irish Aid should seek to exert influence on multilaterals, especially the EU but also
the UN agencies, in relation to allocation to support for education. There should  be active
Irish Aid participation, in the current EU efforts to develop a policy on education and
training in developing countries and to coordinate member state activities in this field.
<p>
<h3>MEASURES AND INSTRUMENTS</h3>
<p>
30.  The implications of a more programme-focused and less project-located approach to
the development process in education needs to be explored to identify viable strategies for
Irish Aid.
<p>
31.  Where Irish Aid is involved at district or regional level there should be a mechanism
in place for feeding back the experience gained to educational policy development at the
national level.
<p>
32.  To respond to the demands of the new aid agenda, Irish Aid should initiate an on-
going dialogue and debate, in host countries and in Ireland, on educational policy
development and strategies for implementation. This needs to be an on-going rather than
once-off process.
<p>
33.  Inter-agency coordination, networking and collaboration should be actively supported
by Irish Aid within countries, regionally and globally.
<p>
34.  Structures and mechanisms for networking and collaboration between Irish Aid and 
NGOs involved in education should be supported.
<p>
35.  The shift away from concentration on long-term Irish TA towards use of short-term
highly skilled consultants should continue with greater use being made of host country skills
and expertise.
<p>
36.  There is a clear need to reconsider the implications of the APSO target of 2,000 by
1997 in terms of meeting the needs of the education sector in developing countries.
<p>
37.  There is need for formulation by APSO of a coherent policy on its support to the
education sector.
<p>
38.  There is need to debate how best to organise and implement Irish Aid support to
education and to develop a structure and strategy to optimise the involvement of all parties
in delivery of effective Irish Aid.
<p>
39.  There is need to develop better instruments for assessing, appraising, monitoring and
evaluating education projects and programmes supported by Irish Aid. 
<p>
40.  There should be regular monitoring and reporting of progress in relation to education
and a mechanism for rapid feedback and flow of information.
<p>
41.  There is need for more debate and scope for formulation of additional, more focused
policy-related papers on particular issues in education and training, relating for example, to
financing of recurrent costs, to involvement in the non-formal education sector, to assessing
the supply and demand aspects and impact of technical assistance, to the privatisation of
education, to application of policy in country-specific programmes, to development of
environmental education programmes and to determining structures for optimum delivery of
educational assistance.

<b>Telecommunications</a></b><br> 
<blockquote> 



The World Trade Organisation is meeting this week to hammer out an agreement aimed at  committing some 50 countries to open up their telecommunications markets to foreign investment. This month's package examines the implications for developing countries.<p>

Advocates of liberalisation say it will usher in a revolution in efficiency and telecommunications-access in developing countries. Critics fear domestic companies will be swamped by multinationals and that the poorest will continue to be left out of the Information Age. Panos explores the issue in <a href="tel1.html"><b>Telecoms Liberalisation - Bypassing the Poor</a></b>?<p>

A woefully inadequate telephone network is causing Ghana to privatise parts of its telecommunications industry. The process is threatened by a lack of transparency, consultation and  regulation, reports Aida Opoku-Mensah in Telecoms in <b><a href="tel2.html">Ghana - Privatisation Causes Concern</a></b>.<p>

After initial successes, the liberalisation of India's telecommunications industry is tainted with allegations of political corruption. There are signs it is floundering, but it may not be too late. As Mahesh Uppal reports in Do Your Homework - <a href="tel3.html"><b>Lesson from India's Liberalisation</b></a>, the government appears now to be addressing these problems.<p>

For some developing countries, the international accounting rate - the fee they earn every time they receive an international telephone call - is the main source of foreign exchange. But they have reason to worry, writes James Deane in <A href="tel4.html"><b>US to Slash Telecoms Payments to Developing Countries</a></b>.<p>
</blockquote>

<b>AIDS Feature</b><br>
Discrimination against people with HIV/AIDS is a human rights issue and a factor in the disease's spread. In Tanzania, the problem is compounded by inadequate legislation. Pudenciana Temba describes how the issue is being addressed by civil society in <a href="tanz.html"><b>Hopes for Tackling HIV/AIDS Discrimination in Tanzania</b></a>.<p>

<h2>Telecoms Liberalisation - Bypassing the Poor? </h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>								



Senior trade officials from around the world are meeting in Geneva to negotiate an agreement for liberalising basic telecommunication services. If agreement is reached, it will take effect from January 1, 1998.  If not, the talks will be shelved, probably until 2005. This is a summary of one of the issues examined in a Panos Briefing on telecommunications. <p>

Lusaka/London - Developing countries, who are being asked by the World Trade Organisation (WTO) to free up their basic telecommunications services, need to set up effective regulatory mechanisms if they wish to realise the long-cherished goal of universal service - or else it could all go horribly wrong, says a new report by <a href="#panos">Panos London.</a> <p>

Although a WTO agreement will be hailed by some as a major step in improving the telecommunications infrastructure on which most global trade depends, there already are worries that developing countries are being hurried into the global market without sufficient public debate on the implications of liberalising telecommunications.<p>

There are fears, for instance, that liberalisation will lead to telecommunications being developed for wealthy urban businesses, and not for the rural poor.<p> 

"Developing countries are rushing into legislation enabling liberalisation without thinking through the requirements for their people," says Edwin Hanamwinga, a senior Zambian telecommunications engineer. "Legislation will favour Western companies and systems and not the interests of the millions of poor people who have never made a phone call." <p>

Countries signing up to the agreement effectively promise to provide foreign companies full access to their telecommunications markets, and to treat them at par with domestic operators. Already, some 50 countries have offered to open up their markets or commit themselves not to reverse existing liberalisation policies. <p>
 
The talks also include the United States and the European Union's 15 countries, who together account for about 90 percent of the $500 billion-telecommunications industry worldwide.<p>

A key issue before developing countries is the future of universal service - the right to access affordable telecommunications services. <p>

Historically, telecommunications has been seen by many governments as a social good to be promoted at reasonable prices. So, government-owned telephone services have been subsidising the less profitable telephone services - such as those in poorer or rural areas - with profitable services such as international calls.<p>

There is little doubt that telecommunications can help improve living standards in developing countries. The benefits of good communications flow through all aspects of development. Whether it is health, education or food security, telecommunications offers many new opportunity.<p>

In agriculture, using telephones can help farmers get the best prices for their produce. A study in Sri Lanka shows that farmers who used to get no more than 50 or 60 percent of the selling-price for their goods, reached the 80- or 90-percent mark once a telephone line was installed in their village.  <p> 							
Such experiences have led advocates of liberalisation to point to the often dilapidated networks run by state-controlled monopolies in many developing countries.<p>
										
Certainly, the state of telecommunications in most developing countries is woeful. Worldwide, its distribution is unequal - while 80 percent of the world's population has no access to reliable telecommunications, just eight industrialised countries pack in three quarters of the world's telephone  lines.<p>

Africa, which accounts for 12 percent of the global population, has to make do with only 1.8 percent of the world's telephone lines. In Latin America four years ago, there were a total of eight million people in line for telephone connections, with an average waiting-period of more than three years. In some countries, the wait can be considerably longer - up to 21 years.<p>

'Teledensity' - the number of telephone lines per 100 people - averages just 1.5 telephone lines per 100 people in developing countries.  In countries like Afghanistan, Guinea, Liberia, Niger and Somalia,  there is just one telephone for every 500 people.  In Cambodia, Chad and Zaire, it comes down to a paltry one per every one thousand. And the telephones that do exist are concentrated in richer, urban areas. Some 80 percent of Kenyans, for instance, live in places that have no telephones.<p>

But critics maintain that while telecommunications may well become more efficient with liberalisation, it is hard to see telecoms operators reaching out to areas where there are little or no profits. Unfortunately, such areas - mostly villages and poorer parts of cities - are often the ones which also can benefit the most from telecommunications in terms of raised living standards.<p>

"The WTO deadline will push many African governments into cosy deals with multinational corporations," says David Lush, Information Co-ordinator of the Media Institute for Southern Africa (MISA). "This will further marginalise sections of their communities who in the information age need access to telecommunications. Therefore, it is imperative that NGOs and civil society groups have a say in the deregulation debate so that the interests of communities are represented."<p>

The Panos report says one model used by some countries is a universal service fund, into which telecommunications operators have to put a proportion of their profits. Such a fund is up and running in South Africa and could be introduced in Zambia as well.<p>

"The extent to which governments succeed in achieving progress toward wider social goals in the new liberalised environment will depend, above all else on the quality, effectiveness and transparency of the regulation of the telecoms," the report says.<p>

But it warns: "There are real concerns that if governments get it wrong on liberalisation, the effects could last for generations. If governments pay little attention to how they are to develop their networks through liberalisation, particularly to rural areas, they may never get another chance."<p>

<title>Panos: Telecoms in Ghana - Privatisation Causes Concern</title>

<h2>Telecoms in Ghana - Privatisation Causes Concern</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>




<b>By <a href="#aida">Aida Opoku-Mensah </a> <p>
								
								
						

Accra</b> - When an international company was allowed to operate the first cellular telephones in the Ghanaian capital of Accra in 1992, those  who could afford the service were overjoyed - with good reason.<p>

There are no telephones for those living in Accra's mushrooming suburbs. And Ghana's telephone density is among the lowest in the world, with a meagre 100,000 lines 'serving' a population of nearly 18 million. That means there are just over three telephone lines per 1000 people. <p>

Ghana is not alone in its telephonic misery. 'Teledensity' averages only 15 lines per 1000 people in developing countries. In contrast, three-quarters of the world's telephone lines are concentrated in only eight industrialised countries.<p>

One obvious sign of Ghana's insufficient telecommunications is that people still physically carry messages to each other simply because there are no telephone lines.<p>

"Before mobile telephones, transport was our only means of communicating with business associates," said Hajia Asata, a market trader in Kumasi, about 200 km north of Accra. "You went physically to enquire whether your goods had arrived and you kept travelling between Kumasi and Accra until the goods arrived. Transport costs were then added to the goods."<p>

That makes little business sense. The Accra-based National Board for Small-Scale Industries estimates that up to 50 percent of the working time in small firms is wasted running around in the absence of basic services such as phone, fax and telex. Inadequate telecommunications facilities not only affect the level of export but also discourage foreign investment.<p> 

Large companies, such as the Cocoa Board, who have more sophisticated requirements like datacommunications, have gone ahead and acquired their own closed communications networks for internal use. But private networks mean a substantial loss of income for Ghana Telecoms.<p>

"Even the government has become a victim of poor telephone services," complained one  government official. He claims a government decentralisation programme, aimed at distributing responsibility and local decision-making between the country's 10 regions and 110 districts, has suffered due to the lack of telephone lines.<p>

The government, in a bid to address the problem, launched a five-year programme in 1994 to restructure the industry through its Accelerated Development Programme 2000 (ADP 2000). The programme aims to increase the density of telephone services in the country while allowing the private sector to participate in some sectors of the industry.
<p>
One result is that Telkom Malaysia now owns 30 percent of Ghana Telecoms with full management control. And the US-based African Communications Group has been 
licensed to compete with the Ghana Telecom/Telkom Malaysia venture.<p>

But fears of a bias in favour of foreign investors have prompted calls for fair partnerships and for local interest groups to be consulted and involved.           			<p>

The  privatisation of Ghana Telecoms in particular is alleged to be a political decision - and not everyone is happy with it.  The aggrieved include the Communications Workers Union of Ghana, whose members say they were not consulted before or during the privatisation and hope there will be no massive job losses.<p>

So far, the deregulation and privatisation of the telecommunications industry has attracted  more foreign investors than local ones because the Ghanaian private sector is ill-equipped financially and technologically to compete in this field. <p>

This has given local businessmen a reason to grumble: they say that while foreign investors can bring in financial, technological and human resources, the government ought to be helping local investors play a part in the new telecommunications environment. <p>

That may be a legitimate demand, but without a telecommunications policy that aims at expanding the network to rural areas, all these measures may bring very little overall benefit to Ghana. <p>

The distribution of telephones in Ghana is highly skewed, almost entirely concentrated in urban areas. Slightly over 50 percent of all telephone subscribers in Ghana can be found in Accra. Yet, essential services like hospitals in towns and villages are poorly served. Rural telephony is almost non-existent, although 70 percent of Ghanaians live in villages. There are plans to install 100,000 new lines by 1998 but 95 percent of these will be in urban centres.<p>

Mary Amankwa,  a nurse in Accra, said: "In rural areas where I  have worked, I have seen how lives are easily lost because there are no telephones for medical attention."<p> 

There is also a lack of transparency. It is hard to come by information about whether there are any rules and regulations that have been contracted with the new operators, or whether these operations are in any way tied to the development of telecommunications in general and rural areas in particular.<p>

In addition, there are many technical faults with the privatisation programme, including the likelihood that some frequency bands may become saturated soon.<p>

These problems are linked to the fact that Ghana's liberalisation and privatisation have occurred before the establishment of a regulatory body. Such responsibilities at present are shared by the Ministry of Transport and Communication, Ghana Telecom and the Ghana Frequency Registration and Control Board. Not surprisingly, there is little regulation.<p>

If and when a single regulatory authority is set up, it will suffer from not being able to determine the relationship between the various operators from the word go and will face 
difficulties in bringing to book those operators who break the rules.<p>

<h2>Do Your Homework - Lesson from India's Telecoms Liberalisation</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>




<b>By <a href="#mahesh">Mahesh Uppal</a> <p>

                    
New Delhi</b> - India's telecommunications liberalisation - involving the largest auction of tenders anywhere - is floundering. But after three years of ad-hocism and fence-sitting amid charges of  corruption, the government appears to have settled down to do its homework.<p>

This may be the best chance yet for the Indian government to see some of the huge licence fees promised by prospective operators of basic telecommunications services. <p>

The liberalisation began with a bang - bids received in September 1995 in response to the government's first tenders were close to a staggering $30 billion. They covered all the 21 Circles into which the country's telecommunications operations are geographically divided. The Circles are graded A, B and C, with A being the most profitable.<p>

The first signs of a telecommunications revolution in India are there to see. The bustling bazaars in small towns and big cities are crammed with shops selling services like long- distance telephone and fax calls. <p>

The government set the ball rolling in 1994, when it announced a far-reaching, clear and ambitious telecommunications policy. It not only opened the field to private investment but also declared that every one of India's 570,000 villages would have a telephone line by 1997. So far, some 250,000 villages - just under 40 percent - have been connected with public telephones.<p> 

The government also promised to set up an independent regulatory authority soon.<p>

The policy's main aims are to reduce waiting lists for telephones, improve the dismal state of rural telecommunications and provide a world-class service at home and in the workplace. The money is to come from both the private and public sources.<p>

But things began to look murky soon after 1995's first round of auctions.<p>

There were huge differences between the bids for the A Circles and the less lucrative C Circles. An unknown company - an Indian-Israeli-Thai consortium called HFCL - accounted for almost a third of all the licence fees offered. It was no surprise when newspapers alleged the company was close to the then Minister of Telecommunications.<p>

The government then declared that all the bids - save five - were unacceptably low. Of the five bids - for a total of about $11.2 billion - four were from HFCL. Only one was for a C type Circle.  <p> 

New bids have been sought twice in 1996. Except in a couple of cases, the response has been cool - the amounts offered are only marginally higher than the minimum price. Half the circles - mostly  the poorer ones - have not attracted a single bid.<p> 

The policy implementation - some say the policy itself - is in a shambles.<p>

								

One of the main reasons for the mess is the way the policy has been presented to the country. Perhaps fearing controversy, the government has tabled the policy document in Parliament with little notice, and few debates have been held.<p> 											
Since its adoption, several major international players have voiced their concern - about the lack of a transparent regulatory regime;  the limit on the licences a company can retain; the one-sided terms offered to the new service providers (close to 70-80 percent of the revenue from each call was to go to the government's Department of Telecommunications); and the lack of price flexibility.<p>

The government response has been sympathy - and a series of  baffling and frustrating  moves. It has backtracked on some decisions and changed others, dithered long over the regulatory body and suddenly transferred the bureaucrat who fashioned the policy, fuelling rumours about differences at the top. To cap it, large sums of money from alleged kickbacks have been discovered at the home of the former Minister of Telecommunications.<p>

"There are two dimensions to the entire problem," Pramod Mahajan, a senior Member of Parliament from the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party, told journalists recently. "The first is the total lack of a clear policy on telecoms - the rules are constantly being changed along the way. The other dimension is corruption. The present crisis is a clear outcome of corruption in the ministry."<p>

Stung by domestic and international criticism, the government has recently taken several initiatives to speed up the entry of private players into the telecommunications sector.<p>

Some long-standing demands of would-be investors have now been met, including tax concessions and lower tariffs for connecting new networks to the existing one. And
an ordinance to set up the Telecoms Regulatory Authority of India was signed by the President in January. <p>

The process has been a learning exercise for all concerned - but most of all for India's policy makers, still new to liberalisation but aware of the potential the country offers to investors. <p> 

The main lesson from India is that the strategic nature of telecommunications requires it to be handled with political savvy as well as commercial sense. Inviting new players to compete with a government monopoly of over 100 years requires a bureaucracy that is well-versed in the intricacies of business, banking law and technology management - traditionally in short supply in governments anywhere. <p>

The state of  telecommunications in India reflects decision-making processes in many  countries. Where there is political patronage, there is also a reluctance to set up credible regulatory bodies that can reduce the scope for arbitrary action.<p>

<title>Panos: US to Slash Telecoms Payments to Developing Countries</title>

<h2>US to Slash Telecoms Payments to Developing Countries</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>




<b>By <a href="#james">James Deane</a> <p>

LONDON</b> -  In a move that could cost developing countries billions of dollars in foreign exchange, the United States government has said it will withdraw from the global system allocating telecommunications revenue.<p>

The international system for dividing up revenue from telephone calls is known as the 'international accounting rate.' Every time anyone makes a call to another country, the originating telephone company must pay the destination-country a fee for completing the call. For some developing countries, these incoming calls are their single largest source of foreign exchange.<p>

"We are bent on reforming the international accounting rates system," Reed E. Hunt, Chairman of the US government Federal Communications Commission (FCC), said last December, promising to make changes early in 1997. <p>

The system, claims Hunt, is an "ancient, outmoded, pro-monopoly system of settlement payments between countries that has propped up overly-high charges to consumers for international calls and led to a huge outflow of money from the US to foreign countries."<p>  

The US has been pressing for years for changes to the system.  Washington claims that in 1995 its companies paid $5.5 billion to foreign companies for completing telephone calls - $4 billion more than they received from foreign companies. One study suggests that US telephone company payments for international calls to other countries equalled 35 percent of the entire US foreign aid budget annually in the early 1990s.<p>

Opposition from developing countries is likely to be fierce.  For many, the system provides one of the few sources of foreign exchange which operators can draw on to modernise their telecommunications systems. And developing countries often pay disproportionately high prices for equipment purchased from Western manufacturers.<p>

The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the United Nations body which fixes and oversees accounting rates, has been seeking a compromise between the US and developing countries.<p>

Around 25 percent of all international calls are made from the US. However, Tim Kelly, the ITU's Head of Operations Analysis, says that US carriers have a huge advantage. "In 99.9 percent of their bilateral relations, they pay out rather than receive and are thus able to withhold payments."<p>
					
The US move has disappointed the ITU. According to Kelly, the US attitude can be summed up as 'We [the US] have calculated what accounting rates ought to be and now we're going to impose them on the rest of the world.'   The success of this approach depends on "how big a stick the United States has," Kelly said recently.<p>					

The ITU argues that the current system does not deliver assistance to those who need it most - only 3.9 percent of US settlements go to Africa for instance.<p>

Some critics say the big outflow of telecoms revenues from the US is not because of the actions of other countries, but those of US companies. 
In particular, they cite the 'call-back' services started by a number of US companies. This system enables subscribers in foreign countries to make international calls - from Manila to New York City for example - which will then be charged to their accounts in the US at the US rate or below. However, the US will still have to pay completion charges to (in this case) the Malaysian operator for what  is effectively a US call.<p>

This, charges Maev Sullivan, an independent telecommunications consultant, is a practise that would be described as dumping if it had been employed in another industry by another country. <p>

Sullivan points out that there are countries such as Hong Kong, who have higher per capita outpayment rates than the US and that, "the sheer size of the US population results in a comparatively low level of international traffic on a per capita basis."<p>

Prof. Jill Hills, director of the International Institute of Telecoms Regulators in London, says that historically, the US has refused to be regulated by the ITU and when not able to get its own way, has resorted to "internationalising its domestic law."<p>

"The FCC's threat follows this tradition," Hill says. "One has to remember that although the US is complaining about payments, its companies are active in call back services - and that increases the US deficit."<p>

Some analysts expect African countries which rely the most on foreign exchange from international calls to be the hardest hit. It is these countries which also have the weakest  bargaining power in international negotiations.<p>

Cezley I Sampson, Director of the Mona Institute of Business, University of West Indies, maintains that traffic flow accounts, in any case, do not tell the full story of the overall balance of payments position in telecommunications.<p> 

"Developing countries operate huge negative imbalances with the US for telecommunications equipment, materials, software and consultancy services," he argues. "Developing countries must, however, adjust to the reality that the market forces and technology development which have been unleashed will continue to result in further progressive decline in accounting rates."<p>

<h2>Hopes for Tackling HIV/AIDS Discrimination in Tanzania</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>




<b>By Pudenciana Temba</a> <p>
									
 

Dar es Salaam </b>- Tackling AIDS discrimination has moved a notch up in Tanzania's health and human rights agenda.<p>

A group of top lawyers, policy makers and doctors last month agreed to target those found guilty of abusing the human rights of  people with HIV/AIDS. And last summer the government announced plans to ban AIDS-discrimination. <p> 

HIV threatens the human rights and dignity of millions of people worldwide. Until now most governments in East Africa, the region most seriously affected by the disease, have concentrated on policies designed to prevent the spread of the virus. These include condom promotion and information campaigns. Increasingly, however, protection of the human rights of people with HIV/AIDS has been seen as a key element in AIDS prevention. Experts say discrimination only pushes people with HIV/AIDS underground and encourages its spread.<p>

In Tanzania, there had been few formal moves to address human rights abuses against people with HIV, save last summer's announcement. But if the outcome of a recent workshop in Dar es Salaam is any indication, things could change for the better.<p>

For a start, policy makers in Tanzania are being criticised by rights activists for being slow to recognise human rights abuses against people with HIV. <p>

"No cases have been brought to court, few articles have been written and many nongovernmental organisations (NGOs) say they do not have the capacity to deal with the problem and no special programmes had been developed to help them," says Ann Strode, a human rights lawyer working for the United Nations to help Tanzania implement its new anti-discrimination policy.<p>

The workshop on Law Ethics and Human rights and HIV/AIDS provided a forum for views on implementation with doctors, magistrates, policy makers and people living with HIV participating.<p>

The workshop comes out of a UN initiative that has been followed in many developing countries. In 1992, the UN Development Programme (UNDP), responding to reports of widespread discrimination against people with HIV, began to encourage countries in sub-Saharan Africa to establish regional networks on ethics, law and HIV. <p>

Made up of doctors, lawyers, NGOs and others, the networks aim to influence existing legislation and develop new policies to protect the rights of people with HIV and those particularly vulnerable to infection, such as women, migrant labourers and prisoners.<p>  

Tanzania is the fifteenth country to establish such a network - the workshop was organised by the network. Others countries include Uganda, Kenya, South Africa, Senegal and Cote d'Ivoire. <p>

Tanzania is among the countries most seriously affected  by HIV.  About 400,000 of its 27 million people have developed AIDS and 1.2 million are thought to be HIV-positive, according to the World Health Organisation.					more....
									<p>

The number of infected people is expected to double by the year 2000. Poverty, gender inequality and sexually transmitted diseases are believed to contribute to the spread of HIV in Tanzania.<p>

Few formal studies of discrimination against people with HIV have been conducted in Tanzania, but the workshop heard testimonies from six people which illustrated how those infected must bear not only the burden of the disease but also discrimination.<p>

Some had lost their jobs; a widow whose husband died of AIDS had been prevented from inheriting his property; a man told of being tested for HIV without his consent; and another was denied insurance. Most described being rejected by their immediate communities.  <p>

Even medical professionals discriminate against patients with HIV, according to Dr Yohana Mashalla from the Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences.  Some doctors disclose information about patients without patient-consent. Others refuse adequate treatment.<p>

A study in Tanzania and Kenya revealed that some nurses had a negative attitude toward the duty to care for patients with AIDS, Mashalla said.<p>

The workshop heard how discrimination against people with HIV in Tanzania was not only a social problem, but was also rooted in laws not designed to address AIDS issues. Guidelines on testing, control and management of HIV, issued by the Ministry of Health in 1989 and based on international norms, had failed to protect the rights of infected people.<p>

A number of laws, including the Criminal Procedures Act 1985, require doctors to tender medical reports before the courts, exposing people with HIV to discrimination, particularly in prisons.  <p>

Labour laws permit organisations with in-house medical facilities to force employees to undergo HIV testing.  Those found positive are sent home or sacked - so they lose access to medical care as well as employment.<p>

Under the country's Evidence Act, rape victims are required to provide an excessive burden of proof which, according to legal experts, violates their privacy, particularly if there is a question of HIV transmission. <p>

At the workshop, participants recommended a review of the national AIDS policy and changes in the law. There were strong calls for a ban on HIV-testing by employers, and for police officers and prison wardens to be trained on the legal aspects of HIV/AIDS.<p>  

Legal support services for people with HIV facing discrimination are also needed. And a computer database will now be used to monitor rights abuses of people with HIV/AIDS in Tanzania.<p> 

How well the new national networks succeed remains to be seen.  All existing networks will have to present evaluations of their work to the UNDP at a conference in Cote d'Ivoire in May. Observers hope that progress in Tanzania will be swift.<h4><p>

<HR>
<H1>From this month's editor</H1>
<BR>
<BR>
You've got to write a really international editor's letter in an issue about
nationalism, my colleagues told me. Remember that our readers are Canadian,
Australian, Indian, Kenyan, American...  <BR>
<BR>
Well I tried. I tried comparing the passions roused by sport to those of
nationalism. No good - too Brit. I went home and wrote about the struggles
I have had with my own Anglo-Dutch identity. They wouldn't like that either
- too European. And the one about the Scottish woman I interviewed
about Scottish nationalism in Glasgow; well, it was just too - Scottish.
<BR>
<BR>
I just can't do it. As soon as I start writing personally about anything
to do with national identity it comes back to Europe, which is where I come
from. <BR>
<BR>



Which is probably also why the many fascinating books I have read on the
subject during the course of my research were all abstract, academic -
and in the third person.
 They were also almost all by men, which confirms
my theories about the links between nationalism and war and my prejudices
about boys and war toys. <BR>

But I enjoyed commissioning this magazine: so many people felt strongly
about their own national identity, and each story and each context shed
a different light on the whole. I felt confirmed in my suspicions that this
was one of the most important issues facing our world today. I was spell-bound
by Ikaweba Bunting's vision of an Africa without boundaries. It was good
to have extensive if expensive telephone conversations about feminism and
nationalism with Urvashi Butalia in India (see page 26) and equally fascinating
discussions with Maggie Murray of Format Photographers who helped me to
cook up the idea for the front cover over a delicious Japanese lunch.<BR>
<BR>
Having ideas on nationalism is one thing - and everyone seems to have
them, from our Pakistani neighbour to John Major, 'our' Prime Minister (there,
I've gone and done it again) - but writing about it personally is quite
another. This is especially true if you not only see yourself as an internationalist
(as I do), but are writing on supremely international issues (what could
be more international than nation-states?) and what is more, work for the
<I>New Internationalist</I>.<BR>
<BR>
So sorry, folks. I've failed you all. An internationalist keynote? OK. An
internationalist editor's letter? Forget it.<BR>

This page gives brief information about relevant Save the Children projects which may be of interest. </i><p><hr><p><h3>Tajikistan in Central Asia - helping women who head the household.</h3>Civil war in Tajikistan in 1992 and 1993 has left some villages in which there are virtually no men. Households are headed by women who are caring for families while coping with the stress and trauma they suffered as a result of the fighting. Save the Children is working with households in the Khotlan region to help them become more self sufficient. The charity is giving the most vulnerable families items like sewing machines, fruit trees and livestock so that they can re build their lives and improve their family incomes. It's also helping community groups develop so that women can work together to deal with their shared problems of security and access to basic supplies. <p><h3>Mali in West Africa - credit scheme means women can boost family incomes.</h3>In the village of Attara a Save the Children credit scheme has helped women get involved in small scale trading and so improve their families' incomes. The women were effectively excluded from the formal banking system which is biased against small loans and against illiterate clients. Now women are lent small amounts of money. As one member of each group repays the money, another is given a loan. A staff member from Save the Children visits the village every week to keep an eye on progress and collect re payments. She has also lead a literacy course so that the women involved could keep records of their accounts. The Attara project has been so successful that Save the Children is setting up other women's credit schemes in Mali. NB: Save the Children also operates or supports credit schemes aimed at women in Vietnam and Pakistan.<p><h3>Pakistan - helping girls get an education. </h3>If you're a girl in the Thar desert area of Pakistan you're unlikely to go to school. Girls made up less than 10 percent of the primary school population last time statistics were collected (1999 to 1991). Save the Children's Tharparkar Rural Development Programme is working to give more girls access to the education they need. The programme has set up 13 primary schools in remote villages. That means nearly 300 more female pupils in areas in which, before now, girls had no chance of schooling. Save the Children is also working to increase the number of female teachers, supporting girls to help them finish their secondary education and reach the standards needed for teaching. <p>NB: In Tilonia in Rajasthan, India Save the Children supports "shepherd schools" providing education at night for children who look after livestock during the day. The vast majority of the pupils are girls.<p><h3>Cambodia - training midwives to meet the needs of mothers. </h3>After the Pol Pot years, there were few trained nurses or midwives in Cambodia. Save the Children is helping remedy the situation by providing help and funding for the Cambodian Midwives Association. The idea is to improve midwifery standards and so help improve the long term health and welfare of mothers and children. Save the Children is also taking part in a major survey looking at maternal mortality (mothers dying because of complications in pregnancy or delivery) and knowledge of birth spacing. Local midwives in Phnom Penh and the ten rural provinces will carry out the work.<p><h3>Rosemount in Glasgow - training and support helps women out of poverty.</h3>The Royston area of Glasgow is one of the poorest communities in Europe. Here, Save the Children's Rosemount project works to give local women the chance to find their way out of the poverty trap. The project provides courses in computing and childcare. Mothers are able to take part because Rosemount offers day care and out- of-school provision for their children at the same time. The courses not only five women skills to improve their chances of taking up employment or further education, but also help them regain their self-confidence.<p>NB: Save the Children provides or helps provide training for women at other UK projects too.<p><h3>Hopscotch in London - a welcoming centre for isolated Asian women and girls.</h3>In the Somerstown area of north London, Save the Children is helping Bengali women adapt to live in a new country. The Hopscotch Asian Women's centre provides advice on housing, health and schools and classes in subjects like English and health care. Hopscotch's practical help is valuable. But equally important is its welcoming atmosphere, helping women who are often isolated and afraid make new friends and gain more confidence. <p><hr><i>If you would like more information about these or other Save the Children projects, please contact the Save the Children press office on 0171 703 5400</i><hr>©Copyright: Save the Children 26th August 1995<hr><p><table border=6><tr><td><b><a href="index.html">Save the Children Home Page</a></b></td></table><hr></body></html>

<A NAME="1"><hr><H3>1. Introduction</H3></A>The policy context within which this discussion
paper should be read is the Irish Aid Strategy Plan of 1993. Irish
Aid: Consolidation and Growth: A Strategy Plan and the 1996 White
Paper: Challenges and Opportunities Abroad.  Concepts such as
poverty alleviation, partnership, participation, sustainability,
gender sensitivity, environmental concerns therefore form the
basis of its policy orientation.  Within that contextual background,
the paper raises some of the key issues around the development
and implementation of area-based projects/programmes (hereafter
referred to as area-based programmes).  Area-based programmes
form the core of Irish Aid Bilateral Assistance in the rural areas
of Priority Countries.  In the context of an expanding aid programme,
support to area-based development is likely to increase.
<p>
This paper
is not intended to be exhaustive and remains at the level of broad
principles rather than detailed analysis of the designing and
implementation of such programmes. It is also at a level of generality
which implies that, although experiences from some of the current
area-based programmes have been incorporated, there will be country
specific considerations which cannot be noted. Country specific
experiences and reactions should if possible be exchanged and
circulated for discussion. Nonetheless it is hoped that the paper
will add to the debate on a development &quot;approach&quot; which,
because of its central position in Irish Aid development assistance,
needs conceptual clarity to ensure its effectiveness in contributing
to poverty-reduction.
<p>
<A NAME="2"><hr><H3>2. Why area-based programmes ?</H3></A>
The bulk of Irish Aid's spending on the Country Programmes is channelled into
area-based programmes for example, Kilosa and Ulanga Districts
in Tanzania, Northern Province in Zambia, the Sidama and Tigray
programmes in Ethiopia and the Kibaale District programme in Uganda.
 There are many other ways of providing development assistance
but area-based programmes are a logical approach for a relatively
small aid donor such as Ireland.
<p>
Poverty and underdevelopment are
multi-dimensional problems. For instance if a community or region
lack basic education and health facilities, they are also likely
to suffer from the lack of other facilities such as clean water,
sanitation, employment, shelter, roads and infrastructure. There
is little value in piecemeal interventions in such an environment
where perhaps one brings about significant improvements in school
facilities when the health, poverty and infrastructure needs of
the same people are ignored. The value of the area based programme
is that it can, over a period of time, address the broad social
and environmental concerns which have brought about, or contributed
to, the state of underdevelopment of the region or community.
This broader approach also offers the prospect of some synergy
between the various sectors.
<p>
A focus on a specific area can bring
visible and measurable impacts. Measurable impacts which can be
readily quantified are items like schools built, water supplies
provided, or roads constructed. Much of the projects impact will
be in the area of non-quantifiable effects such as capacity building
through training. The improved capacity of the people who are
trained will be visible but this improved performance is not readily
measurable.The benefits from such an approach include the following:
<ul>
<li>area-based programmes can address the needs of poor people directly,
and therefore are a means of maintaining the poverty focus of
Ireland's development assistance. There is a general consensus
that this poverty-focus is important.  It is not, of course, unique
to area-based initiatives.
<p>
<li>area-based programmes offer the opportunity to maximise Irish
Aid investment by facilitating coordination of inputs across the
sector and by promoting synergy between the various sectors.
<p>
<li>area-based programmes involve working with communities towards
ensuring the provision of basic needs.  Ireland can be said to
have some &quot;comparative advantage&quot; in this kind of work, partly as a result of the experience gained
by many Irish women and men working in NGOs
<p>
<li> other development assistance objectives, such as institution-building,
capacity-building, gender equality and environmental and financial
sustainability, can be met in a well-designed and well-implemented
area-based programme.
<p>
<li>a focus in a specific area means that Ireland's development
assistance can have a visible and measurable impact which might
not be observable if aid was given at the national level
</ul><p>

When focusing on the development of a specific geographical area
it must be borne in mind that no area-based programme can be successful
in an unsupportive policy environment. There is therefore a need
for donors like Irish Aid to look beyond a certain area or district
to the regional and national policy arenas. Complementary &quot;influencing&quot;
activities to those within an area-based programme may be essential
to the success of the development programme.
<p>
<A NAME="3"><hr><H3>3. The content of area-based programmes</h3></a>
This is perhaps the most important issue:
 what should be the content of area-based programmes?  In the
past, in the heyday of Integrated Rural Development Programmes
(IRDPs), there was a tendency for aid donors to select &quot;their&quot;
area and lavish resources on it often without any specific poverty
focus or prioritisation between sectors.  In many cases such IRDPs
were implemented through parallel project structures because the
donor doubted the implementation capacity of the recipient government.
 Criticisms of IRDPs centred around their vagueness and complexity
due to donors attempting to work in many sectors  simultaneously;
the failure to bring about cooperation between different line
ministries; and the lack of understanding of complex socio-cultural
realities in project design.
<p>
In moving away from IRDPs, some donors
have either switched to a preference for projects addressing a
single sector, or opted for providing more support at the national
level, particularly in the context of structural adjustment programmes.
Irish Aid has not taken these approaches and has instead emphasised
area-based programmes.
<p>
<center><table border=2 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center>Do area-based programmes differ from IRDPs? In what way should
the good practice of area-based programmes differ from the practice
of IRDPs?</center><p>
<ul>
<li>area-based programmes should have a more explicit poverty-focus:
the beneficiaries of these programmes should primarily be the
poor
<p>
<li>area-based programmes should generally be limited to fewer sectors
than IRDPs, or at least limited to adopting an approach of sequential
development rather than simultaneous operation in many sectors.
 Again, the priority sectors should be those which are most relevant
to a strategy of poverty eradication
<p>
<li>area-based programmes should be designed in close consultation
with local people, particularly the poor, and with local representatives,
using techniques such as Participatory Rural Appraisal
<p>
<li>area-based programmes should be implemented in partnership with
the relevant local government authorities (no parallel structures),
and priority should be given to facilitating cooperation between
line ministry officials.<p>
</table></center>
<p>
In practice, however, area-based programmes may not necessarily
be limited to fewer sectors than IRDPs. The Ethiopian experience
shows that it is perfectly feasible to operate in three major
sectors simultaneously (such as Health, Education, Agriculture).
Since poverty has many interrelated strands, a simultaneous, instead
of a sequential approach was also favoured in the Kilosa programme
in Tanzania. In this case, five core projects in the areas of
education, rural transport infrastructure, health, environment
and rural economic development were seen as the crucial components
in tackling poverty in the Kilosa District. All support activities
which help to create an &quot;enabling environment&quot; to allow
the core projects to prosper (such as management services/administration
and capacity building) were grouped under a sixth component, under
the heading of  Programme Planning and Management.
<p>
 The limiting
factor is often the capacity of local administration to absorb
the inputs and to effectively manage and implement the programme.
There is usually a learning curve and it is generally a good idea
to launch projects on a gradual basis. It may be best to begin
with those that are less complex in social terms (e.g. health)
and expand later into more complex ones (e.g. the directly productive
sectors). Whatever the sectoral concentration, it will normally
be desirable to support capacity-building measures (especially
training) across the board within local administration, including
the parts of the administration concerned with raising revenue.
<p>
If
it is accepted that Irish Aid's area-based programmes should be
poverty-focused, design and implementation questions must be tackled.
 Does a poverty focus mean concentration on meeting basic needs?
 The Strategy Plan document suggests that this must indeed be
the priority: &quot;Within Irish Aid's country programmes the
aim will be to maintain a high level of expenditure on meeting
such basic needs as clean water supply, health care, and primary
education&quot;.  Irish Aid: Consolidation and Growth: A Strategy
Plan pg12. (3.2).  An earlier sentence in the paragraph reads
&quot; This assistance is designed to meet basic needs, particularly
of the more disadvantaged sections of the population, and to contribute
to long term economic and social development&quot;.
<p>
Such priorities
are reflected in actual expenditure in area-based programmes such
as the Northern Province programme in Zambia and the two programmes
in Ethiopia. Of course, support to basic needs does not imply
a restriction to the social sectors: basic level interventions
in the productive sectors can also play a central part in a poverty-focused
programme for example savings and credit schemes for women. It
is true that investments in health care and primary education
are now recognised as being crucial long-term investments in human
capital with high rates of return, and investments in water supply
have important productive benefits, particularly for women, in
reducing the time spent collecting water and thereby releasing
this time for other use.  These investments are therefore important
and do contribute to long term development.
<p>
The question is (without
going back down the IRDP route), are there other dimensions of
poverty which can also be effectively addressed within area-based
programmes?  One suggestion is to take the approach of designing
integrated livelihood security programmes. This is based on an
approach designed to empower people by focusing on the poor where
the emphasis is both on social sectors and on direct livelihood-enhancing
activities.  Such programmes address the issues of poverty and
food security through a combination of economic and social activities.
The need to move towards integrated livelihood security programmes
is being substantiated by experiences in Irish Aid's current programmes.
For example the Ugandan office envisages a much greater concentration
by Irish Aid on livelihood enhancement activities once the general
uplifting of the Kibaale district apparatus has been addressed.
The 1995 Kilosa Review in Tanzania recommended that in order to
strengthen the community's resource base, the programme should
strengthen its role in agriculture and other income generating
projects.
<p>
What might the income generating activities be?  That
depends on the particular socio-economic structure of the area.
 If the vast majority of the poor are small farmers, then economic
activities must focus on increasing the productivity of agriculture,
perhaps as much through resource-conservation measures as through
technical innovations.  If the society is characterised by the
existence of relatively well-off farmers but a large number of
poor landless people, the emphasis will need to be on supporting
landless people in identifying other income-earning activities,
perhaps both short-term, through works activities, and long-term,
for example, through credit programmes. If there is an opening
for small enterprises, funding for self-managed 'borrow and repay
schemes' has proved effective and has the additional advantage
of fostering self-reliance.
<p>
However income enhancement is not enough;
there is also a need for income- and wealth-protection, (in other
words, livelihood security measures) to prevent destitution of
poor people during lean periods of specific episodes of income
loss (eg. a drought).  Such security measures could include building
up an emergency fund on a group basis, or developing seed banks
as is part of the Sidama programme in Ethiopia. The issue of livelihood
security measures  was also raised in the 1995 Kilosa review where
it was recommended that Irish Aid should develop an explicit target-orientated
poverty alleviation focus, based upon economic regeneration and
safety nets for the severely disadvantaged.
<p>
The development of
these specific measures puts a premium on having a good prior
understanding of the causes, dimensions and timing cycles of poverty.
 This analysis can be effectively achieved by carrying out participatory
appraisals particularly with poor people themselves.  Such appraisals
should not, however, be limited to gaining an understanding of
current realities leading to the design of programmes removed
from the intended beneficiaries. The dialogue with poor people
- and other local actors, particularly local government structures
- needs to be continuous and to feed into the implementation of
the programme.
<p>
Poverty is not however confined to the economic
arena.  Poor people also endure powerlessness.  Thus, the approach
of an area-based programme should be one that specifically identifies
not only the problems of the poor, but also their strengths, and
seeks to strengthen and build upon them. This implies that design
of a programme include small inputs within the capacity of those
with little capability in conventional economic terms.
<p>
<A NAME="4"><hr><H3>4. Process vs Blueprint</h3></a>

The discussion above implies a &quot;process&quot;
rather than a &quot;blueprint&quot; approach emphasis in the development
and implementation of area-based programmes.  In a process approach,
the precise activities are developed through participatory approaches.
 Flexibility is maintained so that new activities can be introduced
according to locally identified priorities.  The possibility that
mistakes may be made is accepted, but any such mistakes are then
learned from and the programme adjusted accordingly.  In a blueprint
approach, the activities to be supported are identified from the
start and the programme continues in a relatively fixed way, generally
with few attempts to involve or learn from beneficiaries.
<p>
The process
approach should not be mistaken for ad-hocery.  The overall philosophy
of the programme will be laid down at the start, ie. the commitment
to poverty reduction, gender equality, and to participatory approaches.
 But the precise activities, or sub-projects to be supported,
will be developed progressively.
<p>
The process approach demands some
flexibility in terms of donor approval procedures, and some imagination
in terms of the development of appropriate forms of planning,
design, monitoring and evaluation, since quantitative targets
cannot all be specified prior to implementation of the programme.
 But as a development process, it is a desirable approach. The
majority of Irish Aid's area-based programmes are adopting the
process approach. The approach used by the Kilosa Programme could
be described as a of combination &quot;process&quot; and &quot;blueprint&quot;.
The programme is flexible and has evolved significantly in recent
years after having incorporated lessons learnt from earlier mistakes.
Experience from the current area-based programmes suggests that
when using the process approach due account must be given to impact
assessment. The criteria of assessment should be carefully developed
in a participative manner and agreed in advance by all those involved.
<p>
The
process approach also lends itself more readily to what Robert
Chambers calls an &quot;opportunity-orientation&quot; as opposed
to, a &quot;problem-orientation&quot; approach.  As Chambers says,
problems present themselves, but opportunities have to be sought
out.  A process and a participatory approach facilitates poor
people in developing their own livelihood opportunities. These
opportunities will often turn out to be more diverse than any
outside &quot;expert&quot; could expect to identify on the basis
of conventional project design approaches. An opportunity orientation,
however, will not exclude problem orientation when appropriate.
The current efforts in the Ethiopian programme apart from the
savings and credit scheme and capacity-building elements are necessarily
problem orientated because the interventions are at an extremely
basic level and the problems to be addressed are so clear cut
and extensive that one has not yet had to look to the environment
to see what opportunities exist. Nevertheless in dealing with
the problems presented by the community, the programme is automatically
looking for the opportunity within that community as to how best
address its needs. The problem orientation need not be a contradiction
of the opportunity orientation; rather it appears to be its converse.
Sometimes there will be a solid move from problem orientation
to opportunity orientation as, for example, has been reported
 from Uganda.
<p>
<H4>Flexibility</H4>
It is normally desirable, for a number
of reasons, to have some flexibility in the programme design.
 The basic objectives (e.g. improved quality of life of a specified
target population, implementation through local structures, low
intensity of intervention to facilitate sustainability, etc.)
can and should be fixed at the outset.  However, it is undesirable
to confine the operational detail in the strait-jacket of a blueprint
&quot;grand design&quot;.  One strategy may be to have a programme
area that encompasses a number of distinct local authorities (e.g.
sub-districts), thereby having the flexibility to expand more
in some parts of the area than in others if attitudinal problems
are encountered in some areas but not in others.   The same applies
to different sectors that are the responsibility of different
ministries.  For similar reasons, it may be desirable to have
more than one area-based project in a given country.  The hope,
of course, is that the possibility of changing from one district
to another will have a salutary effect, and that it will never
be necessary to exercise that option.  The important thing is
that the approach (including flexibility between areas and sectors,
the expectations as regards the role of the local administration
and the criteria for assessing programme effectiveness) should
be fully clear to all concerned at the outset.
<p>
There may be continuing
tension between the donors need for a clearly planned programme
over several years and the changing priorities and needs of the
community which the donor is trying to serve. The capacity to
respond flexibly to the needs of the community should take precedence
over any preconceived notions which the donor may consider a priority.
Flexibility may also be required to respond to major changes to
the general environment e.g. radical change in government policy
or in the general economic situation of the country.
<p>
<H4>Integration</H4>
This
is a slightly difficult concept, as there are different kinds
of integration. The analysis underlying the approach to an area-based
project must be integrated, in the sense that all factors relevant
to the proposed intervention must be taken into account. The donor
intervention should fit coherently into the environment in which
it exists.  This may sometimes mean that, viewed in isolation,
the donor intervention may appear somewhat unbalanced.  However,
this may not pose any problem provided that all interventions
(by Government and other donors) form a coherent whole. The analysis
should provide an intervention framework that can enable the donor
to add additional programme components at a later stage without
doing damage to the coherence of the overall situation.  The intervention
framework would itself, of course, have to be revised from time
to time to take account of changing circumstances.
<p>
At the level
of implementation, the individual programme components should
be organised so as to be capable of being integrated within the
local structures.  It is not recommended practice to design a
programme component that straddles the areas of responsibility
of two or more Ministries, as such a component could not be absorbed
by any one of the Ministries concerned. In addition there is an
important distinction to be made between de jure and de facto
integration of aid-supported activities with local structures.
 Formal integration with local structures may not mean much if
the aid agency, in effect, transforms part of the administration
by providing an excessively high level of resources to that particular
part of the administration. In such a case, the aid agency has,
in effect, &quot;colonised&quot; part of the administration and
the programme can no longer be considered to be properly integrated
with local structures.
<p>
<H4>Implementation through Local Official Structures</H4>
The
problems associated with parallel structures are so well known
as to need no repetition. Implementation through local structures
is, therefore, obviously important in terms of sustainability.
To the extent that the capacity of the local structures is limited
it is desirable to be patient as regards programme objectives.
 It is very important to resist the temptation to assign expatriates
to take on functions that are proper to local institutional staff.
It may be useful to have a programme support team (preferably
local as far as possible) standing back somewhat from the management
activities (preferably not based in the programme area) to provide
encouragement, supervision and to assist in capacity-building.
 But the local structures must be allowed the space to develop.
<p>
The
management of the donor-supported activities also needs to be
approached carefully. On the one hand, it must be possible for
the donor to monitor and supervise so as to be able to satisfy
requirements related to accountability and implementation.  On
the other hand, an integrated management system for the donor-supported
activities is to be avoided, as this could easily militate against
local absorption of the activities. The aim is that the activities
should be organised on the basis of individual programme components
that can be fully absorbed by local structures from the outset,
but in a manner that permits the donor to monitor and supervise
to a standard that meets its particular needs.
<p>
Local NGOs also
merit support but they normally can play only a secondary role
in the case of area-based programmes supported under bilateral
aid arrangements. However, there is a view that the enhancement
of a partnership between local administrations and local NGOs
and less formal groupings of poor people is a desirable element
in aid activities aimed at the poorest of the poor.
<p>
<H4>Phasing of Implementation</H4>
It may be sensible to start with a phase that focuses
strongly on studies, surveys, feasibility studies, pilot projects
and (in some circumstances) reconstruction and rehabilitation
activities.  This serves various purposes, including the drawing-up
of baseline data against which impact assessments may later be
made.  It will also ensure that subsequent phases are better planned
than would be the case if detailed, long-term, inflexible plans
were drawn up at the outset.
<p>
<H4>Programme Duration</H4>
If  full and true
participation is envisioned then one must be realistic about the
time-frame involved. Progress may be slower than expected but
&quot;ownership&quot; by the recipients is vital for sustainability.
Area-based programmes do require a long-term commitment but this
should not be open-ended. Realistic monitoring of progress is
important and should preferably be done by the local participants.
An open-ended approach could lead to the expectation of continuation
after the initial goals have been achieved and indeed a temptation
to continue to a further phase without adequate evaluation of
other potentially competing projects.
<p>
<H4>Relationship with Host Authorities and Communities</H4>
Local involvement requires giving time-consuming
priority to the meeting of minds.  It is essential that local
people feel that their needs are being addressed, not just studied.
Understanding local patterns of organisation and being sensitive
to the perceived needs of the poor people of the area are very
important. Sometimes donor personnel can be the catalysts in initiating
cooperation between local government institutions, local NGO's
and local &quot;organisations&quot;. This latter type of organisation
may be very informal and unlike the usual organisations the donor
is accustomed to dealing with.
<p>
The quality of the relationship
with host authorities is all-important.  It is essential to get
started on the right footing i.e. when selecting the location.
Donors are inevitably asked to assume extra responsibilities by
local communities and authorities in a resource starved environment.
 It is vital that the two sides should understand each other fully
and that donors be clear about the sectors in which they will
become involved in order to avoid the creation of unrealistic
expectations. Partnership does not mean that unreasonable demands
of local authorities have to be met. Refusal of unreasonable demands
should not cause a crisis provided there was a good basis to the
relationship at the outset

<A NAME="5"><hr><H3>5. Institutional-development and capacity-building
-for whom?</h3></a>
The European Centre for Development Policy Management
(ECDPM) Report: New Avenues for Technical Cooperation in Africa
(Maastricht 1995) distinguishes between 'Institutional Development'
and 'Capacity Building' (p. 59). It reports &quot; UNDP and other
donors are increasingly making this distinction in delivering
Technical Cooperation (TC) to Africa. In doing so they differentiate
between institutional TC support to government structures and
TC geared at strengthening capacity building of intended beneficiaries
at the local level, in the private sector or in the NGO sector&quot;.
<p>
Irish Aid rightly emphasises the importance of self-reliance and
of partnership, both to leave behind sustainable structures for
continued development, and to ensure coherence of development
programmes with other national and local activities.  Furthermore,
there is quite significant emphasis on training of government
officials working in programme areas.
<p>
Irish Aid's commitment to
strengthening government structures at the sub-national level
is a positive feature of its development assistance, and contrasts
with some larger donors who have tended to despair at the limited
capacities or other perceived negative features of government,
and have consequently turned to NGOs to implement a number of
donor-funded programmes.  (This comment does not imply an inherent
dichotomy between the approach advocated and an approach supporting
NGOs).
<p>
Irish Aid is right in its efforts to seek to strengthen
local government institutions and the capacity of local government
officials to undertake effective development work.  It is important
however to recognise that this is not just a matter of technical
training, but also a matter of bringing about &quot;reversals&quot;
(another Chambers phrase!) in thinking, in particular in terms
of the way local government officials interact with poor people.
<p>
If
 institutional development is part of the programme, it is poor
people's institutions which need support as a priority.  What
kind of institutions are these?  There can be a variety, such
as, women involved in savings and loans groups, or small farmers
involved in management of water catchments, or artisan fishermen
involved in inland or coastal zone fishing etc.  There are numerous
examples of such institutions which have many functions, which
include providing for livelihood security (emergency funds), income-earning
activities (group-based credit), natural resource management (fishermen's
groups, farmers' groups for watershed management, women's groups
for agro-forestry development), and agricultural development (farmer-to-farmer
extension groups), etc.  These local level institutions provide
a means for poor people to address some of the key livelihood
issues which they could not deal with in isolation.  In addition,
these institutions strengthen poor people in their relationship
both with potentially exploitative groups and with local government,
as well as managing future group or community initiatives.
<p>
It is
also important to be aware of the need for support and capacity
building for the actual development process, e.g. group development,
credit control competency, record keeping, evaluation, and confidence
development. Local resources may have a role in meeting basic
needs of the poorest of the poor and in developing peoples capacity
to develop livelihood enhancing activities referred to in section
3.
<p>
The ultimate aim of strengthening local government and capacity-building
with local government officials should be that local government
operates in the service of local people, -particularly the poor
 who are (a) more numerous, and (b) more in need of the resources
which local government structures can supply.  This &quot;reversal&quot;
is normally referred to as local government becoming &quot;demand-driven&quot;
rather than &quot;supply-driven&quot;.  This is not just a pious
hope.  There is some evidence already from the Ethiopian programmes
that the involvement of local government officials in the participatory
approach being adopted there, and the development of local women's
groups, is an example of  this kind of reversal.
<p>
<i>Question: Institutional-and capacity-building for whom?<p>
Answer:  Priority should be
given to poor people's organisations.  Support should also be
given   to strengthening local government institutions and the
capacity of  local  government   officials to undertake effective
development work.</i>
<p>
<A NAME="6"><hr><H3>6. Local government vs NGOs?</a></h3>
There is an argument
that says that NGOs are more effective in working with the poor,
and that, if the primary aim of the programme is poverty-reduction,
donors should not waste time and funds in a vain attempt to make
local government work in favour of the poor. The assumption is
that it is  better to channel resources through local NGOs in
the first place.  Another possible approach at the opposite extreme
is to develop a parallel structure with many expatriate and local
TA staff who themselves try to channel resources to the poor.
<p>
These
arguments and approaches cannot be simply dismissed.  Some NGOs
do outstanding work with poor people, and in particular may be
better equipped to adopt an approach based on &quot;empowering&quot;
the poor than local government is likely to do.  On the other
hand, not all NGOs are good, and there are other dangers, for
example that poor people become too dependent on foreign NGOs
instead of developing their own civil society.  Furthermore, the
quality of NGO work sometimes deteriorates when they start to
expand rapidly into larger areas.  There is also no avoiding the
fact that, at least in principle, government structures provide
the basic framework of governance within which development activities
will operate, and significant development resources still flow
through government structures.  Even the most effective NGOs are
now more inclined to develop relationships with local government
structures than to ignore them.
<p>
For Irish Bilateral Aid's involvement
in government-to-government development activity, it would not
be possible, nor particularly desirable, to channel the bulk of
development assistance through NGOs. There may however be more
restricted ways in which NGOs, especially indigenous NGOs, may
be involved in area-based programmes, for example in the delivery
of human development training in which some NGOs have particular
expertise.
<p>
There may, in some circumstances, be a potential limitation
in working with local government if one of the mechanisms of the
programme is group formation ie. the promotion of poor people's
organisations of the type discussed above.  This type of activity
may not be readily carried out by government officials and if
it were might be regarded with suspicion by poor people themselves.
 However, much depends, again, on the nature of the involvement
of local government officials in the programme.  In the Ethiopian
programmes, the quality of government staff working on the programmes,
and the emphasis on participatory approaches appear to be having
positive effects, for example, in relation to the formation and
operation of women's groups for savings and loans purposes.  In
Kilosa, the PRDVL programme appears to be relatively successful
in mobilisizing women.  In other words, the perceived limitations
of local government staff in this area may not be such a constraint.
Much depends on the extent to which the programme can effectively
motivate these staff.  Throughout the programmes the aim should
be that poor people's groups should be self-managing, without
needing intensive support from the programmes, and should instead
be one of the mechanisms through which poor people's priorities
will be identified.
<p>
<i>Question: Local Government vs NGOs ?
<p>Answer:
 Local Government provides the basic framework of  governance
within which  development activities will operate and resources
will be channelled.  However, NGOs in the sense of poor people's
 or ganisations do require   particular support.</i>
<p>
<A NAME="7"><hr><H3>7. Should area-based
programmes build roads if that is what people want?</h3></a>
What if Participatory
Rural Appraisal identifies that people's first priority is to
have a feeder road built to the local town, although the donor
may rate such an investment as a low priority?  Or, in general,
what if people's priorities differ from those of the donor and
perhaps local government officials?
<p>
The question has to be approached
by asking more questions.  Which people want the feeder road?
 Why to they want it?  What will it do for reducing poverty? 
Why do they want the road before clean water, before a school,
etc.?
<p>
In other words, it is important to develop a participatory
approach which genuinely includes the poor and elicits their priorities.
 It would be unlikely, for example, that poor women would prefer
a feeder road to getting clean water, or a health centre located
near to them, or a primary school built in their village.  The
question of whose knowledge is sought is an important one.  If
the programme is genuinely able to include poor people in the
analysis and identification process, it is unlikely that people's
priorities and the aims of the donor will differ greatly.This
very optimistic conclusion may not be realised in practice at
times.  There might be a preference for a road over a primary
school if the road were seen as a source of meeting basic subsistence
needs and/or income generation.  Access can be a local priority.
The Ethiopian programme faced precisely this dilemma in terms
of their Gurage project. The programme had no intention of becoming
involved in the construction of the large Silti Bridge yet in
consultations with the local residents this was emphatically 
their priority need. When the commitment to consultation and participation
is real, one may indeed be faced with the possibility that the
interventions in relation to a community end up being radically
different from one's initial expectations. However, so long as
they do not conflict with the overall objectives of the bilateral
aid programme these changes in direction and sector have to be
respected.
<p>
<i>Question: Should area-based programmes build roads if
that is what people want?
<p>
Answer:  It is important to ensure that
a participatory approach has genuinely included the poor and elicited
their priorities. If  priorities still differ but are within the
overall objectives of the Bilateral Aid programme then these changes
in direction and sector have to be respected.</i>
<p>
<A NAME="8"><hr><H3>8. Where should area-based programmes be located?</h3></a>
The location of area-based programmes may
or may not be a complex issue.  If the overriding aim is poverty
reduction, relatively well-off areas are automatically ruled out.
 The question becomes more one of whether to focus in areas of
intermediate or of low potential.  How are these to be defined?
 It may be that an area is described as being of low potential
because neither government nor any donor agency has been prepared
to face up to the complexities of, say, farming in complex ecosystems,
or pastoral development in semi-arid/arid areas.  There are some
grounds for saying that, because of their poverty and complexity,
these might be good areas to develop a programme which is strong
on poverty reduction, takes a sustainable livelihoods approach,
will be sustained for a number of years (although not with open-ended
commitments), and is not unduly focused on getting quick and easily
measurable results.
<p>
On the other hand, the ideal location should
not be impossibly difficult such as in an area of ongoing conflict
or an arid area sparsely inhabited by nomads. Circumstances such
as these require specialised interventions, not general area-based
projects. It should be borne in mind that programmes located in
the poorest regions often face logistical constraints which in
turn bring to the fore issues of efficiency. But neither should
it be a &quot;main road&quot; location that benefited in the past
from a privileged position as regards the allocation of investment.
Areas in the latter category often give the initial impression
of being easy to operate in (administrative structures that appear
competent, availability of construction materials and of power
and other services, etc.) but attitudinal problems may be encountered
in the local administration e.g. because commitment has been undermined
by the excessive availability of resources, competition between
aid agencies (official and non-governmental) for &quot;good&quot;
projects.  The ideal location is an intermediate area in terms
of potential and accessibility but as far down the scale as possible
in terms of resource availability.
<p>
Experience from Irish Aid's
current area-based programmes shows that the selection of an area
will be influenced by many factors including Government priorities,
the geographical location, communication links, security considerations
and the existence of adequate personnel resources within the regional
authorities to actually administer a programme. In certain areas,
the existence of other donor operations may create the danger
of duplication if Irish Aid also developed programmes there. 
Even in this case, however, there may be scope for realising complementarities
between programmes, particularly if other donors give a priority
to developing &quot;hard&quot; infrastructure (roads, bridges
etc). It has also been suggested that when selecting an area consideration
should be given to the willingness and commitment of the communities/
local authorities.
<p>
<H4>Targeting</H4>
Identification of a poor area does
not necessarily mean that a programme will have a poverty focus.
 Specific strategies will have to be devised to ensure that it
is not the better-off within a poor area that are the major beneficiaries,
but that the programme reaches the poorer sections.  It may not
however be possible, or politically expedient to exclude the better
off.  In such situations, one option is that the poorest are represented
in proportion to their overall presence in the chosen area.
<p>
<i>Question: Where should area-based programmes be located?
<p>
Answer:  In an
intermediate area in terms of geographical location/accessibility,
 communication links, security  considerations and the availability
of  adequate local personnel. Other considerations   include the
host Government's  priorities and the activities of other donors
in the area</i><p>

<A NAME="9"><hr><H3>9. Intensity of resource use</h3></a>
There are again different
experiences of this issue within Irish Aid, from the relatively
intensive application of resources in Kilosa District in Tanzania,
to the more extensive approach being adopted in Ethiopia.  Of
course, this is not just a matter of funds applied per head of
population, but is also related to the development philosophy
and approach.  The participatory approaches being developed in
the Ethiopian programmes were not adopted in any coherent way
by any official donor in the early years of the Kilosa project;
in the latter case, too, a significant proportion of funds were
allocated to district road construction, and therefore almost
by definition could not be allocated extensively.  The Ethiopian
programmes demonstrate an approach which is based on local mobilisation
and on the use of local resources.  In this way a given amount
of development funding can reach a larger population.  Not only
is this positive in terms of the number of potential beneficiaries,
it is also an inherently more sustainable approach, since development
will be brought about to a much greater extent by local (poor)
people themselves through their own organisations, with support
from local government and other external sources.
<p>
It is important
to resist the approach of creating &quot;oasis of development&quot;
through too intensive an application of resources in any given
area, and to realise the importance of mobilising human resources
for any sustained, poverty-reducing development process.
<p>
Area-Based
Programmes must therefore not be too rich to be digested locally.
 It is necessary to build on what is already there.  The desired
end-result may well involve relatively sophisticated institutions
but this outcome must be reached in a series of feasible, sustainable
steps.  The implications include maximum possible use of local
resources, low levels of technology and an unintensive application
of resources.  The key issue is to accept the degree of resource-starvation
that exists locally.  It can be exceptionally difficult for non-locals
to see those issues clearly.  In this respect, participatory investigation
and planning techniques are the most valuable support available
to an aid agency.  The implication of a low-intensity approach
is not that programme budgets must be small (i.e. the belief that
low-intensity programmes have poor &quot;absorptive capacity&quot;)
but that programme areas and target population must be large (i.e.
extensive rather than intensive approach).
<p>
<i>An extensive approach
is favoured: maximum possible use of local resources, low levels
of technology, target population/ programme areas must be large
and resources applied unintensively.</i>
<p>
<A NAME="10"><hr><H3>10. Issues concerning Technical
Assistance (TA)  staff</h3></a>
This is a much-debated subject.  At one
extreme is the type of programme where large numbers of expatriates
are employed (as has been the case in the Irish Aid programmes
particularly in Lesotho, and to some extent in Tanzania). At the
other end of the spectrum is the situation in Ethiopia where no
expatriate TA staff are involved.  In the latter case this is
partly as a result of Ethiopian government policy, but it also
accords with a  more general belief that TA staff are expensive,
may not do a more efficient job than local staff could do, and
may be a demotivating force for local partners, who do not feel
they really &quot;own&quot; the programme.
<p>
It is agreed that whenever
possible Irish Aid should endeavour to use local human resources.
However, experience in Zambia and Tanzania show that it is sometimes
difficult to recruit good quality local personnel especially for
rural postings. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that the a
model based on keeping expatriate technical assistance to a minimum
and using local TA expertise where possible is preferable. There
may however be disadvantages in adopting too rigid a policy on
this.  To begin with, there may be areas, say in health care,
community development or engineering, where a skilled expatriate
TA can make a genuine contribution, while at the same time supporting
capacity-building efforts.  Secondly, there is sometimes a role
for an expatriate generalist, (as found in the Kibaale Programme
in Uganda) both to represent Irish Aid in the field and to have
leadership role in the sense of motivating and supporting local
government and other relevant bodies to commit themselves to the
goals and to the process of the programme.  This role, not being
a specifically technical one, can easily be neglected but can
be important in the successful implementation of the programme
and for sustainability.  Whether such a person is needed or not
partially depends on the prior commitment of the government to
the aims of the programme.  It also depends on the circumstances
and experience of local personnel with the required technical
knowledge.  In the case of some areas of Ethiopia, for example,
it is apparent that the level of self-motivation and expertise
amongst local staff is extremely high; in other countries this
may not be the case.  Local competent persons with the expertise
to provide TA may also benefit from support and encouragement
from expatriate TA input.  The role of a generalist TA could include
capacity building, confidence building and encouragement of creative
thinking among the local TAs who have the technical expertise
and commitment. the distinction is sometimes made between TAs
involved in operational tasks and TAs involved in support roles
and capacity development primarily. Their relative value in different
circumstances should be considered.
<p>
Consideration should also be
given to the location of TA - at the project/programme level,
such as is evolving in Kilosa, or at the central level, as happens
in Ethiopia where a multi-disciplinary team supports more than
one area-based programme. Where it is difficult to recruit qualified
local staff the possibility of using regional resources could
also be examined. In relation to TA from Ireland, sources of 
TA should be developed more and those providing TA should be clear
about the philosophy of  Irish Aid.
<p>
Finally a more donor-focused
reason for having some expatriate Irish TA presence in the field
is to build up expertise within Irish Aid; this is important for
the &quot;institutional memory&quot; of Irish Aid as an organisation,
and may contribute to the design of better programmes in future.
However one cannot rely solely on TAs to build up institutional
memory especially if most of them  are on short contracts and
are peripheral to the organisation. A well thought out transparent
monitoring and evaluation system is needed for &quot;institutional
memory&quot; so that experience is learned from thorough recording
of successes and failures.

<p>
<A NAME="11"><hr><H3>11. Salaries and incentives, and expectations of local government officials</a></h3>
It
is to be expected that local officials will have expectations
in relation to an aid programme (just as aid agencies and their
personnel do).  These range from the personal to the professional;
 from ambition to do good to ambition to do well; from concerns
about personal careers to concern about institutional roles and
&quot;turf&quot; disputes; and from the legitimate to the illegitimate.
<p>
Complications
of this sort are only to be expected in any human enterprise (and
are taken into account in a routine way in developed countries
e.g. in arrangements for labour relations).  In the case of aid
administration, demands are sometimes made which would be inimical
to sustainability, which could weaken the commitment of local
structures or which would involve an inefficient use of resources.
<p>
Donors
have the capacity to pay higher salaries to local project (TA)
staff, and to make &quot;topping-up&quot; payments to local government
staff.  Payments to local TA staff, such that they are paid more
highly than the local government staff with whom they are working,
can cause resentments and frictions within the programme.  Additional
payments to local government staff can lead to charges of non-sustainability;
as soon as the programme is finished, the payments will stop,
and so might the activities of the local government staff.
<p>
It is
important to avoid anything which bears the hallmark of an &quot;oasis&quot;
development, and in that sense, payment of salaries and allowances
far out of line with local norms should be avoided.  In addition
it is recommended that the issue of paying top-ups be resolved
before a programme starts. But excessive rigidity in this area
can also be damaging to achieving the aims of the programme. 
Increased mobility of local government personnel and any other
local government staff is often desirable. For example, the provision
of transport - whether bicycles, motorbikes or four-wheel drives
- will be a necessary budget item for most programmes, and in
this case a requisite budget item for running costs is unavoidable.
 A similar case can be made for provision of office equipment
which genuinely serves the purposes of the programme.  The general
rule should be that expenditures of this kind should be made to
the extent that they are essential to programme objectives.  They
should never be supported in isolation and should never account
for a large proportion of the budget.  The focus should always
remain on the real programme objectives.  There should be clear
understandings in this regard from the outset.
<p>
There is a need
for a sensitive approach.  Developing country officials naturally
object to being treated as though they are self-evidently interested
only in serving their personal purposes, especially if the judgement
is made by aid agency personnel who (even when they are &quot;volunteers&quot;)
earn salaries that are very large in local terms and who absorb
large amounts of programme resources for international travel,
vehicles, expensive housing, etc.
<p>
A highly legitimate form of budgetary
expenditure is in the area of local staff training.  Such training
again promotes programme objectives and should also promote long-term
sustainability.  Training in PRA techniques, for example, can
be expected to have a significant effect on the working practices
of local government officials, extension agents etc.
<p>
Furthermore,
it is a reasonable expectation of local officials involved in
the programme that they will develop professionally from their
involvement. Many good organisations now use 'performance based
payments' which could be an alternative to top-ups.
<p>
<i>Justifiable
expenditures that promote the programme's objectives include:
 local staff training and the provision of the following; transport,
office  equipment and appropriate staff housing.
<p>
Expenditures
that are not justifiable and may undermine the sustainability
 of the  programmes include: payment of salaries, top-ups and
allowances  that are far above the local norms. The best defence
against problems associated with top-ups is the maximum possible
degree of integration of programme implementation in local structures.

This Session brings together as I am sure you realise from looking at the Programme a mixture of journalists and broadcasters based in radio and television and in reference to one of the things that was said in the last about us not being listened to, I would just like to say that Ron Foster the Chief Press Officer of the ADA is here and has been loyally listening all day, although he was presumably trying to stand up! We thank him very much for coming and it's very nice to know that there is at least somebody from our government here listening.<p>	I will introduce the four speakers as they come to speak. The first speaker if Michael Holman of The Financial Times. I am sure that anybody in this room who has anything to do with media and Africa knows about Michael who is absolutely the doyan of the press corps on Africa and I was extremely keen to have him here, particularly because he almost never speaks in public, it's extremely hard to track him and we are very privileged to have got him to come, but also because I thought it was important to make the point that most people here are concerned with broadcasting rather than with the written media and I think one of the things that perhaps doesn't come out incredibly clearly to broadcasters, or at least very openly, is how circular the media is and how very dependent broadcasters are on people who work in the written word. It happens over and over again that people ring Michael or my office or other people who write on Africa saying, "Having seen what you wrote, I've got a brilliant idea for a television programme, or a radio programme, could you just help me by giving me 25 contacts" and of course because we are very good natured we always do! Very often the programmes don't happen. But anyway it is for that reason of the circularity which I think is a really important thing to take on board that I wanted Michael to come this afternoon and I am very very happy to welcome him, and he will be our first, very brief speaker.<p><b>Michael Holman</b><br>It's hard to live down an introduction like that, but I'll do my best!  I am extremely apprehensive at the prospect that is before me and I loathe appearing on occasions like this, partly because I know there is a petty powerful element of hostility to the role of the western media in Africa and partly because I am more vulnerable than most because I work for that organ of the capitalistic establishment, The Financial Times.  I also bear in mind the comment made by a rather nasty African missionary in Africa who wandered round the Continent towards the end of the last century and he said something that was really salutary and I try to bear in mind myself, he said: "In Africa one is tempted far too often to speak one's mind, forgetful that you must mind how you speak".  So I'll try to remember this, and I will also offer one or two pieces of advice about she comes to sum up. I have always found it useful on these occasions when somebody had been talking a combination of nonsense and provocative rot, to say: "It eases the tension if you call somebody 'sincere'.  So you say, "We do not doubt Mr .................sincerity." What this actually means is that we must accept the misguided man actually believes the opinionated nonsense that he has just dished up!  The other example is passionate ie: "We were struck by the passionate way in which he expressed himself". Now what this really means is that we don't agree with a word of what he said.  One final example is:  "Clearly Mr. Holman has a right to his views."  That means "we wish we hadn't invited him"!  I am not going to apologise for the role of the western media and the print writers in particular in Africa, because I think that over the past few years they have done a remarkable job. Several people who have several times been in the front line, a number of people have indeed lost their lives, and I don't know of any of my colleagues who don't at the end of the day look back over the events that they have covered and the events of the past few years and search their consciences about whether they have done the job effectively and adequately. Behind the bragging, behind the inflated egos, without exception, they are a group of men and women who have a very profound concerns about the way they do their job. Over the past 15 years I think in some respects it has become more difficult. Africa has become marginalised. The job of getting Africa into the paper has become more and more difficult. The marginalisation takes several forms I think:  it's the disengagement of the West from Africa, it's the stagnation in Africa's share of world trade, about 3%, it's the stagnant share of foreign direct investment of about 1% and we are reaching a point where I think there is a danger, there is a belief that we can bring sense in ailing marginalised Africa, and the tendency of the coverage is to look upon Africa as an object of compassion. I think one of the first things that we journalists have got to do is make the point that Africa is of concern to the West out of our own self-interest.  I think that an ailing Africa, to put it crudely, would poison the West. That a sick Africa will infect the West. We see the rise of drug smuggling through centres like Nasaka and Lagos. We are going to see I suspect the rise of Moslem extremism in Africa. We are going to face the loss of genetic material which is of immense value to the world - one example is the rosy periwinkle from Madagascar, which is used in treatment of children's lukemia. I think what we've got to put across is that the self-interest of our children in the West is as much of a concern to us as the compassionate motivation for Africa's children themselves.	The other difficulty that I find in covering Africa is the callibre of the African opposition, the democratisation movement of the past few years has frankly proved profoundly disappointing. I was in Zambia just a couple of weeks ago and the opposition there is disintegrated and fragmented along ethnic, regional and personality lines, and one can't avoid coming to the conclusion that there are profound constitutional issues which Africa has failed to address, including the problem of the ethnicity.	Another problem that I think is of enormous worry to all of us who cover Africa, is Africa's failure to speak out in its own cause. How many times I go to Conferences which involve raising funds for Africa or promoting Africa's interests and there are no representatives from African governments. It seems to me outrageous that Africa has failed to raise funds in its own cause. Why doesn't an African President for example sponsor a football team at Wembley between an African Eleven and a Great Britain Eleven to raise money for Africa itself.  Why is it that so much of the campaigning on the part of Africa is done by Mazoos as we call them in Zimbabwe and not by Africans themselves. Where's the lobbying on the part of Africa, where are the people who come to the journalists from African governments and say "Come and see our predicament".  Where are the governments who provide the sympathetic framework with which to address their problems.  I have just to day been dealing with OXFAM which is facing the threat of expulsion from Zimbabwe because of a critical report which was published about the Health sector in Zimbabwe. Add to this the trials and tribulations, still to this day of getting visas. Somebody I believe earlier on this morning was talking about the problems of covering Nigeria and the failure of the Western media to bring to the attention of the world their country's desperate predicament. Try getting a visa to go to Nigeria. It, for many of us, is almost impossible. I happen to have one, so I am excluding myself from this difficulty, but so many of my colleagues come in to me saying "we cannot get access to the countries concerned".  So, at the end of the day the difficulties of reporting Africa are becoming greater and greater, and I think that those in the audience who feel that we are doing a bad job might look upon our position with somewhat more sympathy and somewhat more understanding, and I look forward to fielding the tomatoes when your chance comes.<p><b>Chair</b><br>	Our next speaker is <a name=hilsum>Lindsey Hilsum </a>who is both a writer for The Guardian and The Observer. She is a freelance and she also does radio and I think probably some BBC television work.  Lindsey has for about ten years specialised in East Africa. She was at one point based in Nairobi and I think many of you will know of her very distinguished work from Burundi, particularly in the early part of the crisis when nobody else wanted to write about it and certainly nobody wanted to have it on their airwaves or in their papers, and Lindsey was responsible for really pushing that story in a very sophisticated and very deep way, and we at The Guardian were particularly pleased to have her work for us.<p><b>Lindsey Hilsum</b><br>	Thank you Victoria.  I happened to be in Kigali when the violence started on April 5th. I was in a house where there was a night guard in a scullery and his name was Evarist. He was a Tutsi - and I knew he was a Tutsi because his employer told me he was a Tutsi, and because he was quite tall and he had a thin nose, and I was therefore very worried about him because it became clear very early on that Tutsis were being targeted. <br> I didn't want to leave the house because I was afraid that if I left the house that might increase the chances that a gang of militia would come in and kill Evarist.  So that was very difficult. In the end I did leave the house and I left Evarist and for a long time I didn't know what had happened to him. <br>Now some weeks more than a month later I was in Zaire and I was in the office of the Aid Agency which owned the house where I had stayed in Kigali, and a voice said, "Bonjour, Madame" and I turned round and it was Evarist, and I was thrilled as you can imagine. <br> I thought what the hell is Evarist doing here, everyone here is a Hutu and he's a Tutsi and I finally asked the right question. Instead of asking, "Are you a Hutu or a Tutsi?" which I had asked before, knowing he was Tutsi and not getting a clear answer, I asked the question, "On your identify card does it say Hutu or Tutsi?" <br>  He said, "It says, Hutu". <br> So then I knew he was a Hutu, or he was a Tutsi who had managed to get an identity card which said Hutu.  Oh, I thought, I didn't need to worry about him in the way I did when I was in Kigali, but anyway he survived, that's the main thing.  <br>And then a couple of weeks ago I got a phone call from somebody who knows Evarist and she said "I don't know how I am going to tell you this, Lindsey, but it now looks as if Evarist is implicated in the killings and that he was involved and that he wasn't a potential victim, he may have been a murderer". <br> Now I tell that story not because it distresses me, although of course it does, but because it is an example of how the truth slips and it's an example of how easy it is to make assumptions and get it all wrong, and I think that is truer in Africa than in most other places where I have worked because if you ask the wrong questions, or you come in with the wrong assumptions you will get it all wrong, right from the beginning.<br>	Now I do cover wars, coups and famines more than anything else and I am not going to apologise for that. I am a freelance journalist and that's how I make my living and these are the events which are happening in Africa. They are not the only events but they are cataclysmic events, they are the extremes of human experience, they affect millions of Africans. I believe it is legitimate to cover them, I believe it is right to cover them. I think the issue is how we cover them.  Now I am going to quote something from a piece I wrote for The Guardian which is just a very short quote from a woman I met in South West Rwanda:	"We had 7 goats said Josephine Muhugareeu (?). We lost five when we were running. Then we got hungry and sold the other two. We sold all our clothes, my blanket, my headscarf and three plates. Now we have nothing."	Now the reason I quote that is because it took me a long time to get that. When I first met Josephine she just said, "Oh, we had some animals and lost everything". and that was that.  It took a long time to get out exactly what they had lost, how many goats, three plates, one headscarf. That is authentic. That is exactly what she lost, and I think it is really important to write down exactly what she lost and it takes a long time to do it. It is particularly hard to do that kind of reporting if you are broadcasting because it would have taken about half-an-hour's worth of tape to actually get that, it's much easier if you are just taking notes, and that means that it is very hard to get the authentic voice of poor Africans, Africans who don't speak English or French, (you are working through a translator), Africans who are unable to put their  voices across easily to the outside world. It takes a long time.  I was in the States the other day and I was watching C & N and there was a particular incident where some people had been beaten up. This was in Haiti and C & N had a lot of cameras around and they ran this piece of footage and there were no words. There was no commentary, you just saw what was happening and I was horrified because I think that one of the most important things is to put the words across. What people say, and also what you understand when you have finally asked the right question, and I am horrified by this trend towards just seeing without making any effort to really understand, but the difficulty of understanding and the difficulty of hearing what people have to say is time. The pressure on the journalist is to get the story out and to get it out quickly. As a broadcaster working primarily for BBC radio  and as a freelance journalist, the best thing I can do is find somebody's ......................... and sit by it and listen to what all the other journalists have to say and turn it round in interviews and dispatches and I can make a lot of money doing that. I can just sit there and turn it around without ever really going out, and if I really go out and I spend one days, two days, three days finding out what really happens, talking to people, finding out what they really felt, working with a translator, going back asking the questions again, it takes a very long time, and you don't really get paid for putting that amount of time in  and that makes it very difficult and it makes it increasingly difficult to put the authentic voices across. One of the things which has changed broadcasting from Africa is the satellite phone and it is a blessing in many ways. Gone are the days when you would disappear into Southern Sudan and nobody hears about you for two weeks and they faintly begin to worry. Now on the whole people do have access to satellite phone and that is very useful that you can get the story across and get some sense of immediacy, but it does mean that increasingly you are under pressure to work to the time frame here on the next deadline, rather than allowing people the time they need to speak and allowing yourself the time you need to find out and I think that the danger of this is the coverage of Africa will become increasingly superficial if we don't allow ourselves the time and have the modesty to know that we need the time in order to understand properly.<p><b>Chair</b><br>	One of the reasons that we at The Guardian selected Lindsey is precisely because she does go out for two or three days and produces a story that nobody else has got, so I know it's very hard but there is quite a lot of appreciation for that kind of way of working.	Our next speaker is Andy Kershaw who is also a freelance and as far as I know, only does radio.  Andy has the kind of special gift of not only hearing people but managing to put over in the vary difficult area of things like the Today programme where you are used to hearing endless carrying on between one British politician and another just very very occasionally you get this very very different voice and I well remember the first report that Andy did from Rwanda and I don't know if anybody else heard it, but it was certainly enough to wake you up and completely different kind of presentation that anyone else had done on radio, and to have actually managed to get it on to the Today programme rather than the kind of ghetto of the Africa Service or even the BBC World Service. So, one of the things that I wanted to ask Andy to talk to us about is how it is that he as a freelancer has, as far as I know, a particular toe hole within the BBC manages to get programmes from places like Ecuadorian Guinea or the Rwanda story which he did in the very early days from the Zaire border where other people hadn't done that kind of thing. How he manages to get to various kinds of places and actually persuade the BBC to run his very original material. I know you have just come back from Malawi, so perhaps you could tell us why you were setting a kind of agenda in Malawi?<p><b>Andy Kershaw</b><br>	Well I went back to Malawi to make a programme for Channel Four, a straightforward travel programme because I thought it would be worth going back post Dr Banda to see how the country had changed since I was last there which was in 1993 and was a very different place.  But how do they send me to places like Malawi?  Interestingly enough, and this fact still astonishes me, after the best part of ten years Nancying around Africa I have become known as Mr. Africa Music on the radio and documentaries and things for Radio Four, this was the very first time I had ever shot a frame of film in Africa and I think it was just dogged persistence with certain commissioning editors and production companies that I wore them down saying isn't it about time we went to this interesting country.  But in the case of Equatorial Guinea I went there, as I go to many places, simply because nobody else bothers to go.  I think why do I never hear anything about this country. What kind of place is it? That's how my fascination with Haiti started in those wilderness years between, well certainly wilderness years as far as stories were concerned, for journalists is when the Devaliers???and the arrival of Aristeed????  I went to Haiti simply because no one else did, and in the case of Rwanda I wasn't supposed to go to Rwanda at all.  The way it happened was that a friend of mine who was the editor of From Our Own Correspondent then moved to the Today programme and as far as I understand it was going around the office, we need someone to go to Berundi. There were too stories:  Will it spread because of the same ethnic mix, and how will these Rwandan refugees cope in the surrounding countries.  Well we met an adult within a day and a half that was going into Zaire as well, so we were just basically sitting around a bar of an hotel in Budjembura (?) with a lot of bickering hacks and aid workers, but after about a day and a half of that I just simply you know got bored with the novelty, and what pushed me into it was two guys sidled up to me at the bar one evening who turned out to be the Budjembura representatives of the RPF and they said if you would like to go over into RPF territory, territory that we have held for some time, we can radio over the border. As we had nothing else to do we simply took up their offer.<p><b>Chair</b><br>	Well I think that gives you . . .  on the one hand its a kind of mixture of very enterprising people like Andy who also have a bit of good luck of who they happen to stand next to in bars, but also that this whole kind of wall of commissioning editors that I think a lot of people find, and there's been a lot of talk about it during the day, I think to be a kind of wall that prevent people doing the kind of thing they want to do, don't always have to be like that and people break through it, and I have spoken to a couple that do.<p><b>Andy Kershaw</b><br>	Can I add something else as well?  I was relying on my sleeping bag while in Malawi.  I was trying to think why I had never made a film in Africa in ten years of doing television and one of the conclusions I came to, I think by and large the people who populate the television industry are scared of the place. I think it's much easier to go off and make programmes in less difficult places which is the top and bottom of it, and certainly of one of the people who was on this team with me, I think would confirm that. There is a resistance to it because (i) we don't understand anything about and (ii) they are frightened of it because it has an image of just being a desperate place and very often a violent place and uncomfortable place, they shy away from it.<p><b>Voice</b><br>	Tell us more about the bickering hacks?<p><b>Chair</b><br>	We haven't got very much time.  Thank you Andy.<p> 	Our last speaker has a slightly more conventional profile as far as television is concerned. It is Peter Gill who is the new editor of Africa Express. He has worked a lot in Africa. He first of all worked with VSO in Sudan in the sixties, so he knows a lot about the work on the ground of aid agencies. He has also written a book about OXFAM and its work in Africa and he worked or quite a long time in print working most of the time for The Daily Telegraph as Foreign Correspondent. Then he worked at Thames and made a number of films for them, mostly about Africa and now he is going to be the editor of Africa Express for Channel Four.<p><b>Peter Gill</b><br>	And I only became editor of Africa Express in the past week so I have no direct responsibility for the first series and all these brick bats that were thrown around earlier this afternoon simply bounced off me.  I am here however quite shamelessly to buttonhole people and to pick people's brains as to ideas and suggestions for the second series of Africa Express which is going to be transmitted in the Spring. Africa incidentally is catching up on Europe. I have edited three series of Europe Express, which is the progenitor of Africa Express and is also coming back next year, and Africa is catching up. The first Europe Express series that I edited was of ten programmes, it has now slipped to eight. The first series of Africa Express was give programmes, next Spring it will be six.  Although I haven't had direct responsibility for Africa Express I can say something about the Express approach which why I think it is so valid, why it is just as applicable to Africa as it is to Europe. First this is Current Affairs journalism, it's not news background, and it's not news analysis. Current Affairs show, particularly Magazine Shows like Africa Express can certainly deal with big news stories but only when they have something valid or original t say about them. If they can't find any such thing to say, then in my opinion they shouldn't bother to say it. Dealing with Europe the challenge was always to get beyond that news agenda, not to ignore the news agenda, but to go beyond it, to go beyond in the European context high politics and politicians in suits, to go beyond Europe as an institution and the British obsession with Brussels and bent bananas and all of that. The challenge I think is very similar for Africa Express. We shouldn't ignore all the big news stories of war, aids, famine, coups, conflict - I was going to say in my notes tribal conflict but 'tribal' has been scored out and interspersed with 'conflict'. But we won't touch those issues unless we have got something truly original and surprising to say about them and if we haven't got such things then we move on to other stories and tell them instead, and the story for a magazine programme like Africa Express is the thing. We have an annual series of just six programmes and you can't afford to start at the other end of the spectrum with the news agenda and all those big themes, you've got to bear the latter in mind but then push them aside in the interests of a good story that viewers haven't seen before on a subject they perhaps haven't even thought about. Now there are particular challenges to reporting Africa for a show like Africa Express, one it seems to me is to avoid good news for the sake of 'good' news. It's too contrived and the viewers in my experience aren't mugs. They can see right the way through a contrived effort to tell a good news story about a bad news situation, so for instance successful agricultural project in Northern Ethiopia or somewhere in the Sahill mightn't interest me as the editor of Africa Express but some unexpected, surprising off the wall story about food somewhere else in Africa would, specifically because viewers bring all their background knowledge and a lot of psychological baggage with them to bear on any story about food in Africa. I will give you one good example of the sort of thing I am talking about from the last series of Africa Express. This was a report on the craze for cycling as a sport in Eritrea (?)  It's now apparently virtually the national sport. Now this seems to me to be a surprising and colourful way of telling people that Eritrea(?) was at peace after a generation of war, the longest war in Africa, the longest civil conflict apparently in the world, without either giving viewers a dreary history lesson or a piece of the political analysis. In all sorts of ways we need to get beyond the familiar and the predictable. We could for instance try avoiding animal tales unless they make a particularly valid story, but there was actually one rather good animal story in the last run of Africa Express.  We would want for instance in this series to look at commerce rather than agriculture because that might surprise a lot of British viewers and we should also strive to identify authentic local talking points rather than what European editors think Africans are probably talking about. The next challenge, at least in this second series is to get beyond all the familiar countries and the familiar story areas for good practical reasons, the first series of Africa went for Commonwealth, South Africa before it re-entered the Commonwealth and one trip to Ethiopia and Eretrea???  On the next run we need, if we can get the money, is to go to Frankaphone???? West Africa, we need to go to Islamic Africa and maybe parts of Africa not colonised by the British that even Channel Four viewers would not be able to find on a map.<p><b>Voice</b><br>	Equatorial Guinea!<p><b>Peter Gill</b><br>	Equatorial Guinea being a good example.  There is a further all embracing challenge to making this sort of programme about Africa and that's budget and logistics and extraordinarily few people have actually talked budget during today. On Europe Express for instance, we shoot 6-8 minutes films in two days, sometimes in one. We pick up local crews, always, and we can do all of our research down the telephone to London deploying researchers who have a command of or the right languages. In Africa we know that that is hopelessly unrealistic. Not only is there official suspicion of the Western media making it difficult to get into, but all the practical difficulties of communicating down telephone lines in the country let alone from London. Now all these problems can doubtless be overcome and are overcome on substantial Current Affairs shows but they need staff and money and resources to overcome them, and the biggest problem of all is that Africa Express's budget is not proportionately larger than Europe Express's budget, and we hope to achieve the same sort of impact.  For me the upshot of all this is that we need to go where stories are achievable. That may on occasions mean consciously ducking some of the toughest areas in some of the tougher countries, simply because several weeks spent cracking a 7 minute film can't be attempted on an African Express budget. I was trying to think of a good story example and it was actually provided almost earlier this afternoon.  What about an eight minute film on a Nigerian corruption story shot in two - perhaps we could be really generous - in three days. But despite all those difficulties and despite our perhaps having to duck some of the awkward subjects I still believe there is a strong justification these days for Africa Express to concentrate on stories that go beyond the news agenda, make colourful films and without contrived good news and presented in a fairly positive and upbeat fashion.<p><b>Chair</b><br>	Well you have heard from four people who spend their lives reporting Africa in one way or another, and now we would like to hear from you.<p><b>DISCUSSION:</b><p><b>Julian Samboma - Freelance Journalist & Media Student, City University</b><br>	I think I am very fortunate to be at this Conference and I think you have covered the issues . . . are radically different and reporting about Africa is very important. It is the only area of he world where .......  I think again reporting on Africa is dependent on the media response . . . . and the FT closed with this rigid view that the problem with Africa is that they are not implementing these policies properly and these policies can't work whereas The Guardian has a more critical approach, they don't say everything about Africa is wrong but they are doing certain things wrong, and that's the kind of reporting that is needed. I mean that's the way I feel and Mr Gill was talking about the programme on Africa.  Since I have been watching British television no programme has come out to criticise the shortcomings of the programmes. What they did once was to bring in Ghana as a so-called IMF success story. I mean the whole programme was a farce and I think talking about the 'good' story idea, that's a good story idea. . . and I can apply for a job now.<p><b>Chair</b><br>	Do you want to reply to that?<p><b>Michael Holman</b><br>	Just a brief comment because there are may people with something to say.  But the other explanation of the acronym in Nigeria at least of SAP is search a butcher's pockets!  <p><b>Daniel  Ofori - 	Ghana Broadcasting Corporation</b><br>	I would like to react briefly to this statement made by the gentleman who says he is a student of City University. I will go straight to Ghana. With regard to the structural adjustment, Ghana has liberalised all financial controls and now there is free enterprise in Ghana. You don't need foreigners to transfer money from Ghana or to Ghana.  I just did a research about the number of vehicles that have come to Ghana over the past ten years. In 1983 people were travelling in articulated trucks that were being used by Ghanians as passenger vehicles. Now you can go to Ghana and you can find in average homes at least one vehicle. In Akra where we have people called Burgers. These are traders at least every young man in Ghana has a vehicle. Now did a lot of research just before I came here last week. City planning is not matching up to the development that is taking place in Accra now. People are now building their own houses, I would say mansions beyond the planned areas and therefore this is also creating problems for  city administrators. It is not true that the structure adjustment programme has not succeeded. The structure programme has increased with the personality of the Ghanaians.<br><b>Chair</b><br>	We will stop there because if we wanted to start a debate on structure I am sure there are many others who could be. . . .I think we will try to keep more on actual media issues.<p><b>Paddy Coulter	 - Director, International Broadcasting Trust</b><br>	I wanted to pick up something that Peter said about 'good' news. I think that he is right. I don't suppose anyone in the room wants to have contrived 'good' news stories for the sake of good news.  I hesitate to bring this up because it go into the Martin Lewis 'good' news debate which causes people to spit, or otherwise.  I was listening to Lindsey having to exist on the diet of war and disaster and catastrophe and Peter in the search for the non contrived good story, I just wondered really what the panel felt was the scope for ... I wouldn't use the word 'positive' or 'good' versus bad, but a broader agenda, because I think that out of the last session listening to Rakiya talking about why we still hear this very narrow group of images, narrow stories. Clearly we still are, and why are we?  I think there is a debate here which I think needs to come out . . . I was thinking of the BBC having made a good move on in the last ten years, and that was the appointment of the developing world correspondent, George Argyle. . . ??? He's now in Johannesburg and the job's been re-advertised.  But George said that when he was in Rwanda - maybe Lindsey can bear this out - that he had that pressure down the satellite film together on I think . .  I quote him in saying, "Stop the bloody cackle about the analysis, get up in the fucking helicopter".  We want the aerial shots. The pressure for the picture, for the narrow agenda, even when you've got an absolutely first rate correspondent who would see his or her brief in a wider way, I think that's something we need to talk about. Now I think that the people who need to be confronted with this are not the people on the panel, you are the good guys (excuse the sexism). I feel that if we want to move the debate on we have only got to get the foreign news editors, we have got to get the people who make the decisions that influence . . . and I am thinking more about television Victoria, rather than The Guardian where I think you have a more enlightened regime, but I think this is really important. At the end of the last debate listening to people attacking Channel Four or by implication,  when Channel Four has done more than any single Channel to produce diversity of drama, short stories, African Express and whatever. Whatever reservations about individual pieces, the fact is that that's there, but when you put the challenge are they in news terms doing anything radically different from the mainstream news agenda, and of the researchers the overwhelming majority have stories about the ... now as they were five years ago, or ten years ago, are war and disaster and there will be in five years time, and either we have to accept that and say that those are news values handed down immutably and there is nothing that can be done about that or in scope for a broader agenda.  Can we get the views of the panel on that?<p><b>Lindsey Hilsum</b><br>	Paddy, I don't think that the news agenda is radically different for Africa than it is for the rest of the world. I also think that the way to change it or to broaden it is in how you cover it. Now I sympathise with George obviously about this issue and getting the helicopter, because I think that you address it is that you deal with ...stories about Africa tend to be seen in hundreds of thousands and masses rather than in individuals and people with characters and lives and ideas and individual pain and individual joy and all the kind of human emotions. I think the best way of dealing with it is to cover the stories that the news agenda gives but do it in the most enlighten and imaginative way that will reach across and bring out the other issues as well, because I spent years of my life trying to write interesting development stories about Fatima in the village and now she's got a well, isn't it wonderful . . . and I'm bored still of it and I never want to write a story like that again in my life!<p><b>Chair</b><br>	One more person from the panel.  One other speaker and then you can speak.<p><b>Michael Holman</b><br>	I just want to make the point that sometimes I see Africa portrayed especially perhaps by the World Bank as Continent that I don't recognise. My experience of the Continent is demonstrably declining, deteriorating. There is more poverty, more hardship, more stress and more difficulty, and the objective of recovery is becoming distant, not closer. Film the fundamental realities of that predicament, the talk of trying to change the approach to the African crisis seems to me frankly irrelevant. The danger is that there is a World Bank portraying a Continent as recovering. It is not.  But at the same time the dispute between the World Bank and the development agencies and NGO's is profoundly dangerous because it is leaving a confused international constituency. What the hell's going on? We are moving to a point where the African crisis is becoming very close to being irrecoverable, and that's the fundamental issue that the journalists are trying to confront, and sometimes the concern about whether we are portraying too harsh a view of Africa I think becomes distractible.<p><b>Ibrahima San	 - Director of Radio, RTS Senegal</b><br>	First I am a bit worried and distressed about the way Africa is being talked about in a global way.  I feel dissolved in an anonymous Continent with no sense of identity and belonging to a country.  I hear a description of a situation. I used to hear from "expert specialists" . They used to be when I was here people who had modules in their drawers. Whenever a situation would occur they would call on them, they would pull out a drawer and then in came the specialists and just lay out that thing and go away.  I am sure you have countries in Africa with specific history, with specific teachers of their own culture and ways of development and these descriptions are so sweeping, I am a bit worried. Victoria may tell me as Foreign Editor, do journalists here actually work hard on looking at the country, or do they work from preconceived received ideas on Africa, and are they all experts?<p><b>Victoria Britain</b><br>	Well first of all I am not the Foreign Editor, I am the Foreign News Editor, the species being reviled over there by Paddy. But I think of course some journalists who operate in the kind of way that you are talking about. . . (end of side 1)  in Senegal, or Eretraia?? Botswana who could perfectly well have spoken on those very specific subjects but it isn't what we are here to discuss today, it is a very broad topic and if you want to criticise the topic, that's a completely different issue.<p><b>Jenny Mitchell - 	Spectrum Magazine, Independent Television Commission</b><br>	Something about. . .   the three plates and taking a long time (talking about the lady who lost everything) going back and back so that you could actually get a bit of a cheap thrill and in fact it wasn't exactly that difficult for that woman to describe what she had actually lost, why was it so important for you to know exactly what she lost . . . so that a reader of a broadsheet in this country could do some pitying?<p><b>Who is this?</b><br>	I just wanted to mention what Paddy was saying. It seems to me that there is a big middle ground between on the one hand the disasters, famines and coups which Lindsey admitted she specialises in and she does try to report them sensibly, but I think there is a whole other area of things which are not so obviously newsworthy in the news managers scheme of things. I just want to give you two tiny examples. I went to Somaliland to try to report traditional conflict resolution which has worked very well in that country. I could not get any television channel here to be interested at all, but I sold the story on return because they were so interested in it. The same thing happened with going to Tigre, rebelled held Tigre where an indigenous NGO was coping with the drought. Nobody was interested before I went. When I came back with the pictures they bought them. Now that's the problem you've got. You put forward ideas, Lindsey's fine, and that sort of area, OK, but what Paddy is saying is that there is an enormous area of African experience which is not disasters but which is where interesting things are happening and particularly things which are being initiated by Africans, and we as white reporters tend to neglect those, but the main problem is not the reporters I don't think, its the news managers who won't take these stories until you come up with them.<p><b>Chair</b><br>	I would just like to ask if there is any of this reviled species in the room?  A television foreign news editor?  Or anybody who has . . . oh goodness, how brave!  Thank you.<p><b>Colette Dumez - Vice President (Sales) - Europe & Africa 	 World wide Television News Corporation</b><br>	I am not involved with the day-to-day covering of the news because in fact I am involved with Africa and Europe and mainly sales in Africa, but I have become involved with Africa very closely recently going around the various countries and making contacts with television like Afrovision, and trying to find out more about what the African television people want to get from us and to try to help them. So what I want to say, because you seem to be looking for somebody who covers news, yes we do cover news in Africa, we cover Rwanda exclusively, we cover Somalia, we were the last crew in Somalia recently and we are looking at other countries, we are going into Liberia. I was very interested in the Nigerian gentleman who said why aren't we hearing from Nigeria. Well we can't get into Nigeria and the only picture we get out of Nigeria is from a freelancer and obviously he is trying to stay on the right side of the government and doesn't show us anything except the side of the election that he covered.  I used to be a producer myself, I know a lot about satellite. I would like to point out that Africa is moving finally into the world of communication, that as of April next year we will have ...........band communication in Africa which will mean that there will be communication between the different African countries on a smaller scale. You won't have to spend thousands and thousands of pounds or dollars to communicate between let's say to cover Nigeria and bring the picture back to London and then sending them back into Africa. So I think that's very important.  The other thing I wanted to  mention is that WTN does produce Current Affairs programming - you might see on SKY and you will see that we often have an item on Africa, in fact I have done some calculations, it is about 50-odd items of 6 minutes per year.<p><b>Peter Salmon - Controller Factual Programmes, Channel Four Television</b><br>	I am not a news editor, but I suppose I help set Channel Four's news agenda and work across a range of programmes on Channel Four.  I am slightly worried from some of the comments . . . there seems to be a sense that there is a conspiracy against Africa which I just don't recognise. I feel as negligent of certain issues back here in the UK, of issues in the former Soviet Republics I have never covered, of Sri Lanka, and bits of the former Indo-China, of Latin America, you know I think our job in a sense, whatever the merits of individual stories we have talked about today, is to look for original ways to talk about Africa and a broad and wider way of talking about Africa. I think it is too sudden to neglect the disasters, the wars, the famines etc.,  and it seems to be me to be one of the great challenges, I think the detail of Lindsey's report comes in, or Andy's idiosyncrasies, or the fact in a sense he is given leeway to tell it like he sees it . . . I think that if you are news manager like I am, you are looking for originality, you want someone to come at a story in a way to tell you something about it you have not read in the cuttings, something original that will stimulate people's imaginations, that's going to get people more interested	and not narrow them. So, two things, (a) please don't think there is a conspiracy, and (b) please breathe the same imagination into African issues that we all breathe into issues from other Continents.<p><b>Mike Wooldridge - BBC Radio 4, Religious Affairs Correspondent</b><br>	It still strikes me that Lindsey's point about focusing on individuals and individual stories is perhaps important in trying to overcome the apparent gulf between Ibrahima San and Michael Holman. Ibrahima is obviously right that it's too easy to given an over-simplistic view of Africa as a whole, and there's a good deal of wealth alongside the poverty, but within an individual community, telling individual stories so often helps to show the poor within that community, the exploiters and the exploited if you like, and I though in terms of looking for a way forward in reporting and getting away from stereotypes was a most important point that she made.<p><b>Karin Sieger - Research Department, BBC World Service</b><br>	Two very brief observations - but before that just a personal remark:  It has been a very long day for all of us and very interesting and I would like to take the opportunity to applaud my colleagues whether BBC or whatever or wherever for the hard work that they do and very often for putting their own lives at risk to bring us the news whether it is the full news or half the news, I don't care, they are doing it and I am not doing it.   	Two quick points:  I must mention something which has been on my mind for a long time. Some of our colleagues, and we all know who they are, have a way of introducing a bias in the way we report news, the way we report anything from wherever. There are some people who like the comfortable life and who prefer to go if you have a choice to the well-known tourist resorts of East Africa rather than some of the less comfortable places in West Africa for example, and I think we all know the two countries I am talking about, and I always find it extremely amazing that people who are in a position to say, "Hey, hang on a minute, why should we send somebody there again?" They don't say that, and off they go and bring back a story which we may have heard before.  I hope I am not stepping on anybody's toes, but I would like to suggest that any serious journalist needs to at one stage in his/her career put himself/herself or be put in a position where he/she can face his/her own limits of duress and hopefully extend them to the benefits of the organisation they work for. That's one way of investing in the human resources that work for us.	The second point which was touched upon very briefly . . . and would be useful if we have a Conference like this again . . . a separate item on the agenda - it's what I call the economics of broadcasting. We have budgets. We have programme budgets which force us to make a decision whether we for example, send the reporter on a duty tour or whether we have three stringers reporting in any one week from three different countries. Those are all very important considerations that I am sure you are all aware of but which we also have to explore, and a lot of broadcasting organisations are unfortunately put in the position where they have to spend a lot of time on accounting, rather than finding the programme ideas. I am not criticising it, that's a fact of life, and that's where we go, and I think that is something that should be included in a discussion of this nature.<p><b>Name? (Sounds like Ngamba)</b><br>	I must reiterate what other speakers have said. A lot of foreign journalists are doing a good job in Africa. Thousands of Europeans....  for a long time, and until Mohamed Amin did a .........on the problem in Ethiopa nobody knew that Ethiopians were dying. We are aware that the team of correspondents at Chester House where my friend was from the BBC, are doing an extremely good job, but there are other bunches of journalists who may be called the tourist journalists, who come to Nairobi for one day, go to Chester House, have a drink with one or two local journalists and given an extremely distorted picture of what the country is all about. These are the people I hope respectable journalists in this country will point fingers at.  We go to Chester House and ask who is this gentleman and are told this guy was here for one day and was passing through Uganda or somewhere and they wrote this article in one day. This brings in the point that someone was saying, some of these young journalists have nothing - I have nothing against youth, I was once a very young man! - but the trouble with these young journalists whose understanding of the African Continent is almost nil, make themselves experts in one night and I think the editors in London and elsewhere should really make serious positions and send to Africa journalists who understand Africa.	Finally a challenge to my colleagues, the African television producers, like the gentleman from Kamaroon, Stella here, also a producer, there must be African producers who do a lot of production on African material. We don't know that these problems exist.  When you go to Cannes or look on the London market we work through the film catalogues, we don't see any programmes done by our brothers and sisters, or done by people of Afro descent. I think the challenge is with you to see how best we can get our own brothers and sisters, get the programmes to Africa instead of just concentrating on the problems made by whites in London and New York or elsewhere. I am not saying there is anything wrong with these programmes.  I will be quarrelling with my friend from Ghana, but we who live here and are in the television business then we must........ programmes produced in other countries.<p><b>Name? - ndependent Producer</b><br>	My apologies for being late and missing this session. I have just come back from South Africa and there was a slight problem about the schedules, and I was also at a meeting today.  I have just come back from South Africa and one thing I noticed is . . . I worked in South Africa on and off, I used to work for the BBC for about 5/6 years and they had two developed broadcasting industries working side-by-side with almost no connection between the two of them. You had an indigenous broadcasting industry which had completely failed to cover the story that was around them and you had the foreign broadcasting company which is the biggest in Africa, you know permanent bureaux for all the major news networks all sitting there enjoying quite a lot of South Africa employing a lot of foreigners. The two had almost nothing to do with each other and still today, that's by and largely the case and I think that's one point that ultimately produces a divisive image, divisive perspectives on Africa will only come when that has developed to a greater extent when all Africans who are capable of getting access into either to money, to media, to all the streams that connect here to there. And the other thing connects with that which there is a News and Current Affairs bottleneck. I mean basically all the people you are describing coming to Africa are interested. It's not a conspiracy, but from the moment they get off that plane they are interested in certain stories, they are trying to find news stories, putting them together for news bulletins, they are not trying to find Africa's great writers. They are not making a history series, they are not making. . . it's a very limited bottleneck, so that the richness and diversity of the Continent ends up being squeezed into this very fine filter which is the judgement of News and Current Affairs journalists to represent a whole Continent again and I think it is the very narrowness that then creates the problems that you are talking about when you say about this bias and a feeling that you are not being represented properly, and again I think it's right to make a piece of British broadcasting and all international broadcasting, but it's not so much a news story, and its not so much an issue of covering that news story, in the specific case of South Africa I think the international media did a much better job of covering that news story than the indigenous media in that case. The problem isn't that so much, I think, as getting . . . why shouldn't someone doing a history series include Africa in the history series, generally speaking they don't. Why shouldn't arts, culture, these series why shouldn't they be looking to Africans, why shouldn't they be looking to . . . we are still dominated. . . I mean people like Peter, still inundated with projects which will have American connections, to a lesser extent European connections, very few with African connections.  I am not talking about things that may specifically address Africa, the point is to get Africa put on the map on every map, I think that's what's missing.<p><b>? Ingram??? - Save the Children</b><br> 	I want to try and tie a few things quickly together and leave a point at the end. Victoria started the session by saying that Broadcast journalists often pick up their stories from the print media. What angers me is when good work is being done in the print media - as an example Lindsey's work on Rwanda identifying the origins and the nature of the genocide at an early stage - and that fails to be translated into the broadcast coverage which follows afterwards, and I think this particularly striking example of that was a Newsnight programme about Rwanda, an hour long special which I suppose they should be praised for doing, where they had a very good group of people there as an audience to speak to the presenter, including Rakiyer, and they had two very good reporters on the ground, Robin Densel?? Goma and John Simpson from Inside the Country both of whom were absolutely clear about what had happened in Rwanda and yet the programme as a whole, especially the introduction insisted that the problem in Rwanda was one of long standing ethnic violence and even occasionally gave the impression that the people who fled into Goma were fleeing because they were being massacred. Now I would thoroughly agree with Lindsey's point that whatever we think of other ways of doing things, whatever we think of current reporting the news agenda is going to continue to be about the wars and famines and is going to continue to shape everybody's view of Africa, speaking of the mass of the general public here. The question therefore which faces everybody is how do we educate the editors, because they are the ones who control the gates, they are the ones who control whether good journalists, good development organisations can get their story across, they are the ones who are also far too busy feeding the machine to be able to come to Conferences like this one.<p><b>Chair</b><br>	Thank you very much John?  Don???<p><b>Alison Campbell - Media Officer, CARE</b><br>	I was a producer for a while at ITN before I took this job I was called into ITN on the first day of the Rwanda crisis because I had just arrived back, knowing very little more than anybody else in that newsroom, and I was asked to pontificate about the state of Rwandan politics which I was reluctant to do, but it was my job and I did it and hoped that I wasn't making too many mistakes. In the course of the last six months I have learned a hell of a lot more, but every time I have been called back for an interview, every time I have been to the World Service for an interview, or to SKY, I come up against a producer who might have been pulled off an entirely different story and who has absolutely no knowledge of that situation and I have heard exactly the same clichs arise over and over again. I have been shocked to hear the situation be described as a civil war, the suffering of the refugees who, as this gentleman said, were portrayed as fleeing because they had reason to fear for their lives, and with more and more - it doesn't matter what is coming from the report of the experts in the field and the is more and more picture material being handed over to process they are also the ones who need to be educated or need to be identified to have areas of special attention where they will bring some knowledge to the intro's which they write, the thinking material which they write and the script which they write to agency pictures I think is absolutely vital especially as the thing starts to fall down the news agenda and you are no longer hearing from an expert on the spot, the entire issue is then thrown back into the hands of someone who doesn't necessarily know what they are talking about.<p><b>(inaudible person) - African Male</b><br>	I think there is a problem with journalists writing about Africa seem to take a number of the institutional constraints that they feel as given, they don't plan or wish or are not able to do much about it. There are budgetary constraints, all of these are given and people from this sort of background to try and work objectively with experts on a Continent about which they do not know much, and if you tie that to what this gentleman was saying when a journalist lands from the plane with some little box that represents some keymatic objective, it just shows you the big problem of knowledge of journalists coming from the West to write about a different society, no matter how sympathetic, how well intentioned. Doesn't it strike you that no matter how long an African lives here, even when he takes a PhD and things like that, nobody invites them here to come and talk, it is almost automatically taken for granted . . . some of us have been post-graduates here, but it not the case that you are called on BBC to come and talk as experts because you just assume that we can never feel and know this place enough. . . and it is so easy for people coming from a background of so many constraints and then go in there and feeling so easy and free that they can write with so much authority.<p><b>Chair</b><br>	I would like to give the microphone to A.M. (sounds like Akmar Moussoo) who is one of the BBC World Service Africa Service journalists whom none of these problems of ignorance and so on can possibly be attributed to. <p><b>A.M.</b><br>	I would like to pick up on what you say. One of the things that I feel strongly about and I think a lot of my colleague on Focus on Africa, the programme I am the deputy editor of, is that we are seeing every day, because we do 20 or so news items every day, a real range of talent from all over Africa talking about piling up stories. We use African journalists almost exclusively, or else we use stringers who come from here but who have been living an African country for a very long time, and we think that that talent is better than anything we can get from somebody who comes in for one week and delivers their considered opinion of what is happening in that country which they have never been to before and will never visit again.  I would just like to put in a plea, and I think many of us want to put it in, that people here, commissioning editors, news editors take a look at the talent on the ground and make use of it because so often what happens is, this is my own experience of this directly was going and working in Angola during the Angolan elections. I saw so many foreign journalists come and sit in the press centre and retail the same stories in the same little circles around and around, never ever speaking to an Angolan, never doing their own leg work, and so every story that came out of Angola about the elections sounded identical because basically they had exactly the same source which was each other, and we feel really strongly that people should use local people and make sure that they do their own leg work, and Lindsey's point about it, taking a lot of time is well taken, but at the same time if people really want decent quality material coming out of Africa, then that's what's got to happen.  I would just like to add a final point about Africa Express. That is the answer to your problem. It's not about looking for good news, it's about widening your agenda. If you have a large range of sources of local sources of material you won't have any trouble finding interesting stories, they won't have to be good news or bad news, they will just be interesting.<p><b>Tim Modise - Journalist and Broadcaster, Radio Metro, South Africa</b><br>	I would like to echo what Ibrahim has said and maybe put it into some context of sorts why he expressed himself the way he did. And before I do that maybe also to say thank you to the British World Service Africa because those of us in South Africa we get to know what's going on on the rest of the Continent from them, so we thank you for that.  I think what Abrahim's content was all about, and I will also give you a South African picture about this, is that when African countries are lumped together, and like you said Michael earlier on, the rest of Africa is degenerating and so on and so forth, that it in many ways harms the images of individual countries in Africa, for example we have send Mandella to the US to preach for investment and so on, and repeatedly most businessmen were asking him about Rwanda, whether Rwanda had stabilised and Rwanda is about 1,500 kilometers away from South Africa. They thought that it had very much to do with what was going on in South Africa, so in some ways the way we reflect on Africa in that generalised sense sometimes does more harm than good.<p><a href="africacon6.html">Session 6</a><p><hr></body></html>

<b>
Northern development NGOs are increasingly dependent on official funds to realise their civic
agenda. This partly reflects their popularity as alternative channels of aid delivery, partly the
stagnation of private gifts accruing to them. Only a few NGOs reject public funding on
principle. The changing nature of government support compounds the problem. Throughout
the OECD, donor agencies are earmarking funds to special programmes (e.g. on
democratisation, women, the environment).  Northern NGOs can apply for these funds, but
there are generally conditions attached to them. This also means that there is less money
available for NGOs to finance their own initiatives.</b>
<p>
     This dependency presents a rather paradoxical situation for civil society organisations that are
fiercely attached to their own values and autonomy of action.  It causes tensions between NGOs and
governments, reflected in vivid debates on autonomy, subcontracting and complementarity. At best,
NGOs fear a loss of freedom and flexibility. At worst, they see themselves being co-opted by
governments as cheap executing agencies.
<p>
     In this article, we look at some of these trends and related tensions. We distinguish different
systems of government sponsorship and related NGO strategic responses. We argue that both NGOs
and governments have a stake in finding a new modus vivendi. Positive trade-offs can be realised for
NGOs that seek and accept official sponsorship. To achieve this, NGOs should replace their dogmatic
attachment to the principle of autonomy with a strong stand on identity.

<a name="ngo"><h3>NGO-financing: a menu of options</h3></a>

     Governments in different Northern countries have developed various ways to
support NGOs. At the lowest level, they provide indirect support by allowing tax
deductions for private donations. Most countries, however, have developed co-financing schemes to match funds raised by NGOs themselves. Sometimes, funds
are earmarked for specific components of NGO work such as transport, personnel,
or even for the Government/NGO-dialogue.
<p>
     Four distinct approaches to government sponsorship for NGO-activities can
be identified: the programme approach, the project approach, the 'window' approach,
and the 'quango' approach (each of which is analysed below). In most countries, they
are taken care of by a single ministry for Development Cooperation. NGOs often use
the four approaches in a mix to finance their varied operations. This might be a
surprise since each of these approaches to NGO sponsorship differs in its origins,
underlying philosophy and consequences for the autonomy, working methods and
even the development actions of an NGO.
<p>
     The four approaches can be placed on a continuum. At the liberal end, there
is the Programme Approach. At the other and most restrictive end, is the so-called
'quango' approach (i.e. quasi-autonomous NGO Approach).
<p>
     As the <a href="#tab">table</a> shows, the roles of government and NGOs in initiating action, in
executing projects and in financing varies between the different approaches.

<h4>Programme approach</h4>

     A government relying on a programme approach, accepts the existence and
free development of a civil movement which is concerned about North-South
problems. Because government positively appreciates the value, representativeness
and effectiveness of NGOs, it provides them with funds - on a contractual basis - to
execute their activities. NGO efforts are seen as a complementary contribution to the
government's own policies and programmes (e.g. in development education). A
strong NGO sector, in turn, is perceived as broadening political support for
development cooperation. This approach is very much inspired by the public
sponsoring systems for traditional civic movements (involved in labour, youth and
adult education, health care, etc).

<h4>Project approach</h4>

     Few governments have developed a programme approach which is based on
mutual trust. Most have institutionalised their scepticism and discomfort with NGOs
by adopting project approaches. Proposals are scrutinized on a case-by-case basis,
by public servants who check if the proposed activity falls within governmental
priorities and if it is 'politically acceptable'. The negative side-effects of this approach
have become apparent. NGOs and their partners in Africa, Asia or Latin America have
to rely on ever more creative packaging to suit the system. The NGO's own identity
and social project may find itself diluted in favour of a hotchpotch of isolated
activities, that donors are willing to fund. It may also lead to a growing
bureaucratisation of the NGO sector.

<h4>Window approach</h4>

     A window approach is less appreciative of the specificity of the NGOs than the
programme and project approaches. Here, governments elaborate their own
diversified strategies for tackling development problems and invite outside actors,
including NGOs, to present concrete project proposals for financing. Well-known
examples are the specific budgetlines for gender projects, human rights,
democratisation and the environment. In this system, NGOs compete with private
consultants, research institutes and national organisations all trying to get the same
scarce resources.

<h4>Quango approach</h4>

     All previous approaches leave the initiative to the NGOs. It is their choice if
they want to ask for government money and if they want to accept the strings
attached. Under the quango approach, governments consciously utilise NGOs to
execute projects aimed at achieving government objectives. These quasi-autonomous NGOs thus become mere executing agencies. They are called upon for
their flexibility, their better contacts with certain target groups, their cheap delivery
of services or their experience and professionalism. The objectives and the
strategies of the development actions implemented by the subcontracting quangos
are determined by the governmental funding agency.

<a name="dif"><h3>Different NGO responses</h3></a>

     As mentioned before, NGO financing patterns are changing in most OECD
countries. Some governments are both flexible and prepared to provide multi-year
programme financing. Others adopt a more conditional and restrictive approach and
prefer window and quango types of support. Northern NGOs are responding in
different ways to these challenges on their autonomy and funding base:

<h4>'Close your eyes'</h4>

     This seems to be the implicit strategy pursued by several Northern NGOs. 
These are usually dogmatically attached to their autonomy and reluctant to accept
change. They blame the government for being intrusive while refusing to co-operate
with other NGOs (seen as competitors), or with official aid agencies (seen as the
enemy). This strategy offers few perspectives for efficient action in the field and
institutional survival at home. It leads to a proliferation of small, generalist NGO's,
scrambling for projects and gifts.

<h4>'Follow the market'</h4>

     A second category of NGOs links its survival and growth to the market. The
priorities of these NGOs are increasingly determined by prevailing market
opportunities and special funds rather than by constituencies. In some cases, this
has led NGOs to become private firms, tendering for government contracts. Other
NGOs see the market as a means to earn untied money (e.g. by setting up trading
associations like Oxfam). In principle, there is nothing wrong with a more market-oriented approach. It may lead to quick and cost-effective responses to genuine
needs (e.g. emergency aid). But this approach may also induce NGOs to become too
'greedy' and obsessed with financial growth rather than with development impact,
innovation and political work. It may increase (unfair) competition among NGOs. 
Governments prefer to do business with NGOs acting as subcontracting agencies
than with those displaying a political agenda and critical watchdog attitudes.

<h4>'Specialise'</h4>

     Some Northern NGOs believe that specialisation is the best guarantee to
ensure both greater development impact and institutional survival. In an increasingly
complex world, knowledge and expertise are highly valued. The development agenda
has expanded dramatically, thus creating new opportunities for NGOs that have
specialised skills to offer in certain niches. The rapid growth of NGOs in the South
also compels Northern NGOs to show that they have a real added-value to offer
(beyond the provision of funds). Experience so far suggests that specialist NGOs will
have little problem in securing their funding needs on a relatively autonomous basis.

<h4>'Move towards internationalisation'</h4>

     Internationalisation is high on the agenda of several Northern NGOs. This
strategy is a two-edged sword. It has great potential if it is done to overcome chronic
problems of scale, duplication and competition for dwindling funds. Through larger
entities, Northern NGOs may develop the critical mass of funds and skills required
to influence policy. But internationalisation can also be used by Northern NGOs to
ensure their own (financial) survival. The risk of reduced funding at home is
circumvented by diversifying funding sources from abroad. According to Ian Smillie,
this may lead to a situation in which international NGOs 'do to older and smaller
NGOs what McDonald's does to established restaurants when it moves into a
neighbourhood: they put them out of business'.

<h4>'Put identity before autonomy'</h4>

A large group of NGOs reject both a sterile attachment to the principle of autonomy
and a too market-oriented approach. In their view, NGOs are more than cheap
delivery systems. They see themselves as independent actors, with a specific role
to play in international cooperation and in their own societies.
<p>
     To achieve their objectives, however, they will have to make some hard
choices. The first is to remain unambiguously in the civic realm. Funding that
reshapes NGOs into parastatals or private firms should be avoided. The second is
to put identity before autonomy. This means investing heavily in refining their own
mandate, role, funding strategies, in-house skills and expertise. Thirdly, having
clarified their identity, they need to build strategic alliances with a wide variety of
other actors (such as governments, trade unions, social movements, private sector
associations and local authorities). For too long, development NGOs have worked
in 'splendid isolation' in both the North and the South. This is a luxury that can no
longer be afforded. According to Thomas Dichter: 'All the necessary ingredients for
an effective aggregation of the players in development are present, perhaps for the
first time... Perhaps what is needed now is a balancing, an articulation of the parts'. 
Northern NGOs with a clear identity may have the best chances of find their niche
within this new configuration.

<a name="fut"><h3>Future challenges</h3></a>

     It is rather hazardous to speculate about the future of the Northern NGO
sector. Most of the premises, underlying their activities, are in a process of rapid
change. Development problems are becoming increasingly complex. Roles and
responsibilities of Northern NGOs are being questioned by their Southern partners.
There are doubts about impact and sustainability. Sources of secure finance are
under pressure.  And unconditional support from public opinion is no longer
guaranteed.
<p>
     Against this background, the most promising strategy for NGOs seems to rest
on developing a strong identity. Northern NGOs that are firmly rooted in their own
societies (e.g. in social movements) and that provide clear added value, will probably
have less to fear from government co-option, market regulation or direct funding.
<p>
     For this scenario to prevail, some other thorny issues will have to be resolved.
First, how to reduce the unhealthy competition among Northern NGOs for public
opinion support? This leads to a proliferation of fund-raising appeals, often based
on miserable images of Third World countries. Here also, developmental NGOs with
a sound message are in no position to compete with those promoting relief or child
sponsoring. Second, how to provide incentives for NGOs to abandon their almost
exclusive focus on local NGOs and to work together with a wide variety of
development actors? This holds major promise for greater development impact and
sustainability. Third, how to build new partnerships between Northern NGOs and
their governments, based on mutual respect for each partner's identity and role?
<p>
     In each of the three cases, the way in which government funds are used is a
most critical factor. If carefully managed, they can provide powerful incentives for
increased co-operation among NGOs, diversification of partnerships in the field and
a new relationship with governments.

<A NAME="int"><hr><h3></A>Introduction</h3>
<P>
These guidelines for institutional screening of local governments are prepared by the Local Institutions and Rural Development Group (Iben Nathan, Lars Engberg-Pedersen, Ole Therkildsen, Per Tidemand, Neil Webster and Kirsten Westergaard).<P>
	The purpose of this brief note is to provide guidelines for the screening of local governments.  In doing so choices among different options for implementation arrangements are made explicit and &quot;effectiveness, participation, sustainability and accountability&quot; are promoted.<P>
	A screening is especially relevant during the identification and pre-feasibility stages of the project cycle, but may also be done later in the preparation process.<P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="1"><h3>Context-specific screening</h3></a>
<P>
In a recent issue paper four key concepts in institutional development are identified:<P>
<P>
	<I>Effectiveness and efficiency (E):</I><P>
	&quot;Effectiveness concerns the extent to which the desired objectives are achieved; and efficiency concerns the extent to which results have been achieved with the minimum necessary use of resources&quot; [p. 1].<P>
<P>
	<I>Participation (P):</I><P>
	...... to ensure that the target group/the intended beneficiaries get a stake and a role in project activities during all stages of the project cycle" [p. i].<P>
<P>
	<I>Sustainability (S):</I><P>
	&quot;Institutional sustainability refers specifically to the question of whether project implementing institutions in host country have acquired the necessary financial, technical and human resources and administrative capacity to continue their functions after donor support has been terminated or reduced&quot; [p. 2].<P>
<P>
	<I>Accountability (A):</I><P>
	The accountability of government institutions has three elements: (1) Participation of the public in decisions that affect them. (2) Attention to the needs of the population. (3) Responsibility for the use of public resources [p. 2].<P>
<P>
These concepts provide the starting point for the screening of local governments, and this note should be read together with the issue paper.  However, it is impossible to make an objective screening based on such concepts for which no neutral and unambiguous definitions exist.  The circumstances in which local governments may be allocated various functions in an aid project or programme vary widely. Assessments of effectiveness, participation, sustainability and accountability must therefore be context specific.  In these guidelines this is assured by asking some key questions about local governments - not by establishing general assessment criteria.<P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="2"><h3>The potential relevance of local governments</h3>
<P>
The concept of &quot;local government&quot; is both fuzzy and varies by country.  Nevertheless, it is helpful to keep certain institutional characteristics and classical ideas of local government in mind.  They involve combinations of several features:<P>
<P>
	democratic elections of councils at subnational level <P>
	specific functions based on law<P>
	power to tax<P>
	power to decide on and operate own budgets<P>
	power to hire (and sack) own staff<P>
	power to issue bylaws<P>
<P>
These features of local governments make them interesting from a Danish aid point of view.  They provide the potential for political and economic participation of citizens in the running of public affairs at the local level.  And local governments are typically responsible for activities possessing a high priority in Danish aid (basic social services; environmental activities; community development).  Finally, local government units by definition are many, which makes it possible to target aid to specific areas or social groups within a country.<P>
	The guidelines are based on the assumption <I>that</I> Danida already has some idea of the type of planned project/programme activities, and<I> that</I> local governments have been identified as potential implementing agencies.  In other words, the choice between different types of institutions and activities has already been narrowed down.<P>
	There are three possible outcomes of this screening with respect to proposed projectlprogramme activities: (i) abolishment; (ii) adjustment of activities; and/or (iii) strengthening of local government capacities.<P>
	Moreover, screening can take place in three different ways: (i) of the system as a whole; (ii) of a significant segment of the system; and (iii) of individual local councils.  This is because the actual performances of local governments differ - not only between countries, but also within them.  In some countries the local government system as a whole is not viable.  There it is, many individual local councils may not be effective, participatory, sustainable or accountable.  The last type of screening is appropriate when an aid project to one single local government unit is contemplated.<P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="3"><h3>Screening of a country's local government system</h3><P>
<P>
In some countries the political-administrative problems may be so severe that the performance of the local government system and its individual councils is significantly affected.  Therefore a screening must often start with the system as a whole - especially when larger aid projects are contemplated.  Its purpose is to assess &quot;the potential for E/P/S/A&quot; of a country's local government system.  In this assessment it should be kept in mind that formal powers and real powers may differ significantly.<P>
	Screening of the local government system may be appropriate to do for Danida's country strategies, and may involve assessments of the following:<P>
<P>
(a)	<I>constitutional basis </I>- the realism and extent of the formal specification of local units, their tasks, authority and degree of autonomy in relation to central government.  Such specifications may not just be contained in the local government legislation proper.<P>
<P>
(b)	<I>history - </I>the stability of LG structures over time and across changing regimes and in particular the direction and nature of recent or impending changes.<P>
<P>
(c)	<I>commitment</I> - the extent of political support for and endorsement of (or conflict about) the local government system.<P>
<P>
(d)	<I>democracy </I>- the degree to which local elected politicians are regarded as representatives for their local constituencies and are accountable to them.  The actual opportunities for popular participation in local government affairs.  The transparency with which activities are run (public access to budget information, council meetings, etc.).<P>
<P>
(e)	<I>finance </I>- the sources of LG finance and their changes over time, in particular the structure and extent of local resource mobilization, central government grants and loans, and foreign aid.  The size and growth of revenues in relation to tasks, output and inflation.<P>
<P>
(f)	<I>personnel </I>- the quality of LG staff and their working conditions in relation to those of central government.  The size of staff in relation to tasks.<P>
<P>
<I>(g)</I>	<I>inter-organizational relations - </I>the importance of the various political-administrative levels in relation to planned Danida activities.  The main features of the political-administrative links between central and local government (partnership, conflictual, etc.). The central government control/support/responsibilities in relation to local government with respect to finance, staff, policy and tasks.<P>
<P>
(h)	<I>relations between local government and constituency - </I>local government control/support of lower level agencies and NG0s working in the constituency. The transparency of respons- ibilities and authority from constituency to central government.<P>
<P>
The main outcome of a system screening is to answer two related questions: (1) Is the local government system in the country sufficiently &quot;sound&quot; to justify that aid is channelled through local councils?  If the answer is negative, then (2) what types of institutional measures are needed to make the system sufficiently &quot;sound&quot;?<P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="4"><h3>Screening of many LGs for large programmes (self-screening)</h3>
<P>
A screening of the local government system as a whole is often a necessary but not always a sufficient condition for choosing specific local government councils.<P>
	If a planned programme involves many local councils, it is often infeasible to screen each one in sufficient detail.  Instead a process of <I>self-screening </I>could be contemplated.  Its purpose is to identify the &quot;best&quot; local government units in relation to specific criteria related to programme objectives, but based on the actual performance of individual councils.  The purpose could also be to identify activities specifically directed at the institutional development as a necessary precondition to implement a programme through local governments.<P>
	Self-screening is based on two main assumptions, namely that the actual screening is part of the implementation phase in the project cycle; and that it is politically and ethically feasible to exclude &quot;bad&quot; local governments from aid supported programmes.  Four main questions are involved in the screening:<P>
<P>
(a)	<I>negotiating performance criteria.  </I>Criteria reflecting effectiveness, participation, sustainability and accountability in the specific context should be developed, negotiated with and agreed upon with the involved local councils (or, if this is not feasible, with their representatives: Local government association/Ministry responsible for Local Government).  Only criteria that can be easily monitored should be used.<P>
<P>
(b)	<I>modest implementation, and monitoring, </I>The above criteria form the basis for an initial implementation period at a modest level.  All participating councils are treated equally with respect to aid assistance.  Relevant central authorities/donor outfits/constituencies conduct the monitoring.  The results are made available to all relevant parties.<P>
<P>
(c)	<I>screening.  </I>Councils that do not perform satisfactorily are dropped from the programme.  The feasibility of initiating institutional development activities for low performing councils may be considered.  Such activities may also be necessary for councils retained in the programme.  New councils and/or low performing councils may (re)start at step (a) or (b).<P>
<P>
(d)	<I>increased implementation, and monitoring</I>.  Implementation through the better performing councils is stepped up.  Need for institutional development support should be assessed on basis of past performance.  Monitoring continues, and the continuation of individual councils is periodically assessed.<P>
<P>
Aid is used as an incentive for performance in this approach to screening.  Councils are rewarded for their efforts.  This may contribute significantly to the institutional development of the councils - both among those included, and those initially excluded but wanting to try again.<P>
<P>
<P>
<A NAME="5"><h3>Screening of individual LGs</h3>
<P>
The screening of individual local governments could be combined with the two approaches discussed above.  It could also be conducted when choice of councils or time for screening for various reasons are restricted.<P>
	Since no politically neutral criteria for identifying viable local councils exist, the results of screening will depend on the approach used.  There are four major ones:<P>
<P>
(a)	<I>quantitative comparisons</I>.  Depending on data availability, two types of comparisons are possible: (i) trend analysis for individual councils based upon time series data, indicating changes compared with the base year; (ii) cross sectional analysis, comparing several councils with each other at one point in time, indicating the relative position of individual councils.<P>
<P>
(b)	<I>assessments by constituency.  </I>Rapid participatory appraisal methods (mainly based on focus group discussions) are used to solicit such assessments.  Both recipients and non-recipients of LG programmes should be included.  Locally specific indicators of E/P/A/S should be used in the discussions such as: E (who (don't) benefit from service?  Are services satisfactory?); P (do groups influence outcomes?); S (are services likely to continue?); A (opinions on corruption; administration responsiveness).  Etc.<P>
<P>
(c)	<I>local government assessments</I>.  Approach the same as pt. (b) above.  Both politicians and staff should be involved - as should staff at different levels in the bureaucracy.<P>
<P>
(d)	<I>central government assessments.  </I>This may include comparisons as under (a) above.  It may also involve interviews with (groups of) central government staff and/or national politicians.<P>

<p><b>
Two of Africa's leading lights in the trade union movement, Hassan Sunmonu, Secretary-General of the Organisation of African Trade Union Unity (OATUU) and Andrew Kailembo, Secretary General of the Africa regional section of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU-AFRO) spoke to The Courier about the changing face of trade unionism in Africa in the wings of the annual meeting ACP/EU social partners meeting, held in Brussels on December 6-8 1995.</b>
<p>
	The wind of democratic change blowing through Africa has opened the door to a re-emergence of free trade unionism. On the other hand, an increase in violations of labour and trade union freedoms by governments has been seen. At the same time, structural adjustment and the devaluation of the CFA franc have set back union attempts to take advantage of political pluralism. Trade unionism was an important element in precipitating an end to one party regimes notably in Mali, Zambia and Malawi, and trade union pluralism has grown with the dismantling of one-party systems.
<p>
	'In this democratisation process, some governments fear the role of the trade union movement. This is particularly so when they see that it is independent and working with a free press, conversing with society,' says Andrew Kailembo, who was elected head of the Nairobi-based ICFTU-AFRO in 1993. It has 44 affiliated organisations in 40 African countries and a membership of 27 million.
<p>
	Hassan Sunumo renewed a four-year term as head of the OATUU (based in Accra) in May 1995. The Organisation claims to represent all trade union tendencies in Africa including the non-aligned. Its Secretary-General is confident that unions will have a strong voice in the continent in future. 'Governments in our countries have become intolerant as a result of the trade union movement leading civil society in a number of countries in demanding the restoration of the people's democratic rights. They used to feel that unions should only deal with bread and butter issues; but every human being is a political animal, and we have a right to air our opinions about the way our countries are run.' He adds: 'Trade unions are saying that they played an important role during the pre-independence period, fighting against the colonial past. Now they want to see that proper democracy is established. When you have democracy, you also have free and independent democratic unions.'
<p>
	Both umbrella bodies are active in exposing violations of trade union rights and labour freedoms. According to Mr Sunmonu, 'we go to the governments to present the complaints of our affiliates and discuss them with officials. We don't simply attack violations out of hand. There is always another side to the coin. And countries are sometimes very embarrassed when they see the OATUU report on activities.' Both men make a strong call for greater dialogue with the IMF and the World Bank on the content of structural adjustment programmes.
<p>
	Their fears that the 'social partners' are being ignored in the design of IMF and World Bank programmes are also underlined in a recent study by the Brussels-based ICFTU - which has 127 million members in 124 countries - of 13 French-speaking African countries. This study asserts that structural adjustment has set back trade unionism's ambitions of pluralism, as well as progress on labour rights.
<p>
	The ICFTU report refers to the World Bank Development report for 1995 which says that structural adjustment poses a 'serious challenge'. The ICFTU goes on to recommend 'intervention in labour markets,' to 'reduce the bias against small and informal businesses and agriculture.' Public sector reforms are seen as 'crucial for increasing the quality of services offered' and a 'simultaneous reduction in public employment and a more competitive wage structure' is urged.
<p>
	According to the report: 'Politicians are again tempted to employ repression in stabilising society so that the requirements of conditionality are accepted unopposed'. The offer of a 'docile workforce' facilitates external investment. It also claims that the 1960s scenario is being repeated. This was when the politicians' quest for centralisation to meet the goals of the initial five-year plans first destroyed pluralistic stuctures in French-speaking Africa. Trade unions, says the ICFTU, were swallowed up and private sector employers marginalised. The state assumed almost complete control of industrial relations.
<p>
	The report stresses that 'the train of structural adjustment left the station some years ago and workers and their trade unions are on board. Today, the question is not when the trip begins, but where it is going and what route it will take. As political leaders examine (ways) of restructuring labour legislation and industrial relations, as part of an attempt to restart stalled economic growth, they are confronted by the conditions of the international financial institutions.' The study continues: 'Latent tensions have become transparent in the process of drafting new labour codes. Demands for "flexibility" of employment and working hours have increased pressure in governments to impose fewer restrictions in areas such as terms of employment contracts, employment procedures, authority of labour inspectors, dismissal for economic reasons and temporary work.'
<p>
	And the 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 had a 'profound effect on wage earners and further undermined union credibility.' Trade unions were taken by surprise as no consultations had taken place prior to the devaluation. There were initial protest strikes and demonstrations in Benin, Burkina, Gabon and Niger. Other unions held meetings and demands for wage increases ranging from 35% in Chad and 50% in Burkina, Mali, Senegal and Togo, to 100% in Gabon. 
<p>
	Whereas Andrew Kailembo speaks about the need for the IMF and the World Bank to engage in dialogue with the social partners, Hassan Sunmuno regrets that the 'African alternative' to structural adjustment, endorsed by African nations in 1989,  has never been implemented. 'What we are saying is that the World Bank is not restructuring in the right way because it is not involving the social partners. We believe there should be dialogue with the social partners,' he asserts. 'We criticise the World Bank in countries like Chad and Senegal because they have tried to impose expatriates on the governments who then encourage them to water down or abandon their labour laws. This is the business, not of the World Bank, but of the International Labour Organisation which is the specialised agency for labour legislation.' This year, the ICFTU has organised seven structural adjustment workshops in Ghana, Chad, Senegal, Gabon and Uganda. Participants have included Ministries of Finance and Economics, representatives of civil society and officials of the World Bank and IMF.
<p>
	'Why,' ask Mr Kailembo, 'should the Ugandan government announce that it is going to retrench 10 000 people, without ever discussing the matter with the social partners? The key question is how you retrench. There should be a safety net for those moving into the informal sector, so that they have something  to live on. If you retrench overnight, you create chaos. In the African continent, where you have no social security, if you take away one person's livelihood, you are effectively retrenching 10-20 people.' He claims that the IMF and the World Bank are now beginning to take note of their concerns.
<p>
	Mr Sunmonu stresses the African alternative: 'What does structural adjustment mean?' he asks. 'Well, it certainly means sacrifice but how can we share the fruits of that sacrifice equitably. At present, less than 2% of the people - who have not made any sacrifice  - are reaping 98% of the fruits.'
<p>
	Both organisations are committed to wide-ranging education schemes, not only about trade union freedoms and labour rights, but also on economic integration in Africa. The OATUU is holding worker education programmes based on popular participation, empowerment, accountabilty of leaders, human and trade union rights economic and social growth, and the pillars of the Treaty of the African Economic Community adopted in July 1990.
<p>
	Hassan Sunmonu advocates human resource development and capacity building for unions in each country and talks about organising a sub-regional seminar winding up with a continental meeting. The ILO has pledged funds for three such meetings in Nigeria, Tanzania and Guinea bringing together trade union leaders, general secretaries of affiliates, women's organisations and research and education officers. 'We are also pushing African governments to develop the necessary political will for the integration of their economies through the establishment of  the African Economic Community', he says.
<p>
	But his organisation has ambitions too of being a 'creator of employment' through such things as investment in small and medium-sized enterprises. He points out that in Tunisia, for example, one affiliate owns an insurance company while another runs a hotel. The organisation is hoping to attract EDF backing to build a new African Labour College in Ghana and a new Secretariat. The Chinese government is already offered some funding.

	Both men feel Europe can also directly support labour rights in Africa by linking it with trade. The idea is that if labour standards are not respected, sanctions may  follow - the much-discussed 'social clause' to trade agreements. 'We think the EU could help us by sanctioning countries where trade union rights are not respected ', argues Mr Kailembo.
<p>
	Hassan Sunmonu notes, on this issue, that 'difficulties will arise over who is the accuser and who is the judge. You need a mechanism akin to that of the ILO, where, if a government breaks the rules, you can make a complaint about the violation, and there is a committee which judges the case on the basis of international labour standards. We want transparency and justice, and the application of universal standards in areas such as the use of child labour.'
<p>
	Both men talk animatedly about the future and echo the thoughts set out at the end of the ICFTU study. This says that 'Africa is on the threshold of a new political, economic and social era where trade unions can once again play the positive role they once enjoyed in the struggle for independence. If the challenges of this altered environment are to be met successfully, a new vision is needed to guide the leadership, allowing for workers to go beyond past restraints in forging an innovative, truly African style of dynamic trade unionism and industrial relations.'

<a name="abs"><hr><h3>Abstract</h3></a>
<p>
Post-independence strategies gave the state a lead role in managing development, often excluding other
actors. During the 1980s, this centralist, top-down approach was challenged. Structural adjustment
and democratisation processes created space for direct involvement of civil society actors. Institutional
pluralism, participatory development and decentralisation became the new buzzwords. Against this
background, the European Union (EU) introduced the concept of "decentralised cooperation" into the
Lom&#233; IV Convention. It allows a wide variety of partners outside central government to use
Lom&#233; resources, which in the past were the monopoly of central government agencies. NGO's
in particular, moved to the forefront as the 'third institutional sector' along with the state and business.
<p>
This new approach to aid delivery has great potential. Direct support to civil society actors may bring
development closer to the people, enhance local ownership and accountability. Actively involving local
actors is often seen to be the best investment in "capacity development."
<p>
Progress in implementation, however, has been limited. There are strong political, bureaucratic and
cultural resistances to decentralised cooperation. Neither central government, nor donors have much
experience in working with civil society actors as equal partners  -- rather than simply as beneficiaries
or executing agencies. It is not clear what decentralised cooperation actually means and what makes
it so different from traditional approaches. Implementation is hampered by a lack of appropriate
dialogue structures (interfaces) and flexible procedures. The different actors involved still need to
clarify their new roles in decentralised cooperation and to adapt their capacities accordingly.
<p>
Using the experience of the EU under the Lom&#233; Convention, this paper introduces the concept
of decentralised cooperation, its origin and constituent elements; it identifies some of the key factors
that have hampered effective implementation; it summarises the main changes emerging from the
recent mid-term review of the Lom&#233; Convention. The final chapter draws some broader
conclusions on how to improve the implementation of decentralised cooperation.
<p>

<a name="con"><h3>THE CONCEPT OF DECENTRALISED COOPERATION</h3></a>
<p>
Decentralised cooperation was one of the innovations of the fourth Lom&#233; Convention signed in
1989 between the European Union (EU) and the ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) countries. It
paved the way for economic, social and cultural organizations (other than central bureaucracies) to
submit development projects and to obtain Lom&#233; funding. 
<p>
This innovation reflected the worldwide thrust towards political liberalisation, changing perceptions
on the role of the state in development and a search for alternative channels of aid delivery. It was
seen as a step towards greater involvement of the people directly concerned by development
programmes and a tool for the creation of a democratic fabric. It also sought to promote the active
involvement of the European civil society in development (i.e. North South partnerships between local
authorities, private sector associations, trade unions, etc.).
<p>
Several factors led to the adoption of decentralised cooperation in Lom&#233; IV:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Political changes.  The worldwide thrust towards political liberalisation of the 1980s challenged
      the state's monopoly on power and gave a boost to civil society. New conditionalities have
      emerged that link aid provision to the type and quality of government [Moore, 1993]. This,
      in turn, led to a renewed interest for decentralisation as a possible response to the financial
      crisis and lack of efficiency of the state apparatus [M'Bassi, 1995, Manor, 1995].
<p>
<li>Shifting views on the role of the state  Chambers [1993] distinguishes three clusters of views.
      The neo-Fabian ideology of the 1970s gave the state a major direct role in development. The
      neo-liberal model was a creature of the 1980s. In recent years, a new paradigm has evolved,
      based on "putting people before things, and poor people first; development through a learning
      process rather than by blueprint; decentralisation, democracy and diversity to value local
      knowledge; participation and small group and community action; and open and effective
      communication and access." Decentralised cooperation proposes a practical application of this
      paradigm. In this new approach, the role of central government is no longer to dominate the
      development policy process, but to provide an enabling environment for a variety of relatively
      autonomous institutional actors" [Oluwu, 1992].
      
<li>Concern to get value for money.  The need to enhance aid effectiveness led donor agencies to
      move away from exclusive partnerships with African bureaucracies, generally perceived to
      be "overdeveloped and unaccountable" [Fowler, 1991; see also Dia, 1993] and to embrace
      non-state actors as alternative channels of aid delivery. Decentralised cooperation was seen
      to offer major benefits. It would make it possible to reach out directly to the "primary actors"
      of development; to prevent a monopolistic and non-transparent use of resources and to build
      local capacity. 
</ul>
<p>

<a name="old"><h3>OLD WINE IN NEW BOTTLES?</h3></a>
<p>
To what extent is decentralisation cooperation really a "new" approach, and how different is it from
traditional modes of operation?
<p>
There are no easy answers to this question. Participation and decentralisation have been on the
development agenda for quite some time. There is a long-standing tradition of cooperation with local
NGO's and to a lesser extent, with local authorities. Furthermore, decentralised cooperation means
different things to different people. Some see it as a merely another financing line for NGO's. Others
argue that decentralised cooperation is about twinning or partnerships between decentralised public
authorities (as in the French system). Others, including Commission officials, claim that the purpose
of decentralised cooperation is not to finance a multitude of isolated projects, but to promote
cooperation between different actors at local level. Field managers find it difficult to see the difference
with the micro-projects scheme, introduced under Lom&#233; I (1975-1980).
<p>
The problem is compounded by the very open-ended nature of decentralised cooperation, as promoted
under the Convention. The Commission has always been reluctant to come up with clear principles,
eligibility criteria and procedures, for decentralised cooperation. This was done partly to avoid conflict
with the ACP states, partly to prevent rigidity in management. It was felt that new rules and
regulations would reduce the scope for innovation, flexibility and country specific approaches.
<p>
Yet careful reading of official reports and statements, makes it possible to identify some distinctive
basic features of decentralised cooperation programmes:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Political agenda. Decentralised cooperation is not so much a new instrument as a different
      political approach to development cooperation. There are clear linkages with the idea of
      "participatory development" and the promotion of democracy and human rights;  strengthening
      the organs of civil society is expected to gradually broaden participation of non-state actors
      in policy-making, both at local and national levels; and direct funding to a wide variety of 
      associations may help to promote the formation of interest groups which can challenge
      monopolistic tendencies and poor state performance. 
<p>
<li>Transfer of decision-making and management responsibilities. The bottom-line of decentralised
      cooperation is to support initiatives that originate directly from the local communities and 
      associations. There is no longer room for top-down forms of participation, where
      "beneficiaries" or "target groups" are invited to implement development projects designed 
      elsewhere. Decentralised cooperation aims at reducing the number of "intermediaries" in 
      managing aid and to put an end to "la logique du d&#233;veloppeur". Responsibility for
      programme identification and implementation is delegated to the lowest possible level (the 
      principle of subsidiarity). The transfer of financial responsibilities to the local actors is seen
      as the cornerstone of decentralised cooperation. This is a major innovation within the
      Lom&#233; framework. Central government agencies will no longer be able to interfere in
      the day-to-day management of decentralised operations (including sensitive issues such as
      tenders). This has led some cynics to argue that decentralised cooperation is an elegant way
      to devolve or spread corruption more evenly.
<p>
<li>Capacity Development. In decentralised cooperation, this is seen as both a means and an end.
      It make little sense to transfer management responsibilities in the absence of targeted capacity
      development programmes that enable local actors to assume their new roles. On the other
      hand, involving local actors through a process of "learning by doing" is often the best
      investment in capacity development; it helps to strengthen the capacity of civil society to
      formulate their own development priorities; and it may contribute to building strong
      intermediate organisations that can "voice" the needs of the poor. 
<p>
<li>Linkage with national development policies. Decentralised cooperation does not mean opposition
      to government, but a search for complementarities. The purpose is not to shift support away
      from government to a myriad of local NGO's. The limits of the "go it alone" approach have
      been clearly evidenced in Mozambique where, in 1990, no less than 170 foreign NGO's were
      running programmes in complete isolation from the State -- in many cases, these "new
      missionaries" had divided the country into "mini-kingdoms" [Hanlon, 1991]. Decentralised
      cooperation under Lom&#233; attempts to avoid these pitfalls. It emphasises cooperation
      rather than antagonism between central government and local actors. It wants to give a
      prominent role to local governments as a nexus between the central agencies, the donor
      community and the local actors (NGO's included).
<p>
<li>Different roles for northern partners. Decentralised cooperation is not another financing line for
      cooperation between northern associations (e.g. NGO's) and their southern counterparts. In
      contrast with the traditional NGO co-financing modalities, decentralised cooperation aims to
      directly fund a variety of local organisations. Alliance with a northern partner is still possible,
      but no longer a prerequisite to access funds. It is hoped that this will induce northern NGO's
      to reduce their heavy involvement in project execution and to take up other roles (e.g.
      capacity development of local partners, assistance in managing direct funding, lobbying and
      advocacy).
</ul>
<p>

<h3><a name="#dec">DECENTRALISED COOPERATION IN PRACTICE</h3></a>
<p>
A recent survey by the Commission, based on questionnaires completed by the Delegations, indicates
that most decentralised cooperation programmes are still experimental in nature. In several ACP
countries, political conditions are increasingly favourable to decentralised cooperation. This is
particularly the case for countries involved in decentralisation processes. Promising efforts are made
to disseminate information, to start a dialogue between state and civil society (e.g. Zimbabwe,
Senegal) and to set up decentralised aid programmes (in some cases in close collaboration with local
authorities).
<p>
On the whole, however, traditional approaches are still dominant. From the survey, it clearly appears
that most decentralised cooperation programmes are not so different from classical micro-projects. 
Local actors are seldom involved in project identification, appraisal and selection. Programme
management remains highly centralised. There is only limited delegation of financial authority. The
mobilisation of EU decentralised partners has not really materialised.
<p>
This slow pace of implementation ought not be surprising. Time is needed to change top-down
attitudes [Mukandala, 1992], to reduce levels of mutual mistrust and to agree upon new roles,
management approaches and procedures.  The main bottlenecks to effective implementation include: 
<p>

<i>Political, bureaucratic and cultural resistances in ACP states</i>
<p>
Decentralised cooperation runs contrary to the centralist state view of cooperation, which characterised
all previous Conventions. Old attitudes die hard. ACP State see little incentives to change this and to
make provision in their indicative programmes for decentralised cooperation. Many governments are
afraid to devolve responsibilities and thus to lose control over aid resources and related benefits. The
hostility towards decentralising part of the aid budgets mirrors resistance to any form of political
decentralisation. Research on the relation between African government and NGO's confirms this view:
"the amount of space allowed to NGO's in any given country is determined first and foremost by
political considerations, rather than by any calculation of the contribution of NGO's to social and
economic development" [Bratton, 1989]. The lack of clear operational guidance does not offer an
incentive for field managers to venture into decentralised cooperation. Furthermore, little progress will
be achieved if civil society actors continue to see the state as the "enemy" or to compete with each
other for donor funds and local popularity.  
<p>

<i>Conflicting views on the purpose of decentralised cooperation</i>
<p>
Decentralised cooperation meant different things to different people. ACP governments in favour of
the scheme tend to see it as a way to involve NGO's and other decentralised actors in the
implementation of Lom&#233; programmes. This reflects the fairly limited view that ACP states tend
to have on the role of decentralised actors. Local NGO's, for instance, are invited to participate in
the execution of poverty alleviation projects, aiming at mitigating the social cost of adjustment, not
to discuss the adjustment programmes themselves. This approach is consistent with the wider
decentralisation policies of most African states. The tendency for central governments has been to 
devolve its functions to the local level in order to improve implementation of projects -- to bring top-
down development closer to the people [Mutahaba, 1989]. Not surprisingly, this narrow interpretation
is questioned by decentralised actors. NGO's, for instance, increasingly want to be involved at the 
planning stage, when the country is setting its priorities. They reject the role of mere "subcontracting
agencies", i.e. cheap delivery systems for the implementation of development programmes decided
elsewhere. They argue that decentralised cooperation is not about funding, but access to joint decision-
making.
<p>

<i>Lack of adequate procedures</i>
<p>
The nature of the Lom&#233; Convention (a legal partnership agreement between the EU and ACP
governments) offers little scope for a truly decentralised approach. Lom&#233; IV procedures, for
instance, reserve a key role at each stage of the project cycle for the National Authorising Officer 
(NAO), the official ACP representative in charge of EU aid. This cumbersome decision-making and
management system is hard to reconcile with the autonomy of decentralised actors and bottom-up
participatory activities.  In addition to this, the new scheme was introduced without serious
consideration of its institutional and managerial implications. People in the field were left with no 
clear indications on how to set up and to operate decentralised cooperation programmes. Many critical
questions remain unanswered. What are the eligibility criteria and priority areas of intervention? How
are appropriate partners identified and selected? How to set up a dialogue with decentralised actors?
How is decentralised cooperation with prevailing EDF procedures? How to monitor this type of
programme? How to involve central government in decentralised cooperation and what new capacities
need to be developed, both in recipient countries and donor agencies to operate the new scheme? 
<p>

<i>Capacity problems</i>
<p>
The different actors involved are poorly equipped to use this chapter of the Convention. This certainly
holds true for civil society. Knowledge of the modalities of decentralised cooperation is extremely
low. In January 1994, the Liaison Committee of Development NGO's to the EU and MWENGO (a
Zimbabwe based NGO) organised a workshop on decentralised cooperation. Few of the African
NGO's attending the meeting had any knowledge of the Lom&#233; Convention. They find it difficult
to find their way to the Delegation and to comply with EDF procedures. In some countries,
governments and donor agencies are willing to decentralise, but they do not find a well structured and
representative civil society that has the capacity to enter into new partnerships. Lack of information
also prevents European decentralised actors from participating in the scheme. Central government
agencies, from their side, have little experience and capacity for dealing with a variety of autonomous
civil society actors. There are also capacity problems at the Commission side, particularly in the
country Delegations. Managing decentralised cooperation is a time-consuming task. It requires
specialist knowledge and skills, including with regard to participatory techniques, decentralised
management and monitoring systems. All of this is not readily available in the understaffed
Delegations. 
<p>

<h3><a name="#cha>CHANGES SINCE THE MID-TERM REVIEW</h3></a>
<p>
The mid-term review of Lom&#233; IV has recently been concluded and a new financial protocol 
agreed upon. The future Convention will have a new section on decentralised cooperation,
incorporating the main changes of the mid-term review of Lom&#233; (see new text in annex).
<p>
From the outset of the negotiations, the EU expressed a keen interest to expand the opportunities and
level of resources for this type of aid delivery. It was claimed that decentralised cooperation reflects
the primary objectives of EU development cooperation (i.e. the promotion of democracy, participatory
development and poverty alleviation).
<p>
The mandate of the EU seemed to concentrate on (i) creating space for upstream participation of
decentralised actors in defining the next National Indicative Programme (NIP); (ii) to expand the
funding opportunities for decentralised cooperation programmes in the NIP's, and (iii) to change the
rules for decision-making and management (i.e. to review the role of the NAO in allocating
Lom&#233; resources). 
<p>
This mandate has not fully materialised, partly as result of fierce opposition from ACP states against
the idea of direct funding. This led to the following compromise:
<p>
<ul>
<li>With a view of broadening participation in formulating future indicative programmes, a "Joint
      Declaration on the Consultation and Information of Agents of Development" was agreed upon.
      According to this Declaration, ACP States will endeavour to organize "exchanges of views"
      with decentralised actors and to provide "relevant information necessary for their participation
      in the implementation of the programmes." If needed, and resources are available, the
      Commission can provide financial support for this type of consultation and information
      exchange. Most decentralised actors, including the private sector, are likely to be dissatisfied
      with this timid attempt to democratize the policy dialogue on Lom&#233; programming.  
<p>
<li>Three funding modalities will be available in the new Convention. First, ACP states themselves
      can incorporate specific decentralised cooperation programmes in the NIP's. Second,
      decentralised actors can participate in the execution of government programmes included in
      the NIP. Third, and this is really new, ACP states can reserve a certain percentage of their
      NIP to finance a wide variety of decentralised activities, to be determined at a latter stage.
      The open-ended nature of this window may help to provide direct and flexible support to
      genuine local initiatives. The existence of such a specific "guichet" depends entirely on the
      goodwill of the ACP state involved. Here again, fierce defenders of decentralised cooperation
      might feel disappointed. They might have expected a stronger EU stance on this critical point,
      including the option of reducing the allocation of Lom&#233; resources to those countries
      failing to put aside money for decentralised cooperation. 
<p>
<li>The principles with regard to the role of national authorities have not been modified. ACP-EU
      cooperation support decentralised cooperation "within limits laid down by the ACP states
      concerned". This provision ought not be a problem in countries which are supportive of
      participation and decentralisation. It may help to ensure the necessary coherence between
      national development plans and local initiatives. But in countries facing poor governance
      conditions, it is a recipe for failure. It will make it very difficult to reach out to local
      populations and organisations. 
</ul>
<p>

the rules for decision-making and management (i.e. to review the role of the NAO in allocating
Lom&#233; resources). 
<p>
This mandate has not fully materialised, partly as result of fierce opposition from ACP states
against the idea of direct funding. This led to the following compromise:
<p>
<ul>
<li>With a view of broadening participation in formulating future indicative programmes, a
      "Joint Declaration on the Consultation and Information of Agents of Development" was
      agreed upon. According to this Declaration, ACP States will endeavour to organize
      "exchanges of views" with decentralised actors and to provide "relevant information
      necessary for their participation in the implementation of the programmes." If needed, and
      resources are available, the Commission can provide financial support for this type of
      consultation and information exchange. Most decentralised actors, including the private
      sector, are likely to be dissatisfied with this timid attempt to democratize the policy
      dialogue on Lom&#233; programming.  
<p>
<li>Three funding modalities will be available in the new Convention. First, ACP states
      themselves can incorporate specific decentralised cooperation programmes in the NIP's.
      Second, decentralised actors can participate in the execution of government programmes
      included in the NIP. Third, and this is really new, ACP states can reserve a certain
      percentage of their NIP to finance a wide variety of decentralised activities, to be
      determined at a latter stage. The open-ended nature of this window may help to provide
      direct and flexible support to genuine local initiatives. The existence of such a specific
      "guichet" depends entirely on the goodwill of the ACP state involved. Here again, fierce
      defenders of decentralised cooperation might feel disappointed. They might have expected
      a stronger EU stance on this critical point, including the option of reducing the allocation
      of Lom&#233; resources to those countries failing to put aside money for decentralised
      cooperation. 
<p>
<li>The principles with regard to the role of national authorities have not been modified. ACP-
      EU cooperation support decentralised cooperation "within limits laid down by the ACP
      states concerned". This provision ought not be a problem in countries which are supportive
      of participation and decentralisation. It may help to ensure the necessary coherence
      between national development plans and local initiatives. But in countries facing poor
      governance conditions, it is a recipe for failure. It will make it very difficult to reach out
      to local populations and organisations. 
</ul>
<p>
<a name=imp><h3><hr>IMPROVING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF DECENTRALISED
COOPERATION</h3></a>
<p>
Overcoming current constraints to effective implementation will, inevitably, be a slow process.
Time is needed to move away from thirty years of centralised development cooperation. The way
forward lies with practice, experimentation, learning by doing, risk-taking and critical feedback.
This, in turn, may help to prevent donor-driven, blueprint approaches to decentralised cooperation.
<p>
In this final section, we draw broader conclusions on how to improve the implementation of
decentralised cooperation -- some of which is equally relevant to bilateral agencies and northern
NGO's.
<p>
<I>1. Adopt country-specific approaches</i>
Decentralised cooperation is not done in a vacuum. Progress is likely to be influenced, to a very
large extent, by the conditions prevailing in recipient countries. Each country will have to find its
own way to implement decentralised cooperation; there is no room for standardized packages.
Decentralised cooperation will be slow to materialise if the political and economic power remains
highly centralised and civil society very fragmented. No amount of donor pressure is likely to
rapidly change this. It is likely to gain momentum in countries that have a strong commitment to
political decentralisation and a booming civil society. In countries carrying out an ambitious
decentralisation policy, donor agencies and foreign NGO's will need to make some clear choices.
What is the most appropriate "entry point" (i.e. partner) for providing support to local initiatives?
How best to use the new opportunities created at district level? How to ensure coherence between
local programmes and government decentralisation programmes?
<p>
Recent research in Uganda, to which the author was associated, indicates that different options are
possible, each presenting strengths and weaknesses. Some donor agencies might prefer to fully
support the political decentralisation process of the Ugandan government. This may lead them to
provide (direct) financial and institutional support to district structures. The advantage of this
approach is that the donor programme works within existing structures. It starts from the premise
that district structures are there to stay (which is not the case with donor agencies and foreign
NGO's). Supporting the emergence of a strong local framework for development planning and
coordination may help to ensure domestic political and administrative accountability. Linking aid
programmes to existing structures provides better chances for sustainability. This option also
carries risks. Donor programmes can be trapped in local politics. The focus on official bodies
(politicians and civil servants) may make it difficult to reach out to the bottom level and to ensure
genuine participation. Other agencies (primarily northern NGO's) might decide to choose local
communities and groups as the main "entry point."  District authorities are not neglected but
perceived in a rather functional way (i.e. as a potential resource to be tapped to ensure project
implementation). This type of decentralised cooperation  may facilitate a truly participatory
approach and capacity-building of decentralised actors. But the problem here will be to 'scale up'
toward the district structures. District authorities (lacking basic facilities, resources and appropriate
salaries) are likely to resent parallel programmes, richly endowed with operational budgets,
vehicles, topping-up salaries. This, in turn, may threaten the sustainability of the programmes.
<p>
These contrasting experiences also point to the need to adopt a comprehensive approach to
supporting decentralisation. 
<p>

<I>2. Promote cooperation rather than competition </i>
Past development practice has been characterised by the paucity of institutional forms used to
achieve development objectives. After a period of almost exclusive cooperation with central
agencies, the danger is now to radically shift donor support to private actors (including NGO's).
<p>
This is not the best path to follow. Either-or approaches have no place in decentralised
cooperation: "Development from below requires development from above, using combinations of
hard and soft political power, tight and loose bureaucratic controls, and forms of centralisation and
decentralisation, Above all, without mutual respect among levels of government, there can be no
community empowerment" (Werlin, 1989]. 
<p>
Simply "rolling back the state" is no panacea. The long-running "state-versus-market" debate has
lost much of its poignancy. Indiscriminate privatization and dismantling of the state is "as much an
error as the earlier whole-cloth commitment to centralist-bureaucratic organization" [Wunsch,
1991; Boye, 1992]. Experience in East Asia highlights the critical role of a strong and efficient
government [Ranis, 1989]. Links between democratisation and development remain haphazard
[Healey, Ketley and Robinson, 1993; Ellis, 1995]. 
<p>
Developing countries that have been successful in pursuing growth and alleviating poverty are
generally those "whose politics have concentrated sufficient power, probity, autonomy and
competence at the centre to shape, pursue and encourage the achievement of explicit and
nationally-determined development objectives" [Leftwich, 1994]. Moreover, the limitations of
"civil society" actors as development agents, working outside national policy frameworks, are
increasingly recognised [Ukpong, 1993]. Often, the division between state and civil society is not
obvious [Mamdani, 1992]. Doubts have been raised as to their capacity to have significant impact
on political reform [Fowler, 1991].
<p>
The message is clear. The polemics of centralised versus decentralised systems ought to be
avoided. Government should not be put in a position that it feels threatened or at the losing end. It
would be unwise for donor agencies simply to circumvent central government and to distribute aid
resources randomly among a wide variety of decentralised actors. Both the relevance and
sustainability of this type of activities may depend, to a large extent, on a supportive role of
governments (e.g. financing of recurrent costs). Civil society institutions can complement the
action of the state, but not replace it:  "NGO's are not the answer when the state is weak [...].
NGO's should in fact strengthen the state by making it accountable to its own people by a process
of strengthening civil society. A strong civil society invariably leads to a strong state and the
opposite is true" [Chitega, 1994]. 
<p>
The challenge is rather to convince government that decentralised cooperation may help it to
achieve the objectives of its structural adjustment programme, to help generate income, provide
employment and offset the social cost of economic and institutional reform programmes [Laidler,
1994]. In a similar vein, it has been argued that "the rise in participation will be less threatening
to the states that are strong and more institutionalized" [Van de Walle, 1994].
<p>
If levels of mutual distrust can be reduced, there is scope to establish new partnership between
governments and decentralised actors [Farrington, 1993]. Donor agencies play a critical role in
promoting this type of complementary linkages by providing adequate financial incentives.
<p>

<I>3. Develop new institutional arrangements and procedures</i>
Decentralised cooperation cannot work in the absence of new institutional arrangements for
dialogue, decision-making and implementation. This will require institutional creativity and
innovation. A first priority is to develop both new "interfaces" (dialogue structures) between
central government and decentralised actors. In several countries, this will have to be done from
scratch. Thirty years of authoritarian rule have created a major gap between state and civil society,
resulting in distrust of officialdom. There is a lack of shared norms and institutions with sufficient
legitimacy so as to ensure adherence of civil society actors. A second priority is to put in place
appropriate decision-making and implementation structures for decentralised operations.
Management authority can, for instance, be delegated to "steering committees" (representing the
different stakeholders, including central governments and donors), independent trust funds or
private agencies. 
<p>
There is equally need for efficient funding procedures, allowing for a quick response to grassroots 
initiatives. Finally, there will be little political and managerial support to transfer responsibilities
(i.e. "to lose control") in the absence of efficient monitoring and evaluation systems. To the extent
possible, these monitoring systems should be locally embedded.
<p>

<I>4. Learn to work with local governments</i>
Empirical research in different regions of the developing world has demonstrated that a nonprofit
sector, funded by external donors, is not a valid alternative to a public sector with domestic
responsibility [Meyer, 1992; Batkin, 1992]. NGO's are not in a position to substitute for central
government provision of basic services, nor is it their role. Local governments, placed in between 
NGO's and the central government, may provide a more appropriate institutional framework.  
<p>
The climate seems ripe for increasing support to local governments. In many African countries,
central government agencies are "opening up", while civil society actors are making efforts to
"scale up".  The local government system may offer a platform for democratic interaction,
participation and the search for new partnerships between different actors. 
<p>
Aid agencies have not been very good in providing support to the emergence of a viable local
governance system. At best, they have provided some financial support, technical assistance and
training to local authorities. At worst, donor agencies have simply ignored their potential role in
development policy management. In recent years, new approaches have been advocated, including 
"short-term external assistance for recurrent financing" [Therkildsen and Semboja, 1992].  
<p>
Northern NGO's will also need to reconsider their policies. For too long a time, they have tended
to by-pass local authorities, and have often weakened the structures by recruiting their staff at
higher salaries. NGO's need to work both on the "demand side" (i.e. helpg communities to be
more productive and to demand better government services) but equally on the "supply side"  --
working with line ministries and other authorities at both the provincial and local level to ensure
that they have qualified manpower, funds and equipment to work effectively. Only in those few
countries facing complete economic and political collapse should NGO's try to take on these
functions themselves [Goyder, 1994].
<p>

<I>5. Decentralising the "mind" of donor agencies</i>
This is relatively easy at the policy level, as decentralisation has become a rallying cry among
donor agencies. Adopting a 'decentralised mind' is far more difficult at the managerial and
institutional level. It implies a profound change in donor attitudes, management, procedures and
organisation -- much alike the change central government agencies have to undergo. It will require
changes in programme design and implementation, technical cooperation policies, division of
responsibilities between field offices and headquarters and accountability systems. It may need a
revision of the current project cycle, to adapt it to the participatory framework of decentralised
cooperation. There is, for instance, no room for an army of external experts, called in to quickly
elaborate a detailed programme document or to play a dominant role in implementation. Another
critical issue is the accountability requirements. Pressures on donor agencies to justify the use of
aid funds may lead them to move accountability "upwards" (i.e. towards their own constituencies)
rather than "downwards" (i.e. towards local beneficiaries). This, in turn, may increase the
administrative burden on local organisations, having to elaborate an endless stream of accounts and
reports. A possible alternative is to make greater use of local accountability systems. Perhaps the
most difficult change will be to adapt the "language" of development cooperation to the real world
and values of decentralised actors. 
<p>

<I>6. Increase knowledge</i>
<ul>
Decentralisation and participation have become new fads among donor agencies. They are
promoted almost as a panacea for improving aid effectiveness. This is a risky approach:
<p>
<li>Both concepts make assumptions about state and civil society which are neither justified nor
      even properly examined [de Kadt, Mars and White, 1992). There is, for instance, no
      guarantee that local policy-making will be more relevant, participatory and development-
      oriented than a centralised approach [Crook, 1991]. The 'politics of the belly' ('la
      politique du ventre') may find a stronger expression at local level. The recent proliferation
      of local NGO's in Africa is a signal. Their levels of legitimacy, capacity and
      accountability are extremely varied.
  
<li>Problems of capacity are likely to be even more pronounced at local level. Donor agencies
      are well-advised not to over-estimate the capacity of civil society actors to quickly assume
      a lead role or to absorb large amounts of money. It will be important to systematically
      adapt financial flows to recipient implementation capacities. Intermediary NGO's can play
      a key role in providing a link between donor agencies and local groups [Carroll, 1992].
<p>
<li>Decentralised cooperation is a highly political form of aid. Most donor agencies seem poorly
      equipped to deal with this political dimension. At best, there is a tendency to see 'local
      politics' as a general contextual element. At worst, use is made of an idealised view of
      community participation and solidarity (e.g. the myth of 'spontaneous combustion' of
      people and ideas at grassroots level). Additional research will be needed on the role of
      foreign aid and its potential impact on the internal dynamics of civic associations and their
      capacity to contribute to democratisation [Robinson, 1995].
<p>
<li>Efforts at micro-level will yield little benefit in the absence of a conducive policy framework
      at macro and meso level. Development from below requires development from above.
      Donor agencies that are serious about decentralisation need to careful analyse the limits of
      this strategy and to provide adequate support to other levels of government as well.
      Additional research could provide guidance on how this can be done effectively.

Decentralisation:<br>Acid Test for NGO's</h2>

<p>



Decentralisation processes are flowering in many Third World countries. But if they aren't
supported by strengthening of capacities, they will soon perish. NGO's, both southern and
northern, can play a key role in this process.
<p>
"Centralised government has failed. The state wasn't able to handle everything." The speaker
is Antoine Sawadogo, Director of the National Commission on Decentralisation in Burkina
Faso. Sawadogo knows what he is talking about, because he used to work with Six S, the most
famous NGO in Burkina. "But," says Sawadogo, "the demands placed on government are
increasing. There's a growing number of people who are literate, people that have their eyes
and ears wide open. Their needs have increased in an exponential way, but our means to
provide services are limited. Therefore we need capacity. If decentralisation doesn't lead to
strengthening of capacity, it doesn't really serve an end."
<p>
While decentralisation has become a buzz-word in Africa it has many meanings. It means
something different to civil servants in a central government which has to give up power than
to an elected local official who hardly has enough expertise to fulfil the new tasks; different
again for the local NGO whose accountability is contested or for the northern donor agency
that wants to channel funds more efficiently.
<p>
There is a fear that a domain with enormous possibilities could degenerate into nightmare-like
proportions.  According to ECDPM's Jean Bossuyt and Geert Laporte the way to retain some
sense of proportion is through capacity-building.
<p>
<h3>Capacity-building for all</h3>

Jean Bossuyt explains: "In Africa, one of the major changes has been an awareness that, in
development issues, the state can't be the only interlocutor with donor agencies. This has
been very much accelerated by the donors themselves who want to diversify their partners
and who are particularly interested in the NGO sector."
<p>
While "NGO's have become more involved in the execution of large programmes" Bossuyt
sees them gradually getting involved in policy debates as well. "There is a debate about
who is best at what. The central government has become smaller and smaller so there's
more space for NGO's and civil society. But the new relationships and division of tasks
haven't yet taken definite shape. Capacity-building in this situation means learning to see
the other actors, not as enemies, but as complementary partners and learning to use the
space released by decentralisation processes." 
<p>
Much learning is still needed. For example, many ACP governments still mistrust NGO's.
According to Laporte, many  MP's from ACP countries at the last ACP/EU Joint Assembly
were not interested in discussions with NGO's. "You could hear real tirades against NGO's
as being uncontrollable and unrepresentative," he says. In his view, this just proves that
capacity-building is needed for all the actors, not just the NGO's.
<p>
This includes donors. There is often a mismatch between donor expectations of NGO's and
the self-image of the NGO's. According to Bossuyt, donors see NGO's mainly as "something
the central governments weren't: flexible, efficient, working at grassroots level and knowing
the needs of the local populations." But, "NGO's feel they are being used as cheap delivery
systems." "NGO's don't just want to fill gaps, they want to sit at the table."
<p>
Reconciling some of these views, and ensuring that all the partners learn from the process is
one of the roles taken up by ECDPM. "The Centre intervenes on the common ground for all
the actors. The important thing is to get the actors around the table to plan their actions and
to spend the money properly."
<p>
A major problem in this form of cooperation is the limited capacity of NGO's to absorb
funds. "The best recipe to kill civil society altogether is to bury it under financial resources.
This is not just a theoretical possibility; it's a real danger," warns Bossuyt. He points to the
growing tendency of donors to directly finance southern NGO's.
<p>
This is causing much anxiety among northern NGO's who see direct funding as a threat.
Bossuyt argues instead that northern NGO's "should see it as an opportunity to build capacity
with southern NGO's," says Bossuyt. He would like to see direct funding leading to a re-
arrangement of tasks to everyone's benefit. 
<p>
Given the fragility of civil society in the south, he sees a role for well-considered partnership
schemes with northern NGO's. "They should become intermediaries for the southern NGO's,
they should give them capacity support, and inform them how to operate with the EU." He
expects that NGO's who do not adapt and remain as þserving-hatches for moneyþ will
disappear.

<hr>

Post-independence development strategies gave the state a lead role in managing development,
often at the exclusion of other actors in society. This led the public sector to expand well beyond
its managerial and financial possibilities. During the 1980's, a global consensus
emerged on the limits to what the public sector can achieve in promoting growth and development.
The new neo-liberal doctrine emphasized adjustment, deregulation, and privatisation. Particularly in
sub-Saharan Africa, attacks were launched on the developmental state. Structural adjustment
programmes challenged the state's monopoly on power and the African state, formerly the exclusive recipient, partner and rationale for international aid, lost its most favoured status. These changes created space for other actors in development and contributed
to the drive towards democratisation processes. At the same time, the concept of "good governance" became the new buzzword.
<p>
In recent years, the overall thrust of this new development orthodoxy has been challenged. Four
main reasons can be identified for this. First, simply "rolling back the state" proved to be no
panacea. Policies introduced to reduce the size and cost of the civil service, for instance, led to a
dramatic erosion in wage levels, such that the public sector could no longer attract and retain
qualified staff. As a result, capacity often shrank to dangerously low levels. 
<p>
Second, the long-running "state-versus-market" debate lost much of its poignancy. Indiscriminate
privatization and dismantling of the state was perceived to be as much an error as the earlier whole-cloth commitment to centralist-bureaucratic organization.
Experience in East Asia highlights the critical role of a strong and efficient government, and a "combat-ready" African public administration system is considered to require clarity of role and scope as well as ability to determine optimal levels of involvement.
 <p>
Third, research indicates that links between democratisation and development remain haphazard. Developing countries that have been successful in pursuing
growth and alleviating poverty are generally those whose politics have concentrated sufficient power, probity, autonomy and competence at the centre to shape, pursue and encourage the achievement of explicit and nationally-determined development objectives. 
<p>
Fourth, the limitations of "civil society" actors as development agents are increasingly recognised.
In gerenal, civil society actors, including NGO's, are still very weak in organizational terms and
doubts have been raised as to their capacity to have significant impact on political reform. In many cases, the division between state and civil society is not obvious,
and there is an awareness that a multitude of civil society organizations, operating outside national policy frameworks, will yield few results in their efforts to treat the development problems of Africa.
<p>
While there are very few defenders of the highly centralised bureaucratic state, the pendulum may
have swung too far in reducing the scope of action of the public sector. The key challenge now is
to ensure the transition from a role in which [governments] dominated the development policy
process to one in which they provide an enabling environment for a variety of relatively autonomous institutional actors.
<p>
This paper provides a concrete example of one such transition process in managing development
cooperation resources. Decentralised cooperation was one of the innovations of the fourth Lom&#233; Convention signed in 1989 between the European Union (EU) and 69 ACP (Africa, Caribbean and Pacific) states. It makes a wide variety of development actors eligible to use Lom&#233; resources which, in the past, were the monopoly of central government agencies. This innovation reflected changing
(donor) perceptions on the state-society relationship and development cooperation modalities. Yet
putting the concept into practice has proven difficult, and the results of decentralised cooperation under Lom&#233; IV have, so far, been dismal.

Decentralised Cooperation in Africa:<br>Finding a New Balance</h2>
<p>
<h4>Full text of an article from the <i>ECDPM Programme Highlights 1995</i>: page 1</h4>
</center>
<hr>
Nearly everyone agrees that development aid can be much more effective if it is decentralised.
This means much more involvement of non-state actors such as the private sector, trade unions,
non-governmental organisations and individual citizens, in both doing development, and thinking
about it. But no-one knows just how to make decentralised cooperation happen.
<p>
"In the past, most aid flowed directly from one bureaucracy to another. Target groups -
beneficiaries - were very distant actors," ECDPM's Jean Bossuyt said. "This approach has not
been very efficient and, as a result also of the democratisation process, it's now accepted that
aid has to be managed in a much more pluralistic way."
<p>
Many donors, including the European Union, are looking for ways to increase the involvement
of non-state actors in designing and implementing development.
<p>
While most people in the aid sector accept this, the question is how to put theory into practice.
"This is indeed rather difficult," Bossuyt agreed. 
<p>
Difficult in part because centralised ACP governments feel threatened, they do not want to lose
control over "their" aid. Difficult also because donor agencies have little experience in dealing
with non-governmental actors or local governments as equal partners. They are more used to
thinking of them as beneficiaries or executing agencies. Difficult finally, because civil society
often sees the state as an "enemy" rather than  a partner.
<p>
Distrust of government is not the only constraint. Many non-state actors are unwilling to work
together. "They all want their own money and activities," Bossuyt explained. "But decentralised
cooperation is not just about shifting money from government to non-state actors. The idea is that
different actors work together to solve local problems."
<p>
But regardless of how much is given to non-state actors, government cannot be eliminated from
the picture. "Decentralised cooperation does not mean opposition to government. It aims to foster
cooperation between local authorities and civil society," Bossuyt said. Ultimately, it could help
to find a new balance between state and society, as now seems to be happening in Uganda.
<p>
<h3>Uganda Shows the Way</h3>
<p>
Regarding decentralisation, Uganda is one of the front-runners in Africa. It has a policy to
devolve many government functions, particularly of the line ministries, to its 39 districts.
<p>
Central government is politically committed to decentralisation. Indeed, some budgets have
already been decentralised and local governments have resources to carry out most of their new
responsibilities.
<p>
Bossuyt recently looked at decentralised projects in Uganda. "It was highly instructive," he said.
"It shows that if national governments really support decentralisation, then decentralised
cooperation  can flourish."
<p>
Alongside the Government's strategy, a long-term programme of Danish support to local
government is helping to ensure that there is sufficient capacity in the districts to take on their
new roles. According to Bossuyt, "it provides a meeting place for people to participate in
priority-setting and implementing development activities."
<p>
The Danish approach also builds capacity. "Elderly people, women and others discuss important
issues among themselves and make decisions. They realise they have to take part. By giving
them a stake in local decision-making and implementation of programmes, you also give them
an opportunity to learn and to develop their own ideas and capacities," Bossuyt said.
<p>
Administrative decentralisation of the Ugandan state has undoubtedly helped decentralised
cooperation efforts also. According to Henrik A. Nielsen, recently returned from a two-year
spell in Uganda, the "setting for decentralised cooperation is particularly fruitful in Uganda
precisely because the national strategy promotes this way of thinking."  What they do in their
daily work has a positive effect on their approaches to decentralised cooperation. While he
regards the Ugandan situation as "quite unique," he warned that it poses significant problems for
the donors.
<p>
<h3>Donors Still Need to Learn</h3>
<p>
In Uganda, most donors are still not thinking in the same ways as the Ugandan government, and
they frequently pursue their own strategies without taking serious account of changes in local
decision structures.
<p>
Nielsen spent the past two years as Chief District Adviser in Uganda's Rakai District as part of
the Danish programme to support the Government's decentralisation efforts. He is therefore well-
placed to comment on what he sees as the "main issue" -- that donors must adapt their actions
to reflect local choices. "The problem is the donors", he said.
<p>
What is particularly troublesome is that while donors call for increased decentralisation of aid
resources, their own procedures and working methods remain centralised and bureaucratic.
<p>
According to Nielsen, donors need to "decentralise their minds." This requires major changes
in their overall strategies and in programme design and implementation, adjustments to technical
cooperation, and accountability systems that reflect realities in the field.
<p>
The future outlook is positive however. Visitors from all over Africa come to Rakai District to
see how decentralised administration is supported by decentralised cooperation, while also
respecting the new roles of central government.
<p>
Said Bossuyt: "In the future, it will be essential that we collect, analyse, and disseminate such
examples of best practice, and that we incorporate them into donor thinking and practice.
Decentralisation is not just an African issue."

<hr>
<h3>Summary</h3>
Modes of donor assistance shift according to the policies and
attitudes changing in the donor community and in the donor countries
themselves. However, the effects of the interventions are also
highly dependent on the policies of the recipient countries, and
only when the policies of both partners converge and support each
other, are the chances for successful and lasting results good.
<P>
The emergence of a renewed interest in local government and decentralisation
in the early 1990's is  due to several reasons:
<UL>
<LI> increased emphasis on popular participation and democratisation
(in which, the decentralisation of decisions for local communities
is seen to be essential);
<LI> the economic crisis forcing donors and national governments
to look for other ways to mobilise local resources;
<LI> frustration with the results of planning and implementation
through central governments which lack capacity and legitimacy;
<LI> the recognition that a well-functioning public administration
is an indispensable part of a modern developing society consisting
of both a private, market-driven production sector and a service-delivering
public sector, managed by legitimate and representative political
leaders, both at national level and at the level of local governments.
</UL>
<P>
The donor community has slowly, but increasingly realised the
development potential of decentralisation and popular participation,
and acted by supporting local reform processes, decentralised
planning, or specific local government programmes. However, there
are not many studies on the experiences gained from such donor
supported interventions, and very few as viewed from local government.
Most of the available studies appear to conclude that donors can
only play a modest role in decentralisation processes.
<P>
In this paper, decentralisation and donor interventions is seen
from the <U>perspective of a local government</U> in Uganda, as
experienced by the Rakai District during 1990-95. This period
covers the preparation of the Rakai District Development Programme
(RDDP), supported by the Danish International Development Assistance
(DANIDA), the implementation of phase 1 (January, 1992 up to September,
1995) and the preparation of phase 2 (running from October 1995
to September 1999). Experiences from Rakai show that if a national
policy aiming at substantial devolution of powers and resources
to local governments exists, then donor interventions are important
in terms of providing resources and illuminating strategic options
for local governments, and that their procedures and approaches
can be a major factor in determining for the level of political
and administrative capacity-building</U>, i.e. in developing democratic
decision-making and local participation.
<P>
In the following, a brief introduction to Ugandan decentralisation
policy is given. The actual implementation by the central government
and line ministries is illustrated through a discussion of the
difficult changes of attitudes and activities that followed the
enactment of the Local Government Statute in 1993. The creation
and key elements of the DANIDA-supported programme are presented
and followed by a brief account of related interventions of other
donors in the District. Finally, a number of conclusions and recommendations
relevant to decentralised cooperation as presented. These reflect
the view from Rakai District, situated at a cross-roads where
the interventions of donors meet the interference of Central Government.

<b>
Development cooperation is seen as having important political implications and lobbying is,
therefore, undoubtedly one the NGOs' major roles. Although, for the majority, this is
secondary to their main task of carrying out development actions, there are some (such as the
World Development Movement in the UK) that focus almost exclusively on this activity.
NGO networks have also been established for this specific purpose. Eurostep, which was set
up to coordinate the lobbying work of a large number of European NGOs, is an example of
one of these. The network pursues two main objectives: to influence official development
cooperation policies implemented by the multilateral institutions promoting alternative models
based on the specific NGO perspective, and to improve the quality and effectiveness of the
aid provided by these organisations. We approached Eurostep to provide us with their views
on the lobbying process, the motivations which lie behind it and the outcomes, if any. We
also asked them to focus on lobbying in the context of the European Union. Here is their
frank - and sometimes pointed contribution.
</b>
<p>
     On a grey December morning in 1992, a group of people are protesting outside the
Council of Ministers' building in Brussels. This is an almost daily occurrence, but what
makes this event unique is the three dromedaries and turbaned Tuaregs who are among the
protesters. This colourful protest against European beef dumping in the Sahel was organised
by Eurostep, a relatively new face in the growing crowd of lobbying organisations in
Brussels. The initiative to create a European network, with the overall aim of influencing EU
development policies, was taken by experienced leaders of some of Europe's major NGOs.
The founders, who came from Belgium, Denmark, France, The Netherlands, Italy and Great
Britain, had, through their work with the European Commission, realised that it was no
longer sufficient to have a relationship only with their national government. The EU was here
to stay and decisions on development policies would increasingly be taken in Brussels.
Another realisation was that, in order to be effective, the network should have members in
all EU countries, and preferably also in European countries outside the Union. Members
should be actively involved in the South and membership would be limited to two
organisations per country.
<p>
     When the Eurostep secretariat in Brussels was set up in 1991, it had 21 like-minded,
non-denominational organisations as members. They come from 13 European countries and
are working in more than 90 developing nations in Africa, Asia and Latin America. Their
combined financial contribution to development actions amounts to more than ECU 400
million. To have members actively involved in the South was seen as fundamental for the
advocacy work of Eurostep. Policies have to be founded on the experience of the members
together with their Southern partners.
<p>
     Another important feature is the economic independence of the network. Eurostep is
run on annual membership fees, divided into three categories according to the member
agency's yearly income. Because it is not funded by the EC or any other institution, the
network is free to pursue objectives which might not always be in line with official policy.
Each year the General Assembly reviews Eurostep's programme and sets the priorities for
the following year. These are influenced largely by the official agenda for development
cooperation at the European level, by the members' own concerns and by what is happening
in the UN. 
<p>
     Eurostep concentrates on a limited number of issues. The 'lead agency' principle
implies that member organisations take a leading role in the development and implementation
of programme activities. This ensures both that members are actively involved in the work
of the network and that the activities reflect the concerns of the member organisations and
their partners in developing countries. The following are some of the areas where actions has
been pursued: Africa Recovery; Lom&#233; IV; Environment; World Summit for Social
Development; Trade; Gender; World Bank; Great Lake Region and EU Presidencies.
<p>
     For each of the issues in the programme there is a working group. One example is
the Gender Working Group, currently focusing its energy on issuing position papers in the
run up to the Beijing conference. The Group meets once a year but it has a Task Force which
convenes approximately every two months to take the work forward and monitor EU and
international conferences. The Gender Group has two lead agencies: Oxfam UK for the
advocacy, and NCOS, Belgium to engender activity among the member agencies.
<p>
     Three people are employed in the Brussels secretariat. The members' insistence on
having a small secretariat has several advantages, apart from the obvious financial one. For
example, it means the members feel obliged to undertake work themselves. Also, the staff
know each other well and are able to create an  atmosphere characterised by good inter-
relationships and appreciation of the work of each member of the team. The latter is
absolutely essential if success is to be achieved while working under constant pressure.
<p>
     Measuring the concrete results of lobbying activities is always a tricky matter. The
effects may depend on a change in mentality in how development should be seen and
pursued. Such changes may take years. We do believe, however, that some concrete changes
have been achieved due to our efforts, in cooperation with other networks and NGDOs. For
example, an EU decision to launch a special initiative for recovery programmes, backed by
more than ECU 100 million, came after  NGDO lobbying during the Danish Presidency. A
permanent budget line for rehabilitation - another NGDO objective - has also been established
with the help of the European Parliament. During the same Presidency, Eurostep pushed for
extra personnel for the 'women in development' desks in the external relations and
development departments of the Commission. Two extra people were employed.
<p>
     With the approach of the Lom&#233; IV mid-term review in 1994, which saw 
proposals that could radically alter the nature of the agreement, Eurostep helped to set up a
joint programme in collaboration with the three other major Brussels-based NGDO networks,
(APRODEV, CIDSE and the NGO-EU Liaison Committee). The purpose was to monitor the
review and contribute to the debate with comments and proposals. Two main reports and six
smaller consecutive reports were produced.
<p>
     The World Social Summit was also closely monitored by Eurostep. Position papers
were drafted before each preparatory committee and reports on the progress of the official
and NGO meetings were written after each session. These inputs were greatly appreciated by
NGOs and official delegates. If one compares the NGOs 'Quality Benchmark' paper for the
Summit with the final official paper, it is clear that the NGOs had a major impact on the
outcome. A careful assessment has to made in each case however, in order to evaluate the
time and money put into such a UN event by NGOs in relation to the output. The major
'success' to date, however, has clearly been the beef dumping case.
<p>
     The impact of EU agricultural subsidies on developing countries is a major cause for
concern, and with this in mind, Eurostep produced a report in 1992 calling for further
reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy. This was followed in 1993 by a campaign
focusing on EU subsidies for beef to West Africa. The research, undertaken by Novib,
Eurostep's lead agency on trade, at the request of their partner in the area, showed how
European surplus frozen beef, dumped on markets in the Sahel, prevented local farmers from
selling their fresh meat, as they could not compete on price. It also revealed a lack of
coherence between agricultural and  development policies. On the one hand, development aid
was given to the Sahelian farmers, while on the other, surplus agricultural products were
being dumped with the result that the same farmers were being driven out of business.
<p>
     During the research, fraud involving EU subsidies was also discovered by chance. It
was revealed that some EU exporters were being funded to sell a product containing
substantially less meat than required and whose fat content was much too high to be eligible
for export refunding. The dossier was handed over to the fraud administration of the
Commission. When the campaign began on that December morning in 1992, with Sahelian
farmers handing over the report to the President of the Council, it attracted support from 250
organisations in Europe and West Africa. TV reporters and journalists from several EU
countries covered the event. The European Parliament also became actively involved,
supporting the demands for abolition of subsidies and policy coherence.
<p>
     At the same time Eurostep members sent the report to their ministries of agriculture
and development, and requested talks with the responsible ministers. Although all accusations
were denied from the outset, EU export restitutions on capas destined for West Africa are
now 28% lower than when we started the campaign. After the first reduction of 15% in June
1993, for West Africa only, three successive reductions of 5% for all destinations were
decided (in July and November 1993, and January 1994). EU exports to the region have
decreased and Sahelian farmers are regaining their market share. In combination, the
reduction in EU-expert subsidies and the devaluation of the CFA Franc are largely
responsible for this encouraging result. Other positive news is that the European Commission
has accepted an internal guideline which is intended to bring about a coherent EU policy
towards the livestock sector of West Africa.
<p>
     Though this is a 'success story' seen from the point of view of a lobbying network
the main question still remains: how to make the EU coherent in all its policies.
<p>
     Having a small office, as underlined above, has positive aspects but it also has its
negative side. There is a lack of time to pursue all the things which need to be done. An
advocacy office needs to have a very clear overview of who is who in the European
institutions. Time is needed to develop connections. But elections mean that there are changes
in the composition of the Parliament. Commissioners also change or move to new portfolios
and within the administration, new geopolitical visions mean changes to the structure and
composition of the directorates-general just as one is beginning to understand the old set-up.
<p>
     For a Brussels-based NGO, the European Parliament is without doubt its best ally.
The Parliament is open and most parliamentarians have the outlook that being the only
democratically elected EU institution, they should listen to the 'people' and put forward their
concerns if they find them reasonable.
<p>
     The Council is a more distant institution, but this is not a particular problem for the
Eurostep secretariat as Council lobbying is undertaken by the network's members at national
level. The Council press-department is easily accessible and its personnel is very helpful in
finding and forwarding press releases and reports of Council meetings.
<p>
     A problem which crops up now and then, is that Council reports are first printed in
French, and it can take weeks to get them in English, which is Eurostep's working language.
Another difficulty is access to the agenda of the Council meetings. This is probably not the
fault of the Council but rather of the rotating Presidencies. One somewhat surprising
experience during the recent Danish Presidency was the discovery that openness (one of
Denmark's main themes), certainly had its limits. In spite of some good results and the very
positive working relations with the Danish Minister of Development, it was very difficult for
the Working Group on the Presidency to get information in either Brussels or Copenhagen.
In one specific instance we did get some information, but it was from the UK, where the
ODA seems to take the attitude that NGOs can be knowledgable partners who might offer a
useful input.
<p>
     The same difficulty of access is often experienced with the Commission. It is possible
to develop relationships with single individuals but generally, the Commission papers are
heavily guarded until they become public. We experienced this problem when seeking
information about the Commission's work on the Cairo Summit. The views of an American
stagiaire at Eurostep, writing subsequently in an internal report are instructive. She had
thought the US Congress was difficult, but went on to say had never experienced
'bureaucracy like this before'. As a result of this, and in order to understand better the
working methods of the Commission, Eurostep, together with WIDE (Women in
Development in Europe), carried out research and published a report entitled 'Gender
mapping of the European Union'.
<p>
     Our vision of a good relationship with the Commission, is where the official drafting
a policy paper finds it natural to contact a relevant NGO to hear its views on the subject. We
should also like to see NGO-networks like Eurostep, which produce newsletters on EU
development policies that are sent all over the world, allowed to attend the relevant press
conferences and receive press information from the Commission.
<p>
     The President of the Commission has spoken of the need for more openness and for
the EU to get closer to its citizens, by explaining things better to the citizens of Europe. We
have another and very simple proposal. Let us work together!

<title>Evaluation of the Framework Agreements between DANIDA and Four Danish NGOs</title>
</HEADER><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

Evaluation of the Framework Agreements between DANIDA<br>and Four Danish NGOs.
<p>
(DANIDA Evaluation Summary No. 1994/3)
<p>
For more information on <a href="daneval.htm">DANIDA's Evaluation Unit</a></h3>
</center><p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>Background</h3>
In 1992 Danida channelled DKK 714 million through the NGO Sector (excluding disaster relief)
accounting for approximately 18% of the total Danish bilateral assistance. In 1991/92 Danida entered
into Framework Agreements with DanChurchAid (DCA), Danish Red Cross (DRC), Ibis and The
Danish Trade Union Council for International Development Cooperation (LO/FTF). The four NGOs
account for approximately 60% of the total funds channelled from Danida to the NGOs for
development projects and programmes. 
<p>
The Agreements should facilitate a flexible administration and implementation of the development
assistance, a coherent planning of the NGO activities based on programme principles, the strength-
ening of the dialogue between Danida and the NGOs, the assessment of the NGOs' capacity and a
reduction of the administrative requirements for Danida in the cooperation with the major NGOs.
<p>
The main objective of the evaluation is "to assess to what extent the Agreements have achieved their
operative goals and, on the basis of identified problems (if any), prepare recommendations for revising
the operative goals and/or changes in administrative procedures".
<p>
The evaluation was carried out from February to June, 1994 by a team of consultants from the Danish
firm COWIconsult A/S.
<p>

<h3>Main Findings</h3>

<h4>The Concept of the Agreements</h4>
<p>
The concept is based on a hybrid between a block grant scheme and the traditional form of project
cooperation. The key elements are the activity plans and the annual appropriations. The appropriations
are based on an assessment of the activity plans describing a project portfolio. The activity plans do
not include an overall programme for the NGOs' activities. Furthermore, the activity plans contain
only brief information on the activities, which is making it difficult to obtain an overview and to
assess the proposed projects. Hence, the Agreements do not ensure the application of a coherent
approach for planning and implementation of the NGOs' development activities. Nor do they ensure
that a dialogue takes place between Danida and the NGOs regarding comparative advantages, strat-
egies, modes of operation, development policies and programmes.
<p>
<h4>Capacity Assessments</h4>
The Document approved by the Parliament's Finance Committee required that Danida, prior to the
Agreements, should carefully analyze the professional and administrative capacity of the organisations
to manage project assistance. The capacity assessments could have formed a good basis for
discussions on the development of the organisations and modes for cooperation between the two
parties. However, such assessments were not made prior to the Agreements.
<p>
<h4>Funding</h4>
A relatively large part of the four NGOs' development activities are still funded by Danida through
other appropriations, but the Framework Agreements have played an increasingly important role in
Danida's cooperation with the NGOs. The phasing out of "entrepreneur projects" (i.e. projects carried
out by NGOs at Danida's request) will have considerable implications for the overall Danida funding
to the three major NGOs: Ibis, DRC and DCA.
<p>
<h4>Corporate Planning and Management Framework</h4>
The secured funding for a four year period has enabled the NGOs to make long-term plans in respect
of project activities, organisational changes and staff development. The Framework Agreements have
required less from the organisations in terms of preparing documentation to Danida compared to
funding under the previous arrangements.
<p>
<h4>Coherent Planning</h4>
The Framework Agreements have not yet fostered a more coherent planning approach. The activity
plans prepared by the NGOs are generally based on an ad hoc project approach, without overall strat-
egies and programmes. However, the three major NGOs are in the process of developing policies and
strategies for their activities. The process has mainly been fostered by the general increase in funding,
but the flexibility provided by the Agreements has played a facilitating role.
<p>
<h4>Implementation Performance</h4>
The three major NGOs have generally been capable of planning and implementing projects according
to the time schedules outlined in the approved activity plans. Hence, the disbursements have come
very close to the approved budgets. In the case of LO/FTF the disbursements have been considerably
below the budgeted figures.
<p>
<h4>Assessments of Plans </h4>
The Agreements are not explicitly outlining the criteria to be applied by Danida in the assessment of
the activity plans, with respect to e.g., compliance with the overall principles for Danish assistance,
the NGOs' comparative advantages and the technical appraisal of the projects proposed. The brief
presentation of the project portfolio does not provide a coherent overview of the strategies and
policies applied by the NGOs, nor a comprehensive description of the projects. The desk officers of
the regional departments in charge of screening the proposals are uncertain of their role in the process
and seem to apply different criteria in the assessments.
<p>
<h4>Innovative Small Scale Projects</h4>
The bulk of the funding is still being used for traditional large projects. However, the use of funds
for minor experimental and innovative projects, within the DKK 250,000 limit, has clearly increased
over the years. The ability to develop small innovative projects and new approaches is closely linked
to the NGOs' mode of operation. NGOs with a local representation is able to develop project ideas
with local partners and monitor the activities closely. The NGOs operating through an international
structure rely mainly on the capability of this structure to provide proposals. 
<p>
<h4>Improved Dialogue</h4>
The discussions between the two parties have focused on administrative problems rather than on
policies, programmes and strategies. The Agreements have been given a low priority by the regional
departments within Danida. This may be attributed to the uncertainty within the departments of their
role and responsibilities. Contrary to the picture in general, the dialogue between Danida's Information
Department and the NGOs has improved as a result of the Agreements. The embassies have no or
very limited information on the activities covered by the Agreements, and the dialogue with the NGOs
is mainly confined to the organisations having Danish representatives or staff in the respective
countries.
<p>

<h3>Main Recommendations</h3>

A revision of objectives and administrative procedures is recommended. The revision should be based
on the objectives outlined in the Strategy for Danida's NGO Cooperation. The Framework Agreements
should apply a programme approach facilitating the development of the NGOs' analytical capability,
coherent strategies for development cooperation, improved relations to partners, professional expertise,
and establishment of closer linkages between the constituencies of the organisations in the South and
North.
<p>
Capacity assessments should be carried out for all NGOs holding or wishing to hold Framework
Agreements. The capacity assessments should form the basis for agreements between Danida and the
NGOs regarding the country and sector priorities and mode of cooperation with local partners.
<p>
The appropriations should be based on country programmes focusing on plans and activities with local
partners. The appropriations should be country specific. The country programmes shall address, but
not necessarily be limited to, the following issues:
<ul>
<li>     The international partners and mode of cooperation
<li>     The technical assistance provided by the NGOs
</ul><p>
Danida's requirements regarding professional control of the activities implemented by the
organisations should be accomplished through a regular cycle for updating the NGO capacity
assessments and execution of thematic evaluations of the NGOs' programmes. The development of
the NGOs since the last capacity assessment should be addressed during the annual consultations.
<p>
The responsibility for the professional quality of the activities planned and implemented should rest
with the NGOs. Within Danida, the Policy Department and the NGO Window should be responsible
for ensuring that the country programmes comply with the general principles for Danish bilateral
assistance and the conditions for NGO assistance. The regional departments should be responsible for
assessing the compatibility of the country programmes with Danida's bilateral programme and
government policies. The Danish embassies should be involved in the assessment of the country pro-
grammes. The regional departments should invite the NGOs for annual consultations concerning their
country programmes.
<p>
The Steering Group in Danida - comprising representatives from the regional departments, the Finance
Department (StS.2), Information Department (StS.3) and the Policy Department (S.1) including the
NGO Window -  should invite the organisations for annual meetings to discuss the NGOs' overall
strategies for providing assistance, the outcome of the thematic evaluations and the development
within the organisations since the last capacity assessment.
<p>

<h3>Lessons Learned</h3>

The Framework Agreements with the four NGOs do not ensure a coherent planning approach and
synergy between NGO activities and other forms of Danish bilateral development assistance. The
Framework Agreements lack an essential element to achieve a concerted planning approach and
improved dialogue between Danida and the NGOs, viz. country specific programmes for the NGOs'
activities.
<p>
The planned capacity assessments could have been an important tool for strengthening the dialogue
between the two parties. However, they remain to be carried out.
<p>
The regional departments in Danida have devoted too few resources to the cooperation with the four
NGOs. 
<p>

<h3>Danida's Comments and Follow-Up</h3>

Danida generally agrees with the findings and recommendations of the evaluation report. One of the
framework NGOs has expressed reservation towards some of the findings and recommendations.
<p>
Danida has already entered into a dialogue with the four framework NGOs, with regard to follow-up
on the recommendations of the report.
<p>
The first capacity assessment of a NGO considering to enter into a Framework Agreement (Care
Danmark) was carried out in the spring of 1994. Capacity assessments of the present four framework
NGOs will be carried out in 1994/95. The recommendations and findings of the report will be a key
source of inspiration for the formulation of a new set of guidelines for Danida's future cooperation
with framework NGOs.
<p>
Some of the recommendations address the need for changing Danida's administrative set-up. These
will be considered as part of the overall follow-up on Danida's NGO Strategy Towards the Year 2000.

<title>First report on decentralised cooperation</title>

First report on decentralised cooperation</h2>
<h4>
<p>
News Item from <i>The Courier ACP-EU</i><br>No. 157, May-June 1996</h4>
<h5>(Note: this text may differ slightly from the printed version)
</h5>
<a href="../index_uf.htm">EUFORIC Home Page</a><br>

<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
A report on the experience of decentralised cooperation in its initial years has been approved by
the European Commission. This is to be presented for information purposes to the Council of
Ministers and the European Parliament.
<p>
The rapid growth of this form of cooperation between 1993 and 1995 has made it possible to
present a comprehensive assessment based on a significant number of decentralised projects and
programmes currently being implemented. Decentralised cooperation is not so much a new
instrument as a different approach in the conception and implementation of development
cooperation which complements traditional methods.
<p>
The report covers all regions where the EC in involved in cooperation - ACP countries, overseas
countries and territories, the Mediterranean region, Latin America and Asia.
<p>
It should be pointed out that the document in question does not cover all the development fields, 
or actors, that fall within the wider definition of the term 'decentralised cooperation'.  It does not, for
example, deal with the subject of enterprise promotion or the development of the private sector.
These areas, which are subject to the same broad approach, have their own specific cooperation
instruments and hence, their own individual reports.
<p>
The main focus of the report is, therefore, on local authorities and organisations operating within
civil society. It highlights the diverse nature of the experiences that have been gained in the field of
decentralised cooperation and the wide variety of outcomes resulting from the different conditions
prevailing in different geographical areas. The report also underlines the fact that this is an evolving
area where ideas are still developing and new possibilities have still to exploited.
<p>
In the Mediterranean countries, Latin America and Asia, this kind of cooperation is developing all
the time, with local and public authorities as well as with universities and NGOs. The same
observation can be made for a growing number of ACP countries, where collaboration with NGOs,
local authorities and the private sector is on the increase.
<p>
In conclusion, the report highlights three 'lines of attack' in the development of decentralised
cooperation:
<ul>
<li>to launch a more sustained basis for dialogue with the developing country actors involved in
such cooperation, preferably at the country or regional level;
<li>to strengthen the dialogue with possible European actors in this area, in which connection the
NGO Liaison Committee could play an important role in bringing such actors and the European
institutions together;
<li>to achieve more flexibility of and complementarity between aid instruments so as to ensure that
decentralised cooperation takes its proper place in the EU's policies and programmes.
</ul>

<p>
<h3>Institutions</h3>
<P>
North (1990) has pointed out that 'institutions' can mean two different things. First are the <I>rules</I> - legal or customary - for assigning and managing resources, such as the customs and laws affecting land ownership and tenure; transfer and inheritance of assets; or relations between employer and employee, or parent and child. Second are the <I>organizations</I> defending particular interests (e.g. trade unions), including the State's interest in implementing or altering rules (e.g. police, some aspects of education).<P>
	Until quite recently, mainstream development economics - sometimes respectfully or timidly; sometimes dismissively or arrogantly - put institutions into a ghetto. These rules or organizations were the &quot;other things&quot; deemed &quot;equal&quot; and left to the care of sociologists or political scientists, or even politicians. Whether neo-classical, Marxist or structuralist, economists almost all viewed these &quot;institutions&quot; as largely outside their area of competence or interest, and often as so random and <I>ad hoc</I> as to defy serious study (by which they tended to mean empirical, often reductive, analysis). The &quot;institutional economics&quot; of Veblen and Commons did not convince mainstream economists. It seemed to fail to generate testable theories. A set of inductivist cases was taken by mainstream economists as the only result, and as a proof that they could achieve very little by going into institutional (especially micro) details.<P>
<P>
There have been two great uprisings against this neglect of institutions in the last 10-20 years: &quot;new institutional economics&quot; and &quot;new political economy&quot;. Both attempt to theorize institutions by making their (predicted) behaviour endogenous to economic incentives. Yet the great bulk of macro-economic analysis, of poverty studies, and especially of the <I>intersection</I> between these two (e.g. the analysis of the effects of structural adjustment on the poor), proceeds as if those uprisings had not taken place. Institutions are usually still largely ignored, or ghettoized as &quot;other factors&quot; that may alter the pace of change slightly, but can never (for example) <I>reverse</I> the effect on poor people of a particular economic policy, such as food price liberalization. Yet a moment's thought will show that, if the rules of land tenure and inheritance promote great rural inequality, the prospects that liberalized and therefore higher food prices will harm the poor must be much greater than if those rules promote great rural equality. A little more thought will persuade us that the rules of tenure, as they relate to access to political power, affect the likelihood, speed, and manner of <I>implementation</I> of any agreement by a Third World government (e.g. in a structural-adjustment deal with a donor) to liberalize and therefore raise food prices.<P>
<P>
The first uprising against the &quot;segregation&quot; of institutional factors is the <I>new institutional economics</I> (NIE). This takes two forms. Sometimes, institutional frameworks, especially rules of property rights are seen as <I>determining</I>: it is argued, for example, that secure, registered, individual land titling is a necessary precondition for agricultural growth in Africa. At other times, institutions are seen as <I>determined</I>: for example, share cropping, tractorization, or land-saving agricultural innovations (the &quot;green revolution&quot;) are seen as evolving in response to factor scarcities, especially land scarcity, and to the need to reduce &quot;transactions costs&quot;, especially the cost of obtaining reliable information. In both cases, the implication is that anti-poverty policies have to treat institutions as <I>part of</I> the economic system, not as readily &quot;reformable&quot; <I>levers upon</I> the economic system. If land reform or labour-using agricultural research is seen as important for poverty reduction, then one has to create the incentives - often, the factor-scarcities, or the prospects for reducing transactions-costs - to change rules and organizations, so that such changes take place. Conversely, <I>given the strength of existing institutions</I> (organizations plus rules) and the balance of powers impinging on them, outside donor pressures to &quot;help the poor by reducing <I>price biases</I> against them&quot; - e.g. against non-food labour-intensive agriculture - will be offset by increased <I>non-price biases</I> against the group that has benefited from the reduction in price biases.<P>
<P>
The second uprising against economists' attempts to &quot;ghettoize&quot; institutions is the so- called <I>new political economy</I> (NPE). NPE sees politicians and civil servants as maximizing some self-interested goal - income, power, or patronage. Rent-seeking is a familiar example (Krueger 1974). Another approach sees coalitions as surviving only if enough members will pay the costs, and supervise others; as a result, &quot;small is effective&quot; even if the general interest suffers (Olson 1982). NPE directs our attention to the special problems faced by poor people - and by donors trying to impose &quot;conditions&quot; in their interest - due to the greater experience and power - and more coherent, smaller groupings - of the better-off. Yet both NIE and NPE overlook the power of poor majorities - or large groups. Also, NIE and NPE can offset each other. It is arguable that NIE explains the emergence, survival and demise or transformation of institutions in the very long run, whereas NPE explains the short-run behaviour of politicians who manage organizations and set rules; but NIE and NPE are normally <I>rival</I> explanations of any given event.<P>
<P>

<h3>Civil society</h3> (this section draws, in part, on Lipton (1991a)<p>

Society is the arena in which poor and rich, individually and via their group institutions, conflict or cooperate. &quot;Civil society&quot; is society mediated by a <I>civitas</I>, city or (in an extended sense) state. (a) We tend to think of &quot;civil society&quot; in Hegel's sense of numerous, co- operative or peacefully conflicting, agents or groups, outside the state itself. (b) But a necessary condition for that is &quot;civil society&quot; in Hobbes's sense: each person, or non-state institution, surrenders coercive power to the state, on condition that all others do the same. If the state cannot enforce this, &quot;covenants, without the sword, are but words&quot; and there is no hope of any Hegelian civil society, let alone one in which the poor can contest. (c) A pre-condition even for Hobbesian civil society is that the state is able to control its own agents. If each police force is a local &quot;law unto itself&quot; - if Rome's Praetorian Guard can appoint the next Emperor - then there is no effective state to prevent the rich from forcing the poor to do what they choose, and hence no Hobbesian civil society- and, therefore, no prospect of Hegelian civil society.<P>
<P>
(a) Hegel fully realized that even Hegelian civil society does not secure the interests of the poor. Indeed, he saw the problem of poverty, and the organizational weakness of the poor, as the second most important problem of a &quot;bourgeois&quot; civil society; it implied, he claimed, that the state - having severed (or greatly weakened) traditional relationships of kin and feudal fealty so as to permit economic advance - must replace those relationships by increasingly functioning as the protector of the poor, as the guarantor of almshouses, etc. <P>
<P>
(b) Many aspects of civil society in developing countries show states as unwilling or unable to enforce Hobbesian social contracts. Cain (1982) emphasizes the contrast between Andhra Pradesh, India, where the police (more or less) enforce the law including the legal claims of the poor, and Bangladesh, where poor people pursuing legal land (or other) claims against rich people must contend with active, even violent, police opposition. <P>
<P>
(c) At an even more basic level, some governments cannot control their own agents. In Sierra Leone, army and police &quot;road blocks&quot; are used to extort payments for the right to pass freely. Such a system is bound to bear most heavily on the poor and powerless.<P>
<P>
It is these considerations - of the structure, powers, and responsibility of the state vis-&agrave;-vis freely competing civil organizations - that constitute the central issues of &quot;civil society&quot; as it impinges on the poor. The extent to which the poor can &quot;learn by doing&quot; via participatory pressure has exercised all serious thinkers about the politics of poverty reduction, from Hegel to the &quot;civic culture&quot; school of Almond and Verba (1963). The appropriate methods will obviously differ as between countries with well-developed, complex and fairly open civil societies (most of India); countries meeting the Hobbesian, but not the Hegelian, conditions (Pakistan); and countries where even the Hobbesian conditions are not met (Zaire). The poor need different <I>sorts</I> of help to confront and &quot;contourner&quot; the state and the rich in these three radically distinct sets of conditions. The effort to reduce these deep problems of &quot;civil society and poverty reduction&quot; to the question of &quot;NGOs&quot; or even &quot;local participation&quot; is reductive and unhelpful.<P>
<P>

<h3>Poverty reduction, donors and governments</h3>

Donors deal mainly with Third World <I>States</I>, not institutions or civil societies. That is because the State, through the government, (a) is the point of entry, and of force to deny entry; (b) supplies domestic currency and is therefore usually the recipient of foreign exchange; (c) will not go away; (d) orders the arena of political conflict. Also, donors' own commercial and political interests dictate that - even when handling aid - they operate via governments, which have the power to deny, or to accede to, those interests. In pursuing the World Bank's &quot;tripartite agenda&quot; against poverty, donors have sought to help or persuade <I>states</I> to pursue less-distorted, labour-intensive growth; to provide human capital; and to supply safety-nets. Yet the <I>institutions</I> - of possibly rent-seeking providers of services; of those who seek state support for the rich or the capital-intensive; and of the poor themselves - are often not fully embedded in the state itself, but in (more or less imperfect) forms of civil society. What does this mean for poverty reduction, and how can donors respond?<P>
<P>
Donors have tried three approaches. The first is to concentrate on projects and/or (in 1979-94) macro-reforms; to try and make them more poverty-orientated; and either to neglect institutions, or to build in bits of institutional development specific to the aid activities themselves, e.g. water-users' groups or extension for an area-based project. The second donor approach has been &quot;institution-building&quot;, in the sense of strengthening organizations rather than working with rules or customs, at regional or national level -  e.g. by trying to strengthen national systems of extension or food output statistics collection and processing; these approaches can solve some problems, and may somewhat advance labour-intensive growth or social-services development, but must operate through existing structures of power, which are seldom pro-poor. The third approach is to &quot;change the rules&quot; in favour of the poor, e.g. by using aid to stimulate (or to ease the pain of) major changes in land tenure, or in &quot;participation&quot; in the project cycle; this method requires at least some part of the state apparatus to be reasonably favourable towards the proposed rule changes, and/or a significant <I>demand</I> by poor groups, preferably with some powerful allies, for such changes. Such demand depends on the extent to which the poor can undertake collective action, either in the market of in the political institutions of civil society, or (failing that) violently. What can donors do to help the development of civil institutions permitting peaceful, effective action by the poor?<P>
<P>
<I>The projects/macro-reform approach</I>: The economic performance of <I>projects</I> - for growth as well as poverty impact - is closely tied to the services provided to the project by national institutions, before, during and (especially) after the period of project implementation. Yet donors, by supporting project-specific (e.g. area) organizations, often &quot;bleed&quot; national systems. Also, the project itself is exposed to erosion after the donor departs, and line ministries (or other national structures) reassert control, or the lack of it. This has impeded the staying power of many poverty-orientated donor projects.<P>
<P>
Since 1979, donors' emphasis has moved somewhat away from projects. They have emphasized &quot;the policy environment&quot;, and lending in support of <I>macro-reform</I>. Initially there was too little concern for poverty impact, but recently there has been some success, in countries with appropriate institutions, in supporting &quot;social funds&quot;, social-service improvements, and safety-nets. Yet well over 75% of aid remains project aid, and poverty- orientation needs to be expressed in projects much more than is suggested by the present implementation of the threefold &quot;consensus strategy&quot;. Also, even for programme aid, the problem of poverty-orientation remains where the poor have little impact on, for example, the proportions of public spending that reach education (or primary schools), or remote regions, or urban slums. Price reforms favourable to agriculture, for example, are readily offset by changes in the balance of public expenditure favourable to cities; the proportion of central government expenditure (plus lending, less capital repayments) spent in support of agriculture, forestry and fisheries fell steadily in non-oil developing countries, from 6.3 per cent in 1976 to 4.8 per cent in 1986 (Lipton 1991b, p. 43) and these trends have intensified in 1986-92 (IMF, 1992: 70-71).<P>
<P>
<I>National-level organization building</I>: Partly because of these issues - and partly because of exaggerated reaction against project aid, especially integrated area projects - donors, especially the World Bank in Africa, have moved towards national system-building. Yet, even in apparently &quot;technical&quot; areas such as agricultural research or statistical services, the State commitment needed to pay, train, and deploy cadres and products effectively is often absent, especially without pressure in &quot;civil society&quot; from final users (of, say, new rice varieties, or food output data). If poor people - African small farmers, Asian landless workers, slum-dwellers - are to benefit from reformed <I>organizations</I>, they need to be able to press for reformed <I>rules</I>, customs, procedures. Great inequality in the political marketplace (e.g. mass illiteracy) or the economic marketplace (e.g. Brazilian or S. African land distribution) - or the suppression or effective &quot;fixing&quot; of either marketplace, by the State or powerful private groups - makes it much harder for the poor to exert such influence (cf. Mead Cain on Bangladesh <I>vs</I> Andhra Pradesh). Hence &quot;new-style projects&quot; are likely to be effectively open to &quot;poor power&quot; only if such reform of institutions (in the sense of &quot;organizations&quot;) is accompanied by appropriate (changes in) rules, customs or procedures..<P>
<P>
<I>Rule-reforming</I>: Donors <I>can</I> help developing-country governments to change the rules, but only if there is something to build on, by way of either State or private factions strong enough to exert influence for pro-poor changes. Examples are possible donor-supported reductions of gross bottom-end inequality in <I>market power</I> (e.g. by donor support to ease land reform - Kenya, Brazil, Philippines, perhaps S. Africa, India), or in <I>political power</I> (e.g. by donor support for primary education). More difficult is the question of how the poor can be strengthened where access to civil-society institutions is absent, either for everybody or for the poor. Project-level participation can achieve something, locally and via learning, but needs to be placed appropriately in the project cycle, and readily tends to be subverted by the local non-poor. At national level, donors might consider whether governments would accept support for wider access to political debate and media, especially for rural people. The support, in some countries or regions of Africa, of journals such as India's <I>Economic and Political Weekly</I> is one possible way forward.<P>
<P>
Of course, many governments will not accept such forms of aid. The final way to steer aid towards sets of rules, organisations and procedures that represent the interests of the poor is to phase out aid to countries systematically suppressing such institutions. This is fully in the spirit of the final chapter of the World Bank's 1990 <I>World Development Report</I> on poverty.<P>

NGO's and Official Donors<br>

<hr>
<i>In the 1950s and 1960s, Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and 
official donors tended to pursue
different development agendas. Beyond support to emergencies, they 
were usually disinterested in
each other's activities and occasionally suspicious of the other's 
motives. This began to change from
the early 1970s when most donors followed the earlier example of 
countries such as Norway and
Canada in directly supporting NGO development programmes. The shift 
of official funding towards
NGOs accelerated in the 1980s. Part of this shift is explained by the 
growth in emergency assistance
in the period but it also reflected a growing recognition of the role 
of NGO programmes in meeting
official aid objectives in areas such as poverty reduction, 
environmental conservation, health and
education.<p>

     This Briefing Paper focuses on the various, and changing, ways 
in which NGOs interact with
official donors and discusses possible new directions in the 
relationship between NGOs and donors.
The emphasis is upon development activities, rather than emergency 
assistance and relief.</i><p>


<h3>The financial contribution</h3>
One of the most tangible indicators of growing interaction has been 
the change in the quantity of
funds official aid agencies channel to and through NGOs for their 
<i>development</i> activities. Figures from
the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) 
indicate that the total amount
of official aid going to NGOs for development in 1992/93 was 
US$2.2bn, while data from the World
Bank put the 1992 figure at $2.5bn.  Why do these figures 
seriously underestimate actual
flows?<p>

     The financial contribution of donors to NGO development 
activities is commonly presented
in terms of two ratios: 
   <ul><li> the proportion of official aid channelled to NGOs
    <li> the contribution of official aid funds to total NGO income.</ul>

Published OECD data suggest that in aggregate about 5% of all 
official aid is now channelled to
NGOs. Not only are these figures an underestimate, but they fail to 
capture wide variation among
different donors in the share of official aid going to and through 
NGOs. For individual donors, the
ratio ranges from less than 1% for some donors to up to 30% (Table 
1)</a>.<p>

     Published aggregate figures indicate more accurately the growing 
importance of donor funds
to overall NGO income: the World Bank judges that whereas in the 
early 1970s about 1.5% of total
NGO income came from donor sources, by the mid-1990s this share had 
risen to about 30%. Yet these
figures, too, conceal wide variations across donor countries, ranging 
from about 10% of total NGO
income to 80% or more (Table 2)</a>.<p>

     Also of importance has been the pace at which donors have 
increased the funds they channel
to NGOs. For instance, in the ten years to 1993/94, the United 
Kingdom increased its official funding
of NGOs by almost 400% to £68.7m, raising the share of total aid 
channelled to NGOs from 1.4% to
3.6%. In the same period, Australia increased its official funding of 
NGOs from A$20m to A$71m,
raising the share of total aid going to NGOs from 1% to 6%. Similar 
expansion occurred in the case
of Finland, Norway and Sweden from the early 1980s to the early 
1990s.<p>


<h3>Funding arrangements</h3>
In terms of donor-NGO funding arrangements, there are variations 
across countries. In Australia, there
are 32 different funding mechanisms through which NGOs can obtain 
funds from the Government.
However, the dominant type of NGO activity funded by donors today 
remains projects and
programmes put forward for funding by the NGOs themselves, and 
utilised for projects and
programmes in particular developing countries. In the United Kingdom, 
this is through the Overseas
Development Administration's (ODA) Joint Funding Scheme; in Sweden, 
through the NGO
Programme; in Finland, through the NGO Support Programme. 
Additionally, a small proportion of
donor funds are channelled through a range of international NGOs, 
while most bilateral donors have
also provided funds to NGOs specialising in sending volunteers 
abroad, and to NGOs working on
education and information initiatives within donor countries.<p>

     All donors have introduced criteria to determine the eligibility 
of potential projects put up for
funding: some use sectoral specialists to review project proposals, 
others provide funds almost on a
self-monitoring basis within general guidelines. Donors vary, too, in 
the share of total project costs
which donors are willing to fund, from 50% or less (the UK) to 75% 
and upwards (Finland, Sweden).

Donors have also differed in the relationship between the level of 
funds requested by the NGOs and
the official funds available: some parliaments (Sweden) have, until 
very recently, repeatedly voted
more funds each year than there are projects available to fund. 
Others (such as the UK) have to reject
a high proportion of projects, because of a shortage of total funds 
allocated.<p>

     Different donors have also applied varying degrees of 
conditionality on the non-project funds
they provide for NGO work. In contrast to the United Kingdom, which 
has stringent conditions
attached to official funds used for development education and 
information work, other donors, such
as the Scandinavians, have a more permissive approach and even 
provide funds for activities and
campaigns critical of official aid policy.<p>


<h3>The role of NGOs in donor programmes</h3>
What all these particular funding schemes have in common is that they 
are official contributions to
the NGOs' own development projects and programmes. Increasingly in 
recent years, however, NGOs
have been co-opted to assist official aid agencies execute donors' 
own projects and programmes. For
these types of initiative it is usual for donors to contribute all 
the funds required to execute these
particular projects effectively on a 'sub-contract' basis. Although 
aggregate data on the amount of
official funds channelled to these types of initiative have not been 
gathered, country studies conducted
by the ODI indicate that, in recipient countries with a large and 
growing NGO presence, 5% and more
of total bilateral aid funds are commonly used for these NGO 
sub-contracted initiatives. <p>



     There are three factors which have influenced donors to utilise 
the skills and services of NGOs
to help further their own agenda.
    <ul><li> First, donors have been using NGOs to support their emergency 
and relief activities for some
     time, so providing funds for NGO development projects has often 
been viewed as a natural
     progression.<p>

     <li>Second, poor performance of official donor programmes in 
reaching the poor and carrying out
     successful rural development projects in the late 1960s and 
1970s, married with the clear
     popularity of NGOs for their work in the fields of education and 
health, and claims by NGOs
     that they were able to reach the poor and improve their lives, 
has led donors to turn to NGOs
     to help them achieve a greater poverty focus in their own aid 
programmes.<p>

    <li> Third, and relatedly, donors have seen NGOs as a means of 
getting around obstacles to aid
     impact caused by inefficient and corrupt governments, as well as 
a way of reaching people
     in those countries where they had suspended official aid 
programmes.</ul><p>


<h3>Official donors and southern NGOs</h3>
Historically, most official funds have gone to support the work of 
NGOs based in donor countries,
even though the bulk of the funds have been spent in developing 
countries. An early reason for this
was that there were few viable, and effective, indigenous NGOs. Yet 
over the past 15 years there has
been rapid growth in the number, as well as the capabilities of NGOs 
based in developing countries:
 <i> southern </i>NGOs. <p>

     The growth of southern NGOs has varied from country to country 
but, in general, effective
southern NGOs emerged earliest in south and east Asia (such as 
Bangladesh and the Philippines) and
in a number of countries in Latin America such as Chile, Brazil and 
Nicaragua. Only in the last ten
years has there been a rapid growth in the number and importance of 
indigenous NGOs in Africa and
their influence varies markedly across countries.<p>

     The donor view which saw increasing merit in working through 
NGOs, together with the
growing strength of southern NGOs, has led more and more donors to 
supplement their support of
northern NGOs with direct funding of southern NGOs. Such donor-NGO 
initiatives became prominent
in the early 1980s and have continued to expand thereafter. <p>

     In 1988, the ODA channelled £3.4m to 40 Bangladesh 
health-related NGOs under the
Bangladesh Population and Health Consortium, and over a five year 
period to 1993 has provided over
£5m to a large NGO in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh Rural Advancement 
Committee.  The United
States, Canada, Norway and Sweden are amongst the leading bilateral 
donors who have all channelled
substantial funds to local NGOs, with a heavy concentration in south 
Asia. The EC and the UNDP
have been among the leading multilateral agencies to fund southern 
NGO activities. <p>

     Mirroring the support given to northern NGOs, official funding 
of southern NGOs has taken
two forms: the funding of initiatives put forward by southern NGOs, 
and the utilisation of the services
of southern NGOs to help donors achieve their own aid objectives. <p>

     Early moves by donors to fund southern NGOs directly have often 
been viewed with
misgivings by northern NGOs. Yet when donors have embarked on this 
type of initiative in
consultation with their home-based NGOs, and especially when they 
have used the experience of
northern NGO personnel on the ground to assist these direct funding 
initiatives, the process has often
stimulated northern NGOs to assess their own comparative advantage 
and has been welcomed.<p>

     Donor funding of southern NGOs has received a mixed reception 
from recipient governments.
Clear hostility from many non-democratic regimes has been part of 
more general opposition to any
initiatives to support organisations beyond the control of the state. 
But even in democratic countries,
governments have often resisted moves seen as diverting significant 
amounts of official aid to non-state controlled initiatives, especially where NGO projects have not 
been integrated with particular
line ministry programmes.<p>


<h3>The rise of the 'reverse agenda'</h3>
The growth in official donor support to NGOs has not always been 
welcome to NGOs. Reluctance by
many northern NGOs to accept large amounts of official aid funds has 
been based on two mutually-reinforcing ideas: that their development approach was qualitatively 
different from that of the official
aid agencies, and that, as donors continued to apply conditions to 
funds channelled to NGOs, a rise
in donor funding would increasingly be likely to compromise the 
integrity of NGO approaches to
development. <p>

     Using NGOs to help achieve donors' own aid objectives only 
heightened these concerns,
though the degree of concern has always varied across different donor 
countries. For example, in most
Scandinavian countries, NGOs have received from the state upwards of 
80% of income for their
projects and most have not felt their integrity threatened as a 
result. Some major US NGOs, on the
other hand, have refused to consider official funding.<p>

     Though NGO anxiety about being over-run by the official donor 
agenda has persisted, the
growing role and status of NGOs has fuelled a different phenomenon, 
increasingly referred to as the
<i>reverse agenda</i>. This is the process whereby the approach and methods 
of the NGOs are now
influencing the activities and perceptions of donors and official aid 
programmes, in some cases as a
direct result of donors seeking out NGO ideas.<p>

     There are a number of ways in which this has manifested itself. 
For instance, some of the
characteristics of the 'NGO approach' to development   participatory 
planning, assessing a gender
dimension, and concern with the environment   have gradually been 
incorporated into mainstream
donor thinking. Additionally, some donors (such as Australia, 
Germany, the Netherlands and Norway)
regularly seek out the views of NGOs in drawing up particular 
official bilateral aid programmes:
Norway did this in 1993 for their programmes in Ethiopia and 
Nicaragua. Of particular interest has
been the willingness of the World Bank (which has often attracted the 
hostility of NGOs) to engage
in discussions with NGOs and to include some NGOs in the 
implementation of World Bank projects.
<p>
<TABLE BORDER=2>
<TR>
<TD><h2>NGOs and the World Bank</h2>
The World Bank has been subject to sustained criticism by some major 
NGOs in recent years over its handling of
economic policy conditions attached to its structural adjustment 
loans, especially in Africa, and of its involvement
in large projects, such as the Arun Dam in Nepal, which antagonise 
environmental groups. These twin pressures
culminated in a `Fifty Years is Enough' campaign by some 
environmental and developmental NGOs to coincide with
the Fiftieth anniversary of the World Bank. Yet this public criticism 
serves to disguise a growing interaction
between the World Bank and NGOs.<p>

     Until the late 1980s, NGOs played a relatively minor, and 
indirect, role in the work and activities of the
World Bank. In the period 1973 88, NGOs were involved in only 6% of 
total World Bank-financed projects. Yet by
1990, NGOs were making a direct contribution to 22% of all World 
Bank-financed  projects, and by 1994 to over 50%. 
Interaction with NGOs is actively encouraged not only in 
implementation but in the design and planning of projects. 
     Another change has been the World Bank's growing involvement 
with southern NGOs in its projects. Thus
whereas in the period 1973 91, 40% of NGOs involved with the World 
Bank were international NGOs, by 1994,
indigenous NGOs represented 70% of NGOs involved in World 
Bank-financed projects. <p>

     At present, however, and in contrast to most bilateral donors, 
there are few mechanisms through which
NGOs receive funds from the World Bank. Of greatest importance to 
NGOs are the World Bank's Social Funds
which channel resources to demand-driven sub-projects proposed by 
public, private or voluntary organisations <p>
     However, in July 1995 an initiative was announced which could 
further enhance the role of NGOs in
relation to World Bank funding. The Consultative Group to Assist the 
Poorest of the Poor (CGAPP) is, according
to the World Bank, designed to `promote the replication and growth of 
NGO-managed programmes that provide
financial services to the poor'. The World Bank has provided an 
initial capital of US$100m and other donors together
are expected to contribute at least as much. The CGAPP will focus on 
so-called `micro-loans' to the informal sector
which were pioneered by NGOs and remain a major part of their 
activities.<p>

     Of particular importance is World Bank-NGO interaction in the 
area of policy discussion and debate.
Although an NGO-World Bank Committee was formed in the early 1980s to 
provide a forum for policy discussion
between World Bank and NGO staff, until recently there was little 
sign that mainstream World Bank policies were
influenced by these exchanges. <p>

     In recent years, however, the World Bank has joined other donors 
in exposing itself to both NGO gender
and participatory rural appraisal approaches; NGOs have been included 
in consultations on early drafts of World
Bank reports and, although in a more limited way, NGO personnel have 
been invited to join World Bank economic
mission teams. <p>

     While both sides would acknowledge that there remain areas of 
disagreement, both would probably also
acknowledge that the degree of interaction and the potential for 
policy change resulting from World Bank-NGO
interaction is much greater today than hitherto.<p>
</td>

</TABLE>

<h3>The further expansion of a common agenda?</h3>
A direct effect of the growing influence of the reverse agenda has 
been to increase the common
ground between donors and NGOs. No longer is it easy to talk of 
distinct differences between NGO
and donor approaches to development. <p>

     One manifestation of a growing common ground has been the way 
that most donors have
broadened their aid objectives. Thus, most donors now include poverty 
alleviation, concern with the
environment and enhancing the status of women as major aid 
objectives. Perhaps of even greater
importance is that most donors now view action to enhance human 
rights and democratic processes
as a constituent part of their development agenda. Additionally, many 
donors have taken up
'strengthening civil society' as a specific aid objective. This is 
doubly beneficial to NGOs both because
NGOs are seen to constitute an important part of civil society, and 
because one of the core objectives
of NGOs has been to work to 'empower' poor people, especially by 
strengthening the organisations
to which poor people belong.<p>

     One concrete result of a growing overlap of objectives is that 
donors themselves are now
increasingly willing to bring  those projects and programmes, which 
for a long time were typically
initiated by NGOs, within the umbrella of official aid. It is now not 
uncommon for donors to take over
(and often expand) the funding of projects in the developing 
countries which were started and have
been funded by (usually northern) NGOs.<p>

     Though these examples provide evidence of a widening cluster of 
initiatives where it is no
longer possible to make a strong and clear distinction between donors 
and NGOs in terms of project
approach and execution, it is important not to press the common 
agenda argument too far. Thus a
number of NGOs, including a high proportion of the long established 
and larger northern NGOs and
a growing number of southern NGOs, remain wary of these recent 
developments and are still
concerned to maintain their distance from donors. Some argue that the 
growing convergence of the
NGO and official aid agenda could well turn out to be more a 
convergence of <i>language</i> about
development than convergence in the overall approach to development. 
In particular many large
international NGOs remain extremely critical of donors' support for 
economic policy reform (or
structural adjustment) programmes.<p>


<h3>The future</h3>
The common ground between donors and NGOs can be expected to grow, 
especially as donors seek
to make more explicit their stated objectives of enhancing democratic 
processes and strengthening
marginal groups in civil society.  However, and in spite of a likely 
expansion and deepening of the
reverse agenda, NGOs are likely to maintain their wariness of too 
close and extensive an alignment
with donors.<p>

     In aggregate, the direct funding of southern NGOs by donors, now 
emerging as a significant
form of interaction, is likely to expand in the next few years, even 
though some donors (such as
Norway) may not follow this trend.<p>

     Ironically, this expansion could well be accompanied by greater 
involvement of northern
NGOs and northern NGO personnel, by contracting them to help 
administer and monitor the impact
of such funds. This is in part because many officials of donor 
agencies often do not have the skills and
expertise necessary to liaise effectively with the often small and 
dispersed organisations which make
up the southern NGO 'community'.   It might be assumed that these 
trends will result in increased
funding of NGOs by donors in the years ahead. <p>

     For growing numbers of northern NGOs, such an expansion would 
help to compensate for
what appears to be falling aggregate income from private 
(non-official) sources (down to $5.4bn in
1994, compared with $6bn in 1992). However a new, if very recent, 
phenomenon is that some donors
who have provided large amounts of money to NGOs (Canada, Sweden and 
Finland) have announced
cuts of 10% or more. In contrast, USAID intends to channel 40% of its 
bilateral resources through
NGOs by the end of the century, up from 34% in 1994. In general, 
however, where donors have
started to cut aid to NGOs, this has mainly been due to overall 
pressure on, and often absolute cuts
in, the aggregate aid budget, in some cases reflecting doubts about 
the entire aid enterprise in the
post-Cold War era.<p>

     Together these differing trends may enable donors and NGOs to 
cooperate even more closely
than in the past. If a deeper sense of mutual interests and mutual 
purpose between donor agencies
and NGOs does emerge, this might lead NGOs to devote less energy and 
fewer resources to criticising
those aspects of the donor agenda they dislike, and more to building 
and widening the common
ground they increasingly share.

<a name="int"><i>The NGDO-EU Liaison Committee is the preferred means</a>
of communication between the NGOs and the European
Union. We interviewed its recently elected President,
Agostinho Jardim Gon&#231;alves. A chaplain and
Portuguese journalist, Mr Gon&#231;alves has had long
experience of the development cooperation sector.
Having, in the past, been a representative of CCHD,
chairman of the 'Latin American' group of the CISDE and
also a National Director of the international press
agency 'Inter-Press service' in Portugal, he is now the
founder and Director of OIKOS in his country. We asked
him first of all about how he saw his new role as
President of the Liaison Committee.</i>
<p>
- I think that the role of President is essentially to
give coherence to the various organisations making up
the Committee while at the same time providing the
Committee the verve, impetus and dynamism which it
needs, given that it is made up of people with very
different experiences. Preference should not be given
to any one type of experience. They must all be
employed to engender the dynamism which is the
Committee's aim. In the past, the Presidency has been
held by the people from the Netherlands, Belgium,
Ireland and France. Now it has passed, for the first
time, to someone from a southern European country, and
to one of the more recent members of the EU. I am very
much aware of my responsibility to conserve, coordinate
and implement, but also of the fact that the culture to
which I belong is a southern European one. I think that
this meeting of different cultures and consultation
between them should further enrich the work of European
NGOs.
<p>
<i>The great strength of NGOs clearly lies in their
richness of experience and diversity. Is it possible to
maintain this diversity in a Liaison Committee that
brings together more than 700 organisations?</i>
<p>
- The NGOs reflect a European reality. We are working
for the European Union, but are concerned to ensure
that we do not lose the richness which results from our
diversity. This applies both to the construction of
Europe and to the civil societies in which the NGOs are
rooted, which give them their significance. The Liaison
Committee does not intend to standardise the work of
the NGOs. We offer a forum in which the various NGOs
are able to share their history, experience and
opinions. We work together, helping in the construction
of Europe in the specific context of solidarity with
developing countries through cooperation. The way of
achieving this differs from one country to another and
from one NGO to another. We have no desire lose the
richness that arises from the spontaneity of NGO work,
not do we want to create something which is too
standardised and which will, therefore,  impoverish
their work.
<p>
<i>Is this diversity something that is reflected in the
links which the Committee has with the European
Union?</i>
<p>
- The Liaison Committee is a privileged partner in
dialogue with the European institutions - and is
accepted as such - as regards development cooperation
policies. It signals the fact that the societies of the
15 EU countries still possess vitality. The NGOs of the
North and South alike have full freedom to submit
projects or programmes, or to determine acceptance or
rejection criteria with the Commission, and the Liaison
Committee is there to pass on their wishes and their
demands. The Committee is therefore the arena for
debate over the scale of the contribution to be made by
NGOs to the construction of a Europe which shows
solidarity. All this is part of a continuous dialogue.
<p>
     However, there is another problem at the level of
the Liaison Committee which is knowing just what is
represented by it. Does it simply represent the big
NGOs; those that are sufficiently large to be able to
tackle certain matters, to develop their lobbying
activities or to have significant projects in
developing countries? Or is the Committee also open to
small NGOs and associations that want to develop their
work in the field of solidarity? For my part, I think
that there is no clear answer to this question. It is
something that needs to be handled at an individual
country level. After all, it is there that things are
actually happening. I wouldn't say that there is a
conflict over this issue, but there is a certain lack
of alignment and an obvious difference in the power of
the large and small NGOs.
<p>
     One of the decisions of the last General Assembly
was to reinforce the links between the Liaison
Committee and national platforms. I think that up to
now, despite all the efforts that have been made, it
has not yet proved possible to establish a truly
fruitful institutional relationship between the Liaison
Committee and the national platforms. This is a claim
made by the NGOs of the various countries and also by
Member States. The Liaison Committee has a duty to
ensure that the activities of national platforms make a
significant contribution to the dynamism of EU-
developing country, and to include both large and small
NGOs in this.
<p>
<i>NGOs actually have a duty to coordinate their activ-
ities. But doesn't the search for funds, and the
resulting competition mean that this is little more
than fine words?</i>
<p>
- There is a lot of talk about competition. In fact it
is more talked about than actually encountered. It is
true that NGOs are trying to obtain considerable
financial resources. This is especially the case for
those working in the field who need capital to support
their projects. It is also true that in certain
countries, they are working in the same locations and
the same fields, dealing with the same social groups.
But when one talks about coordination among NGOs, one
is mainly thinking about the complementarity which we
need to have to make the activities of NGOs even more
effective. Let me explain what I mean. Some NGOs are
expert in the field of humanitarian assistance. Others
have devoted themselves to development of the Third
World using technology transfers, support for human
resources and so on. There are still others which have
substantial experience in the field of political
lobbying. The fact that NGOs specialise does not mean
that they should be compartmentalised - isolated one
from another. Real life isn't like that. A country
which has suffered the effects of a war needs emergency
assistance and the NGOs which want to bring about
development should not forget. By the same token, those
NGOs which provide emergency assistance should not
forget this is essentially transitory and there has to
be a follow up. So NGOs should not work in ignorance of
what the others are doing. They should seek, rather, to
share their appeals, challenges, experiences and even
their funds and resources. What is currently happening
in Rwanda and Angola, for example, is very unfortunate.
It is inconceivable that NGOs will be able to continue
working in their own individual spheres without
reaching some sort of agreement on coordination, so as
to make their work more effective.
<p>
<i>Looking at the NGO world more generally, a
characteristic feature of the past few years has, been
the advent of and recognition given to Southern NGOs.
This has inevitably led to a repositioning on the part
of some Northern ones.</i>
<p>
- Let me say first of all that I think that there is
still a need to reflect on and deepen the existing
links between the societies of North and South and
between their respective NGOs. The fact that it has
proved possible to deepen this link between peoples,
states and intergovernmental organisations, within a
framework of consultation and collaboration, is
extremely promising. It means that nations are brought
closer together. It is dynamic movements such as these
which will bring people together in a spirit of
solidarity to construct an international system which
is just, and to achieve world peace.
<p>
     Having said this, we cannot turn back the clock on
certain things that have happened. The fact that a
number of European bodies decided to begin forging
direct links or direct cooperation with Southern NGOs
in a rather overhasty manner will not prevent the
Northern NGOs from continuing to strive to deepen
cooperation between NGOs. It will, of course, be very
difficult if there is no proper preparation or
commitment to permanent evaluation. The overall aim is
to continue consultation and I can say with regard to
decentralised cooperation, for example - an area in
where Southern NGOs are increasingly involved in any
new process, that everything is conducted in a very
good spirit of cooperation between the Liaison
Committee and the EC. Here we are kept up to date with
what is going on. We are involved in discussions and we
participate. I may add that we are moving forwards
together with the Commission in the field of research
and the new relationships developing in this area.
However, we do think that such cooperation must be
undertaken with a certain degree of caution if it is to
be truly effective.
<p>
<i>You say wish to continue to work in partnership with
Southern NGOs, but when your predecessor, Guido Dumon,
was appointed by the General Assembly, he expressed the
opinion that this partnership had failed.</i>
<p>
- I think we must accept that the partnership failed in
the sense that the our concept of it was a failure. It
was not implemented in the way that was intended. There
were obstructions placed on the path that we tried to
follow which prevented the establishment of the kind of
partnership which is described in manuals and in the
speeches of leaders and those in authority. You have to
be realistic and acknowledge that while partnership is
a goal and an ideal, different countries have different
economic situations. Everyone knows that some countries
have more resources than others and that means that
from the outset, we have a situation which is not
really conducive to partnership. There are donors and
recipients and the latter do not have as much power as
the former, even if they both started out with the best
of intentions. On the other hand, we are all aware of
the history of development cooperation. Partnership
cannot be divorced  from reality, from what is actually
happening in the world and from the realpolitik of
North-South relations. The situation in the real world
can also affect relations between Northern and Southern
NGOs. In areas like  international trade or technology
transfers, we have undoubtedly seen forms of
interference which have prevented the establishment of
the desired partnership. 
<p>
Today, however, it looks as if there are some more
promising signs. It is not just that there is still a
will within the NGOs for the partnership to retain its
vitality. There is also the fact that we learn by
experience what direction to take to advance in future,
and what traps to avoid.
<p>
<i>What impact do you think the Liaison Committee has
had?</i>
<p>
- The establishment of the Committee was an important
historic act. It involved the creation of an
organisation which respects the autonomy of society and
holds out the possibility of a fruitful and permanent
dialogue with it, in the context of a European system
which was set up with clear economic aims and political
intentions. In evaluating the Committee's impact, I
personally think that, although we have already
achieved a lot and have developed a certain way of
involving ourselves in the process of cooperation
between Europe and the South, we could have progressed
even more quickly. I think that we must now, as quickly
as possible, give  some thought to the fundamental
nature of what we are doing - something which probably
would not have been possible in the past. We need to
bring about an increase in interaction between the
Liaison Committee and the various structures of the
European Union - whether it be the Parliament, the
Council, COREPER or the Commission. As regards the
Commission, I am not just talking about the NGO unit
but about the Commission as a whole. I would like us to
move forward more quickly.
<p>
<i>What, therefore, are the current priorities?</i>
<p>
- Priority must be given today to the European Union's
cooperation policy. It is not possible to work outside
it, swimming against the stream. The EU could have a
very good policy of cooperating with NGOs, but if this
is not coherent, the NGOs will find it difficult to
make their action effective. The priority is therefore
for the Liaison Committee to contribute to the
definition and inauguration of a coherent development
cooperation policy on the part of the EU. This can be
achieved in different ways. Dialogue is important, but
most important of all is the ability to take time to
ask the key questions. The most recent General
Assembly, in fact, set the pace by raising the question
of revising the Maastricht Treaty. By the same token,
it is necessary for the Liaison Committee to be able to
participate, in its own way, in next year's
Intergovernmental Conference. Lom&#233; is also of
fundamental importance. It is not just a question of
joint financing of projects, financial resources or
other technical factors. There are other aspects that
are more importance, such as the definition of
cooperation strategies. 
<p>
<i>In this connection, what do you think about the
future of the Lom&#233; Convention?</i>
<p>
- I think it is very dangerous to set one's sights on
something that will dilute the formula offered by
Lom&#233;. Despite all its faults and problems, and
also despite its failures, the Convention represented a
desire for something special as regards dialogue,
cooperation and partnership. It was a form of
multilateral cooperation which went beyond fine
phrases. And it has led to some concrete results and
some genuine negotiations. Certain  mechanisms were
inaugurated and implemented that have had a real
impact. I think that killing off this aspect would be a
step backwards in the history of cooperation.
<p>
Secondly, I think that a great deal of experience has
been accumulated in the sphere of cooperation and a
large number of people have been mobilised to enable
Europe and the ACP countries to come closer together.
It would be a pity now to say "Alright then, all this
is a waste of time. Let's move in another direction". I
for my part favour a much more hard-headed evaluation;
I think that the evaluation carried out for the
Lom&#233; IV mid-term review was very weak. And, more
worryingly, the real problems regarding financing were
not touched upon. The Liaison Committee, working with
other European networks, discussed and reflected on the
issues. We shared our thoughts and worked more closely
than ever before but there was no echo of these
deliberations in the final texts. It was all
compartmentalised at an official level. Doubtless, this
is partly due to the fact that international structures
frequently do not provide the conditions which are most
conducive to sustained collaboration. So there should
have been a better evaluation aimed at breaking down
the barriers which have originated both in Europe and,
more particularly in the ACP countries, notably on
questions relating to competences, which have impaired
Lom&#233;'s effectiveness.
<p>
If Lom&#233; fails, and is expunged altogether, then
the only remaining hope for the future will be the
international charity, assistance and emergency aid
movements. There will be nothing else.
<p>
<i>Are you suggesting that the NGOs' main role is now a
political one?</i>
<p>
- Development cooperation inevitably has a political
dimension. Things cannot be allowed to continue to
depend on the goodwill of people acting in a spirit of
mercy in the face of suffering. This presupposes
changes in structures which involve redefining
cooperation policies, and the NGOs have a part to play
in this respect. 
<p>
Today's NGOs refuse to be mere witnesses. We will not
refrain from intervening until such time as the level
of suffering absolutely demands it. There is a lot of
talk about democracy, but the way in which it is
conceived sometimes means there are areas where states
reject the involvement of civil society. This is the
case for foreign relations and defence. These are areas
which are almost state monopolies. But the gradual
intensification of democratic awareness implies that
there will also be intervention in relations between
nations as we, the people, express our political
opinions. That is what we already do in the case of
social and economic problems, which are seen as areas
of legitimate democratic concern. But democracy also
entails the capacity and right to intervene in foreign
relations policy. The aim is not just to ensure that
there is peace between nations, but also to establish
international justice, and the NGOs are of fundamental
importance in this respect.

This paper examines the challenges facing Northern NGOs in the 1990s. Its sets out the changing
global context of aid and looks at the relationship between Northern NGOs and three different sectors:
Southern governments, the private sector and Southern NGOs. The changing balance of activities
among these three sectors, and the trend among Northern NGOs to re-evaluate their own value added
to the development process means that strategic choices will need to be made if NGOs are to build
partnerships with any of these sectors. The article provides some questions which NGOs should ask
when doing this and some options for engaging in these partnerships.
<p>
<a name="int"><h3><hr>Introduction</h3></a>

The role of NGOs has moved centre stage on the development agenda in the 1990s. Official donors
have become frustrated with state inefficiency in programme management, with frequent misallocation
of resources and an urban bias. In terms of delivery of services, the economic crisis in which many
countries find themselves leaves governments short of funds for development programmes. Pressure
from international financial institutions for reductions in public sector spending has resulted in
government withdrawal from the provision of certain public services. Thus, NGOs are encouraged to
focus their attention on poverty alleviation projects and programmes, especially in those economies
undergoing structural adjustment. Between 1970 and 1990, there has been a three-fold increase in the
flow of funds to NGOs, and there is an increasing trend by donors to channel funds directly to
Southern NGOs. NGOs now account for 13% of all official government aid. NGOs are seen to be able
to work more effectively than government at the community level using a participatory approach, a
process that is essential to democratisation and the development of civil society. They are deemed to
be able to use money more efficiently and offer better value for money than governments. 
<p>
The increased resources available to NGOs both in the North and in the South are accompanied by
rising expectations among donors, of what NGOs can deliver, and a demand for accountability. In
many countries there is competition between Northern and Southern NGOs with the latter arguing that
the role of Northern NGOs is to support, not displace, them. As Southern NGOs grow in size and
ability to work with bilateral and multilateral agencies, the role and value-added of Northern NGOs
is questioned. 'This has left some Northern NGOs with a crisis of purpose .... Reordering NGOs,
building their capacity, redefining their roles, clarifying relationships between Northern and Southern
NGOs and their relationship to civil society and state institutions are a matter of urgency in the
1990s'<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">2</a> and are the subject of this article. In particular, the paper addresses issues concerning the
relationship between Northern NGOs and state/government in the South, the role Northern NGOs can
play in the privatisation process taking place globally, and in terms of their relationship with Southern
NGOs. 
<p>
NGOs however, are not a homogeneous group; they vary in size, mission, culture and function. NGOs
may be international donors, intermediaries, networks and federations, or grassroots movements of
various kinds<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">3</a>. Northern NGOs may be operational in emergency and/or in long term development,
they may be non-operational agencies but support local people and organisations in tackling their own
problems, or they may be campaigning, development education and advocacy organisations. Many
agencies have multiple mandates covering some or all of these aspects. NGOs in the South may be
involved directly with communities in delivering services, they may have an intermediate function
whereby they assist grassroots organisations to help their members/communities, or their main focus
may be advocacy or networking.
<p>
<a name="aid"><h3><hr>Aid and the changing global environment</h3></a>

The end of the Cold War has meant that aid given by the superpowers, to achieve political rather than
development ends, has reduced. Developing countries will henceforth have to demonstrate greater
efficiency with the aid which they receive. The collapse of the former Soviet Union and a number of
economies of Eastern Europe, the settlement of conflicts in such places as Mozambique, and South
Africa, and the escalation of conflicts in Rwanda and Burundi, means that an increasing number of
countries require development assistance to stimulate economic recovery and support the market
economy, cushion the effects of reform, to cater to huge refugee populations, or to sustain peace. Yet,
few countries are increasing their aid budgets; many including the Middle Eastern countries and the
US are substantially reducing their aid contributions.
<p>
The net negative cash flow problems experienced by so many Southern nations, where debt repayment
and servicing are much greater than aid, has led to a deterioration in economic wellbeing, greater
poverty, and less ability by countries to match aid with local subventions. For such countries as
Burundi, Tanzania and Uganda servicing their multilateral debts accounts for over 20% of their export
earnings. Governments are restructuring their economies but with very mixed results including many
negative impacts on the poorest. While there is much rhetoric about helping the 'poorest of the poor',
there is an increasing trend that aid going to the poorest is in the form of relief rather than
development as Northern governments respond to public demands to take immediate and visible action
in emergency situations. On the other hand, there must be concern regarding the view that the poor
have the capacity to deliver all their own needs, without adequate resources and the support of public
services which are invariably severely limited due to cutbacks as part of structural adjustment
programmes, or because of corrupt undemocratic regimes. The 20:20 compact (20% of national
budgets of developing countries and 20% of ODA from developed countries to be allocated to basic
social programmes) reached at the UN Social Summit in Copenhagen is a hopeful start in supporting
and recognising the role of the state in service provision, though this is a voluntary compact and action
plans have yet to be developed.
<p>
Significant changes are taking place within the development environment. Economically, para-statal
organisations are being privatised and a major emphasis is being placed on the role the private sector
can play in generating growth and creating employment, though the experience in Western Europe
would suggest caution. Politically, donor assistance is increasingly conditional on the development of
democratic processes which includes good governance, human rights, an increasing role for local
NGOs (especially in Africa), and participation by grass roots organisations. At the same time the
impact of donor supported structural adjustment programmes often times resulting in harsh cutbacks
in social expenditures, leads to an undermining of social cohesion and civil society itself. Additionally,
policy conflicts emerge because the market's focus by definition is on the immediate whereas building
participatory democracy is a long-term process.
<p>
In terms of development aid, there is an overall decrease in ODA from the OECD countries from $61
billion in 1992 to $56 billion in 1993 D a 6% fall in real terms, and large donors such as Germany,
the US and Canada are likely to cut aid still further<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">4</a>. Donors are also debating the need to address
growing poverty in the North as well as the South. With the large increase in refugees in both Eastern
Europe and Africa there is an increasing demand for emergency and humanitarian assistance. Global
media coverage of conflicts, droughts, floods, and earthquakes has influenced the public in the North
to demand immediate short term action with visible results, often at the cost of more long-term
development programmes. Among the donors themselves, there is a move towards more
comprehensive programming approaches (rather than the project by project approach). In some
instances, donors collaborate and fund different elements of a programme, e.g., agricultural sector
programmes in Zambia, or the integrated transport programme in Tanzania.
<p>
With this rapidly changing environment, the time has come to have a new vision for how development
agencies should adapt to the changing macro-environment. In this changing scenario, there are three
key players with which NGOs can cooperate namely, Southern governments, the emerging private
sector, and Southern NGOs. The challenge which faces NGOs is how they are going to relate to these
different players, and undoubtedly, the relationship will be influenced by individual contexts and
circumstances. A few key questions need consideration: 
<ul>
<li>Is there a role for individual NGOs to collaborate with other NGOs, in the spirit of partnership,
to have joint negotiations with (well-chosen) host governments concerning, for example, government
policy or budget allocations to key sectors which receive development assistance? Where they work
with governments, NGOs tend to have individual ad hoc arrangements and agreements with
governments.
<p>
<li>How will NGOs interact with the private sector in the future? Has the time come to develop a
partnership with the private sector and how might this be done?
<p>
<li>What should be the role of NGOs in capacity development for Southern NGOs and strengthening
the NGO sector in general, and conversely, what will be the impact on Northern NGOs of a
strengthened NGO sector in the South?
</ul>
<p>
<a name="gov"><h3><hr>Cooperation with Southern governments</h3></a>

The relationship of cooperation between NGOs and governments in many countries has been described
as that of 'reluctant partners'<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">5</a>, characterised by mutual suspicion. Yet, if poverty is to be alleviated
and poor people are to be empowered to determine their own destiny, the combined efforts of all
development players is required. Increasingly, multilateral and bilateral donors are demanding that
NGOs be involved in the implementation of programmes, and are channelling significant funds to
NGOs.
<p>
NGOs and governments generally differ in their model of, and approach to development, the objectives
they pursue, and the role they envisage for the poor in terms of their own development. The NGO
approach is typically thought to be participatory, holistic, targeted at the grassroots level while the state
is seen to be bureaucratic, centralist, and sometimes non-democratic, corrupt and repressive. Yet, it
is argued that while NGOs generally claim and are perceived to be closer to the poor than to the state
'they bear more resemblance to the state then they do to the poor D and in most of their activities they
operate in a manner that is more akin to the state than to any organisation of the poor'<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">6</a>.
<p>
There is difficulty in making generalisations about NGOs given their diversity and the actual
contradictions between those that see development as an emancipatory process and those that see it
as poverty alleviation. However, trends have emerged especially with regard to NGO/state
relationships. NGOs have tended to develop their own structures, programmes and projects based on
their individual philosophy and values. Cooperation with the state or with other NGOs has been
limited. Consideration must be given to the consequences of NGOs acting independently of
government as it can undermine government efforts and legitimacy, contradict government approaches,
lead agencies to duplicating efforts, result in the use of conflicting approaches and generate confusion
among the poor. It has been found that despite the constraints of government 'the chances of achieving
impact on policy and practice are enhanced when NGOs agreed to work within government structures
right from the outset'<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">7</a>. Equally, the poverty alleviation policy of government and effective use of
government budgets, particularly with regard to meeting basic needs and provision of primary services,
is central to the sustainability of NGO inputs. Thus, there is need for structures which define the
complementarity of state and NGO efforts in the interests of the poor. Effective cooperation with
Southern governments can allow NGO programmes to have a multiplier effect rather than an
expansion in programme coverage merely having an additive effect.
<p>
The challenge is for NGOs and governments to develop partnerships that are based on mutual respect
and trust. Partnership refers 'to a shared commitment to tackle development problems on the basis of
an agreed division of tasks and responsibilities'<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">8</a> where Southern partners take responsibility for their
own development and donors play supportive roles only. Most development aid programmes claim to
be based on partnerships but the reality is usually very different, not least because donors have
financial power which they use to insist that the partner fulfil certain conditions. The concept of
partnership may be correct, but much remains to be learnt on how it is to be operationalised. What
is required is a 'willingness from both sides to tackle the contradictions of the aid system ... a search
for converging interests, priorities and expectations; and calls for a pragmatism rather than ideology
in determining appropriate task divisions between partners'<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">9</a>. 
<p>
As governments are likely to have to function within very tight budgets over the next number of years,
the time has come for NGOs both in the North and the South, to negotiate jointly with governments
to take policy decisions that support key sectors for the poor and that support the 20:20 compact
agreed by donors and governments at the UN Social Summit in Copenhagen, 1995. There is scope for
NGOs as part of their operations in some countries to jointly identify with governments what the
problems are, how they can be resolved, and what each can contribute to the solution. If a number of
Southern and/or Northern NGOs were to agree to provide clearly defined assistance over the
forthcoming five years, in turn the government would agree to implement key policy decisions, e.g.,
with regard to resource allocation to the specific sub-sectors, or to increase incentives for local staff
to limit the brain drain, (according to UNFPA, Africa lost one third of its highest skilled workers to
emigration in the 1980s)<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">10</a>.
<p>
This strategy is not dissimilar from the concept of 'development contracts' proposed by the Norwegian
government at the North-South Roundtable in Ottawa (1991) and the Global Coalition for Africa
(1992). The concept includes a contractual agreement between partners based on mutual benefits and
binding obligations on both sides; it is increasingly being adopted by European agencies e.g. the
Catholic Institute for International Relations/ International Cooperation for Development (CIIR-ICD).
A contractual agreement that recognises the strengths and weaknesses, needs and priorities of both
partners would offer a viable way forward. Based on their experiences of building partnerships, NGOs
both from the North and South can inform the process of building partnerships with governments. 
<p>
This is clearly a strategy that could not be implemented unilaterally. Indeed, there are examples of
many NGOs, who on grounds of policy and principles, will not work with governments that they
perceive to be acting contrary to the interests of the poor. But perhaps in other instances, there is scope
for pilot testing such a partnership in a chosen country where the political will is forthcoming and
where the government is deemed to be potentially a good partner. Some may argue that such contracts
are undesirable and are a form of neo-colonialism perpetuating Northern control over Southern nations.
Others will see in the contract arrangement possibilities for greater partnership and sustainability in
that both government and NGO agree to invest in a sector (or sub-sector) and work towards a common
goal. Yet again, others argue that it is under non-democratic regimes that the poorest are often in
greatest need compared with those in democratic systems and that the choice of partner is a technical
affair.
<p>
The first challenge to NGOs is to initiate a debate on whether this sort of contractual arrangement is
acceptable or desirable, explore its advantages and disadvantages, and if deemed appropriate to certain
contexts, examine how it could be implemented on a genuine partnership basis. The primary question
to be answered is whether the existing system of NGO operations result in sustainable benefits for the
poor, or whether the poor would gain more than they currently do, and could be more empowered
through such agreements.
<p>
<a name="pri"><h3><hr>Cooperation with the private sector</h3></a>

A second challenge to organisations such as NGOs is to determine what their relationship will be to
the private sector. The major economic changes affecting developing country economies today are
public sector reform and privatisation. These have been an integral part of structural adjustment
programmes since the early 1980s and they feature in two-thirds of the World Bank's programmes,
half of them in sub-Saharan Africa. Between 1984 and 1991, the governments of 100 countries sold
off $250 billion worth of state-owned companies, primarily in developing countries, and especially in
Latin America and Africa<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">11</a>. 
<p>
Changes in development aid spending are also taking place. Until recently, most official development
aid has been for public sector projects and programmes, often building the infrastructure to facilitate
industrial development. However, this concentration on the public sector is becoming increasingly
unacceptable to donors. Present political and economic thinking favours private sector initiatives as
a major contributor to redressing the deteriorating economic and employment problems of developing
countries (and developed countries also).
<p>
With this expanding role for the private sector, what will be the response of NGOs? Clearly, it would
be unwise for NGOs to ignore the changes that are happening globally. Questions that need
consideration are: will working with the private sector be seen as incompatible with the 'NGO' and
'development' ethic? Do NGOs see the provision of assistance to profit-making companies as
incompatible with a poverty focus and the meeting of basic needs? Will NGOs be able to make the
cultural change that may be necessary if they are to play a constructive role in this new development,
or will some find it impossible? Would, for example, NGOs provide managerial staff to a private
company operating for profit? If they did give a positive response, what would be the impact on
fundraising from the public? How would cooperation with the private sector be explained in
development education programmes? 
<p>
For many NGOs the risk of cooperation with private enterprise may be perceived to be too high. It
could prove difficult to convince the public or political masters that provision of this kind of assistance
constituted 'development'. Yet, the reality in developing countries is that most people are involved or
want to be involved in income generation (the private sector). The development experience of income
generation has not been good and has often tended to be welfare rather than economic in orientation.
Agencies are frequently left with the choice of giving up on income generation projects or applying
business principles. Well publicised, best practice examples exist however, such as the Grameen Bank
in Bangladesh and SEWA (Self-employed Women's Association) in India, which demonstrate how
commercial and development principles can work together. NGOs should identify and publicise other
examples that may have wider application.
<p>
If the private sector is going to be a key player in developing countries, the question for NGOs may
not be whether or not to help private enterprise, but which sort of private enterprise to assist.
Undoubtedly, development agencies must adapt and respond to the new needs of developing countries.
The issue that will concern NGOs will be the distribution of the wealth generated, and the benefits to
the poor in particular. Even if wealth and jobs are created, private enterprises are developed, and
growth is sustained, will this be gained at the expense of human and social development, will the poor
benefit, or will we see a return to the 1960s approach to social development whereby the benefits of
economic growth were expected to eventually 'trickle down' to everyone?
<p>
In making decisions regarding assistance to the private sector, NGOs could develop criteria which
would make the provision of such assistance acceptable to the 'voluntary' or 'development' ethic, and
to the donating public. Criteria which could be adopted to reach the poorest include focusing on small
scale enterprises, enterprises which encourage local economic revival, are based on local labour, local
skills and are labour-intensive and based on local materials, co-operatives, and non-economic, social,
environmental projects that have links with the NGO sector.
<p>
Aid to the private sector could be regarded as 'seeding', to give a local based economy a kick-start.
Continuing management aid is not likely to be acceptable, nor aid to private firms which can afford
proper management or consultancy expertise. 
<p>
The time has come for NGOs to initiate a debate on whether and how the provision of technical
assistance could effect positive change in the private sector. Finding mechanisms for collaboration with
the private sector is a challenge that lies ahead.
<p>
A few examples of issues that might be considered are: 
<ul>
<li>the possibility of mixing social and commercial practices in the same organisation, and how to
measure their dual impact. Oxfam's fair trade network of shops is an example of this;
<p>
<li>the development of partnerships not only with government, local authorities, NGOs, and
cooperatives, but also with economic and social partners, for example, trade unions, professional
associations, chambers of commerce and industry, producer groups; 
<p>
<li>actions that could be taken to make the private sector and its management more responsible and
answerable to employees and the wider society, e.g. assistance could be provided with the agreement
that worker participation be adopted as an integral part of management; or that raw materials would
be acquired from other small firms or the informal sector; or that sub-contracted work would be given
to small producer groups or cooperatives; or that women as well as men would be given opportunities
at recruitment, training, and promotion levels;
<p>
<li>actions that could be taken to mitigate against the worst aspects of modern industry with regard
to exploitative conditions of labour; for example, agreements to provide assistance in labour relations,
if the private company were to give fair conditions of employment to its employees and improve
health and safety standards. A further example is where managerial expertise could be provided in
return for provision of fair rates for home-based workers;
<p>
<li>as more Northern companies invest in developing country economies, or establish joint ventures
with local companies, there may be a role for NGOs to help them prepare for inter-cultural
collaboration through training of their management staff;
<p>
<li>there is scope to work with commercial companies to help them improve their environmental
standards, and/or encourage them to provide basic facilities for the local community;
<p>
<li>there is an advocacy and practical role to be played to ensure that indigenous communities are
acknowledged and rewarded for their knowledge and preservation of products from their local
environment that are now being harvested by commercial companies, e.g. the Body Shop, Caf&#233;
Direct.
</ul>
<p>
<a name="ngo"><h3><hr>Cooperation with Southern NGOs</h3></a>

There is a major role for NGOs, North and South, to be a countervailing force vis-a-vis governments,
business, donors, international financial institutions. Indeed, this is a valuable and legitimate role
played by many NGOs. However, NGOs are not a homogeneous group, some are better than others,
but the impact that Northern and Southern NGOs may have will be largely determined by their
capacity to respond to the changing context within which they operate.
<p>
The 1980s saw a significant increase in the amount of funds being allocated to NGOs. The growth rate
of official aid to NGOs outstrips almost five-fold the growth of ODA itself, confirming a policy shift
in favour of NGO financing from public funds. 'Expressed in 1986 prices the flow of foreign aid
channelled through NGOs rose from $2.7 billion in 1970 to $7.2 billion in 1990'<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">12</a>. The 1980s also
saw a new phenomenon of channelling funding directly to Southern NGOs. This trend is likely to
continue<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">13</a> despite the fact that some Northern donors require that Southern agencies have a Northern
partner in order to secure funding. 
<p>
Increased funding places organisational and management demands on NGOs for which many are
ill-prepared, as well as raising real concerns about their independence, and advocacy and empowerment
role. Official funding requires good management practices, but oft-cited inadequacies of NGO
management practices include charismatic but sometimes autocratic leadership; committed but
untrained staff; weak monitoring, inadequate reporting, little accountability or transparency, and above
all, financial confusion<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">14</a>. It is argued by some that unless the institutional capacity of Southern NGOs
is substantially increased, they will collapse under the weight of the projected growth in funds
available to them<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">15</a>.
<p>
As more funds are channelled to NGOs, problems of self-regulation, collaboration and quality control
will emerge. As Southern NGOs are developing institutionally, and as they gain greater access to direct
funding from donors, their dependence on Northern NGOs will diminish as their overall share of NGO
funding grows. However, among NGOs, both North and South, there is growing competition especially
with regard to fundraising and public profile which is not necessarily in the interests of the poor. As
NGOs grow in size, they become more bureaucratic and as they become more reliant on donors for
funding, so their policies and agendas are influenced or set by the funding body. In the case of
Southern NGOs this can often result in their policies and programmes being determined by foreign
donors.
<p>
Other concerns are that as NGO funding becomes tied aid, NGOs' role in advocating social and
political change which are crucial in achieving sustainability, equity and empowerment will be eroded.
The project-based approach to funding by many official donors and Northern NGOs has placed
significant constraints on a participatory, grassroots approach to development, characteristic of NGOs
who are striving to alleviate poverty.
<p>
If Northern NGOs do not wish to see their Southern partners become tools and instruments of
donor-directed development, with all that it implies for their autonomy and sustainability, there is need
to build strategic alliances between like-minded NGOs with complementary skills, both within and
between Northern and Southern NGOs so that they can rationalise their efforts and use of resources.
There is need for on-going collaboration between NGOs so that they can harmonise policy positions
on issues affecting NGOs as a whole, nationally and internationally<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">16</a>.
<p>
The experience of many Northern indigenous NGOs in community development, in nurturing social
partnerships within the voluntary sector, with trade unions and government, and their role in
influencing national policy could inform the work of Northern NGOs working in the South. However,
(with some notable exceptions) the track record of NGOs collaborating either in the North or the South
is not encouraging. A window of opportunity for this emerged at the UN Social Summit, wherein
NGOs from both the domestic and development sectors in the countries of the North and the South
had the chance to discuss common problems faced by them in the light of globalisation, ongoing
poverty and social disintegration. The future relationship between Northern and Southern NGOs will
have to be based on more genuine partnerships built on mutual respect and sharing of power and
resources. They will also need to find efficient ways in which all NGOs can come together, build
alliances between communities, and between NGOs themselves.
<p>
Perhaps the time has come for a division of labour to evolve between NGOs North and South. As
Southern NGOs become stronger and more confident about their work, perhaps Northern NGOs should
focus on developing the capacity of their Southern partners, and assisting them with advocacy work
among Northern donors and global institutions on such issues as donor conditionality and its impact
on the poor, or for a moratorium on debt servicing. This is a major challenge to Northern NGOs
whose credibility and funding is often based on their practical involvement in implementing projects
overseas<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">17</a>, but also points to the need for more innovative ways of maintaining and sustaining public
support through development education. The problems associated with poverty are enormous and too
complex for any one organisation to go it alone. There is need to foster a 'climate of cooperation'
within the NGO community, civil society, and between governments and international institutions. 
<p>
The crucial question for Northern NGOs is what will be their role in this process? They could begin
by initiating a dialogue with Southern partners about the implications for both sides of these changing
trends, and explore how collaboration and cooperation can be strengthened and reinforced. There is
also likely to be a strong role for Northern NGOs to assist Southern NGOs with institutional capacity
building, management development, and income generation as the focus of donors shifts from funding
good project proposals to assessing the general competence, track record and performance of Southern
NGOs. As happened in Europe, those NGOs that strengthen their institutional and organisational
capacity will expand, those who do not may become marginal to development debates. 
<p>
Perhaps the challenge for the future is to help build not only strong individual NGOs, but also a strong
NGO sector in each country that can influence national government policy and programmes, the
private sector, and influence the support provided by external donors.
<p>
<a name="con"><h3><hr>Conclusion</h3></a>

NGOs have a comparative advantage over the private sector and government in relation to sustainable
poverty alleviation arising out of their access to the poor, their relations with intended beneficiaries,
and their organisational freedom<a href="tdrjen_r.htm">18</a>. However, the changes that are taking place in the wider
environment in which NGOs operate demand that adaptation is required if they are to respond to this
dynamic environment. Some may argue that it is not the role of NGOs to place conditions on
governments in exchange for development or humanitarian assistance, and that it is certainly not their
role to help the private sector to make profits, and they may well be right. Others may be threatened
by the growing Southern NGO sector and its direct access to Northern funding. Given the dramatic
changes in global politics, and the economic fate of developing countries since the early 1980s, the
21st century will require creative approaches and flexibility by all parties. Negotiation with
governments and private companies is likely to have a more far reaching and strategic impact on the
lives of the poorest, than any number of individual projects. All development agencies will have to
make strategic choices in the years to come. The quality of the choices that are made will influence
the extent to which the assistance will achieve sustainable benefits for the poor.

<hr>
<b>There are many 'actors' engaged in the process of Third World development
including governments, multilateral institutions, bilateral agencies, private
enterprises and of course, 'non-governmental organisations' (NGOs). The term 'NGO'
covers a range of different bodies and their activities are many and varied.</b>
<p>
<i>We spoke to Michael Aaronson, the Director General of 'The
Save the Children Fund', which is a large British-based NGO. Mr Aaronson is an
Oxford graduate who began his career with a two-year spell in Nigeria as a relief
worker for Save the Children. It was there, he says, that he 'caught the bug for
working in Africa.' He then served as a British diplomat for 16 years before returning
to Save the Children seven years ago to oversee the overseas operations of the
Fund. On 1 May 1995, he became Director-General. We began by asking him about
the role of Save the Children specifically, and northern NGOs more generally.
</i><p>
- There are a number of roles. I think that the primary justification for being
involved in somebody else's country, as an outsider, is the belief that one has some
substantive contribution to make, providing added value by supplementing local
skills, capacities and resources. In other words, bringing or doing something that
cannot be acquired or done locally. Linked to that increasingly is our role in our own
countries of the North, and particularly in the European Union, as an advocate for the
South. We are advocates for the development process and particularly for human
development, which is really the ultimate goal. By drawing on our own experience
of trying to undertake development in the South, we aim to speak with authority and
to have some influence on the policies of the major institutions in the North.
Obviously, for us, this means the British Government and the European Commission
in particular. Our independence is also very important to us. We are not, in any way,
agents of anybody else's policy, other than where there is a mutual coincidence of
interest. In short, our mission requires us to be there, first and foremost, to respond
to need, but we also see it as part of our responsibility to use the experience that that
gives us to try and have some influence on the policy process.
<p>
<i>Do you see any difficulty in carrying out that two-pronged role - providing
development assistance but also lobbying?</i>
<p>
- No, I don't think that there is any clash of interests. Lobbying is not a word
I like particularly - I prefer to talk about using our experience - but in any case, I don't
see it as a separate activity. Provided it is based on our own experience of trying to
make things happen on the ground then I don't think there is any contradiction. After
all, if the European Commission, for example, funds an NGO like Save the Children
to do a development programme somewhere in Africa, then clearly it wants it to be
as effective as possible. If our experience tells us that the conditions the donor is
imposing on us make it more difficult to do our job properly, then I would have
thought it was as much in the interests of the donor to be told that as it is in our
interests to try to have the conditions eased.
<p>
We have been actively engaged with the Commission, alongside other
European NGOs, discussing the general conditions of cofinancing. As you know,
there has been a review process, which I have to say has been going on far too long.
On the humanitarian side, Save the Children has also been very active through our
liaison office in Brussels. We were one of the first agencies to sign a framework
partnership agreement with ECHO (The European Community Humanitarian Office).
We have been involved in the current efforts to review the framework agreement
where again we feel that a number of the stipulations actually make it much more
difficult for us to do our job effectively and deliver for the Commission what it wants.
So we are, if you like, lobbying with others to get those conditions changed.
<p>
<i>One can understand why 'public' bodies like the Commission or national agencies
get in touch with NGOs to do certain things because NGOs are often capable of
'reaching the parts that others cannot reach'. But is there not a danger that you might
be drawn into the system? You presumably having an interest in maintaining your
operations and keeping your staff employed. If that means more co-financing, with
taxpayers' money becoming a major source of income, is there not a concern that
your independence might be compromised?</i>
<p>
- I think there is that danger and it is very important for NGOs to be aware of
it and not let it happen. It is, of course, perfectly legitimate for a public authority
which is charged with implementing a particular policy, to look to others such as
NGOs to help it achieve its goals. We have to be realistic about that, and understand
where the public authorities are coming from. But equally, I think we look to them to
have a sophisticated understanding of our role. We have sometimes felt, particularly
in recent times, that some authorities view NGOs rather simplistically as little more
than contractors. There seems to be a trend in this direction in some parts of the
Commission. There is a failure to understand that we are independent organisations
with our own mission and mandate, our own constituency and our own
accountabilities - both to the people we work with in the developing world and to
those who support our activity at home. So it is perfectly all right for the EU, let us
say, to want us to help it achieve its goals but they need to understand where we are
coming from. It is very important for us not to have our efforts distorted because we
fail to stand up for ourselves. I don't think that it need be adversarial. I think it is just
about the different parties having a better understanding of each other.
<p>
Save the Children gets substantial funding from government and EU sources.
Our turnover is about GBP100m (ECU 120m) a year and about half of that comes from
grants from statutory bodies. But the important point is that the other half comes
from voluntary public subscriptions. So even though we are heavily engaged in
grant-funded activity, we have also got a very solid voluntary fund-raising base.
Indeed, it is because we have that base that we are able to take money from
institutional donors. We are not in the position of having to take the money because
without it we couldn't do the work. We have a very clear view of what we want to do.
If people are happy to fund us to do that work, that's great - they're happy and we're
happy. In other words, the key to it is having a strong independent funding base of
your own.
<p>
<i>How happy are you about the relationship with the EU and about the operation of the
NGO Liaison Committee?</i>
<p>
- I have only been on the Liaison Committee for a year but from my experience
as the British representative, I think that in some parts of the Commission - those
that are used to working with NGOs - there is a desire to improve the nature of the
partnership. In other parts, where working with NGOs is a more recent experience,
I think they have got quite a lot to learn about us. Obviously the people in the NGO
unit in DG VIII (The Development Directorate General) are very experienced and well
aware of the role of NGOs. But elsewhere in the Commission there is definitely a
need for a greater understanding of what we are and what our role can be.
<p>
<h3>'The image of the Third World is becoming less and less positive'</h3>
<p>
<i>In the foyer of your building there is a display which includes a quotation by Sir
Philip Gibbs speaking just after the end of the First World War: He said: 'Beneath all
the hard crust of materialism and cynicism which have Europe in their grip at the
moment, there has been a welling up of generous ardent idealism, which very soon
will break through the crust and prevail.' 75 years on there still seems to be rather a
lot of materialism and cynicism around and arguably it is on the increase. Given that
you have a large base of individual subscribers, are you concerned about the
possible effects of 'aid fatigue'?
</i>
<p>
- I think it is a worrying trend. It is undoubtedly fuelled by a variety of factors:
certainly the international recession and the fact that things have become a lot
harder all round. It is also fuelled, I think, by political changes following the end of
the Cold War. These have unleashed all sorts of rather depressing and destabilising
events. By and large, the image of the Third World is becoming less and less
positive. I think another factor has been the unrealistic expectations of recent times
that have so quickly been dashed. Nobody talks about the new world order any more
but it is quite staggering how, relatively recently, everybody was talking about it.
That's what led the Americans into their disastrous intervention in Somalia. Its the
sort of idealism that was to be found in Boutros Boutros Ghali's 'Agenda for Peace'
which he has now more or less formally acknowledged is unrealistic. It was this
feeling which led the UN Security Council into some pretty foolhardy involvements
in Africa, and the negative feedback from all that is very dispiriting.
<p>
The kind of things that we have seen in Somalia and elsewhere certainly make
life more difficult for organisations like ourselves. They must make also cause
problems for the EU as a donor as it seeks to justify its actions to it own
constituency. But I don't know that I would necessarily call it 'aid fatigue'. I don't
think the individual member of the public is any less moved or that there is any less
compassion around. What there is, at the moment, is a lot of bewilderment as to what
the appropriate solutions are. People thought things would be a lot easier because
that is what they were told, and its not turning out to be so easy after all.
<p>
As regards so-called 'aid fatigue' among officials donors, there have been reports
that the US Congress is trying to slash an already modest aid budget. At the same
time we have a problem in the EU over the funding for the second half of Lom&#233; IV.
<p>
<i>Are you concerned about these trends?</i>
<p>
- Yes. We are all watching what is happening on Capitol Hill with considerable
alarm. We are also concerned about developments in the EU over the second half of
Lom IV and in particular, I have to say, about the minimalist stance adopted by the
British government. They seem to want to blame Europe for reductions in its own
bilateral programmes and to set up some sort of rivalry between the two.
<p>
<i>The UK government says that it wants to expand its bilateral programmes. Do you
think that is likely to happen?</i>
<p>
- I think, frankly that it is a red herring. The real issue at stake here is political
priorities for Europe. It appears that more priority is being attached to relations with
the East and the Mediterranean countries and that that can only be pursued at the
expense of relations with the South. By all means assist the process of transition in
Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. This is very important. We should also
be helping to address the problems of the Mediterranean countries. But surely not
at the expense of the developing world. In absolute terms, levels of poverty and
suffering there are still on a completely different scale to anything we see closer to
home. That there is a squeeze on aid to Africa seems therefore to be a direct
consequence of the fact that there is no additional funding being made available.
That's the real issue. All this stuff about whether a bilateral programme is any better
than a European one is just a smokescreen. Obviously, it appeals to nationalistic
sentiment in a country like Britain where knocking anything European is fashionable.
I think it is utterly depressing how, in British politics, there is so little serious
consideration of the potential benefits to this country of working with our European
partners to try to achieve more together than we can achieve separately. The debate
is never on those terms. It is always conducted in purely negative terms of what are
we going to 'give up' and I find that hugely depressing.
<p>
Interestingly, in the NGO sector, the British have a much better reputation in
Europe. Representing British NGOs, I find that our work is highly appreciated and
welcomed by our European colleagues. This is because we are in an area where we
are all conditioned to think in terms of 'how can we achieve more by working
together?' It is part of the culture and ethos of NGOs, and I think that stands out in
strong contrast to the negative, inward-looking, narrow-minded and depressing
attitude of politicians in this country: politicians of all parties, I have to say. We have
a bit of a 'little England' problem here, I am afraid.
<p>
<i>There is a proliferation of organisations of varying types under the broad
'NGO' heading. And whenever there is a crisis, in somewhere like Rwanda for
example, they all descend on the place, presenting problems of coordination and so
on. What is your view of this phenomenon?</i>
<p>
- The longer-established, and what I would regard as more professional NGOs
(I hope we can count ourselves as one of these), have been very alarmed at this
relatively recent phenomenon of mushrooming NGOs. Rwanda was an appalling
example. There were something like 130 organisations working in the refugee camps
in Zaire and another 100 trying to set up shop inside Rwanda. And frankly, many of
them were thoroughly ill-equipped. They had very little real contribution to make and
seemed to be there solely to raise their own profile and attract funding. They
certainly showed no desire to take part in any coordinated plan of action. So those
of us representing the UK platform on the EC NGO Liaison Committee would put our
cards firmly on the table on this issue. We need, as an NGO community, to begin
trying to impose some standards of our own, for example, by developing codes of
conduct. The good name of NGOs is at stake and I think that we have to do
something about it.
<p>
<h3>'We have to be careful not to impose our own models of civil society
on the countries of the South'</h3>
<p>
<i>What about Southern NGOs. Do you see their emergence as an aspect of the
development process?</i>
<p>
- It is a very important aspect of our work, although I have to say that in recent
years, I think it has become a bit of a fad. There are also very real dangers attached
to it in that we have to be very careful not to impose our own external models of civil
society on the countries of the South. For Save the Children, for example, to go
around setting up little local branches in Africa would seem to me to be completely
inappropriate. The question of what sorts of NGOs emerge as part of the civil society
in developing countries is a matter for the people of those countries. It is not for us
to force the pace or impose our own models. I think we also shouldn't forget that
NGOs form only a limited part of the whole spectrum of civil society. People talk
about NGOs in a very undiscerning way, failing to distinguish between local NGOs
and community-based organisations. The latter may truly represent particular
communities in a way that local NGOs do not. Local NGOs may represent lites,
philanthropists or whatever. That's not necessarily a bad thing, of course - its how
Save the Children came into being - but obviously, the development of civil society
is very important. Local NGOs undoubtedly have a role to play in that but we, as
outsiders, need to be sensitive to the local context and not allow ourselves to be
seduced by the latest fashions.
<p>
<i>The balance appears to be tipping away from traditional development assistance
towards humanitarian activities. Is that something which you have seen within your
organisation?</i>
<p>
- It is certainly a phenomenon that we are concerned about. This refers back
to one of your earlier questions. What seems to be at stake at the moment is the
extent of the the North's commitment to long-term development in the South. There
seems to be some sort of disillusionment with it. We see a much tougher attitude on
conditionality together with a feeling that we will get involved where we have to,
because the scale of suffering is so great, and it is being shown on our television
screens. If we don't react, we will look bad with our own constituency. In practice,
that means a lot of funding that might otherwise have been available for development
work is now being channelled into humanitarian activity. In fact, it is not even
'humanitarian', strictly speaking. It is really emergency relief with a strong political
flavour to it.
<p>
<i>Could you not argue there is some merit in this approach given that, after 30 years 
of attempted development assistance, the number of success stories doesn't appear
to be very great.</i>
<p>
- Well my response would be 'whose fault is that?' Are we really justified in
penalising Africans. Maybe we should look more at our own practices and ask
ourselves if we have been doing it the right way. Obviously, there are faults on both
sides. Africa has done itself no good at all by failures of governance, corruption, civil
war and so on, but I think for us to sit here and pass judgment from on high, ignoring
the historical and contemporary context of Africa, is a bit rich. It is very easy to use
that as an excuse. Let me give you what I think is a good recent example. After the
Kibeho massacre in Rwanda, the Commission announced that it was suspending all
aid through the Kigali government. I actually think that said more about feelings of
inadequacy in Europe than about anything that is happening in Rwanda. I believe
that it was a reflection of European guilt at its failure to engage in Rwanda in
anything more than a superficial way. There has really been only a very half-hearted
involvement in the process of reconciliation, the justice process, and in rehabilitation
and reconstruction. Instead, we have seen huge sums being poured into
unsustainable refugee camps along the border.
<p>
You also asked whether that has been a problem in Save the Children. One of
our corporate goals is that we will continue to provide emergency relief  - but in the
context of long-term development. In other words, we not interested in becoming a
sort of flying squad for humanitarian assistance. We are committed to long-term
development. Obviously, we also try to provide relief where children's lives or well-being are under threat but we will always keep our eye on the longer term
perspective and won't allow ourselves to be diverted from our own goals.
<p>
<i>Broadening the discussion a little, can I ask you about your views on structural
adjustment. There are those who regard it as the great hope - or even the panacea 
- for genuine and sustainable development. Do you agree with that analysis or do
you think that it is ill-founded?</i>
<p>
- I think there are no panaceas in development; certainly no economic
panaceas. I believe that the whole approach to structural adjustment reflects a
misplaced obsession with economic models and a view that development is about
economics when it is actually about people. Economic growth is a means to an end,
not an end in itself. Properly applied, it is a way of achieving greater wealth and,
more crucially, greater well-being for a greater number of people. At the macro-economic level there may be perfectly sound arguments for structural adjustment -  although they have been disputed - but there is no doubt that at the level of the
ordinary people, particularly in Africa, adjustment policies have led to greater
suffering and hardship. Nor is there any guarantee that any economic gains resulting
from adjustment will be applied to the benefit of the population at large. There are
some very well documented cases. What has happened to the health service in
Zimbabwe under structural adjustment is just one example. I think that development
is too important to be left to economists.
<p>
<i>Another big change which, on the face of it, ought to be very encouraging, is the
democratisation process in Africa. Working in an NGO, has that change made it any
easier for you in your dealings with local administrations?
</i><p>
- There are many encouraging things happening in Africa but I think that the
perspective of an organisation like Save the Children is always going to be a bit
different in this area. Even in countries which suffered most under non-democratic
regimes, it has always been possible for us to find people to work with: people who
are committed to improving the lives of children. One thinks, for example, of Ethiopia
under Mengistu. We worked there quite happily for many years and made absolutely 
no compromises to the authorities. Whatever else their faults, they were intelligent
enough to know that they needed us to be there and, therefore, they were prepared
to allow us to carry on working according to our own lights. Now, obviously, we have
a very good, close and ultimately more productive relationship with the new
Ethiopian regime because, if you have a democratic system, there are all sorts of
possibilities that weren't there before. I suppose what I am really saying, without
wishing to sound arrogant about it, is that organisations like Save the Children are
able to reach the parts that others can't as you yourself said. That makes a difference
as to how we view the countries in which we are working.
<p>

<h3>'Children are important social actors in their own right'</h3>

<i>What about the proposition that there can't be development without democracy?
There are those who argue the opposite - that if you try to set up a democratic
system, it is more difficult to get the economy sorted out because of all the
competing interests.</i> 
<p>
- Well there can't be development without human rights. I would certainly
agree with that. But I think that is a slightly different proposition. The trouble is that
when we talk about democracy, we are really talking about our own particular
models. I don't think the case is proven that the Westminster form of governance, for
instance,  is necessarily the most appropriate to the needs of Africa. I think that
remains an open question. We would regard it as a bit insolent if Africans told us
how we should run our democracy here. They have every right to feel somewhat
insulted if we judge them only by their failure to operate our system of governance.
I think we should be a bit more open-minded about that.
<p>
<i>Finally, with specific reference to Save the Children, where do you see your 
organisation going as we approach the next millennium.</i>
<p>
- What we want to do is promote the role of children in development. One of
the reasons for this is to do with human rights. Our Charter is that of the rights of the
child, which are now reflected in a UN Convention. This sets out the values that
underpin all our work. For us, there is therefore an obligation to try to address the
needs of children as part of securing their rights. But we think there are also quite
substantial practical arguments for doing that. Children are important social actors
in their own right. In many countries, they make up more than half the population.
They also, in many cases, contribute quite significantly to household economies. But
their position is usually defined only in relation to adults so that one never really has
any insight into their situation or role in the development process. We think that it
is very important to try to redress that. There is a parallel here with the debate about
the role of women. The role of children in the thinking of policy-makers and planners
today can be compared to that of women 20-25 years ago. It is now a commonplace
that women are crucial to the development process and that policies and programme
should pay particular attention to their situation. What we are saying is that there is
a comparable case to be made with regard to children. So one of the key things we
want to do is to promote the children's agenda in development, as a genuine means
of promoting more effective development programmes.

Report on NGOs and society building</h2>
<h4><i>NAR Secretariat</i>
<p>
Source: <i>In Brief: Information from the NAR</i><br>No. 2, July 1992</h4>
<h5>The full text of the report in English, as well as a list of other publications, are available free of
charge from the Council's secretariat: E-mail: nar-dgis@dgis.minbuza.nl</h5>
</center>
<hr>
<b>On 9 July 1992 the National Advisory Council for Development Cooperation presented its 100th
report to Jan Pronk, the Minister for Development Cooperation, on the role of NGOs in the process of
`society building'.</b>
<p>

<h3>Summary of the problems and the issues covered by the report</h3>

The recent focus on democratisation, good governance and sustainable development led the Advisory
Council to take a closer look at the role in society of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). Little
attention has been paid in policy to the significance of initiatives taken by such organisations, partly because
of the complexity of the subject, which can be approached from many angles.
<p>
To ensure stable development on a democratic basis - otherwise known as `society building' - in developing
countries, a solid network of NGOs is essential. This is one of the major fundamental principles underlying
the report. Individuals must have the opportunity to make their opinions known and to join together to take
action. Only then can countervailing power be used to curb the powers often used by governments in the
interests of only one section of society, and enable large groups within society to become involved in the
societal process. This rarely happens at present.
<p>
The Advisory Council calls for a broad spectrum of organisations to be regarded as having something to
contribute to development. The report lists the examples of organisations of teachers, journalists, doctors,
lawyers and judges, trades unions, consumers, employers, cultural organisations and even sports as-
sociations. Many of these NGOs are off the donor circuit. They should be given more support; development
cooperation is all too often restricted to the eradication of poverty.
<p>
<h3>Uneven growth</h3>

Until recently, economic growth, in terms of Gross National Product (GNP), was the most important
criterion for establishing a country's stage of development. More and more account is now being taken of
societal factors such as educational standards and health care. The term development is often interpreted
more broadly in international debate, and encompasses respect for human rights, democratisation, standards
of education, the position of women and the environment. Economic growth is not always essential for the
`quality' of a society to be improved. While the strong economic growth experienced in a number of Asian
countries may seem commendable, it is actually very one-sided and the majority of the population have no
share in it. What is more, the environment is being sacrificed to economic progress, with no regard for
sustainable development.
<p>
At the same time, the idea that development processes can be controlled by social engineering - with the
outcome determined by the state or donor - is being eroded. The recognition that development is a multi-
faceted and varied process emphasises the complexity of the relationship between development and society
building. The changes in East-West relations have given a new complexion to the debate on whether
societies can be `created'. More education does not necessarily lead to democratisation or respect for human
rights, and economic growth will not always be accompanied by democratisation or constitutional
government. The idea that central control without the consent or control of large proportions of the
population is doomed to fail sooner or later is gaining currency. Although this is a derived objective, the
Advisory Council believes that there are sufficient grounds for reflecting the role of NGOs in policy.
<p>
<h3>Countervailing power</h3>

Individuals must have the opportunity to voice their opinions and to join together to take action. Only then
can countervailing power be used to curb the powers often used by government in the interests of only one
section of society, and to enable large groups within society to become involved in the societal process.
<p>
NGOs' ability to exercise countervailing power lies in their organisational and mobilising role. Their
organisational capacity is important not only for the eradication of poverty and representation of interests but
also for the formation of an organisational base for government policy to wipe out poverty in the long term.
Organisations make the public and the authorities aware of issues such as the environment and human rights,
lending them more weight in social and political debate.
<p>
Although, on the face of it, the term `countervailing power' may seem to have negative connotations, this is
not necessarily so. It is a positive thing when it is used against powers which, if unchecked, could be very
destructive. Depending on the situation, countervailing power might be exercised against the power of the
state, major landowners, banks, or monopolies which prevent balanced pricing and hinder the free operation
of the market.
<p>
<h3>Conclusions and recommendations</h3>

The Advisory Council has observed uneven growth in many developing countries, which has led to a one-
sided social structure dominated by economic growth or an excessively large state apparatus. Such
unevenness often gives rise to conflicts, and even violent protest, which seriously hamper efforts to achieve
a sustainable form of development.
<p>
In its policy dialogue with developing countries, the Netherlands can support the process of `society
building' by calling for more scope for NGOs to operate and by drawing attention to universally recognised
principles of freedom of expression and organisation. This policy is known as `positive linkage' and aims to
create the conditions in which compliance with these principles can be achieved. It is the opposite of
`negative linkage', where sanctions are imposed after violation of the norms. Although this can also be
extremely effective, the Advisory Council has concluded that a greater and longer-lasting effect can
ultimately be achieved with positive linkage.
<p>
The Advisory Council recommends that three conditions be attached to the provision of assistance to
NGOs. Firstly, the specific conditions in which they operate should be well known. Questions such as "what
is their relationship with the government?", "which organisations can make a contribution to society
building?" and "how can they be supported?" need to be answered if support is to be effective. Secondly,
any support should be based on a local initiative, in order to prevent distortion of the process of societal
development. Finally, it must be clear that the organisations in question can operate with a sufficient degree
of independence (in terms of organisation and funding), or are expected to be able to do so in the near
future.
<p>
The Advisory Council concludes that support can be provided for NGOs through co-financing and through
sectoral organisations in the North. Besides direct funding, new forms of funding could be applied, where
activities are paid for from a fund managed in the developing country itself. In addition, NGOs which are
part of an international network and have insufficient funds to take part in such activities could be made
eligible for broader forms of support. This type of support, for which travel scholarships are an effective
instrument, can encourage exchange of information and input by experts and reinforce both international
frameworks and the participating organisations.
<p>
In the view of the Advisory Council, professional organisations deserve special attention, in the form of
training and measures to facilitate exchange of experience and know-how and strengthen their position. The
Advisory Council concludes that twinning between organisations (often in the North and South) could be a
feasible instrument. Many Dutch NGOs already have links with counterpart organisations in developing
countries, some of them in the form of cooperative arrangements. Such links are gaining in importance and
deserve serious attention. The Advisory Council recommends that a study be carried out to establish where
such links can be encouraged in the framework of development cooperation. Such a policy could also
increase public support for development cooperation in the Netherlands.

<p>
<a name="sum"><h3>Summary</h3></a>
Modes of donor assistance shift according to the policies and
attitudes changing in the donor community and in the donor countries
themselves. However, the effects of the interventions are also
highly dependent on the policies of the recipient countries, and
only when the policies of both partners converge and support each
other, are the chances for successful and lasting results good.
<P>
The emergence of a renewed interest in local government and decentralisation
in the early 1990's is  due to several reasons:
<UL>
<LI> increased emphasis on popular participation and democratisation
(in which, the decentralisation of decisions for local communities
is seen to be essential);
<LI> the economic crisis forcing donors and national governments
to look for other ways to mobilise local resources;
<LI> frustration with the results of planning and implementation
through central governments which lack capacity and legitimacy;
<LI> the recognition that a well-functioning public administration
is an indispensable part of a modern developing society consisting
of both a private, market-driven production sector and a service-delivering
public sector, managed by legitimate and representative political
leaders, both at national level and at the level of local governments.
</UL>
<P>
The donor community has slowly, but increasingly realised the
development potential of decentralisation and popular participation,
and acted by supporting local reform processes, decentralised
planning, or specific local government programmes. However, there
are not many studies on the experiences gained from such donor
supported interventions, and very few as viewed from local government.
Most of the available studies appear to conclude that donors can
only play a modest role in decentralisation processes (see B&oslash;rhaug,
1994: 6).
<P>
In this paper, decentralisation and donor interventions is seen
from the <U>perspective of a local government</U> in Uganda, as
experienced by the Rakai District during 1990-95. This period
covers the preparation of the Rakai District Development Programme
(RDDP), supported by the Danish International Development Assistance
(DANIDA), the implementation of phase 1 (January, 1992 up to September,
1995) and the preparation of phase 2 (running from October 1995
to September 1999). Experiences from Rakai show that if a national
policy aiming at substantial devolution of powers and resources
to local governments exists, then <U>donor interventions are important</U>
in terms of providing resources and illuminating strategic options
for local governments, and that their procedures and approaches
<U>can be a major factor in determining for the level of political
and administrative capacity-building</U>, i.e. in developing democratic
decision-making and local participation.
<P>
In the following, a brief introduction to Ugandan decentralisation
policy is given. The actual implementation by the central government
and line ministries is illustrated through a discussion of the
difficult changes of attitudes and activities that followed the
enactment of the Local Government Statute in 1993. The creation
and key elements of the DANIDA-supported programme are presented
and followed by a brief account of related interventions of other
donors in the District. Finally, a number of conclusions and recommendations
relevant to decentralised cooperation as presented. These reflect
the view from Rakai District, situated at a cross-roads where
the interventions of donors meet the interference of Central Government.
<P>
<a name="dec"><h3><hr>Decentralisation in Uganda</h3></a>
<P>
The policy of democratic decentralisation in Uganda was conceived
during the 1980's, when the present governing National Resistance
Movement (NRM) was fighting in the bush. The first objective of
its Ten Point Programme was to create a local government system
that would be democratic, participatory, efficient and development-oriented.
It also indicated that the new system would empower local communities
to take charge of their destiny through local institutions of
self governance and resource mobilisation.
<P>
Following the change of government in 1986, the system of local
Resistance Councils (from village via Parish, Sub-County, County
and District to the national level) was legalised through the
Resistance Councils and Committees Statute (1987). This enabled
local councils to be involved to some extent in local political
issues. However, as key decisions on areas like planning, finance,
implementation and accountability were left to the central government,
a debate continued on how a local government system with devolved
of powers and resources could be developed to replace the highly
centralised Local Administrations Act of 1967. The <U>main weaknesses</U>
related to a <U>lack of an effective personnel system</U> that
provided Local Governments with the power to appoint, deploy and
control the officials; a <U>lack of clear lines of authority</U>
with respect to services provided by central line-ministries;
the <U>failure to create a dynamic financial relationship</U>
between the Central and Local Governments; the <U>existence of
a dual system of administration</U> by the local authorities and
the Central Government, which has, according to President Musevini,
&quot;tended to preserve the sectoral approach to development
and to promote the duplication of effort, operational inefficiencies,
the wastage of resources and a strong sense of departmentalism&quot;
(Decentralisation Secretariat, 1993: 5).
<P>
Accordingly, through a number of commissions, hearings and draft
papers (commented upon by the World Bank and DANIDA), consensus
was reached on the key features needed for local government reform.
The Cabinet approved the policy in November 1991. In August 1992,
it was endorsed by the NRC (Parliament) Sub-Committee on Local
Government, which also provided a budgetary provision (subsidised
by DANIDA) to establish and operate a Secretariat within the Ministry
of Local Government. The <U>decentralisation policy was officially
launched on 2 October 1992</U> by His Excellency the President.
A draft proposal for a Local Government law was prepared during
1993, and, taking into account the major recommendations of the
draft constitution then available, it was decided to go ahead.
The <U>Local Governments (Resistance Councils) Statute,</U> 1993
(hereafter called: the Statute), was passed by the Parliament
in November, 1993, and became <U>effective from December, 31,
1993</U>. 
<P>
The objective of the Statute was to create a process of decentralisation
in which functions, powers and responsibilities are transferred
from the Central Government to local Governments, and from higher
local Governments to lower local Government Councils. The aim
was to ensure that governmental decisions are taken as close as
possible to those involved (para 2). This devolution is, as a
principle, total: &quot;<U>Every District,.., and Town Resistance
Council shall</U>, within its own area of jurisdiction, with the
exceptions listed (i.e. matters reserved for the Central Government),
<U>exercise all political and administrative authority and provide
services as it deems fit</U>&quot; (para 11). The Central Government
will take care of: defence, fiscal and economic policies, migration,
minerals, national monuments, foreign relations, national planning,
justice, institutes of higher learning, hospitals, etc., while
the powers, functions and services performed by the District and
Urban Councils include: primary education and vocational schools,
medical and health services, water services, roads services (apart
from national roads), and all field services and activities of
every decentralised Ministry (including agriculture, fisheries,
forestry, community services, etc.).
<P>
While the Statute as a framework for institution building and
administrative reform applied to all local Governments of Uganda,
<U>financial decentralisation was to be implemented in phases</U>.
As stated by the Decentralisation Secretariat: &quot;It is foreseen
that the implementation of decentralisation will be a flexible
and continuous process - the Local Governments Statute was designed
and passed as an enabling law that opens doors for a continuous
process of decentralisation and creates a framework for autonomous
decision making&quot;. The introduction of block grants, i.e.
the transfer of funds from the Central Government to the District
Councils, was to be in 3 phases, with 13 Districts receiving District
Votes in 1993/94, and Block Grants from 1994/95 when another 14
Districts started with District Votes. Thus, by 1996/97, all 39
District will be on the grant system. Apart from the funds received
from the Central Government, the Local Governments retain the
personal taxes collected as Graduated Tax from all taxpayers of
the District and any other revenues like licences or market dues.
Half of the locally mobilised revenues is retained at the Sub-County
level, while the other half is forwarded to the District Council.
This is important, as the funds actually available for local government
will decide the success of the decentralisation process. 
<P>
<a name="att"><h3><hr>Decentralising Central Government Attitudes: a Difficult Process</h3></a>
<P>
The decentralisation policy of the Ugandan Government, and the
legal framework have thus been clear and comprehensive since 1993.
However, centralist and hierarchical attitudes and traditional
bureaucratic approaches firmly established through a century of
practise are not changed overnight. The Statute had to be implemented
through the elaboration of detailed Financial Regulations, Accounting
Manuals, countless directives and specific decisions, and many
case-by-case discussions. The major battlefields were naturally
financial and personnel management.
<P>
Although the Block Grant system was originally presented from
the Decentralisation Secretariat as the transfer of unspecified
funds to the District Council, in reality, the Ministry of Finance
and the <U>line-ministries succeeded in earmarking and deciding
on the utilisation of most of the block grant funds</U>. For Rakai,
out of the USH 1.598 million Block Grant appropriated for 1994/95,
only 502 million (31 %) were not specified as, for example the
salaries of civil servants, primary and secondary teachers, and
support to health centres. The Ministry of Education even issued
a 'Policy Guideline' Circular in November 1994 in which it tried
to specify how the District should spend the decentralised, unspecified
block grants for detailed, educational purposes.
<P>
Furthermore, the criteria for distributing the grants among the
Districts were not clear, and the existing allocation patterns
were more or less maintained; that is, the urban and larger Districts
received the major share, although a policy of equity-allocation
was intended. However, it was a major achievement that the Block
Grant system got started, and in particular, that the amounts
appropriated by the Central Government were actually disbursed
to the District on time. This greatly facilitated the budgeting
and planning process in Rakai, and increased the confidence in
the government and the decentralisation policy as such.
<P>
However, it was soon realised that <U>decentralisation only included
recurrent funds</U> for operational purposes, while the capital
funds for investment and development were interpreted by the Ministry
of Finance and other central ministries not to have been decentralised.
This was despite the functions being specifically mentioned in
the Statute's Sixth Schedule (e.g. the services of agricultural
extension, health, water, etc.), and no distinction between recurrent
and capital development being made anywhere in the Statute. As
will be discussed later, the main reasons for this are the reliance
on donor funding for capital development.
<P>
The accounting procedures required by the Ministries of Finance/Local
Government also <U>impeded transparency and local control</U>.
In the pilot year of the Vote system, the District was requested
to set up a special ad-hoc accounting unit for the 'decentralised
funds' (dubbed very ambiguously the 'Decentralisation Desk') with
the task to deliver special accounts for disbursements during
the financial year of the Central Government July, 1, - June,
30. Although the funds were spent by the District, and somehow
included in the District Budget (covering the period October,
1 - September, 30), this double-accounting (one set of accounts
for the Central Government Funds, and another for the Local Government,
partly overlapping) was blurred and non-transparent to the political
leaders. For the financial year 1995/96, the Decentralisation
Desk was dissolved, and accounting was done by the Finance Office
in a comprehensive way, but the concept of 'special accounts'
for the Central Government still prevailed, and the gap between
the Local Government and Central Government financial years still
was not bridged. In reality, when the District Council approves
its budget by the end of September, it is based upon an assumption
that the Central Government will provide funds for the period
July-September the following year, although the exact amount is
not known until the following July.
<P>
While the financial implementation thus to a reasonably degree
is in accordance with the decentralisation policy, the <U>key
issue of personnel management has been more difficult to decentralise</U>.
The Statute was clear: As of January, 1, 1994, all civil servants
of the decentralised departments presently stationed in the respective
Districts became employees of the Local Government. Their future
employment, control and eventual dismissal became the responsibility
of the District Service Committees, to be nominated by the District
Council and approved by the Ministry of Public Service. However,
it was soon found that these wide-ranging powers did not include
the largest group of local civil servants - primary school teachers
- who made up about 2,400 of all 3,400 local government employees
in Rakai. A special District Teaching Service Committee, not mentioned
in the Statute, was to be appointed to take care of the teachers
(including all personnel administration like appointment, transfers,
etc.), subject to the approval by the Ministry of Education. The
establishment of the Committee was dragged out, and only when
the Head of the Civil Service was requested to intervene personally
by the Rakai District Council was the Committee approved by mid-1995.
<P>
For other central ministries, it also took a long time before
they adjusted to the new Statute. The Ministry of Health tried
well into 1994 to transfer a nurse from the Health Centre in Rakai
town to the National Hospital Mulago in Kampala, and the Ministry
of Agriculture kept on advertising positions of Fishery Officers,
etc to be deployed as District Officers. It was noted as a great
achievement when the District Executive Secretary (the only civil
servant at District level who was still an employee of the Ministry
of Public Service) dared to politely notify the Permanent Secretary
of the Ministry of Health, that his transfer-order was actually
illegal.
<P>
The implementation of the Local Governments statute coincided
with the preparation and implementation of a <U>Civil Service
Reform</U> programme in Uganda, and this programme, initiated
and funded primarily by the World Bank, could be seen as a test
of how the degree to which important decision-making process on
the future administrative structure of the local governments was
decentralised. In March, 1994, a joint team from the Ministries
of Public Service and Local Government arrived in Rakai to carry
out interviews among the civil servants on their assessments of
the present and future structure of the District administration.
Based on these, and not including any opinions of the local political
leaders, a report was drafted, which more or less was a copy of
the standard structure for all Districts, as perceived by the
Ministry of Public Service. However, due to the interception and
critical elaboration by the local political leadership and secretariat
(supported by the resident Adviser), the draft proposal was significantly
scaled down. Subsequently, the Rakai District Administration implemented
its own re-structuring from 26 local departments (each representing
a central government ministry or department) into 8 amalgamated
departments plus two offices referring directly to the Council
(the Council Clerk and the Internal Auditor). In September, however,
the District Council was requested to finally endorse the Ministry
of Public Services's re-structuring proposal. A summary was read
out in the afternoon session of the District Council, while in
the morning session it had already carefully debated and approved
the District Budget 1994/95, including the specific positions
for all civil servants in the re-structured administration. However,
after some amendments, it was unanimously approved. Having second
thoughts, one Councillor asked, which of the two endorsements
were now prevailing - the District Budget or the Ministerial Proposal?
The reply, suggested by himself, and approved with loud acclamation
was: &quot;They are both valid, but if a contradiction occurs,
the District Budget will prevail.&quot;
<P>
This was probably the crucial point where the local civil servants
and the political leaders realised that the decentralisation of
the budget process and the decisions involved in this process
is the key to a genuine devolution of powers and resources. This
is where local political priorities are turned into operational
activities and corresponding budget lines. A ministerial approval
is no longer needed for the District Budget. Although some of
the Heads of Department from time to time still claim that this
or that position is mentioned in the Rakai District Re-structuring
Report, and thus should be established, the standard question
from the Finance Committee and the District Executive Secretary
is to ask whether the position is in the approved District Budget?
Otherwise, the proposal must be scrutinised in the budget process
for next financial year.
<P>
Of course, the process of implementation continues during the
next years until new administrative traditions are established.
Presently, the issues of the pay-rolls of the local civil servants
and the assets of the local governments are on the agenda. While
civil servants are employed by the local government, the salary
scales and actual payment are administered by the Central Government
and the Uganda Computer Service. Changes to this arrangement are
already underway and the Rakai District Council has approved its
own District Personnel Policy for the District Budget 1995/96,
including (District) incentives and bonus-schemes on top of the
standard Central Government salary-scales. An inventory of assets
belonging to the Central Government or to the Local Governments
was not made on January 1, 1994, and disputes on who is to profit
from the sales of buildings, vehicles, land, etc. or who is to
operate and maintain the same are now in progress.
<P>
While the Local Governments Statute will be adjusted according
to experiences, and in accordance with the new Ugandan Constitution
enacted in September 1995, it is envisaged that only minor adjustments
will take place as devolution of powers, functions and resources
is still the main principles on which the new Constitution rests.
However, it is obvious that it will take much longer time, maybe
a full generation, before the mental attitudes of the representatives
of the Central Government will change. It will take deliberate
efforts from the local governments, and their administrative managers,
before unscheduled by senior representatives from Kampala will
be postponed or have to wait, if a scheduled Committee-meeting
of the Rakai District Council is in session.
<P>
<a name="don"><h3><hr>Donor Intervention in Rakai District: the DANIDA-supported
RDDP</h3></a>
<P>
When the first contacts were made during 1989-90 between the Danish
Embassy in Kampala and the Ugandan Government on a future DANIDA-supported
programme in Rakai District, it was based on inputs from NGOs,
in particular the Lutheran World Federation, DanChurchAid and
the Rakai Development Association (based in Kampala), and the
preliminary ideas of the government on the planned decentralisation
reform. However, the implications to be incorporated in the programme
document, drafted after a substantial number of preparatory studies
had been elaborated (on for example, the Resistance Council system,
the needs within different sectors, and assessment of specific
proposals), were quite rudimentary. &quot;The principles for the
future division of responsibilities between the central and local
government authorities are unclear. It is evident, that since
there is no experience in the country for decentralisation there
is a need for procedures and guidelines to be drawn up in central
government and to carry out training programmes for local government
officers&quot; (DANIDA, 1991: 39). Thus, from the outset, the
Rakai District Development Programme (RDDP) was intended to pursue
national decentralisation policies, using Rakai District as a
pilot model for implementation, and at the same time supporting
the Decentralisation Secretariat at the national level.

<P>
Instead of using a blueprint approach, the design was deliberately
chosen as a long-term programme where the overall frame and development
objectives are specified to some extent at the initial phase,
but the actual project contents are defined over time in <U>an
interactive process between the recipients and the donor</U>.
A <U>long-term commitment to Rakai District of 15-20 years</U>
was thus made in the original government-to-government agreement
of 1992, but only the first phase of 3 years (January 1992 to
December 1994) were detailed. Moreover, the contents were debated
and decided upon mainly by the District representatives and local
leaders, although the Ministries of Local Government and Finance
and Economic Planning also participated. A major input was a 3-day
Programme Planning Workshop in Rakai District in April 1991, where
the local priorities (e.g. rehabilitation of roads) were given
higher preference than initial donor suggestions (health, water
supply, education).
<P>
Strategically, the intentions were <U>not to integrate all programme
activities</U>, but to promote the development of the District
through many different agents like the District Administration,
specific government or private institutions, local, national and
international NGOs, community-based activities, entrepreneurs,
and individuals. The individual implementing agencies were to
be responsible for the day-to-day management, and any co-ordination
would be solved as the needs arise. The managers would be accountable
to the specific political committees/Board of Directors/community
constituencies, while the overall prioritisation of the resources
is left to the District Council, i.e. the ordinary, supreme political
body of the District. However, this model was only gradually introduced
and implemented, and flexibility in programme design and implementation
is a key trait of RDDP.
<P>
Operationally, the <U>implementation of the RDDP-activities</U>
has in general been <U>through existing local institutions, organisations
or contractors</U>, supported or assisted by local consultants,
as far as possible. <U>No Project Implementation Unit (PIU)</U>
with recruitment of unsustainable project staff was included in
the donor design, and <U>only one resident District Adviser</U>
has been attached to the programme (assisted by one Administrative
Assistant). Obviously, the role of the resident Adviser has been
crucial in piloting, promoting and facilitating, but always in
an advisory role, and only partly involved in implementation in
terms of monitoring and financial control. A donor funded incentive
scheme for the key senior civil servants was unavoidable for the
First Phase (otherwise their commitment and energy would be used
for basic survival), but with the District Council's approval
of the District Personnel Policy, it has already been phased out.
<P>
The first, specific support for decentralised planning included:
<UL>
<LI> the functioning of an efficient <U>District Planning and
Co-ordination Unit</U>,
<LI> the establishment of a decentralised system ensuring that
funds are made available to implement local priorities as determined
by a democratic process (i.e. <U>trials with block grants</U>),
<LI> the establishment of a new system of <U>accountability</U>
to enable the local governments (Resistance Councils) to monitor
the implementation of these policies by public servants (and to
enable DANIDA to ensure implementation),
<LI> and the establishment of a <U>District Development Fund</U>
as an initial stage of financial decentralisation.
</ul><p>
During 1992-93, the RDDP-1 took off with the establishment of
the necessary infrastructure, rehabilitation of existing offices
and residences and construction of new ones; the supply of motorcycles,
bicycles and vehicles; the low-profile procurement and donation
of office equipment and machinery; -- all of the standard physical
items which are necessary for any local government to operate.
However, <U>most importantly, training of the local political
leaders and the civil servants in their functions and roles</U>
was started, and the political and administrative capacity was
developed: preparing and making a budget, conducting of meetings,
planning and implementation of projects, screening applications
for funding, etc., became part of the training, either in scheduled
seminars, or as part of the day-to-day management.
<P>
Many of the problems faced were solved, however, on a preliminary
ad-hoc basis, and the role of the donor Embassy was substantial.
As observed by the DANIDA Review-team in October 1993, when addressing
the constraints in the capacity strengthening efforts: &quot;The
continuation of some ad-hoc institutional arrangements mainly
introduced by the Embassy in the initial stages of the programme.
While  they could be explained in those days, they now cause some
confusion about the roles of both the District Administration
and the organisational structure of the programme. These arrangements
lead to double administration, non-transparency and problems with
the release of funds for various components&quot; (DANIDA, 1993:
3).
<P>
An important example is the ad-hoc District Planning and Co-ordination
Committee (DPCC), mentioned above, institutionalised in the Government
Agreement as the co-ordinating and monitoring programme body,
where the Embassy was directly representing the donor in monthly
meetings: &quot;The actual existence and position of the DPC made
it possible for the donor to play a rather dominant role in the
decision-making process at district level (that, according to
the programme's strategy, should have been much more of a &quot;learning-experience&quot;
for the respective local authorities). This, and the fact, that
the donor at times unilaterally called in the services of external
consultants, has constrained the capacity building of local authorities&quot;
(DANIDA, 1993: 35).
<P>
Immediately after the review, the Embassy immediately withdrew
from the DPC and left the donor's seat to the resident District
Adviser. More emphasis was put on emphasising the role of the
District as the client, when contracting consultancies and entrepreneurial
works, thus training the District in drafting Terms of Reference
and contracts, while leaving a sponsoring role to the Embassy.
And all involved and DANIDA-supported organisations were requested
to report to and co-ordinate with the District authorities in
their planning and implementation of activities.
<P>
With the Local Governments Statute coming into force by the beginning
of 1994, clearer directions were easier to see and follow. In
three major areas of operation, <U>DANIDA adjusted their approach
to the new decentralisation Statute</U>: 1) by adjusting the programme
bodies to the new legal and administrative structure; 2) by integrating
programme planning with the long-term planning of the Rakai District;
and 3) by integrating donor funding with the budget-process of
Rakai District. 
<P>
First, the donor-designed DPC was phased out, and the co-ordinating
and monitoring functions were taken over by two statutory bodies
-- the Technical Planning Committee, a purely technical body of
the departmental Heads, chaired by the District Executive Secretary,
and the District Resistance Committee (the Executive Committee
of the District Council), consisting only of politicians, chaired
by the District Council Chairman. Both committees are ordinary
bodies of the Rakai District and the donor representative was
only an observer. The role and the influence of the donor is thus
gradually being phased out, formally as well as in reality, and
taken over by local institutions.
<P>
The donor supported training and capacity building to a very large
degree then became <U>supplementary to the efforts of the national
and local decentralisation policies</U>. A proposal to structure
the political Sub-Committees and the District Departments along
the same lines was adopted by the Rakai District Council and subsequently
recommended by the Decentralisation Secretariat to all local governments.
This implied that all Departments came under the direct political
control of a District Council Sub-Committee. Further, a synchronised,
fixed meeting schedule for all the committees of the Council and
District Administration made it possible to plan and process the
on-going political and administrative decisions in a co-ordinated
way, not least the Annual Budget process. Training in conducting
of meetings, minute-taking, and in the general and specific roles
of political leaders and civil servants was imparted. The efforts
of the donor and the national programme of decentralisation converged
at the lower government level where Sub-County seminars in the
contents and spirit of the Statute were conducted by the team
of Rakai District officials and the DANIDA Adviser.
<P>
Secondly, the <U>long-term planning of the Rakai District development
also became a joint donor/District exercise</U> where DANIDA had
to adapt to the local institutional frame. The RDDP-1 formally
expired on December 31, 1994, and as funds were still available,
it was originally suggested that the phase could be extended with
one or even two more (calendar) years without much change in contents.
However, it was found more appropriate to adjust the planning
of the RDDP-2 to the planning process of Rakai District, which
followed a 5-year period from 1994/95  to 1998/99 with the local
government financial year October 1 - September 30, as its basis.
To bridge the transition and tally with the periods, the RDDP-2
became a 4-year programme from October 1, 1995 to September 30,
1999. This enabled Rakai District to embark on and carry out an
extensive discussion and elaboration of the objectives, strategies
and priorities of the Rakai District Five-year Development Plan,
as the first District in Uganda. Conducted simultaneously with
the ordinary budget process for 1994/95, it was approved by the
District Council on September 30, 1994. Further, the actual projects
to be implemented were suggested and decided upon in the following
months in time to be put forward to DANIDA, as the starting point
of an appraisal for RDDP-2. Even though the quality of the final
plan of course may be improved, and a need for future readjustment
exists, the impact of the Development Plan was substantial. Thus,
it was not necessary for the donor to initiate a special ad-hoc
process to involve the participation of the 'beneficiaries', as
they had already themselves made the basic work. Even as additional
studies and consultancies were fielded for some sectors, the District
had more than a &quot;stake&quot; in the work, and most of the
tasks were carried out by local consultants.
<P>
Thirdly, <U>integration of the donor funding and the budgets of
Rakai District</U> had already been on the agenda before the new
Statute, and the (limited) donor block grant was included as a
subsidy to the District Budget from 1993/94. As the DANIDA non-earmarked
block grant (about USH 250 million) was only 35% of the total
recurrent support of (about USH 700 million.), the major part
of donor funds were not initially included in the District budget,
but transferred from the Embassy directly to the District unit
or fund concerned. From 1994/95, however, all recurrent support
(USH 664 million or 22 % of the District recurrent budget) was
included in the District Budget (totalling USH 2.980 million),
and from 1995/96 all DANIDA-funded capital development support,
totalling USH 4.224 million was also included in the budget to
ensure transparency. Most of funds might still be channelled from
the Embassy to the implementing agencies - contractors for infrastructure
components, NGOs operating in the District, consultants, financial
institutions, etc. - but the decisions on the allocations are
a joint process, and the agreed amounts are seen in the District
budget. For RDDP-2, an <U>Annual Review Meeting (ARM)</U> has
been institutionalised as the forum where funds are negotiated
and allocated for the coming year within an agreed total frame
for RDDP-2. Flexibility is thus secured between the specific financial
years and the individual components and activities, but the overall
frame for the four years is fixed.
<P>
The <U>accountability implications are the most difficult ones
to accept and solve</U>. The dilemma of the donor is how to strengthen
the capacity of the new local government, i.e. to leave the responsibility
for the budgeting and the accounting to the local recipients and
their constituents, and at the same time to monitor and account
to donor constituents at home for the appropriate and responsible
spending. How fast and in which areas shall the transfer of responsibility
take place? No fixed guidelines are available, and the experiences
of successful decentralisation are limited. However, the experiences
from the block grant utilisation and the accounting for these
funds through RDDP-1 show, that <U>it is possible to build up
the capacity of acceptable accounting</U> (though still not sufficiently
timely and adequate in all details) <U>in a local government</U>.
But this a very important achievement, as most donors would not
accept the principle of general accounting for specific subsidies,
but would demand specific accounting, thereby excluding the option
of general subsidies. As a result, the capacity of the Rakai District
Finance Office is strengthened, and the donor (DANIDA) will in
future be able to support the District through non-specified grants.
The importance of the accounting requirements is stressed by the
agreement between DANIDA and Rakai District for RDDP-2. It requires
that monthly statement of accounts on all budget lines of the
District are delivered by the 10th of the following month. Otherwise,
the donor is entitled to immediately terminate all further programme
fund disbursement.
<P>
Even the <U>auditing process is being integrated</U>. Fortunately,
the Statute allows the Uganda Auditor-General to contract out
the actual preparation of audit of local governments. DANIDA and
the Auditor-General agreed to audit Rakai District Accounts jointly
by a private auditing company, thereby speeding up the process
and integrating the audit requirements of the two partners. This
did not disqualify the Danish Auditor-General of any additional
auditing, if required.
<P>
Finally, the donor has supported Rakai District in its <U>capacity
to monitor and evaluate the activities of the District</U>, whether
they are DANIDA-supported or not. A general progress monitoring
system, based on monthly physical and financial reports of all
Departments and agencies involved, is regularly drafted by the
District Planning Unit and presented to the District Development
Committee (a standing Sub-Committee of the Council) for scrutiny.
Further, for the long-term effect and impact monitoring, a Village-Wise
Impact Monitoring System (VIMS) has been set up, whereby regular
data-collection from 10 selected villages is made by a female
and male village-reporter on topics like population changes, agricultural
production, health and primary education. The information is processed
and analysed by the District Planning Unit and presented to the
District Development Committee as well as the donor.

<P>
Overall, in all areas of DANIDA support (rehabilitation/maintenance
of roads, construction of offices, credit, extension, planning,
local projects, training, etc.) the <U>capacity-building and institutional
development has been the main focus</U>, delivered through the
resident District Adviser, supported from time to time by short-term
consultants, and facilitated by project finance and purposely
designed procedures. As the presence and added-value of long-term
resident advisers have been questioned by many donors in recent
years, and DANIDA itself has adopted a policy to reduce the number
of long-term advisers (Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 1994: 19),
it is important to note that this critique is not substantiated
by the experiences from Rakai District. On the contrary, <U>the
advantages of using a (single) resident, long-term adviser are
many</U>: the longer term means that the adviser can be easily
integrated in the daily routines of the administration and attending
the political committees, while gaining the confidence of the
partners; being resident implies, that he/she is able to be present
when the problems and issues are on the agenda, set-up by the
politicians or administrators themselves (and not defining another
donor agenda, as short-term consultants are forced to do); and
most important, being the only adviser implies (not least for
capacity reasons), that the role is purely advisory and observing,
acting as a trainer and catalyst, delivering ideas and inputs,
and informing on the intentions of the donor, but not implementing
anything. 
<P>
Unambiguity, limited internal communication, simplicity and low-key
approach are the basic features. For the donor, the added advantage
is to have a representative on the spot, informing on local developments
and giving feed-back, and being able to monitor activities and
control financially, as required. The long-term adviser, of course,
will have to be combined with the utilisation of short-term consultants,
as the resident adviser is not omnipotent. But the resident adviser
may facilitate such additional technical inputs, and train the
District in the drafting of terms of reference for such tasks
and assist in the negotiation of consultancy contracts.
<P>
<a name="int"><h3><hr>Intervention by Other Donors in Rakai District</h3></a>
<P>
DANIDA is not the only donor operating in Rakai District. Since
donor activity in Uganda is at a very high level (the national
capital development budget is funded nearly 100% by donor funds),
the list of bilateral and multilateral donor activities is very
long. This is particularly true for Rakai which was severely damaged
during the Tanzanian invasion in 1979 and the first area of the
country where the AIDS scourge was observed. However, a comprehensive
list of all donors operating in the District is not easily available,
as the information of their activities is not delivered to the
local government in a systematic way, but is kept within national
or international agencies.
<P>
As <U>most donor programmes</U> (and in particular, the multilateral
programmes) <U>are channelled through central ministries as sector-programmes</U>,
cross-sectoral co-ordination is weak, and integration in the local
level planning is absent. This is experienced also from other
African countries by many observers (see Sikabanze, 1990; Kalapula,
1990). Planning, budgeting and accounts by-pass ordinary procedures,
and the donors themselves also monitor and evaluate &quot;their&quot;
projects, each following a unique procedure. Any deviation from
the nation-wide or regional sector-programmes are difficult to
include for the individual district, and <U>integration in the
local area development planning becomes nearly impossible</U>.
The bureaucratic procedures of the central agencies and line ministries
further impede the local co-ordination.
<P>
This has been known for a long time. So it is more surprising
to experience how, at the local District level, this <U>bulldozer-
and top-down approach still prevails</U>. A scary example is the
1st Health Project, funded by loans from IDA/World Bank. This
was presented verbally by the District Medical Officer (no copies
of documents were given) to the Health Committee in Rakai District
in August 1994 on the basis of completed plans from the Ministry
of Health. At that time, the plans and drawings had been completed
by the consultant appointed by the Ministry, and the District
was only informed (at their specific request) while international
tendering for construction was on-going. Four health centres,
one administration building plus one larger health unit were to
be constructed. The Rakai Health Committee tried to influence
the location, contents and the planning process itself, as the
project was not in accordance with the District's five-year Development
Plan (neither as a strategy or physically), but it was in vain.
It had already been agreed at the centre, and the contract was
subsequently given to an international company, which started
construction with imported Filipino labour and very heavily mechanised
equipment in May 1995.
<P>
The <U>planning and implementation of this health project has
been packed with problems</U> for the District: the newly rehabilitated
main road to the District headquarters was severely damaged by
the heavy trucks used by the contractor; a road had to be rehabilitated
and reinforced to one site (thereby diverting scarce maintenance
resources of the District from its agreed plan); the administration
building was sited on the existing stadium in the centre of the
headquarters (requiring that a new one be built); an existing
clinic constructed by local resources and supported by the District
Development Fund was destroyed in the process; etc.
<P>
The most detrimental and absurd part, however, is, that the <U>future
operational costs of the completed structures</U> - staffing,
supply of electricity, water, drugs, etc. - <U>will be the responsibility
of the District</U>, because primary health care is a decentralised
function according to the Statute. While originally, the District
in the National five-year Plan was to have a District Hospital
like other districts, which is a central government task to run
and fund, the project was changed (without ever consulting Rakai
District) into the health centres, which is now a district task.
While the Ugandan Government has borrowed USD 2.8 million ( more
than one year of DANIDA support to Rakai District) to construct
these health centres, the District now has to bail out the World
Bank and avoid the health centres turning into another 'white
elephant'. Wisely enough, the Finance Committee and the District
Council in the budget process for 1995/96 realised that no additional
recurrent funding was available for the increased staffing or
other costs, and many of the new buildings will therefore be put
straight into mothballs for a long time to come.
<P>
In another field, An African Development Bank project on road
maintenance seemed, at the outset, to promise support for capacity-building
of the District Works Department in an instructive, low-profile
way. An amount of USH. 100-150 million could be expected for 1995/96,
and the District would be involved in the planning, priority-setting,
etc. Although with some difficulty, it was agreed that the political
Works Committee would decide on the selection of the roads involved,
and further information on the budgetary implications would be
forthcoming. However, in August 1995, when the contribution from
the AfDB was to be included in the budget process, it became clear,
that <U>no funds from this project would be channelled into the
ordinary District budget</U> as a block grant or even as an ear-marked
contribution. First, because the loan had not been secured from
the AfDB, and second, as a separate Project Implementation Unit
and other ad-hoc funding procedures had already been approved
by the Ministry of Local Government (sic!). Accordingly, the Rakai
District had to suspend this donor project from its present budget
and planning agenda.
<P>
Further mixed experiences of donor interventions include the many
activities in the health and water supply sector, where a number
of sub-programmes of  UNICEF, the EC, the German Leprosy Agency
and the World Health Organisation have been implemented. Many
of these are by tradition <U>delivered directly to the District
Departments</U> leaving little accountability, information or
scope for guidance and control to the politicians. As the budgetary
contributions are not communicated to the Finance Office, accountability
problems arise. Options for misuse are wide, as most support is
given as additional transport costs, allowances and other invisible
support, which may easily be claimed for several times.
<P>
<U>International non-governmental organisations</U> like WorldVision,
InterAid, and CARE are also very active in the District. So far,
only Save the Children (UK), has been willing to inform and support
the District in a capacity-building fashion, partly through disbursement
as a block grant, partly by ear-marking support in accordance
with the planning and budgeting process. Many other NGOs actually
working on District facilities, like Med&eacute;cin du Monde,
<U>have not been able to tell the District of their plans, budget
contributions and activities</U> even within a period of 1-2 years.
This is mainly because their Headquarters maybe do not know this
themselves. But other NGOs, like the Kitovu Hospital (supported
from Ireland) <U>are simply not willing to inform the District</U>
authorities on their activities and budgets, as they feel that
this is outside the mandate with which they have been entrusted
by their respective donors. The attitude is that their constituents
are not the local government in Rakai but the foreign donors that
fund them. Co-ordination at the local level is thus extremely
difficult, and for example, simple information on how many AIDS
patients are under treatment or how many HIV tests have been performed,
where, and with what results is not provided to the District Health
Department.
<P>
The distribution of tasks and roles between the District, as the
local government agency responsible for planning and co-ordination,
and private non-governmental organisations, as entrepreneurs and
implementors, has up to now simply not been established and recognised.
Until a consensus on which bodies are playing which roles has
been acknowledged among the constituents and users in the District
as well as among the donors - and this will probably take several
years - the problems of co-ordination and tensions between the
local government and the NGOs will prevail.

<P>
In general, donor interventions in Uganda and elsewhere are sector
specific and often implemented on a wider scale than one District,
thus linking up with separate procedures for planning, implementation
and budgeting. By definition, they are most frequently seen as
capital development projects, and defined in terms of short-term
projects/programmes managed by ad-hoc PIUs at the centre. As donor-funded
and initiated programmes, it is <U>very difficult for the Ministry
of Finance and Economic Development to further decentralise the
Uganda capital development budget without the full consent of
the respective donors</U>. The standard argument for further decentralisation
to the districts was the assumed &quot;lack of planning, management
and accounting capacity&quot;. Even though Rakai District (and
a few other districts) had already demonstrated that they have
this capacity e.g. by making their own District Development Plans,
further trials with decentralisation have been postponed to 1996/97.
And since the NGOs also have their separate standard management
procedures, <U>it makes it very difficult for a local government
like Rakai District to perform its facilitating role and co-ordinate
the activities</U>, which, whether they are carried out as a public
or private task, all aim at developing the living standards of
the population.
<P>
<a name="rak"><h3><hr>Rakai District at a Cross-roads: Between Donor Intervention,
Central Interference and Local Institution-building</h3></a>
<P>
After the first phase of the Rakai District Development Programme,
and nearly two years after the decentralisation Statute was enacted,
the <U>impressive results in Rakai District</U> can be assessed.
Faster than envisaged, the District Administration has been re-organised
and it now functions and delivers services much more effectively.
The political structure has also been organised in accordance
with the Statute giving the political leaders the guiding influence.
The District Planning Unit, originally set-up as an ad-hoc donor
driven secretariat, is now integrated in the ordinary administration
and has been the main force behind the production of a five-year
District Development Plan. The annual budget process is clearly
identified by the political leaders and the civil servants as
the key priority process of resources, and the process itself
has been integrated in the work of the District Council and its
sectoral committees. All councillors at District-and Sub-County-level
have been trained in the decentralisation policies and institutions.
Physical results are completion of offices for all District departments
and all Sub-County local governments, residences for most staff,
rehabilitation of roads and 1/3 of all primary schools in the
District. As a tangible effect, the local resources have been
increasingly mobilised with local tax revenues growing over three
years from USH 200 million to 800 million.
<P>
Thus, it is <U>not found</U> (as argued by Olowu and Smoke, 1992)
that <U>successful local governments are mainly found in urban
local councils</U>, and in regions that are relatively well developed
economically, that the dominant revenues come from indirect sources,
that the powers and responsibilities are close to the colonial
model, or that there has been a very close supervision by the
central state. On the contrary, <U>this capacity-building project
has been successful in a rural District at the periphery</U>,
most revenues come from direct personal taxes, and the decentralisation
model is totally different from the colonial model of deconcentration,
while the supervision from the central state has been mainly informative
and instructive. The main basis has been a national policy of
devolution, which is conducive, supported by donor efforts which
have been supplementary, combined with strong local political
and administrative commitment.
<P>
Apart from the costs of the training seminars, delivered by the
Decentralisation Secretariat, the funding of the decentralisation
programme is rather a re-distribution of the existing recurrent
national budgets. Even the costs of the DANIDA-funded programme
have been relatively modest. Over 3 years, about DKK 55 million
has been provided (equivalent to about USD 9 million.), of which
45% has been spent on rehabilitation of schools, and a further
20% on other construction or development activities. While most
of the capital development budget of Rakai District has been funded
by DANIDA, only 25 % of the recurrent budget has been DANIDA-supported.
The Central Government contributes about 50%, the remaining 25%
comes from local taxes and other revenues. 
<P>
It is clear, that <U>the capacity-building efforts have been very
cost-effective. By combining the efforts of the donor with the
national policy-framework, it has been possible within surprisingly
short time to see tangible results. This, however, is also much
due to the commitment of the local political leaders and administration.
As elected leaders, the councillors are responsible towards their
constituents at village, sub-county and district-level. The regular
holding of local elections is therefore extremely important, but
as has already been noted, that individual leaders are held responsible
by the general Council. A longer-term process (depending in particular
on the attitudes and practices of the central ministries) is to
internalise the civil servants' role of being accountable to the
politicians, not as individuals, but to the District Council and
its subcommittees. However, it has already been noted, that the
politicians of Rakai are learning fast.</U>

</table></center>
<P>
Having achieved the initial 'take-off' in capacity-building,
the District, however, is now at a cross-roads, where two new
challenges will have to be addressed: On the one hand, the
sector programme management of the donors (imitated by the central
agencies of the Government), and on the other hand, the devolution
of powers and resources to the lower level governments and the
link-up with community groups, interest groups, villages, etc.
<P>
The donor driven sector programme approach basically conflicts
with priority to the local government area development planning
approach. It is a vertical, rather than a horizontal planning
and implementation strategy, and frequently also made with watertight
compartments. As it is physically unmanageable for the international
donors to directly negotiate and plan together with 39 districts
of Uganda, and furthermore, as seen from the Ugandan Government's
point of view, it may not be desirable to have too many direct
linkages between foreign donors and the individual districts,
<U>some intermediate solutions have to be created</U> to facilitate
an in-flow of international resources to the local governments.
The Decentralisation Secretariat is already designing a District
Development Revolving Fund from which individual districts may
receive grants or loans. Similarly, Rakai District together with
the other districts in the country has an interest in amalgamating
their opinions and resources through a joint spokesman or association
vis-a-vis the Central Government. A Uganda Local Authorities Association
has recently been formed, but it is still weak, and Rakai District
has as yet not been much engaged in its work. A more vigorous
support could be applied in both cases.
<P>
<U>Devolution of powers and resources to lower level governments,
and the creation of linkages to representatives of local community
groups</U>, villages, etc., is part of the agenda to support the
development of a democratic civil society, from which a system
of checks and balances on the local governments at different levels
can be exercised. As of to-day, communication channels from and
to the District are limited and impeded by the lack of transport,
of telephones, of a functioning postal system, and of well-organised
community groups or representatives of villagers. The existing
system of Resistance Council and -Committees has to a large extent
taken care of the communication, but alternative channels are
needed if a democratic process is to be maintained. Rakai District
may try more formalised systems of hearings, wide-spread information
on the budget proposals, and (as has already been endorsed, but
not implemented) public access to all local government documents,
notices for committee meetings, etc. The Council has also approved,
based on the development of a computerised District data bank,
that information on individual tax-assessment and payment be passed
on for public display to all villages to ensure proper monitoring
by the villagers themselves. But further training at the level
of sub-counties, and even further down to the parishes and villages
will have to be imparted in the years to come. The aim is that
by passing more information to as many people as possible (even
though the low level of literacy is a serious constraint), the
more stronger and sustainable will the democratic features be,
and the less risks will there be for elitist or non-democratic
development.
<P>
The <U>sustainability test of the achievements</U> so far in Rakai
District, and of the future further options for accountability
and decentralisation will be whether <U>local government elections
are held regularly with genuine results</U> reflecting the choice
of the constituents. It is not crucial for the system (but of
course important for the individual political leaders), whether
this or that councillor is re-elected, but there needs to be some
continuity. Fortunately, the scheduled elections in February 1995,
were only postponed because the Constituent Assembly was still
working on the future Uganda Constitution. So, with the new constitution
in place, hopefully, local government elections also in Rakai
District will take place soon.
<P>
<a name="rec"><h3><hr>Recommendations for Decentralised Co-operation</h3></a>
<P>
Summing-up, the recommendations, based upon the experiences from
Rakai District of five years of co-operation with DANIDA, can
be categorised into three sets of actor-related requirements:
<ul>
<li>Requirements from the <U>national environment</U>:
<UL>
<LI><U>A genuine commitment and a coherent policy</U> from the
Central Government on devolution of powers, functions and - not
least - resources to the local governments;
<LI><U>A legal framework</U> establishing the rules of the devolution
in a clear manner, and outlining the functions to be the competence
of the local governments;
<LI><U>Be willing</U> to devolve negotiations with donors directly
to the local governments, and allow them to receive direct donor
funding;
<LI><U>Train political leaders and managers</U> of the local governments
as well as of the centre and line ministries on their roles in
the new system; 
<LI><U>Transfer resources</U> for both recurrent and capital development
purposes from the centre to the local governments as unspecified
block grants in a regular, scheduled and planned manner;
<LI><U>Devolve employment</U> and personnel management of all
civil servants working at the local level from central control
to the local governments;
<LI><U>Devolve accountability</U>, financially as well as politically,
to the constituents of the local governments, leaving the role
of the centre to facilitation and guidance;
<LI><U>Devolve auditing</U> to professional companies or the Auditor-General,
as the local governments may prefer;
<LI>Create clear <U>guidance for the central government supervision</U>
of the local governments in terms of competence and procedures;
<LI>Sustain the local government system by <U>constitutionalising
and implementing frequent, regular holding of local government
elections</U>;
</UL>
<P>
<li>Requirements from the <U>local government</U>:
<UL>
<LI><U>A genuine commitment to local development</U> and strict
adherence to the policy of decentralisation;
<LI>An awareness and readiness to <U>act on issues of national
or local importance</U>, and to maintain own positions and view-points;
<LI><U>Political ability and flexibility to compromise</U> and
make choices within limited resources;
<LI><U>Accept</U> negotiated <U>donor requirements</U> with respects
to accounting, auditing, transparency, and the <U>learning-process
of utilising advice</U>;
<LI><U>Accept the roles</U> of political leaders to guide and
decide, and of civil servants as technical advisers and implementors
of the decisions, implying, that all <U>departments are subordinate</U>
to a specific political committee and to the Council in general;
<LI><U>Structure political committee work</U> with fixed meeting
schedules, notices, minutes, and facilitated by civil servants;
<LI><U>Develop administrative capacity</U> to plan, implement
and monitor activities, horizontally, qualitatively, financially
and in a timely way;
<LI><U>Ability to learn, to develop training capacity</U>, and
the willingness to impart the training to lower levels of government,
even in remote and inaccessible areas;
<LI><U>Be open towards the development of a democratic, civil
society</U> with public access to information, acceptance of orderly
lobbying from civil groups, and the results of local government
elections;
</UL>
<P>
<li>And the requirements from the <U>donors</U> are:
<UL>
<LI><U>A genuine commitment and a policy towards decentralised,
devolved co-operation</U> between the donor, the recipient central
government and in particular, the local government;
<LI><U>Develop guidelines on devolved implementation of development
support</U>, either directly to local governments, or indirectly,
through intermediate institutions like District Development Funds,
Local Government Associations, Decentralisation Secretariats,
etc.;
<LI><U>Accept the priorities of local governments</U> as a principle,
and be willing to negotiate view-points and positions;
<LI><U>Accept flexibility in project design</U> and on-going adjustment
of programmes according to the development of local capacities;
<LI>Be aware of the risks and distortive <U>implications of continued
sector programme</U> strategies; if unavoidable, support devolutionary
management and guidance by the sector concerned;
<LI><U>Adjust strategies</U> from overall sector programmes <U>towards
combined sectoral support and local government support</U>, encouraging
the mobilisation and utilisation of local resources and local
level planning and decision-making;
<LI><U>Support the training</U> in decentralisation at all levels;
<LI>Initiate processes to <U>transfer resources</U> to local governments
<U>as unspecified block grants</U> as far as possible;
<LI><U>Use advisers as a combination of resident, long-term advisers
and short-term consultants</U> with emphasis on national candidates,
as far as possible;
<LI><U>Devolve the accountability</U>, relying on local government
accounting;
<LI><U>Devolve audits</U> to local, professional companies or
the Auditor-General, keeping the option for supplementary audits
by the donor's Auditor-General open, if required;
<LI>Institutionalise donor support as a <U>long-term, framed,
but flexible commitment</U>, with annual negotiations to specify
short-term activities;
</UL>
</ul>
<P>
These recommendations are not given in the naive belief, that
for all countries and all local governments, they will work successfully.
Rather, that seen in combination, and seen as a long-time, learning
process, the experiences from Rakai District have shown that this
is the direction in which devolution to local governments can
be supported, and thereby, to the development of a democratic,
participatory civil society. Through the establishment of systems
of checks and balances, which will always be indispensable in
human societies, and by gradual, experiments of institutional
developments adapted to the respective national environment and
local government, progressive steps can be achieved. Whether these
in the longer term will contribute to the achievement of more
general development objectives like the alleviation of poverty
or a sustainable environment, is not possible to predict now,
as it depends on the choices of the local community and its citizens.
However, this is exactly the essence of a decentralised co-operation:
they are not only partners in this process, but they should be
the main decision-makers. From Rakai, at least, the strategic
and operational lessons from the beginning of this process  are
not copy-righted and may be freely copied or borrowed.

DANIDA Evaluation Unit
<p>
</h3>
</center><p>
<hr>
<p>
The responsibility of Danida's Evaluation Unit is to assist in maintaining and improving the quality of Danish aid.
 

<P>An evaluation is an examination, as systematic and objective as possible, of the design,
implementation and results of an ongoing or completed project or programme, with the
aim of determining its efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability and the relevance of
its objectives.


<P>Danida evaluations primarily serve as management tools with a view to improve the
projects evaluated and, being a systematic way of learning from experience, to provide
lessons which can guide future decisions and thus improve Danish development assistance.
Furthermore, evaluation together with monitoring activities provide information to Danida
and host country managers about the performance of projects and programmes.


<P>Another important purpose of evaluation is to provide accountability about the aid process
to the political community and to serve as a basis for informing the public about the
results of Danish development assistance.


<P>Evaluations are carried out by interdisciplinary teams, mostly composed of external
consultants. This is primarily due to the desirability of a high degree of independence in
the evaluation work. Furthermore Danida aims at establishing cooperation  between the
authorities and local consultants of the recipient country and the evaluation teams. This is
done partly in order to strengthen the capacity of the recipient country, partly in order to
get the benefit of these consultants' knowledge of the local conditions.


<P>A list of reports issued since late 1991 and a 4 page summary of each are available on the <A HREF="http://www.ingenioeren.dk/danaida/danida.html"  target="_top"> Internet</a> (http://www.ingenioeren.dk/danida/danida.html). A few

<html><head><title>NI Keynote Editorial 262 - Dec 94</title><!!keys: New Internationalist+UN+Cold War+arms ></head><body><h2>New Internationalist Keynote Editorial</h2><i>The material that follows has been provided by </i><a href="NIinfo.html">New Internationalist</a><hr><h3><img src="ni_pix/niunsymbol.gif">WINDS OF CHANGE</h3><p><i>Can the United Nations change enough to win renewed credibilityand respect? Or will it be blown away? <b>Chris Brazier</b>investigates.</i><hr><p>High up in the UN building in New York you get a fine view ofManhattan's skyscrapers one way and a rather less spectacularoutlook over the East River into Brooklyn the other. But theoffices themselves are really rather ordinary - bland decor,standardized office equipment, ubiquitous computers - not muchsign of the lavish bureaucratic excess attacked by conservativecritics. The sense of being in a special place does not comehere on the upper floors or even in the General Assembly hallwhich sits idle for eight months of the year. It is in the staffcanteen at lunchtime. Here you see at every table a convincingcross-section of the world's people, endlessly diverse in colourand language - a downhome testament to the working reality ofthe United Nations.<p>As I sat there listening to the panoply of different accents itthrew me back to my teens. While I was still at school and idlyconsidering what my glorious future career might be, thepinnacle of my aspirations was a job with the UN. I suspect Iwas not alone in those ambitions. Back in the 1960s and 1970sthe UN commanded respect and faith as an embodiment ofinternational concern. Whatever its problems during the ColdWar, there was always the idea that the world's well-being wasbeing looked after by an institution that would one day, when wewere all adult enough to accept that nationalism was a thing ofthe past, become a world government.<p><img src="ni_pix/niungrowth.gif"><p>I doubt that many teenagers would share these aspirations now.Public disillusion with the UN is growing as fast as cynicismabout Western politicians. Why? After all, we're now five yearsinto the post-Cold War period when the UN gained a new freedomof action, liberated from the tiresome game of superpower vetopingpong. <p>In a way what went wrong was that the Cold War ended at all. Aslong as that continued, its ice covered the cracks in theinstitution erected by a war-weary world on 26 June 1945.<b>(1)</b> Aslong as Washington and Moscow eyeballed it out over the SecurityCouncil table we could dream - if only the UN was liberated fromthis straitjacket! And we could concentrate on the positiveachievements - the eradication of smallpox by the World HealthOrganization or the immunization of children worldwide byUNICEF. <p>But then the Soviet bloc imploded. Our hopes soared for both apeace dividend and a UN with a new lease of life. The <b>NI</b>'s lastissue on <i>The Arms Trade</i> detailed how the peace dividend has beenwasted. And much of this issue shows how inadequately the UN hasused its new freedom of manoeuvre over the last five years.<p>The Gulf War was the start. This was represented as a greattriumph - a despot's invasion of a defenceless little countrywas rolled back by the sheer collective will of theinternational community. But the military campaign was sotransparently a US action -  mainly US soldiers, commanded by USgenerals, using state-of-the-art US hardware - that it severelydamaged the credibility of the United Nations as an independentforce. Smaller states were whipped into line. Egypt went alongmeekly and had its debts to the US cancelled; Yemen stood outagainst and lost its US aid.<p>But at least the UN operation in the Gulf was successful in itsown terms - it evacuated the invading forces from Kuwait andblitzed Iraq back into 'a pre-industrial age'.<b>(2)</b> The UN'sperformance as an international peacekeeper since then has beenshockingly inept, as this issue's articles on Somalia and Rwandamake clear. <p>Are we expecting too much? Whenever a crisis crops up now in theworld our first instinct is to call for the UN. Yet we findfault with whatever action they take. The same people whoadvocated armed intervention to defend the Bosnian Muslims willdeplore the intervention in Somalia. The same people who opposedall-out war on Saddam Hussein will call for all-out war on theKhmer Rouge in Cambodia.<p><b>Blaming the parent</b><br>In a way we want to blame the parent. Parents are routinelyblamed for all the problems of their children - 'They fuck youup, your Mum and Dad' is probably the poet Philip Larkin's mostquoted line. Doubtless because I am a parent it seems rather tooeasy a let-out. The UN may suffer from the same syndrome. Whentrouble flares up we can satisfy our desperation that somethingshould be done by calling for the UN to deal with it. And whenthings inevitably go wrong we can pour scorn on it - for notintervening quickly or early enough, or for riding roughshodover local political and cultural conditions. <p>Even so, the UN's independence is severely compromised by itssubservience to Washington DC. What is the major factor whichdetermines whether or with what vigour the UN launches apeacekeeping operation? The principle? The appalling nature ofthe problem? Neither. It is the mood of the US. If the WhiteHouse decides for its own reasons  to wade into Somalia -because President Bush wants to give a humanitarian gloss termof office - then that is what the UN will do. If the US decidesit doesn't want to get involved in Bosnia - 'we have nostrategic interest in the Balkans', said the State Department'sLawrence Eagleburger - then the UN ends up wringing its handsover 'ethnic cleansing'. If Washington is in isolationist moodlicking its wounds after the fiasco in Somalia then some of theworst massacres in recent history can be more or less ignored inRwanda. <p>Unfortunately US influence over the world body is harder andharder for the South to challenge. <p><img src="ni_pix/niunrhetoric.gif"><img src="ni_pix/nireality.gif"><p><i>"The decisions of the Security Council are binding on member states; those of the General Assembly are not. The five main victors in World War Two have permanent membership of the Security Council and an individual veto over its decisions."</i><p>Back in the late 1960s and 1970s the UN was seen as a forum inwhich the newly independent developing nations might winmeaningful changes in the world order. They could not compete inglobal trade, in wealth or in military firepower. Yet here atleast they could be heard. There was genuine hope that throughthe UN the South could successfully challenge the existing worldorder. <p>Those days are long gone. It is shocking to realize now how muchthose hopes depended on the support of the Soviet Union. For allits faults, Moscow was prepared to champion the cause of theThird World - not least because it was scoring points offWashington and Western capitalism. The Soviet bloc's collapseleft developing countries bereft. The non-aligned movement, oncea focus for creative ideas if not for global muscle, is now moreor less non-existent. In a bipolar world there was the spacebetween to be non-aligned; in today's unipolar world everyone issucked towards the magnetic centre of power. Countries that oncedemanded things as their moral right now go cap in hand to theglobal financiers.<p><b>Everyone is cutting a deal</b><br>One insightful UN employee from the South lamented this trend.It was a sad picture he painted for me, in which China's defenceof its own independent view of human rights (send in the tanksand lock up the students) was welcomed by Southern governmentsof all political colours simply because it showed a developingcountry standing up to the West for a change. <p>'For the most part,' he said, 'there is no real notion of aThird World with a collective agenda any more - everyone issimply trying to cut a deal with the US and the West... I amcommitted to the UN,' he continued, 'without it there would bechaos out there. But what I want from it is not what the majorpowers want. They don't want the UN to address social andeconomic development. All they want is a UN that keeps the lidon - and they only really want that in regions where they have adirect strategic interest.' <p>This Western lack of interest in the UN's promotion ofdevelopment is increasingly evident. Michel Camdessus, who headsthe IMF, went so far as to say in 1992 that the UN was just oneof the four pillars of the world system. He relegated it tosocial affairs while the other three pillars - his ownorganization, the World Bank and the new World TradeOrganization (the successor to GATT) - handled the seriouseconomic business. The idiocy of seeing social affairs asseparable from economic forces apparently did not strike him.Neither did the arrogance of setting his own unaccountablefiefdom on a par with the United Nations.<p>Yet you can almost understand his arrogance when you see withwhat compliance the UN has tossed its responsibility foreconomic affairs into his lap. So now when the UN wants to talkabout issues like the widening gap between rich and poor in therun-up to the vital World Summit on Social Development inCopenhagen in March, the US and its key allies will say that anydebate about economic issues 'will be best handled by theappropriate institutions' - meaning the IMF and the World Bank.<p>Ah, 'the appropriate institutions' - what a weasel term. Theidea of the UN becoming a global government now seems absurd.Yet in one way it has already come about as the IMF and theWorld Bank have ranged the world cowing national governmentsinto submission. Both these institutions are part of the UNsystem, though they have become a law unto themselves - notleast in their own pay and perks, which far exceed those oftheir UN counterparts.<p>But theirs is the efficiency of the tunnel-visioned accountant,aware of the bottom line but not caring about the hardship their'adjustment' programmes cause. Still less are they capable ofstanding back far enough to see that their policies - a decadenow in the testing - have failed even on their own terms.<p>In the light of all this should we tear down the UN? Thetraditional defence against this has been the worthwhile workdone by the diverse <a href="NIUNagencies.html">UN agencies. </a>Some of their achievements,notably in health, have been spectacular. But the developmentwork is no longer sufficient defence since as many agencies areperforming badly as are doing well. And three decades of'development' have done nothing to combat the core problem ofglobal inequality. In 1960 the richest fifth of the world'spopulation earned 30 times the income of the poorest fifth;today it earns 60 times more.<b>(3)</b><p>Yet ironically the worst aspect of the UN's record provides themain reason for trying to retain and reform it. If it wereabolished tomorrow it is probable that the best agencies, likeUNICEF, could retain an independent existence. But it isabsolutely certain that the World Bank and the IMF would gaineven more unchallenged sway. And if the UN were to be demolishedthere would be not a hope in hell of a new organization risingphoenix-like from the ashes to challenge them. The will andidealism to create a new institution has only ever existed aftera major cataclysm - as the First World War spawned the League ofNations and the Second World War the UN. And while we may lamentthe fact that the UN's rhetoric too seldom translates intoaction, even the limited prick to conscience that rhetoric andpeer-group pressure provide may be preferable to noacknowledgement of responsibility for the poor at all.<p><b>Crying out for reform</b><br>It is, then, worth at least trying to reform the UN. The naturalfirst impulse is to make it more democratically accountable.Despite the opening to the Charter which reads 'We the peoplesof the United Nations...' (significantly echoing theconstitution of the United States), the peoples are notable bytheir absence. Yet this would not be easy to correct. <p>We could demand that delegates to the General Assembly wereelected. But the whole point of the UN is that governmentsshould implement the policies collectively arrived at there -and taking the General Assembly out of their hands would makethis much less likely. The more urgent need is to reform theexisting institution so that it functions with more efficiencyand independence. Since the US is forever screaming about howmuch money it has to pay into the UN system (even though it hasto be cajoled and crawled to for the dues to be paid, usually ayear or 18 months in arrears), its contribution should bereduced from 25 per cent of the regular budget to nearer 10 percent. Other wealthy countries should share the burden moreevenly. This would automatically slacken the Americanstranglehold somewhat.<p><b><i>WHO SHOULD PAY THE BILLS...</i></b><br><img src="ni_pix/niunbudget.gif"><p><b><i>...AND WHO FAILS TO PAY</i></b><br><img src="ni_pix/niunred.gif"><p>The <b>NI</b>'s game <a href="NIreform.html">'Navigating UN Reform'</a> suggests how difficult itwill be to reform the archaic power structure of the SecurityCouncil. <link to "New Internationalist UN Reform Game">  Thepre-eminence there of the post-war victors - the US, Britain,France, Russia and China - with their veto over changes in theUN Charter as well as everyday policies, is an absurdity. Theyare unlikely to give up their privileged position - particularlythe ex-colonial powers of Britain and France who cling on totheir places at the top table like children desperate to stay uplate with the grown-ups. But by clinging on by their fingertipsthey are putting the whole existence of the UN in danger. A newSecurity Council which had as many permanent members from theSouth as from the North - and ideally with no-one holding a veto- would do much to transform the world's sense of the UN.<p><b>Choosing a leader</b><br>At the very least the UN must be transparently accountable. Thepermanent members also control the appointment of theSecretary-General and their method of selection is about as openand systematic as King Henry VIII's appointment of advisers. Didthe current incumbent, Boutros Boutros-Ghali, formally apply forthe job? Was he interviewed? Was an exhaustive trawl done of the most able candidates? No. Boutros-Ghali was appointed thesame way all his predecessors were, after a secret process ofhorse-trading between the veto-holding powers to find the leastoffensive candidate. It is hardly a system designed to providethe world with an energetic, visionary leader. That is nocoincidence since the major powers decided nearly 25 years agothat they much preferred someone who would not rock the boat.<p>The appointment of the Secretary-General - and of all thedirectors of UN agencies, whose recruitment is just as much of alottery - must be taken out of the hands of the major powers.The General Assembly should instead launch an accountablerecruitment process. Perhaps if this were so the Assembly wouldbe sensible enough to choose a first female Secretary-General. <p>Sadako Ogata, the current High Commissioner for Refugees, hasbeen tipped as a possibility - she has already regenerated onemoribund agency, after all. What is more she is prepared totread on toes to support what is right. She is makingBoutros-Ghali squeal at the moment, publicizing a report fromRwanda which claims there are organized killings of Hutus by thenew government's army; he wants the report suppressed because itmakes the UN's peacekeeping forces in the country look bad. <p>The first test of whether the UN can regenerate itself as aforce for global change will come soon. At the vital SocialSummit in March the UN must recognize that its vision of humandevelopment is being fatally undermined by the policies of itsown institutions. The fiftieth anniversary year would be asuitable moment to create an Economic Security Council - and tobegin the process of bringing the IMF and the World Bank to heel.<p>The UN edifice cannot be insulated from the winds of change formuch longer. If it is not prepared to take on a new role, morerepresentative of the needs of that vast majority of the world'spopulation which lives in the South, then it must prepare to beblown away in a cloud of dust and dreams.<p><b>Chris Brazier is a co-editor of the New Internationalist.</b><p><b>1</b> The 50 representatives at the founding Conference signed theUN Charter on 26 June.

<html><head><title>NI on UN agencies - Dec 94</title><!!keys: New Internationalist+UN+Food and Agriculture Organization></head><body><h2>New Internationalist On UN Agencies</h2><i>The material that follows has been provided by </i><a href="NIinfo.html">New Internationalist</a><hr><p><h2> School's Out<img ALIGN=top src="ni_pix/nischool.gif"></h2><p><i>Few people know just how many UN agencies there are - still lesswhether their work is effective. Here the NI marks the reportcards of the most prominent members of the UN class.</i><p><h2>FAO</h2><br><ul><li>REPORT 1945-1994<p> Full name: UN Food and Agriculture Organization<br> Home Address: Rome<br> Principal: Jacques Diouf (Senegal), Director since 1994<br>  Class Size: 6,000 employees<br>Allowance: $673 million (1994/5) <p>Record: FAO's 50th birthday falls a few days before that of theUN as a whole, next October. The shadow of one man will loomlarge over the celebrations - Edouard Saouma, whose 18 years asDirector recently came to an end. Saouma ruled with the ironfist of a medieval emperor - staff were required to call him'Your Excellency'. FAO has a worse record than any other agency.It has actually done more harm than good to people and theenvironment through its uncritical promotion of the GreenRevolution, dangerous pesticides and its insistence that smallfarmers switch to cash crops instead of growing their own food.Saouma's departure must help but FAO seems almost beyond reform. <p>Mark: 0/10</ul><hr><p><h2>UNICEF</h2><br><ul><li>REPORT 1946-1994<p>Full name: UN Children's Fund<br> Home Address: New York<br> Principal: James Grant (US), Director since 1980 <br> Class Size: 7,000 employees <p>Allowance: Income $888 million, Expenditure $972 million (1994).UNICEF is the only UN agency which receives funds direct fromthe general public. <p>Record: UNICEF has been the driving force behind the universalchild immunization programme, which it claims is now saving thelives of 10,000 children a day. Its World Summit for Children in1990 produced a treaty which should soon become the firstuniversally ratified human-rights convention in history - andits country offices are energetically monitoring governments'progress in meeting the goals they've signed up for. UNICEF isthe most focussed of all the UN agencies - and the mosteffective. But even its strength as an institution could beendangered by the wrong choice as Director following Jim Grant'simminent retirement (he is now 72). <p>Mark: 9/10</ul><hr><p><h2>UNFPA</h2><br>  <ul><li>REPORT 1969-1994<p> Full name: UN Fund for Population Activities<br>  Home Address: New York<br>  Principal: Nafis Sadik (Pakistan), Director since 1987<br>   Class Size: 837 employees<br>  Allowance: Income $219.6 million Expenditure $215.4 million(1993) <p>Record: More and more women are gaining control of theirfertility. While less than 10 per cent of couples in developingcountries used contraception in the 1960s, 55 per cent did in1993. But UNFPA is funded and driven by rich countries' paranoiaabout population growth in the South - it has looked too kindlyover the years on repressive regimes like China (with itsone-child policy) and Indonesia. It has also had (on its ownadmission) 'an overwhelming concern for quantitativeachievements and... demographic targets' - in other wordskeeping Third World numbers down. In recent years, though,partly because of its female Director, UNFPA has placed muchmore emphasis on women's rights, seeing them as people needingeducation, equality and comprehensive health care rather thanjust as mothers. The recent Cairo Conference may have had tosteer a course between the Vatican and Western feminism but itsemphasis on women's choice and reproductive health and choice isa big improvement on simplistic Malthusian number-crunching. <p>Mark: 5/10</ul><hr><p><h2>UNDP</h2><br>  <ul><li>REPORT 1965-1994<p> Full name: UN Development Programme<br>  Home Address: New York<br>  Principal: James Gustave Speth  (US), Administrator since 1993<br> Class Size: 6,631 employees Allowance: $1,426 million (1993)  <p>Record: Even people in the development field tend to be hazy asto what UNDP actually does - and some say you could abolish ittomorrow and barely notice the difference. This is because it isa funding and co-ordinating agency with no projects of its own.Its image has been transformed by the success of the HumanDevelopment Report. Outspoken for a UN document about the needto change development policies so they meet the needs of thepoor, the Report is the more remarkable for having emergedduring the term of Bill Draper, a Reaganite whose main passionwas for privatization. UNDP's funding policies have barelychanged, however - and its criticism of structural adjustmentseems hypocritical given its close co-operation with the WorldBank. New Administrator Gus Speth claims to be bringing UNDP'sfunding criteria into line with the human-development principlesof the Report - but then he would, wouldn't he? UNDP needs toput its money where its mouth is. <p>Mark: 3/10</ul><hr><p><h2>UNHCR</h2><br>  <ul><li>REPORT 1951-1994<p>Full name: UN High Commissioner for Refugees <br> Home Address: Geneva<br>  Principal: Sadako Ogata (Japan), High Commissioner since 1991.<br>Class Size: 3,444 employees <br>Allowance: Hoped-for expenditure in 1994 $1,308 million. Raisedby 31 August $889.6 million. UNHCR depends on voluntarycontributions from governments, which vary each year.<p>Record: In contrast to WHO, UNHCR has been revitalized by achange at the top. The previous High Commissioners, Messrs Hockeand Stoltenberg, had respectively been ousted due to a financialscandal and resigned after a few months. UNHCR itself wasineffectual and unfocussed. The new chief, Ms Ogata, hastransformed the organization. It now responds more quickly andefficiently to refugee crises - which are now coming thicker andfaster than ever - and responds to the needs of internallydisplaced people as well as those who have left their country.She has also raised the agency's profile substantially - notjust through public relations but also through taking up vitalrefugee-related issues.<p>  Mark: 7/10</ul><hr><p><h2>WHO</h2><br> <ul><li>REPORT 1948-1994<p>Full name: World Health Organization<br>  Home Address: Geneva<br>  Principal: Hiroshi Nakajima (Japan), Director since 1988<br>  Class Size: 5,200 employees<br>   Allowance: $1,800 million (1994/5)  <p>Record: WHO can take credit for one of the UN's greatestachievements - the eradication of smallpox. But it is a classiccase of a UN agency which has gone off the rails because of achange of regime. Under its previous Director, Halfdan Mahler,WHO was an effective advocate of primary health care (investingin low-tech care at local level instead of hi-tech hospitals andmedicine for an elite). It also campaigned for countries to usea few essential drugs rather than a plethora of expensive brandnames - and the agency still contains able people doing goodwork to fight disease. But Mahler's successor, Nakajima, hasmore or less ditched the essential drugs policy, influenced bythe lobbying of the pharmaceutical industry. He is generallyconsidered to be a disaster and even the major powers were notprepared to support his re-election in 1993. But in a dismaldisplay of vote-buying by Nakajima and his Japanese Governmentbackers that brought the whole UN system into disrepute, heeventually gained re-election.  	               <p>Mark: 4/10</ul><hr><p><h2>UNEP</h2><br>  <ul><li>REPORT 1972-1994<br>  Full name: UN Environment Programme<br>  Home Address: Nairobi<br>  Principal: Elizabeth Dowdeswell (Canada), Director since 1992. <br>  Class Size: 913 employees Allowance: $112.1 million (1993)<br>  <p>Record: UNEP has been one of the weakest agencies in the UNsystem - the surge in environmental concern worldwide cannot beattributed to its work. Previous Director Mostafa Tolba wasnotorious for his autocratic, almost monarchical behaviour andit is significant that the two major recent internationalinitiatives on the environment - the Brundtland Commission andthe Rio Earth Summit - were organized outside UNEP. Its mostconcrete achievement has been to secure an agreement that hasreduced the pollution of the Mediterranean. New DirectorElizabeth Dowdeswell is a technocrat who has failed as yet toraise morale or effectiveness. <p>Mark: 2/10</ul><hr><p><h2>ILO</h2><br>     <ul><li>REPORT 1919-1994<br> Full name: International Labour Organization<br>  Home Address: Geneva<br>  Principal: Michel Hansenne (Belgium), Director-General since1989.<br>  Class Size: 1,254 employees <br> Allowance: $447 million (1994/5) <p>Record:  75 years old this year, ILO is often seen as the agencypromoting the interests of workers worldwide. But given that itis responsible to a tripartite board comprising governments,employers' organizations and trade unions, it is never likely todo that.

</center></h5>
<hr>

Information and its management are moving towards the centre of development thinking and
development action. Nowhere is this more true than in the environmental sector. Here, policy-makers,
planners, managers, and activists are calling for greater investment in the generation of data and
information, and in its subsequent use. Information is being used to report on the state of the
environment, to monitor threats to natural and human environments, to set conservation priorities, to
select among competing uses of natural resources, in the development of reliable þindicatorsþ, and
to determine levels of "sustainable" natural resource use. Information and data are also needed to
support effective policy-making and policy management.
<p>
The needs for data and information are especially pressing in small states where human and natural
resources are very limited. By focusing on ways to promote the use of information resources, as a
"niche" so to speak, small states can broaden the scope of their actions and address issues previously
beyond their capacity.
<p>
Yet, despite a multitude of reports and meetings on the need for more and better information, and long
experience in its generation and management, little is known about the contribution of information to
the policy process and how it can be strengthened. Nor is it clear how information resources and
capacities are best organised to ensure that information is used effectively in policy decisions.
<p>
In early 1995, ECDPM consulted its partners and other organisations on ways to deal with these
questions. As a first step, ECDPM organised a meeting in which environmental managers and
information specialists considered first, the use of information in environmental policy-making, and
second, approaches to information capacity-building, with special reference to the environment and
the Caribbean. A third aim, to agree on the aims and activities of a future programme of work was
also discussed.
<p>
Drawing heavily on discussions during the meeting, as well as some other sources, the report opens
by illustrating the growing concern of international and national agencies that information and data
should be used more effectively in decision-making on environmental issues. Then, based on
discussions at the meeting, the two main issues are each reviewed.
<p>
On the use of information in policy-making, participants concluded that policy-making is not a single
process, but several processes involving a wide range of actors; that the various participants in these
processes require some "knowledge capacity" to take effective decisions; that this capacity is still quite
limited and that information providers should concentrate on issues of information quality, content,
and presentation. A "distillation" function closely linked to the policy-makers was suggested as a way
to bring knowledge into policy-making processes.
<p>
On the kinds of information capacities needed in policy-making, three main clusters are identified.
First, organisations need capacities to manage the "capacity" agenda itself. Second, they need
capacities to define a vision and purpose for information activities. Third, they need capacities to
manage information flows between information providers and policy-makers. Clear þvisionsþ on the
information function are particularly crucial in empowering organisations and countries to say þnoþ
to inappropriate assistance and equipment.
<p>
Finally, five main follow-up activities are suggested: To carry out case studies of specific policy
processes; to look at the role of information in policy management situations; to þmapþ environmental
information systems and capacities; to assess the impact of specific information initiatives on policy-
making; and to raise awareness of the role of information in policy-making.

Allegedly, the event was brutally repressed and ended in violent struggles with police.<p><li>8th March was commemorated in 1907, again in New York by women textile workers demanding a 10 hour day.  As in 1857, many of the women were arrested. <p><li>1908:	US socialist party appointed the Women's National Committee to campaign for the suffrage. On March 8, women workers in the needle trades demonstrated on the Lower East Side of New York for the right to vote and an end to child labour.<p><li>1909: Following the previous year's event, 1909 marked the First National Women's Day in US.  The day was celebrated by the American Socialist Party annually on the last Sunday of every February so as not to miss a working day.<p><li>1910: At the International Socialist Congress in Copenhagen, Clara Zetkin, a German Socialist leader and editor of Gleichheit (German Social Democratic Party newspaper) proposed that March 8th be observed annually as International Women's Day.  The idea of the day was to highlight the plight of working class women in a unified, international demonstration and to promote universal suffrage for women.<p><li>1911: 	After Zetkin's establishment of IWD, more than 1 million women in Austria, Denmark, Germany and Switzerland used the day to rally for the right to vote and hold public office, the right to work and to vocational training. Celebrations also took place in Russia and China.   Less than one week later, more than 149 working girls, mainly Italians and Jews, lost their lives in the Triangle Fire in New York City.The appalling working conditions which led to the disaster were denounced in subsequent celebrations of the IWD.<p><li>1913/1914:	A demonstration against the outbreak of the First World War was held in St Petersburg on the last Sunday of February in 1913.  Elsewhere in Europe, women used the day to protest against war and violence and to express solidarity with other women internationally.<p><li>1917:	Following series of strikes by Russian workers against high prices and factory layoffs, on March the 8th (February the 23rd of Russian calendar) women took the streets of St Petersburg.  The protest turned to riots and contributed to the February Revolution which forced the abdication of Tsar Nicholas II.  <p><li>1922: With Clara Zetkin's help, Lenin established International Women's Day as a Communist holiday. Chinese communists began to celebrate it, too.<p><li>After 2nd World War: Until the late 1960's the IWD did not receive such a high profile. The reason for this was the Cold War.  With the growth of the Women's Movement, the day came once more into prominence.   <p><li>1975:	UN International Women's Year.<p><li>1977: UNESCO proclaimed March the 8th International Women's Day.  <p><li>The UN Decade for Women (1975-85) encouraged women and women's groups in many countries, including developing ones, to celebrate the Day.Celebration of IWD became more focused on women's achievements and aspirations.</ul><br><br><hr>©Copyright: 1996 Womankind Worldwide<hr><TABLE BORDER=6><TR><TD><a href="index.html"><img src="wk_pix/wk_logo2.jpg" alt="Womankind Worldwide Home Page"></a></TD></TR></TABLE></body></html>

<h3>Le contexte des d&#233;bats</h3>
<P>
<i>Il semble que l'avenir des relations que l'Union europ&#233;enne (UE) entretient avec 70 pays d'Afrique, des Cara&#239;bes et du Pacifique (ACP) n'est pas tr&#232;s certain. Ceci est d&#251; au fait que l'Europe n'a pas encore pris de d&#233;cision concernant la nature et la forme de ses politiques &#233;trang&#232;re et de coop&#233;ration. La position des pays ACP d'ici l'an 2000 n'est pas claire. De plus, certains Etats membres de l'UE doutent de la valeur de la coop&#233;ration et des relations priviligi&#233;es entre les pays ACP et l'Union europ&#233;enne. 
<p>
La Commission europ&#233;enne, les Etats membres de l'UE, et les pays ACP pr&#233;parent leurs positions dans les n&#233;gotiations qui commenceront fin 1997.<b> Actuellement, une ample consultation s'impose pour assurer qu'un &#233;ventail d'opinions soient entendues et prises en compte.</b></i>
<p>
<h3>Questions actuelles</h3>
A l'issue des d&#233;bats dans lesquels l'ECDPM &#233;tait engag&#233, les th&#232;mes suivants, consid&#233;r&#233;s essentiels, ont &#233;t&#233; identifi&#233;s:

<p>
<li><a href="../ecdpm/lome/top2_fr.htm">Th&#232;me 2 -- D&#233;veloppement et coop&#233;ration: vers une participation accrue du secteur priv&#233;</a>

 <h1> UNITED NATIONS: U.N. Watchdog Body Blasts Rwanda Tribunal </h1>

<ADDRESS>   by Thalif Deen </ADDRESS>
<strong>UNITED NATIONS, Feb 12 (IPS) - A U.N. investigative body is  
blasting the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda for  
mismanagement, overpayments, waste, malpractice in procurement,  
and violations of U.N. rules and regulations. </strong><P>
   In a 49-page report, leaked to IPS, the U.N. Office of Internal  
Oversight Services (OIOS) says that ''not a single administrative  
area functioned effectively'' in the Tribunal's  Registry. <P>
   The reported clumsiness and the slow pace with which the  
Tribunal is being run has raised questions about the quality of  
justice in the genocide trial taking place in Arusha, Tanzania. <P>
   The Tribunal, created in late 1994 and functional only last  
month, is expected to bring to justice those who participated in a  
campaign that year by the majority Hutu ethnic group to  
exterminate the Tutsi minority. <P>
   In a virtual indictment of the Tribunal itself, the OIOS says  
the body has no proper accounting system. And neither the Registry  
of the Tribunal nor U.N. headquarters has budget expenditure  
information. <P>
   Although the Tribunal's 1996 budgetary allocation was about 40  
million dollars, it did not have ''a reliable budget'' for more  
than a few months at a time until June last year, according to the  
report. <P>
   ''Lines of authority were not clearly defined; internal  
controls were weak in all sections; personnel in key positions did  
not have the required qualifications; there was no property  
management system; procurement actions largely deviated from U.N.  
procedures; and U.N. rules and regulations were widely  
disregarded,'' the report says. <P>
   Headed by U.N. Under-Secretary-General Karl Paschke, a team of  
auditors and investigators from the OIOS visited the Tribunal in  
Arusha from Sep. 30 through Nov. 1996 to report on the findings.  
The team also visited the Office of the Prosecutor in Kigali. <P>
   The OIOS points out that the Office of the Prosecutor had  
administrative, leadership and operational problems. <P>
   ''Functions were hampered by a lack of experienced staff as  
well as vehicles, computers and other office equipment and  
supplies,'' it adds. ''Lawyer posts were vacant and of the almost  
80 investigator posts, only 30 had been filled.'' <P>
   The report also says there were ''prosecution strategy  
deficiencies'' and that ''witness-related programmes had not been  
fully developed.'' <P>
   The relationship between the Registry and the Office of the  
Prosecutor was characterised often by ''tension rather than  
cooperation.'' <P>
   ''The effective establishment of the Tribunal was affected by  
the short-term funding arrangements, by the geographical  
separation of the Prosecutor's office from the other organs of the  
Tribunal and by lack of adequate infrastructure both at Arusha and  
Kigali,'' the report adds. <P>
   These difficulties were ''exacerbated by the recruitment of  
inexperienced or otherwise unqualified staff, decisions for which  
both the Registrar and the Secretariat bear responsibility,''  
according to the OIOS. <P>
   ''When establishing this Tribunal, the United Nations took on  
the responsibility for securing its effective operation. The  
evidence suggests that once a few key administrators were  
selected, the Secretariat failed to take responsibility to provide  
essential support for the Tribunal until could become  
functional,'' it notes. <P>
   The report says that, as a result, the Tribunal is yet to  
achieve its goals. ''And without such support, it will not  
succeed.'' <P>
   Many of the deficiencies and failures which permeate key facets  
of the administrative operation are in the process of being  
corrected, and some can be effected by personnel changes and the  
development of a functional administrative structure, says the  
OIOS. <P>
   ''For these changes to occur, however, the Secretariat must  
take greater responsibility to assist the Secretary-General'' in  
the effective functioning of the Tribunal, it notes.

<html><head><title>FWCW: Closing Statement by Pierre Sane, Secretary General</title></head><body bgcolor="#ffffff" text="#oooooo" link="#238e23" vlink="#4a766e"><img src="amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by <a href="amnesty.html">Amnesty International</a></i><hr><h2>FOURTH WORLD CONFERENCE ON WOMEN</h2><h3>CLOSING STATEMENT BY PIERRE SANE, SECRETARY GENERAL</h3> Over the past two weeks, we have heard many governments say that this conference should be about action and not words, about reality and not rhetoric.Those are their words, not ours. But I couldn't agree more. <p>The Platform for Action that will emerge from the discussions over these 10 days will set out the agenda for improving the lives -- and the human rights -- of women worldwide. <p>What governments actually do over the 1500 plus days to the end of the century will show whether they are committed to achieving Equality by the Year 2000.<p>The first step, of course, is to have a strong and clear Platform.<p>On Amnesty International's first day in Beijing, we set out our demands from the conference. Even though discussions are continuing as I speak, at this stage it looks like on paper those demands have been met.<p>Our demands to the conference were for governments to: <p><ul><li>reaffirm the commitment they made two years ago to the universality and indivisibility of the human rights of women<p><li>recognize the violence that women suffer at the hands of the state and make a commitment to ending that violence, bringing perpetrators to justice and paying compensation to victims.<p><li>state that rape in armed conflict is a human rights violation, and make a commitment to live up to international humanitarian and human rights law during armed conflict <p><li>make a commitment to work towards eradicating violence, like female genital mutilation, in family and society. <p><li>make a strong commitment that all human rights of women activists would be guaranteed<p><li>and step up their efforts to ratify and implement international treaties that have an impact on the human rights of women</ul><p>In a few words, this is a document that Amnesty International can do business with to hold governments accountable. <p>And getting down to business is exactly what governments and the United Nations now need to do.<p>Governments must now state clearly how and when they will implement the action set out in the Platform. <p>We will be watching to see if, for example, they do ratify and implement international standards, bring perpetrators of torture, "disappearances" and political killings to justice, and stop the human rights violations of women activists. <p>The United Nations must now integrate action on women into all of its activities, including by placing higher priority on human rights violations against women.<p>But as I said earlier, discussions are still underway and threats are still looming.<p>First, the threat that in the final stages of debate governments will not pull together what they have agreed so far, and will weaken the final Platform. This includes the debate over "respect for the various religious and ethical values and cultural backgrounds".<p>Second, the threat that governments will lodge reservations to the agreed Platform, effectively picking and choosing what areas of the Platform they will work on. <p>And finally, the threat that when governments leave Beijing they will not put the Platform INTO action. <p><hr width=80%><p>On our first day in Beijing, I said that we have come here to campaign on the human rights of women and the results so far show the effects of that campaigning.<p>But I also said Amnesty International would not be silent on human rights violations in China.<p>Not only because we are here in China, but also because China has over one fifth of the world's population and an emerging global economic force. This places a special responsibility on the government to make sure that human rights are not denied to one fifth of humanity.<p>Progress has been made in moving towards freedom from want, but freedom from fear is still not a right of the Chinese people. <p>Since we arrived in this country, Amnesty International members appealed directly to the Chinese authorities on human rights violations in China .<p>Thousands and thousands of urgent appeals on death sentences, imminent executions, and prisoners of conscience. <p>And appeals for Ding Zilin and her husband Jiang Peikun, who were arrested and reportedly accused of "economic irregularities" on 18 August. According to one source, however, the real reason for their arrest was to prevent Ding Zilin from making contact with people attending the World Conference on Women. She is reported to be held in Wuxi. <p>Ding Zilin is not alone. Since the start of the conference, the relatives of at least seven activists have been under virtual house arrest to prevent them from making contact with participants at the forum and conference. <p>For some of these mothers and wives of activists and prisoners of conscience this has meant 24-hour surveillance, reporting telephone conversations, and in one case being ordered to join her husband in prison.<p>One of these women, Wang Lingyun, the mother of student leader and prisoner of conscience Wang Dan, has apparently been under constant surveillance since 26 August to prevent "foreigners who are attending the women's conference from visiting the family".<p>Before we leave Beijing, we will be raising our concerns will the Chinese authorities about this harassment, by letter or in a meeting.<p>While we have been here, the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Tibet Autonomous Region was marked on 1 September. In the run up to that anniversary, dozens of people were arrested and some are reported to have been tortured. We are continuing our investigations into this crackdown.<p><hr width=80%><p>These human rights violations are not, of course, unique to China.<p>Harassment of relatives of activists, suppression of political dissent and state executions blacken the human rights records of governments around the world. And the victims as often as not are women.<p>We showed this repression earlier this year when we published this report on human rights violations against women, and during the NGO Forum here when we collected signatures on petitions for a dozen women who are victims of those violations.<p>Indeed, our involvement in this World Conference on Women has strengthened our conviction that human rights violations against women must be better identified, documented, publicized and stopped.<p>It is for those women that we are speaking. And for those women that radical action is needed to end human rights violations. <p><hr><a href="index.html"><img src="amnesty_pix/amnesty_logo2.gif">Amnesty International Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<b>
Au moment o&#249; l'on constate une certaine faillite de nombreux
Etats africains, la perspective de renforcement des ONG est
primordiale. Mais celles-ci connaissent souvent de nombreuses
difficult&#233;s: d&#233;pendance ext&#233;rieure, comp&#233;tence
limit&#233;e et difficult&#233; d'adaptation en sont les
ma&#238;tre-mots.</b>
<p>
     Parler des ONG nous ram&#232;ne &#224; parler du fait
associatif qui appara&#238;t pour beaucoup d'analystes notamment
occidentaux comme une r&#233;alit&#233; contemporaine alors que
pour qui conna&#238;t l'Afrique Noire, cette
r&#233;alit&#233;-l&#224; existe depuis toujours. En effet, le fait
associatif constituait et continue &#224; constituer dans certaines
zones rurales la base de toutes les relations sociales et
&#233;conomiques. Il serait fastidieux de d&#233;velopper ici cette
forme associative inh&#233;rente &#224; la tradition africaine et
dans laquelle "l'esprit est solidarit&#233;, entraide et respect
des hi&#233;rarchies". De nos jours, il semblerait qu'un consensus se soit
d&#233;gag&#233; pour parler de l'association, structure non &#233;tatique, telle
que l'occident l'a con&#231;ue pour faciliter les rapports Nord-Sud. Le "modelage"
des associations africaines sous la forme ONG proc&#233;derait de ce choix; cela dit,
en analysant le processus de cr&#233;ation des ONG africaines, on constate qu'elles
voient globalement le jour de deux mani&#232;res: pendant longtemps, elles ont
&#233;t&#233; suscit&#233;es par les ONG du Nord qui en faisaient des relais; par
la suite, elles se sont volontairement cr&#233;&#233;es suivant diverses motivations.

<p>
     Les ONG relais sont n&#233;es au cours des ann&#233;es 1970-1985. Suite
aux diff&#233;rentes s&#233;cheresses r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;es, les
probl&#232;mes &#233;taient devenus si aigus en Afrique que la plupart des ONG
occidentales principalement fournisseurs de nourriture ont &#233;t&#233;
oblig&#233;es de se transformer sur place en producteurs de nourriture. Le volume
de leurs interventions &#233;tait tel que bon nombre d'entre elles se sont
engag&#233;es dans un travail de structuration du milieu, soit avec les populations
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires (groupements villageois), soit en sollicitant le concours de
cadres locaux comme auxiliaires techniques. Dans ce dernier cas, la structuration
aboutissait parfois &#224; la cr&#233;ation d'une antenne africaine de l'ONG.
<p>
     Ce mouvement d'appui &#224; la cr&#233;ation de structures locales a
co&iuml;ncid&#233; par ailleurs avec l'av&#232;nement des projets dits de
participation au d&#233;veloppement, projets qui voulaient que l'initiative du
d&#233;veloppement vienne de structures locales d&#233;tenant une certaine
autonomie organisationnelle. Ainsi pour des besoins pratiques (volume du travail) et/ou
pour des besoins du concours financier des donateurs (pour qui l'origine de la demande
importait de plus en plus), des ONG du Nord ont adopt&#233; trois comportements
diff&#233;rents: certaines ont cr&#233;&#233; de toutes pi&#232;ces des ONG dans
le Sud, d'autres ont d&#233;cid&#233; leur d&#233;sengagement de l'action sur le
terrain en encourageant des locaux &#224; prendre la rel&#232;ve par la
cr&#233;ation de structures autonomes; d'autres enfin ont accompagn&#233; la
maturation d'organisations embryonnaires de b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires.
<p>
     Second type, les ONG de volontaires africaines sont g&#233;n&#233;ralement
le fait de cadres africains soit ind&#233;pendants (parce que n'appartenant pas
&#224; la classe politique), soit "de gauche" (parce que oppos&#233;s aux politiques
et pratiques conduites par les dirigeants de leurs pays), ou enfin tout simplement au
ch&#244;mage. Les motivations qui vont pousser ces personnes &#224; mettre sur
pied des ONG sont diverses. Il peut s'agir d'un devoir de solidarit&#233; &#224;
l'&#233;gard notamment d'un monde rural qui ne cesse de se paup&#233;riser suite
aux crises r&#233;p&#233;t&#233;es (s&#233;cheresse, invasion de sauterelles,
etc.). Une autre motivation r&#233;side en une r&#233;action aux limites des ONG
occidentales (surtout de volontaires) plut&#244;t consid&#233;r&#233;es comme des
"bricoleurs" ou des "touristes". Enfin, la motivation peut &#234;tre la
n&#233;cessit&#233;, le cr&#233;neau de la coop&#233;ration non gouvernementale
&#233;tant devenu un v&#233;ritable secteur cr&#233;ateur d'emploi.
<p>
     A la faveur d'un vide juridique total sur les ONG en Afrique, on constate ainsi
qu'un groupe d'amis (g&#233;n&#233;ralement des intellectuels vivant en ville) se
constitue en ONG avec comme seul moyen de volont&#233; d'&#234;tre ONG;
d'o&#249; la naissance prolifique d'ONG en Afrique depuis une dizaine
d'ann&#233;es. Parmi celles-ci, on retrouve des ONG qui se disent d'appui au
d&#233;veloppement et des ONG de services. Si les premi&#232;res sont souvent
des unions ou f&#233;d&#233;rations de groupements de base qui se confondent
donc avec leur base sociale, les secondes, par contre, sp&#233;cialis&#233;es en
formation, cr&#233;dit, alphab&#233;tisation, etc., ressemblent plus &#224; des
ONG du Nord.
<p>
<a name="pau"><h3>Pauvret&#233; des moyens</h3></a>
<p>
     Les ONG africaines p&#234;chent parfois par amateurisme. Si celles-ci font
g&#233;n&#233;ralement appel &#224; de simples volont&#233;s qui n'ont souvent
aucune qualifications professionnelles, rares sont en outres les dirigeants qui
t&#233;moignent d'une formation technique. Tant qu'il s'agissait de conduire des
actions caritatives, il n'y avait pas de probl&#232;mes notables, la bonne
volont&#233; doubl&#233;e d'un esprit d'organisation suffisait. Par contre, en
mati&#232;re d'appui dans des domaines tels que l'agriculture, le commerce ou
l'hydraulique, des probl&#232;mes d'efficacit&#233; se rencontrent; probl&#232;mes
aggrav&#233;s par une obstination &#224; travailler en vase clos, sans recours
&#224; la sous-traitance technique (qui, il est vrai, n&#233;cessite des
possibilit&#233;s financi&#232;res dont elles ne disposent pas).
<p>
     L'adage selon lequel "c'est en forgeant que l'on devient forgeron" constitue
donc la pratique courante de nombreuses ONG. Il n'est d&#232;s lors pas
&#233;tonnant que certains observateurs qualifient leurs actions de bricolages. Cette
tendance s'inverse toutefois petit &#224; petit puisque de nombreuses ONG africaines
souhaitent am&#233;liorer leurs performances soit par le recrutement de personnel
qualifi&#233;, soit par la formation technique de leurs agents. Malheureusement, il est
dit que leurs partenaires restent peu r&#233;ceptifs &#224; ces nouvelles demandes.
En effet, ceux-ci privil&#233;gient les t&#226;ches de gestion et de contr&#244;le
au d&#233;triment des efforts d'animation et de formation des ressources humaines
des ONG africaines. Aujourd'hui, s'il est partout question de renforcement
organisationnel et de d&#233;veloppement institutionnel de ces ONG, dans la
pratique, les exp&#233;riences r&#233;ussies sont peu nombreuses. Le rendement
des actions demeure l'urgence.
<p>
     Pauvret&#233; &#233;galement en terme de ressources financi&#232;res. Les
ONG africaines ne disposent en effet pas comme leurs homologues occidentaux de
membres et sympathisants participant r&#233;guli&#232;rement au financement de
leurs activit&#233;s. De plus, rares sont celles qui d&#233;veloppent une initiative
de lev&#233;e interne de fonds. De m&#234;me, les possibilit&#233;s de
b&#233;n&#233;ficier de financements de leur propre gouvernement sont maigres (les
petites facilit&#233;s octroy&#233;es auparavant, telles que les exon&#233;rations
des taxes et droits de douane sur le mat&#233;riel, sont d'ailleurs remises en
question). Les ONG sont donc totalement d&#233;pendantes du financement qu'elles
re&#231;oivent de leurs partenaires occidentaux, publics ou priv&#233;s, ce qui
comporte des cons&#233;quences limitatives tant quant &#224; leur
d&#233;veloppement qu'&#224; l'efficacit&#233; de leurs appuis:
<p>
- elles n'ont aucune marge de manoeuvre pour se lancer dans une quelconque
planification de leur d&#233;veloppement. Les financements arrivant par le biais des
projets, ces ONG vivent donc en fonction des possibilit&#233;s offertes. Hors du
projet, il n'y a pas de vie;
<ul><p>
<li>ces projets concernant g&#233;n&#233;ralement des activit&#233;s bien
pr&#233;cises, planifi&#233;es pour les populations-cibles, l'ONG ne sera
r&#233;mun&#233;r&#233;e par le bailleur que pour le travail effectu&#233; dans
le cadre de ces activit&#233;s. Pour le reste, elle est appel&#233;e &#224;
s'assumer avec des moyens propres qu'elle n'a pas. Cette situation accentue les
comportements malhonn&#234;tes (d&#233;tournement des fonds, rapports
d'activit&#233;s mensongers, etc.);
<p>
<li>enfin, ce manque de ressources propres entra&#238;ne une concurrence accrue
entre ONG, ce qui ne facilite pas les &#233;changes d'exp&#233;riences, de moyens
et d'outils pourtant n&#233;cessaires. A ce titre, les quelques rares &#233;changes
entre ONG &#233;mergent au fur et &#224; mesure des besoins et sont
g&#233;n&#233;ralement d&#233;velopp&#233;s sur la base d'une affinit&#233;
essentiellement psychologique.
</ul><p>
     Cette double pauvret&#233; accentue en outre les deux imp&#233;ratifs que
sont les besoins des populations et les priorit&#233;s des donateurs. Or, tous deux
changent. Les actions des ONG sont pass&#233;es des actions d'urgence aux actions
de d&#233;veloppement &#224; travers l'ex&#233;cution de micro-projets;
aujourd'hui, elles embrassent des activit&#233;s &#233;conomiques et tendent de
plus en plus vers la consid&#233;ration des besoins de participation et d'affirmation
politiques. Les ONG africaines ont beaucoup de difficult&#233;s &#224; suivre cette
&#233;volution et se trouvent pour beaucoup d'entre elles en d&#233;phasage par
rapports aux besoins r&#233;els des populations qu'elles appuient. En outre, les
priorit&#233;s des donateurs sont &#233;galement changeantes. Les
consid&#233;rations humanitaires et g&#233;opolitiques qui motivaient
principalement les donateurs ont c&#233;d&#233; la priorit&#233; &#224; de
nouvelles motivations telles que le respect des droits de l'homme, l'instauration de la
d&#233;mocratie ou le lib&#233;ralisme &#233;conomique. Ces priorit&#233;s
nouvelles, qui apparaissent comme des exigences, et m&#234;me si elles sont
partag&#233;es, cr&#233;ent de v&#233;ritables probl&#232;mes &#224; des ONG
africaines qui d&#232;s lors semblent &#234;tre en "rade" par rapport aux attentes
des donateurs.
<p>
<a name="ong"><h3>ONG et soci&#233;t&#233; civile</h3></a>
<p>
     De nos jours, la prolif&#233;ration des ONG africaines semble &#224; la fois
&#234;tre porteuse d'espoir  pour la soci&#233;t&#233; civile mais &#233;galement
d'inqui&#233;tudes. 
<p>
     Espoir car est &#224; pr&#233;sent reconnu que l'existence des ONG dessine
l'amorce d'une sorte de soci&#233;t&#233; civile populaire. En effet, il
appara&#238;t clairement que les nombreuses associations populaires, leur
f&#233;d&#233;ration et les organismes qui les appuient visent &#224; donner la
qualit&#233; d'acteurs aux "petites gens" qui avaient jusque l&#224; &#233;t&#233;
b&#226;illonn&#233;es et manipul&#233;es par les tenants du pouvoir (les Etats et
leurs administrations). Il appara&#238;t d'autre part que ces organisations qui sont en
pleine croissance partout en Afrique soient en train de se doter progressivement d'un
pouvoir de dialogue, de se forger une certaine conscience de prise en charge et
d'opposer une certaine r&#233;sistance au pouvoir. A cet &#233;gard, les ONG
africaines sont sur la voie de cr&#233;er, consciemment ou inconsciemment, un
"pouvoir interm&#233;diaire" qui a longtemps fait d&#233;faut entre les Etats
d'Afrique et leur population.
<p>
     Mais inqui&#233;tude &#233;galement. Le d&#233;veloppement de certaines
ONG sans liens ou apports significatifs avec les populations de base et ayant comme
principale motivation la satisfaction de leurs propres besoins mat&#233;riels fait
craindre &#224; certains observateurs l'&#233;mergence d'une administration
parall&#232;le au sein des ONG. On reconna&#238;t en outre que des ONG se
cr&#233;ent sans que leurs responsables aient la moindre id&#233;e de la
mani&#232;re dont fonctionne une ONG et qui interviennent ponctuellement selon les
opportunit&#233;s financi&#232;res qui se pr&#233;sentent &#224; elles. Au vu de
cette prolif&#233;ration d'ONG interm&#233;diaires tax&#233;es "d'affairistes",
certaines ONG (qui se confondent, elles, g&#233;n&#233;ralement avec leur base
sociale) d&#233;sirent que clarification soit faite.
<p>
     On note &#233;galement le cas d'ONG qui sont porteuses d'id&#233;es toutes
faites (refl&#233;tant g&#233;n&#233;ralement les attentes de leurs bailleurs); elles
entreprennent faiblement une v&#233;ritable animation favorisant un n&#233;cessaire
m&ucirc;rissement des id&#233;es qui sous-tendent les actions qu'elles
ex&#233;cutent avec les populations de base. Par ailleurs, la plupart d'entre elles ont
peu de comp&#233;tence pour accompagner de mani&#232;re pertinente les
communaut&#233;s appuient. Les r&#233;sultats auxquels elles aboutissent sont
souvent disparates et sans lendemain. Le service "apr&#232;s aide" des ONG existant
rarement. 
<p>
     Les ONG africaines, souvent pr&#233;occup&#233;es par leur portefeuille
d'actions, ne sont, pour la plupart d'entre elles, pas &#224; m&#234;me de mesurer
ou de contr&#244;ler l'impact de leurs actions en vue de capitaliser et de
d&#233;velopper des changements qui faciliteraient une v&#233;ritable participation
des populations qu'elles appuient. A ce titre, elles t&#233;moignent souvent d'une
peur de l'action politique. En effet, plut&#244;t que de jouer un r&#244;le de pompier
face aux "situations de catastrophe" engendr&#233;es par la gestion et le
comportement de l'Etat, les ONG feraient mieux de s'employer &#224; des actions
dont la dimension est plus politique. Le neutralisme de l'action ONG doit &#234;tre
d&#233;pass&#233; et les ONG africaines se doivent de prendre conscience de leur
r&#244;le de contre-pouvoir et du caract&#232;re politique de leurs appuis. Elles se
doivent de d&#233;finir des strat&#233;gies appropri&#233;es favorisant la pleine
participation des populations &#224; leur d&#233;veloppement. Mais pour cela, en
d&#233;pit d'une riche exp&#233;rience acquise au cours des ann&#233;es, la
plupart des ONG africaines manque toujours d'une "masse critique d'analystes" pour
aider &#224; d&#233;finir des strat&#233;gies et m&#233;thodes pertinentes afin
de mieux conduire leur travail d'accompagnement aux populations de base qu'elles
disent repr&#233;senter.
<p>
     Malgr&#233; toutes les difficult&#233;s qu'elles rencontrent, les ONG
africaines sont aujourd'hui des acteurs reconnus comme incontournables dans la
reconstruction socio-&#233;conomique et politique qui a cours en Afrique. Au cours
de leur d&#233;veloppement, les inqui&#233;tudes qu'elles suscitent iront cependant
en s'amenuisant pour que les espoirs plac&#233;s en elles ne soient pas vains.

<b>
Depuis quelques ann&#233;es, les ONG du Sud peuvent b&#233;n&#233;ficier d'un
appui plus large que la traditionnelle formule de financement par projet. Si ce
financement de l'appui institutionnel ouvre la porte &#224; une am&#233;lioration des
rapports de collaboration entre les diff&#233;rents intervenants, il reste
n&#233;anmoins sous-utilis&#233;.</b>
<p>
     Les ONG du Nord engag&#233;es dans le d&#233;veloppement du Sud
peuvent se r&#233;partir en deux grandes cat&#233;gories. D'une part, les ONG
op&#233;rationnelles, celles qui g&#232;rent elles-m&#234;mes les  actions qu'elles
m&#232;nent sur le terrain, en engageant du personnel expatri&#233; et local et
souvent en collaborant avec des structures locales priv&#233;es ou publiques. D'autre
part, les ONG de financement, celles qui financent les activit&#233;s d'organisations
locales qui sont leurs partenaires. Le r&#244;le de ces ONG de financement est
d'offrir un appui &#224; leurs partenaires du Sud dans des domaines vari&#233;s,
d&#233;termin&#233;s g&#233;n&#233;ralement de commun accord entre l'ONG
du Nord et l'ONG du Sud, et &#233;galement d'assurer un suivi r&#233;gulier du
fonctionnement, des m&#233;thodes d'intervention et des r&#233;sultats de ces
organisations du Sud. Plut&#244;t rares il y a une vingtaine d'ann&#233;es, on a vu
augmenter consid&#233;rablement le nombre des ONG de financement au cours des
deux derni&#232;res d&#233;cennies.
<p>
<a name="sys"><h3>Les syst&#232;mes "classiques" de cofinancement</h3></a>
<p>
 Les syst&#232;mes de cofinancement publics des ONG du Nord ont
&#233;t&#233; &#233;tablis dans une p&#233;riode ou la plupart des ONG
&#233;taient des organisations op&#233;rationnelles sur le terrain et cette situation
a largement d&#233;termin&#233; l'optique dans laquelle les r&#232;gles des
cofinancements ont &#233;t&#233; &#233;tablies. Le sch&#233;ma le plus
r&#233;pandu est le financement par projet. Dans ce sch&#233;ma, l'ONG du Nord
pr&#233;sente une ou plusieurs activit&#233;s qui seront men&#233;es sur le terrain
&#224; son cofinanceur. Ces projets doivent &#234;tre d&#233;crits avec
pr&#233;cision et comporter un budget d&#233;taill&#233;. Ils sont examin&#233;s
&#224; priori de mani&#232;re approfondie par l'instance de cofinancement et si cet
examen est positif, l'engagement de financement couvre en g&#233;n&#233;ral une
p&#233;riode de trois &#224; cinq ans.  Pour cet examen &#224; priori,
diff&#233;rents avis ext&#233;rieurs sont g&#233;n&#233;ralement
demand&#233;s, ce qui augmente la fiabilit&#233; de l'avis mais entra&#238;ne des
d&#233;lais de d&#233;cision parfois fort longs. &Eacute;tant donn&#233; que la
priorit&#233; est donn&#233;e &#224; ces examens &#224; priori, il reste souvent
peu de temps au service de cofinancement disponible pour faire le suivi des projets
cofinanc&#233;s tout au long de leur d&#233;roulement.
<p>
 Si ce syst&#232;me de cofinancement est relativement bien adapt&#233; aux
projets des ONG op&#233;rationnelles qui m&#232;nent leurs projets sur le terrain,
il convient par contre moins bien aux exigences du travail des ONG de financement qui
soutiennent et appuient les activit&#233;s de leurs partenaires du Sud.
<p>
 L'appellation ONG du Sud peut d&#233;signer des organisations de types fort
diff&#233;rents. Il peut s'agir de petits groupes de base (de villageois, de femmes,
etc.), de f&#233;d&#233;rations de groupes de base (locales, r&#233;gionales ou
m&#234;me nationales) qui offrent des services &#224; leurs membres, ou encore
d'organisations d'appui qui apportent leur soutien technique et/ou financier &#224;
des initiatives locales. Certaines de ces ONG sont "d&#233;butantes" et peu
exp&#233;riment&#233;es, d'autres ont acquis un savoir-faire et obtiennent des
r&#233;sultats sur le terrain qui  sont reconnus localement et dans les milieux des
ONG du Nord.
<p>
 La plupart des ONG du Sud recherchent des financements aupr&#232;s de plusieurs
ONG du Nord, d'une part pour augmenter leur volume d'interventions et d'autre part
pour tenter d'assurer un financement global r&#233;gulier en r&#233;partissant les
risques d'un retard, d'une suspension ou d'un arr&#234;t de financement de la part
d'une ONG du Nord. S'il semble &#233;vident que la formule de financement par
projet convient mal &#224; ces ONG du Sud, elle pr&#233;sente des
inconv&#233;nients pour chacun des intervenants. 
<p>
 L'ONG du Sud doit diviser son programme g&#233;n&#233;ral en un certain
nombre de parties qui sont alors pr&#233;sent&#233;es une par une sous forme de
projets ind&#233;pendants &#224; ses diff&#233;rents partenaires du Nord. L'ONG
du Sud doit &#233;galement pr&#233;parer une comptabilit&#233;
s&#233;par&#233;e pour chacun de ses partenaires du Nord pour justifier les
montants re&#231;us.  En un mot, cela ne stimule pas une saine gestion et une
comptabilit&#233; coh&#233;rente et transparente de l'organisation.
<p>
 L'ONG du Nord est g&#233;n&#233;ralement consciente des probl&#232;mes que
le financement par projet pose &#224; son partenaire du Sud mais doit en faire une
condition pour l'obtention des fonds. Elle aura parfois tendance &#224; faire un suivi
ax&#233; uniquement sur les activit&#233;s sp&#233;cifiques qu'elle finance et non
sur le fonctionnement de l'ensemble de l'ONG du Sud.
<p>
 L'agence de cofinancement aura rarement en mains l'information n&#233;cessaire
pour juger de la qualit&#233; des m&#233;thodes de travail et des r&#233;sultats de
terrain de l'ONG du Sud et devra prendre une d&#233;cision sur des donn&#233;es
tr&#232;s partielles.
<p>
<a name="nou"><h3>La nouveaut&#233;: le financement de l'appui aux ONG du
Sud</h3></a>
<p>
 La derni&#232;re version des Conditions G&#233;n&#233;rales de Cofinancement
des ONG Europ&#233;ennes par la Commission de l'UE, parue en 1988,  comporte
un nouvel article qui r&#233;pond mieux aux besoins des ONG de financement et de
leurs partenaires du Sud.  Il s'agit de l'appui institutionnel aux organisations du Sud.
Ce syst&#232;me permet de financer une part de l'ensemble des activit&#233;s de
l'ONG du Sud ainsi que de couvrir une partie de ses frais de fonctionnement. Les
rapports et la comptabilit&#233; demand&#233;s sont les documents qui couvrent
l'ensemble des activit&#233;s de l'ONG et sont donc une copie des documents que
l'ONG doit &#233;tablir de toute mani&#232;re pour assurer sa propre gestion.
<p>
 L'objectif de ce nouvel article &#233;tait d'encourager les ONG europ&#233;ennes
&#224; appuyer le d&#233;veloppement des organisations du Sud, en
am&#233;liorant leurs capacit&#233;s de rendre des services aux initiatives locales
de d&#233;veloppement et en encourageant leurs efforts pour atteindre une plus
grande autonomie de fonctionnement.  Pour permettre la r&#233;alisation de ces
objectifs, les r&#232;gles de financement de ce nouveau mode d'appui laissent
&#224; l'organisation du Sud une large initiative dans le choix de ses actions et
l'encouragent &#224; g&#233;rer correctement ses activit&#233;s et ses finances
en se concentrant sur sa gestion globale.
<p>
 L'esprit de ce nouvel article des conditions g&#233;n&#233;rales de cofinancement
des ONG est excellent et ouvre la porte &#224; une am&#233;lioration des rapports
de collaboration entre les intervenants, ONG du Sud et du Nord et service de
cofinancement. En 92-93, une &#233;tude sur la mani&#232;re dont cette nouvelle
possibilit&#233; a &#233;t&#233; utilis&#233;e a &#233;t&#233;
r&#233;alis&#233;e. Quelques ONG du Sud ont pleinement
b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de ce nouveau mode de financement auquel leurs
partenaires du Nord les avait introduites.
<p>
 L'&#233;tude r&#233;v&#232;le cependant une sous-utilisation de cette nouvelle
possibilit&#233; par les ONG du Nord. Plusieurs raisons sont avanc&#233;es, par
exemple,  le nouvel article &#233;tait pr&#233;sent&#233; comme &#233;tant
exp&#233;rimental et limit&#233; &#224; une dur&#233;e de deux ans, les
valorisations des apports en nature, accept&#233;s pour les projets, n'y &#233;taient
pas admis. Une enqu&#234;te aupr&#232;s d'une vingtaine d'ONG
europ&#233;ennes r&#233;alis&#233;e dans le cadre de cette &#233;tude a
indiqu&#233; que certaines ONG du Nord n'avaient pas pris connaissance de la
nouvelle possibilit&#233; et n'avaient d&#232;s lors pas pu en informer leurs
partenaires du Sud.
<p>
 L'&#233;tude comportait &#233;galement une enqu&#234;te aupr&#232;s d'ONG
du Sud, certaines ayant b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; d'un financement selon le nouvel
article et d'autres qui n'en avaient pas b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233;. Dans l'ensemble,
les ONG du Sud ayant obtenu un financement selon les nouvelles dispositions en
&#233;taient fort satisfaites.  Voici quelques avantages de ce mode de financement
cit&#233;s par les ONG du Sud:
<p>
<ul>
<li>il permet &#224; l'ONG du Sud de d&#233;velopper une approche
int&#233;gr&#233;e et non sectorielle de ses actions;
<li>il permet aux financeurs de soutenir cette d&#233;marche globale de l'ONG du
Sud;
<li>il permet &#224; l'ONG du Sud de s'adapter aux besoins du milieu dans lequel
elle op&#232;re sans &#234;tre li&#233;e &#224; un nombre de r&#233;alisations
&#224; effectuer obligatoirement dans le cadre d'une subvention affect&#233;e;
<li>il doit permettre &#224; l'ONG de renforcer son fonctionnement interne.
</ul>
<p>
 Presque toutes les ONG du Sud interview&#233;es dans le cadre de l'&#233;tude
qui n'avaient pas b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; de ce nouveau type de financement,
ignoraient l'existence de cette possibilit&#233; de financement. Ces organisations se
sont montr&#233;es extr&#234;mement int&#233;ress&#233;es par cette
nouveaut&#233;.
<p>
<a name="rol"><h3>Le r&#244;le des ONG de financement du Nord</h3></a>
<p>
 Certaines ONG du Sud bien g&#233;r&#233;es et bien d&#233;velopp&#233;es
souhaitent obtenir un acc&#232;s direct aux instances publiques de financement ou
de cofinancement (sans passer par une ONG du Nord).  Cet acc&#232;s direct est
possible actuellement dans un nombre de cas limit&#233;, tant &#224;
l'int&#233;rieur de la Commission de l'UE (par exemple, dans certains lignes
budg&#233;taires ALA - Asie/Am&#233;rique Latine) que dans les Minist&#232;res
de Coop&#233;ration de quelques pays Europ&#233;ens (par exemple, la Suisse). En
r&#233;alit&#233;, pour contourner l'ONG du Nord dans une relation de financement
avec une ONG du Sud, il faut que l'agence de financement assume toutes les
fonctions de l'ONG du Nord. Cela est possible lorsque l'agence de financement traite
avec un nombre d'ONG du Sud tr&#232;s limit&#233; mais devient difficile &#224; 
r&#233;aliser lorsque le nombre de partenaires du Sud est important.
<p>
 Il semble utile de rappeler ici les diff&#233;rents r&#244;les de l'ONG de
financement du Nord:
<p><ul>
<li>un r&#244;le d'identification: l'ONG du Nord doit bien conna&#238;tre l'ONG
du Sud et bien se faire conna&#238;tre d'elle avant d'entrer dans une relation de
partenariat. Elle doit appr&#233;cier les m&#233;thodes de travail, le syst&#232;me
de gestion, les r&#233;sultats de terrain de l'ONG du Sud afin de bien comprendre
quel type d'appui sera utile. Elle doit exposer ses propres m&#233;thodes de travail,
ses possibilit&#233;s d'appui technique et de gestion, ses ressources
financi&#232;res et son acc&#232;s aux ressources financi&#232;res publiques.
<p>
<li>un r&#244;le d'appui: l'ONG du Nord doit appr&#233;cier les objectifs de
d&#233;veloppement de sa partenaire du Sud, d&#233;terminer avec elle les
domaines ou elle &#224; besoin de se renforcer et rechercher les moyens les plus
efficaces et les moins chers pour arriver aux renforcements n&#233;cessaires.
<p>
<li>un r&#244;le de suivi: l'ONG du Nord est responsable de la bonne utilisation des
fonds publics et priv&#233;s allou&#233;s &#224; l'ONG partenaire du Sud et pour
cela elle doit organiser un syst&#232;me de suivi de l'ONG du Sud qui lui permettra
de s'assurer que les fonds octroy&#233;s sont utilis&#233;s &#224; bon escient. Ce
suivi devrait porter essentiellement sur la dynamique interne de l'ONG du Sud, ses
strat&#233;gies de d&#233;veloppement et les m&#233;thodes utilis&#233;es pour
les mettre en oeuvre, la qualit&#233; et la transparence de sa gestion. Ce type de
suivi implique des visites r&#233;guli&#232;res des agents de l'ONG du Nord
aupr&#232;s de sa partenaire du Sud, des &#233;changes de courrier r&#233;guliers
et quelques visites des partenaires du Sud au si&#232;ge de l'ONG du Nord.
<p>
<li>un r&#244;le d'information: l'ONG du Nord doit utiliser son acc&#232;s direct
aux r&#233;alit&#233;s du Sud pour informer le public des pays du Nord sur les
situations v&#233;cues par les gens des pays du Sud. Cette information doit faire
comprendre au public du Nord les relations qui existent entre le d&#233;veloppement
au Nord et au Sud et l'importance de la solidarit&#233; entre le Nord et le Sud.
</ul>
<p>
   De nombreuses ONG du Sud appr&#233;cient beaucoup les services offerts par
les ONG du Nord et tiennent &#224; garder cet interm&#233;diaire qui les
conna&#238;t, les appuie et les suit. Il est &#233;vident que toutes les ONG de
financement du Nord n'offrent pas une qualit&#233; de services &#233;gale. Les
ONG du Sud qui recherchent un acc&#232;s direct aux agences publiques de
financement sont peut &#234;tre celles qui ne sont pas satisfaites de leur relation de
partenariat avec les ONG du Nord.

Presque tout le monde s'accorde pour dire que la d&#233;centralisation peut r&#233;ellement
accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&#233; de l'aide. Il s'agit d'impliquer bien davantage des acteurs autres que
l'Etat, tant dans la conception du d&#233;veloppement que dans sa mise en oeuvre.
<P>
"Autrefois, l'aide passait directement d'une bureaucratie &#224; une autre. Les b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires
&#233;taient en r&#233;alit&#233; des acteurs &#233;loign&#233;s", explique Jean Bossuyt de
l'ECDPM. "Cette approche ne s'est pas r&#233;v&#233;l&#233;e tr&#232;s efficace et, à la suite
du processus de d&#233;mocratisation, on admet aujourd'hui que l'aide doit &ecirc;tre
g&#233;r&#233;e de fa&#231;on beaucoup plus pluraliste."
<P>
De nombreux bailleurs de fonds, y compris l'Union europ&#233;enne, cherchent des moyens d'impliquer
directement des acteurs non &#233;tatiques. 
<P>
La "grande question" est de savoir comment mettre cette th&#233;orie en pratique. "C'est effectivement
une question assez difficile", convient Bossuyt. Difficile en partie du fait que de nombreux gouvernements
ACP se sentent menac&#233;s et craignent de perdre le contr&ocirc;le de "leurs" ressources d'aide.
Difficile parce que les organismes donateurs ont peu d'exp&#233;rience quant &#224; la fa&#231;on de
traiter &#224; niveau &#233;gal avec les acteurs non gouvernementaux. Ils ont plus l'habitude de les
consid&#233;rer comme des b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires ou des organismes d'ex&#233;cution. La
difficult&#233; tient &#233;galement au fait que la soci&#233;t&#233; civile voit
g&#233;n&#233;ralement l'Etat comme "l'ennemi" plut&ocirc;t que comme un partenaire potentiel.
La r&#233;ticence de nombreux acteurs autres que l'&Eacute;tat &#224; travailler ensemble freine
&#233;galement ce processus. Comme l'explique Bossuyt, "chacun veut son propre argent et leurs propres
activit&#233;s. Toutefois, ind&#233;pendamment de la part du g&#226;teau laiss&#233;e aux acteurs
autres que l'&Eacute;tat, le gouvernement central ne peut pas &ecirc;tre exclu de la sc&#232;ne. 
&#224; encourager la coop&#233;ration entre le gouvernement central, la soci&#233;t&#233;  civile et
les organisations locales", pr&#233;cise Bossuyt. Par la suite, elle pourrait contribuer &#224; trouver un
nouvel &#233;quilibre entre l'Etat et la soci&#233;t&#233;, comme en Ouganda.
<P>
<H3>L'Ouganda montre la voie &#224; suivre</H3>
<P>
L'Ouganda suit une politique de d&#233;centralisation active consistant &#224; transmettre nombre de
fonctions du gouvernement aux 39 districts.
<P>
Le gouvernement central s'est politiquement investi dans la d&#233;centralisation. En effet, certains
budgets gouvernementaux ont d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; d&#233;centralis&#233;s et les
gouvernements locaux disposent de ressources pour s'acquitter de la plupart de leurs nouvelles
responsabilit&#233;s, explique Bossuyt, qui a r&#233;cemment &#233;tudi&#233; divers projets
d&#233;centralis&#233;s en Ouganda. "Cette exp&#233;rience fut tr&#232;s instructive, estime-t-il. Le
cas de l'Ouganda montre bien que si le gouvernement national soutient vraiment la d&#233;centralisation,
les activit&#233;s de coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e peuvent prosp&#233;rer." 
<P>
Par exemple, un programme soutenu par le Danemark aide &#224; garantir que les districts disposent des
capacit&#233;s suffisantes pour se charger de leur nouveau r&ocirc;le. Selon Bossuyt, "le programme a
contribu&#233; &#224; cr&#233;er un lieu de rencontre o&ugrave; les citoyens peuvent prendre part
&#224; l'&#233;tablissement des priorit&#233;s et &#224; la mise en oeuvre des activit&#233;s de
d&#233;veloppement".
<P>
En outre, l'approche danoise renforce aussi les capacit&#233;s. "Les populations se rendent compte
qu'elles doivent participer. En les int&#233;ressant au processus de d&#233;cision et &#224; la mise en
oeuvre des programmes au niveau local, on leur donne &#233;galement l'occasion d'apprendre et de
d&#233;velopper leurs propres id&#233;es et capacit&#233;s", explique Bossuyt.
<P>
Indubitablement, la d&#233;centralisation administrative de l'Etat ougandais a &#233;galement servi les
efforts de la coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e. Selon Henrik Nielsen, "l'&#233;tablissement
de la coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e est particuli&#232;rement fructueux en Ouganda parce
que les organismes locaux partagent pr&#233;cis&#233;ment cette mani&#232;re de voir." Ce qu'ils
accomplissent dans leur travail quotidien a un effet positif sur leur fa&#231;on d'aborder la
coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e. D'apr&#232;s son exp&#233;rience, cette situation est
exceptionnelle, m&ecirc;me si elle pose quelques  probl&#232;mes aux bailleurs de fonds.
<P>
<H3>Les bailleurs de fonds ont encore beaucoup &#224; apprendre</H3>
<P>
En Ouganda, la plupart des bailleurs de fonds ne partagent toujours pas l'avis du gouvernement et ils
persistent souvent &#224; poursuivre leurs propres strat&#233;gies sans faire grand cas des changements
survenus dans les structures de d&#233;cision locales.
<P>
Nielsen a pass&#233; ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es en qualit&#233; de conseiller principal du district
de Rakai.  Il est par cons&#233;quent bien plac&#233; pour commenter ce qu'il consid&#232;re comme
le "point cl&#233;", &#224; savoir que les bailleurs de fonds doivent adapter leurs actions pour qu'elles
refl&#232;tent les choix locaux. "Le probl&#232;me, dit-il, c'est les bailleurs de fonds."
Chose particuli&#232;rement g&ecirc;nante, alors que les bailleurs de fonds r&#233;clament une
d&#233;centralisation accrue des ressources de l'aide.
<P>
Nielsen est d'avis que les bailleurs de fonds ont besoin de "d&#233;centraliser leurs esprits" pour pouvoir
mettre en place une coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e. Cela n&#233;cessite des changements
consid&#233;rables dans la conception et la mise en oeuvre des programmes, des ajustements dans la
coop&#233;ration technique ainsi que des syst&#232;mes de justification de l'utilisation de l'aide
refl&#233;tant les r&#233;alit&#233;s sur le terrain.
<P>
Toutefois, l'avenir se pr&#233;sente sous un jour tr&#232;s favorable. Des visiteurs venus de toute
l'Afrique ont visit&#233; Rakai pour voir comment une administration d&#233;centralis&#233;e est
appuy&#233;e par la coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e, tout en respectant le r&ocirc;le
nouveau, imparti au gouvernement central.  Bossuyt conclut: "Il sera essentiel dans l'avenir que nous
collections, analysions et r&#233;pandions de tels exemples de bonne pratique, et que nous les
int&#233;grions dans la pens&#233;e et les actions des bailleurs de fonds. La d&#233;centralisation
d&#233;passe la probl&#233;matique africaine."

Les strat&#233;gies de d&#233;veloppement de l'apr&#232;s-
ind&#233;pendance ont attribu&#233; &#224; l'Etat un r&#244;le
directeur dans la gestion du d&#233;veloppement, souvent au
d&#233;triment d'autres acteurs de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Ceci a
conduit le secteur public &#224; se d&#233;velopper bien au-
del&#224; de ses possibilit&#233;s financi&#232;res et de gestion. Au cours des ann&#233;es 1980, un
consensus global est apparu quant aux limites de l'impact de
l'action du secteur public pour favoriser la croissance et le
d&#233;veloppement. La nouvelle doctrine n&#233;olib&#233;rale met
l'accent sur l'ajustement, la d&#233;r&#233;glementation et la
privatisation. C'est plus particuli&#232;rement en Afrique sub-
saharienne, que l'on s'en est pris &#224; la mainmise de l'Etat sur
le d&#233;veloppement. Les programmes d'ajustement structurel ont
remis en cause le monopole du pouvoir dont disposait l'Etat, et
l'Etat africain, autrefois unique r&#233;cipiendaire et partenaire
de l'aide internationale, a perdu son statut d'organe le plus favoris&#233. Ces changements ont permis aux autres acteurs du d&#233;veloppement d'occuper la
place ainsi lib&#233;r&#233;e et ont contribu&#233; &#224; l'acheminement vers le processus de d&#233;mocratisation. Simultan&#233;ment, le concept de "bonne gouvernance" est devenu le dernier terme en vogue.
<p>
Ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, la progression g&#233;n&#233;rale de cette nouvelle orthodoxie du
d&#233;veloppement s'est vue contest&#233;e. On peut d&#233;gager quatre raisons principales
&#224; l'origine de ce ph&#233;nom&#232;ne. Premi&#232;rement, se contenter de "faire reculer
l'Etat" s'est r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; ne pas &#234;tre la panac&#233;e. Les politiques mises en place
pour r&#233;duire la taille et les cots de l'administration, par exemple, ont caus&#233; une diminution
dramatique des niveaux des salaires, &#224; un tel point que le secteur public n'a plus &#233;t&#233;
en mesure d'attirer ou de retenir la main-d'oeuvre qualifi&#233;e. Par cons&#233;quent, les
capacit&#233;s ont souvent diminu&#233; jusqu'&#224; atteindre des niveaux dangereusement faibles.
<p>
Deuxi&#232;mement, le d&#233;bat "Etat contre march&#233;", qui n'est pas nouveau, a perdu de son
int&#233;r&#234;t. La privatisation immod&#233;r&#233;e et le d&#233;mant&#232;lement de l'Etat
ont &#233;t&#233; perus comme &#233;tant tout autant des erreurs que l'engagement sans
r&#233;serve en faveur d'une organisation bureaucratique et centraliste qui avait
pr&#233;c&#233;d&#233. L'exp&#233;rience en Asie de l'Est met en
lumi&#232;re le r&#244;le d&#233;terminant d'un gouvernement fort et efficace, et on
estime qu'un syst&#232;me d'administration publique africain "offensif" requiert un r&#244;le et un domaine d'intervention bien d&#233;finis ainsi que l'aptitude &#224; d&#233;terminer les degr&#233;s optimaux de son engagement.
<p>
Troisi&#232;mement, la recherche indique que les liens entre la d&#233;mocratisation et le
d&#233;veloppement demeurent accidentels. Les pays en voie de
d&#233;veloppement qui ont r&#233;ussi &#224; d&#233;clencher la croissance et &#224; r&#233;duire
la pauvret&#233; sont g&#233;n&#233;ralement ceux dont les politiques ont rassembl&#233;
suffisamment de pouvoir, de probit&#233;, d'autonomie et de comp&#233;tence pour &#233;laborer,
poursuivre et encourager la r&#233;alisation d'objectifs de d&#233;veloppement explicites et
d&#233;termin&#233;s au niveau national.
<p>
Quatri&#232;mement, les limites des acteurs de "la soci&#233;t&#233; civile" en tant qu'agents du
d&#233;veloppement sont de plus en plus reconnues. En g&#233;n&#233;ral, les acteurs de la
soci&#233;t&#233; civile, y compris les ONG, sont encore tr&#232;s faibles en ce qui concerne
l'organisation et des doutes ont &#233;t&#233; &#233;mis quant &#224; leur capacit&#233; de produire
des effets significatifs sur les r&#233;formes des politiques. Dans de nombreux cas, la distinction entre
Etat et soci&#233;t&#233; civile n'est pas &#233;vidente, et certains sont conscients du fait que
d'innombrables organisations de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile, op&#233;rant en dehors des cadres des
politiques nationales, obtiendront peu de r&#233;sultats en termes de traitement des probl&#232;mes de
d&#233;veloppement de l'Afrique.
<p>
Bien que les partisans d'un Etat bureaucratique fortement centralis&#233; soit tr&#232;s peu nombreux,
on est peut-&#234;tre all&#233; trop loin dans la r&#233;duction du domaine d'action du secteur public.
L'important, aujourd'hui, est d'assurer la transition d'un r&#244;le o&#249; [les gouvernements]
dominaient le processus des politiques de d&#233;veloppement &#224; un r&#244;le o&#249; ils
fournissent un environnement favorable aux divers acteurs institutionnels relativement autonomes.
<p>
Ce document fournit un exemple concret d'un processus de transition de ce type dans la gestion des
ressources de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. La coop&#233;ration
d&#233;centralis&#233;e fut l'une des innovations de la quatri&#232;me Convention de Lom&#233;
sign&#233;e en 1989 entre l'Union europ&#233;enne (UE) et 69 Etats ACP (Afrique, Cara&#239;bes
et Pacifique). Elle permet &#224; un grand nombre d'acteurs du d&#233;veloppement de
b&#233;n&#233;ficier des ressources de Lom&#233;, ce qui, par le pass&#233;, &#233;tait l'apanage
des agences des gouvernements centraux. Cette innovation refl&#233;tait les conceptions en
&#233;volution (des donateurs) quant &#224; la relation Etat-soci&#233;t&#233; et aux modalit&#233;s
de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. Cependant la mise en pratique de ce concept s'est
r&#233;v&#233;l&#233;e difficile et les r&#233;sultats de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement
obtenus jusqu'&#224; pr&#233;sent dans le cadre de Lom&#233; IV sont maigres.

La d&#233;centralisation:<br>un test d&#233;cisif pour les ONG
</H2>
<P>
<H4>
Texte int&#233;gral d'un article paru dans <i>ECDPM Points cl&#233;s 1996</i>: page 1

<HR>
<p>
Les processus de d&#233;centralisation fleurissent actuellement dans de nombreux pays du tiers monde.
Mais s'ils ne sont pas soutenus par un renforcement des capacit&#233;s, ils seront de  dur&#233;e
&#233;ph&#233;m&#232;re. Or, les ONG, tant du Sud que du Nord, peuvent jouer un r&ocirc;le
cl&#233; dans ce processus.
<p>
"Le gouvernement de type centralis&#233; a &#233;chou&#233; car l'Etat n'&#233;tait pas en  mesure
de tout r&#233;gler," d&#233;clare Antoine Sawadogo, directeur de la Commission nationale de
d&#233;centralisation au Burkina Faso. Il conna&icirc;t bien le sujet puisqu'il a travaill&#233; aves Six
S, l'une des ONG les plus importantes au Burkina Faso. "Mais," poursuit Sawadogo, "les demandes
pos&#233;es aux gouvernements se multiplient, et ce, &#224; cause de l'augmentation du niveau
d'&#233;ducation.  On constate un nombre croissant de gens qui savent lire, des gens avides de savoir.
Leurs besoins se sont accrus d'une fa&#231;on exponentielle, mais nos moyens pour leur proposer des
services sont plut&ocirc;t limit&#233;s. C'est pourquoi  nous avons besoin de capacit&#233;s. Si la
d&#233;centralisation ne s'accompagne pas d' un renforcement des capacit&#233;s, elle reste sans objet."
<p>
La d&#233;centralisation est devenue le ma&icirc;tre-mot sur le continent africain, ayant plusieurs sens. 
Manifestement, pour le fonctionnaire de l'administration centrale appel&#233; &#224; conc&#233;der une
partie de son pouvoir, elle a un sens tout &#224; fait diff&#233;rent de celui qu'elle a pour l'&#233;lu
local presque totalement d&#233;muni des connaissances n&#233;cessaires &#224; l' accomplissement
des nouvelles t&#226;ches qui lui sont confi&#233;es; ou pour le repr&#233;sentant d'une ONG locale
&#224; qui on demande de rendre des comptes; ou pour l'agence donatrice du Nord d&#233;sireuse
d'employer ses fonds de fa&#231;on plus efficace. Selon Jean Bossuyt et Geert Laporte de l'ECDPM, la
solution passe par le renforcement des capacit&#233;s.
<p>
<h3>Le renforcement des capacit&#233;s</h3>

Bossuyt explique: "En Afrique, on a pris conscience que le gouvernement ne peut pas &ecirc;tre le seul
interlocuteur des agences donatrices. L'&#233;volution en ce sens a bien s&ucirc;r &#233;t&#233;
acc&#233;l&#233;r&#233;e par les bailleurs de fonds eux-m&ecirc;mes qui sont, &#224; la fois,
d&#233;sireux de diversifier leurs partenaires." Les ONG se sont vues de plus en plus souvent
engag&#233;es dans la r&#233;alisation de projets importants. Bossuyt confirme que, petit &#224; petit,
elles se retrouvent &#233;galement impliqu&#233;es dans des d&#233;bats de politiques. "Un d&#233;bat
est en cours sur qui est le plus apte &#224; faire quoi. Le gouvernement central a diminu&#233; en
importance. Il y a donc une place plus grande pour les ONG et la soci&#233;t&#233; civile, mais les
nouvelles formes de relations ne se sont pas encore concr&#233;tis&#233;es de fa&#231;on pr&#233;cise.
Dans ces conditions, renforcer les capacit&#233;s signifie apprendre &#224; voir les autres acteurs en
partenaires compl&#233;mentaires et apprendre &#224; occuper l'espace laiss&#233; vacant par la
d&#233;centralisation."
<p>
Force est de constater qu'il y a encore un long apprentissage &#224; faire. Ainsi, de nombreux
gouvernements ACP se d&#233;fient encore des ONG. Selon Laporte, "Grand nombre de parlementaires
ACP ont, lors de la derni&#232;re assembl&#233;e paritaire ACP/UE, fait marque d'un
d&#233;sint&#233;r&ecirc;t complet envers les ONG, leur reprochant d'&ecirc;tre incontr&ocirc;lables
et non repr&#233;sentatives," d&#233;montrant bien la n&#233;cessit&#233; du renforcement des
capacit&#233;s  pour tous les acteurs, et pas seulement pour les ONG.
<p>
Cela vaut &#233;galement pour les agences donatrices. Il existe souvent un d&#233;calage entre les
attentes des bailleurs de fonds &#224; l'&#233;gard des ONG et la propre image que celles-ci ont d'elles-
m&ecirc;mes. Selon Bossuyt, les agences donatrices voient les ONG comme "tout ce que les
gouvernements centraux ne sont pas: efficaces, op&#233;rant &#224; la base et connaissant les besoins
des populations. Elles ne veulent pas simplement combler les vides, elles veulent aussi s'asseoir autour
de la table."
<p>
Concilier ces vues diff&#233;rentes et garantir que tous les partenaires tirent la le&#231;on  du processus,
tel est l'un des d&#233;fis que l'ECDPM s'efforce de relever. "Le Centre op&#232;re sur le terrain
d'entente de tous les acteurs.  Il est important de rassembler les diff&#233;rents acteurs pour planifier
leurs actions et d&#233;penser l'argent de fa&#231;on pertinente."
<p>
L'un des probl&#232;mes majeurs en mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e
r&#233;side dans la capacit&#233; limit&#233;e &#224; absorber des fonds. "La meilleure fa&#231;on
de tuer la soci&#233;t&#233; civile est de l'ensevelir sous les ressources financi&#232;res, et ce n'est
certes pas seulement une possibilit&#233; th&#233;orique mais un r&#233;el danger," avertit Bossuyt.
Il fait notamment r&#233;f&#233;rence au fait que, de plus en plus souvent, les bailleurs de fonds 
financent directement les ONG du Sud.  Cela suscite une grande inqui&#233;tude chez les ONG du Nord
qui consid&#232;rent le financement direct comme une menace. Bossuyt argumente que les ONG du Nord
devraient plut&ocirc;t le consid&#233;rer comme une possibilit&#233; pour renforcer les  capacit&#233;s
avec les ONG du Sud. Aussi pr&#233;sage-t-il que le financement direct va entrainer une redistribution
des t&#226;ches, et ce, pour le bien de chacun.
<p>
En raison de la fragilit&#233; de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile dans le Sud, il consid&#232;re qu'il existe
un cr&#233;neau pour des structures de partenariat bien &#233;labor&#233;es avec les ONG du Nord.
"Celles-ci devraient agir domme des interm&#233;diaires pour les ONG du Sud, elles devraient leur
fournir un appui en termes de capacit&#233;s et les informer sur la fa&#231;on d'op&#233;rer avec
l'Union europ&#233;enne." Il pr&#233;voit que les ONG qui ne s'adaptent pas et ne servent que de
"distributeurs de billets" sont appel&#233;es &#224; dispara&icirc;tre.

<b>
Nous les rencontrons le temps d'une r&#233;colte de fonds, nous suivons parfois
leurs actions &#224; la t&#233;l&#233;vision, peut-&#234;tre lisons- nous leurs
brochures. Rarement plus. Aussi, que connaissons-nous des "organisations non
gouvernementales", appellation qui recouvre une grande diversit&#233;, si ce ne
sont celles dont la notori&#233;t&#233; n'est plus &#224; construire? Bien peu
de choses en r&#233;alit&#233;. Il faut dire que si elles aiment &#224; garder une
part de myst&#232;re, elles ne sont pas non plus des entit&#233;s fix&#233;es
une bonne fois pour toutes. A l'heure actuelle, d'ailleurs, ne sont-elles pas &#224;
red&#233;finir leur propre identit&#233;?</b>
<p>
     S'il est un exercice p&#233;rilleux, c'est bien celui de donner une
d&#233;finition &#224; la notion d'ONG. Ce terme recouvre de nombreuses
acceptions: organisation de volontariat, agence de solidarit&#233;, organisation
non gouvernementale internationale, organisation quasi-non gouvernementale, tiers-
secteur, etc. Il n'existe en fait aucune convention universelle; les ONG sont
cr&#233;&#233;es dans le cadre des l&#233;gislations nationales, leurs conditions
juridiques et leurs proc&#233;dures de constitution variant donc d'un Etat &#224;
l'autre. A ce propos, la d&#233;nomination ONG a &#233;t&#233;
abandonn&#233;e r&#233;cemment en France au profit de celle d'ASI, association
de solidarit&#233; internationale.
<p>
     On peut bien s&ucirc;r tenter de cerner quelques bases d'identification
communes telles que la notion d'association priv&#233;e non lucrative, le rapport
particulier &#224; l'espace Nord-Sud (sans oublier que des ONG se chargent de
venir en aide &#224; la pauvret&#233; dans nos pays) ou encore la volont&#233;
d'inscrire une action comme une &#233;manation de la soci&#233;t&#233; hors
du pouvoir de l'Etat (ce qui passe sous silence qu'un bon nombre de leurs projets
sont solidaires des activit&#233;s m&#234;mes du gouvernement). A ce titre, le
grand public, pour peu qu'il ait un minimum de compassion pour la pauvret&#233;
mondiale, croit en les ONG et les soutient. A contrario, la critique est souvent
virulente &#224; l'&#233;gard des gouvernements et autres institutions d'Etat.
C'est la dichotomie non gouvernementale/gouvernemental; l'efficacit&#233; contre
la bureaucratie; l'altruisme face &#224; l'int&#233;r&#234;t; le souci du bien-
&#234;tre des hommes oppos&#233; aux enjeux &#233;conomiques et politiques.
Les m&#233;dias renforcent d'ailleurs plus d'une fois cette conception. Cependant,
les ONG n'ont pas un profil si limpide car s'il est une caract&#233;ristique que l'on
ne peut certainement pas leur pr&#234;ter, c'est de former un tout
homog&#232;ne. Les ONG sont avant tout, et c'est ce qui fait leur force,
diversit&#233;.
<p>
<a name="ong"><h3>Des ONG de tous bords</h3></a>
<p>
     Nous assistons &#224; un v&#233;ritable foisonnement d'ONG depuis le
d&#233;but des ann&#233;es 80. Si selon l'OCDE, les pays occidentaux en
comptaient environ 1600 en 1980, elles &#233;taient 2500 en 1990 et on
d&#233;passe all&#233;grement le chiffre des 3000 aujourd'hui. Il existe certes
des diff&#233;rences selon les pays, notamment en taille (un "monstre" comme
Oxfam UK, par exemple, ne se retrouve dans aucun autre pays europ&#233;en) et
en nombre. Si elles sont tr&#232;s nombreuses en France et en Allemagne, elles
sont en nombre bien plus restreint dans d'autres pays. Il faut dire que certains
d'entre eux ont une v&#233;ritable tradition en la mati&#232;re quand dans
d'autres, le ph&#233;nom&#232;ne est beaucoup plus r&#233;cent. Au Royaume-
Uni, par exemple, bien qu'on en recense d&#233;j&#224; au si&#232;cle dernier,
beaucoup d'ONG, et non des moindres, na&#238;tront avant la seconde guerre
mondiale. En Espagne par contre, la premi&#232;re ONG ne verra le jour qu'en
1942 et la v&#233;ritable &#233;poque de croissance date des ann&#233;es 80.
Cette "tradition" nationale se retrouve &#233;galement dans la gen&#232;se de
beaucoup d'ONG. Si dans les pays catholiques, l'activit&#233; associative s'est
d&#233;velopp&#233;e presque exclusivement dans le sillage de l'Eglise, dans
d'autres par contre, ce fut plut&#244;t li&#233; &#224; une tradition anti-
gouvernementale; ou encore, comme c'est le cas dans les pays scandinaves,
persistait un volontarisme qui cherchait &#224; &#233;tablir une
soci&#233;t&#233; bas&#233;e sur le consensus avec l'Etat; cette approche
corporatiste se retrouvant quelque peu aux Pays-Bas.
<p>
     Une autre distinction peut-&#234;tre faite entre les ONG dites
confessionnelles et les ONG dites s&#233;culi&#232;res. Les premi&#232;res, soit
qu'elles en &#233;manent directement, soit qu'elles s'y soient li&#233;es au cours
de leur histoire, sont en effet proches &#224; diff&#233;rents degr&#233; d'un
culte. Cette parent&#233; n'influence pas toujours leurs actions bien que certaines
estiment avoir un v&#233;ritable message missionnaire chr&#233;tien; on parlera
d&#232;s lors plus volontiers d'ONG &#233;vang&#233;liques. Certaines vont
m&#234;me plus loin comme c'est le cas d'ONG proches de tendances telles que
l'Opus Dei ou issues de diff&#233;rentes sectes. En ce qui concerne les ONG
s&#233;culi&#232;res, une distinction peut &#234;tre faite quant &#224; leur
appartenance ou non &#224; une autre structure. En effet, beaucoup d'entre elles
&#233;manent de structures telles qu'un syndicat, un parti politique, une
organisation internationale ou autres organisations sociales. L&#224; aussi, ce lien
peut s'av&#233;rer &#234;tre plus ou moins intime et se r&#233;percuter sur
leurs actions. Toutes ne s'en cachent pas (il n'en va par contre pas de m&#234;me
pour d'autres qui &#233;manent de structures telles que la C.I.A...). Encore une
fois, cette appartenance est souvent li&#233;e &#224; la tradition nationale; ainsi
par exemple, tous les partis politiques allemands ont leur ONG attitr&#233;e. 
<p>
     L'appartenance &#224; une structure peut &#233;galement &#234;tre une
source de financement suppl&#233;mentaire pour l'ONG. C'est le cas notamment
de beaucoup d'ONG confessionnelles, souvent par le biais d'un r&#233;seau, qui
b&#233;n&#233;ficient d'une part de la taxe per&#231;ue par l'Eglise &#224;
laquelle elles sont rattach&#233;es. A contrario, les ONG "politiques" sont parfois
interdites de r&#233;colte de fonds propre et d&#233;pendant &#224; 100% du
gouvernement (cas de l'Allemagne). Si cette r&#233;partition fonds propres/fonds
publics conna&#238;t de profondes diff&#233;rences selon la
notori&#233;t&#233; de l'ONG, elle varie &#233;galement selon les pays. Ainsi,
la d&#233;pendance &#224; l'&#233;gard des fonds publics ne d&#233;passe pas
en moyenne les 15 &#224; 20% en France. Le chiffre est semblable en Allemagne
mais atteint les 40% au Royaume-Uni. Mais il peut monter jusqu'&#224; 80%
comme c'est la cas en Italie, en Su&#232;de ou en Norv&#232;ge. Notons que ces
deux derniers pays ne connaissent pas le syst&#232;me d'avantage fiscal
attach&#233; aux dons priv&#233;s, ce qui explique en partie leur extr&#234;me
faiblesse.
<p>
     Si, gr&#226;ce &#224; ces financements, certaines ONG (souvent celles qui
ont une base tr&#232;s vaste) concentrent leurs efforts sur une grande
vari&#233;t&#233; de th&#232;mes, d'autres privil&#233;gient les actions
li&#233;es &#224; une th&#233;matique sp&#233;cifique. Ces "ONG
sp&#233;cialis&#233;es" sont de plus en plus nombreuses et, au fil des ans, des
th&#232;mes nouveaux sont venus se greff&#233;s sur les secteurs
d'activit&#233; traditionnels que sont l'&#233;ducation, la faim et la sant&#233;.
C'est l'environnement bien s&ucirc;r, mais aussi les droits de l'homme, la
r&#233;sorption de l'endettement ou le d&#233;sarmement. Depuis une dizaine
d'ann&#233;es, deux th&#232;mes majeurs ont fait leur apparition: la jeunesse et
les femmes. Quant aux questions relatives &#224; ces derni&#232;res, il est
&#233;vident que les ONG ont jou&#233; un r&#244;le important pour la mise en
oeuvre d'une politique officielle appropri&#233;e. Bien souvent d'ailleurs, les ONG
n'h&#233;sitent pas &#224; d&#233;fendre ces causes avec acharnement,
prenant une position politique claire et parfois radicale (malheureusement beaucoup
plus par r&#233;action aux politiques officielles plut&#244;t que de mani&#232;re
pr&#233;ventive). Leur r&#244;le ne se cantonne effectivement plus &#224;
mettre en place des micro-projets comme elles pouvaient le faire il y a une trentaine
d'ann&#233;es (ni &#224; ne faire que de l'aide humanitaire comme se plaisent
&#224;  le prouver des m&#233;dias avides des situations d'urgence), mais bien
de plus en plus &#224; tenter d'influencer les relations &#233;conomiques et
politiques internationales.
<p>
<a name="pre"><h3>Des premiers missionnaires aux avocats du tiers monde</h3></a>
<p>
     Bien souvent, lorsque l'on distingue les ONG selon leur r&#244;le, selon leur
mission au sein du secteur du d&#233;veloppement, trois cat&#233;gories se
d&#233;gagent:
<ul>
<li>les ONG d'urgence ou d'aide humanitaire;
<li>les ONG de d&#233;veloppement, subdivis&#233;es en ONG de financement
(appui technique ou transfert de fonds) et ONG op&#233;rationnelles (travail avec
groupe local ou envoi de son propre personnel);
<li>les ONG d'&#233;ducation au d&#233;veloppement (sensibilisation dans les
&#233;coles, campagnes d'information et de mobilisation, lobbying, etc.).
</ul>
<p>
     En r&#233;alit&#233;, cette distinction peut facilement porter &#224;
confusion car si certaines s'int&#232;grent uniquement dans un type d'action
sp&#233;cifique, de plus en plus d'ONG m&#233;langent aujourd'hui les genres
(surtout d&#233;veloppement et &#233;ducation au d&#233;veloppement). Aussi,
cette prise de position politique actuelle ne s'est pas faite du jour au lendemain et
les ONG sont pass&#233;es par de s&#233;rieuses remises en question de leur
propre travail. Sommairement, et comme l'a &#233;tudi&#233; David Korten, on
peut affirmer que trois g&#233;n&#233;rations d'approche du
d&#233;veloppement ont jalonn&#233; les actions des ONG.
<p>
     Les premi&#232;res ONG contemporaines sont n&#233;es juste apr&#232;s
la premi&#232;re guerre mondiale, bien souvent dans le sillage direct des Eglises.
Concentrant dans un premier temps leurs actions pour subvenir aux besoins des
victimes dans l'Europe d&#233;chir&#233;e, elles vont petit &#224; petit se
tourner vers les pays du Sud. Cette assistance humanitaire ne restera pas
longtemps l'unique apanage des missionnaires et de la religion puisque des groupes
de b&#233;n&#233;voles se cr&#233;ent dans les milieux la&iuml;cs. L'approche
de cette premi&#232;re g&#233;n&#233;ration &#233;tait simpliste et consistait
&#224; dire "si ces personnes ont faim, c'est qu'elles n'ont pas de nourriture; nous
allons donc leur en donner". Les ONG r&#233;pondaient donc &#224; un besoin
imm&#233;diat et concret.
<p>
     La seconde approche, qui co&iuml;ncide avec la vague d'ind&#233;pendance
de la fin des ann&#233;es 50 et du d&#233;but des ann&#233;es 60, est
n&#233;e d'une remise en question du mod&#232;le qui pr&#233;valait
jusqu'alors. Le nombre d'ONG augmente et les activit&#233;s se diversifient. Il ne
s'agit plus d&#233;sormais d'une simple assistance face &#224; des
sympt&#244;mes de la pauvret&#233; mais bien de permettre &#224; ces
populations de se prendre en main; de focaliser son &#233;nergie &#224;
d&#233;velopper les capacit&#233;s des "victimes" &#224; mieux r&#233;pondre
&#224; leurs besoins par le biais des actions locales. C'est le "small is beautiful"
de Schumacher qui se traduit par le d&#233;veloppement de comit&#233;s de
sant&#233; pour entreprendre par la suite des mesures de pr&#233;vention ou
encore l'introduction de pratiques agricoles. Si au d&#233;but de cette seconde
p&#233;riode, beaucoup d'ONG tentaient de reproduire le mod&#232;le occidental,
la volont&#233; de maintenir l'ind&#233;pendance &#233;conomique et politique
des populations locales va prendre rapidement le dessus; d&#233;sir
d'ind&#233;pendance soutenu par de nouveaux concepts politiques
&#233;mergents d'intellectuels du Sud tels les th&#233;ologiens de la
lib&#233;ration. 
<p>
     Alors que les grands mod&#232;les propos&#233;s au tiers-monde ne
parlaient qu'en terme de retard et d'une croissance macro-&#233;conomique dont
les effets positifs se r&#233;percuteraient sur les pauvres, un discours nouveau
&#233;manait de la communaut&#233; des ONG. Cette "id&#233;ologie" selon
laquelle la pauvret&#233; r&#233;sulte d'une distribution in&#233;gale des
richesses et des ressources et d'un rapport de force in&#233;gal, tant sur le plan
national qu'international, va contribuer sans nul doute &#224; accentuer la
reconnaissance de leur r&#244;le fondamental dans tout processus de
d&#233;veloppement. En effet, les ONG qui privil&#233;giaient le soutien aux
projets locaux vont prendre conscience des limites d'une telle approche. Limites qui
ont pour nom int&#233;r&#234;t politique et &#233;conomique. Depuis le
d&#233;but des ann&#233;es 70 et dans la lign&#233;e des id&#233;es d'une
certaine gauche et de l'av&#232;nement du Nouvel Ordre Economique Mondial,
une troisi&#232;me g&#233;n&#233;ration appara&#238;t: le
d&#233;veloppement soutenable. La  nature de la pauvret&#233; devient politique.
Implicitement, cela signifie que si non seulement les micro-projets n'auront jamais
plus qu'un r&#233;sultat &#224; petite &#233;chelle, une inertie locale est
maintenue &#224; cause de la corruption, du d&#233;tournement des fonds, de
l'exploitation mais aussi de relations internationales fond&#233;es sur le seul
int&#233;r&#234;t. Pour inverser la tendance, il faut d&#233;sormais
accompagner les projets ou programmes de d&#233;veloppement par du lobbying
et de l'&#233;ducation au d&#233;veloppement. En parall&#232;le &#224; ce
r&#244;le d'avocat du tiers-monde, se d&#233;veloppe &#233;galement l'appui
&#224; des ONG du Sud qui vont de plus en plus &#234;tre reconnues comme
partenaires n&#233;cessaires pour s'attaquer aux causes de la pauvret&#233;.
<p>
<a name="nou"><h3>Une nouvelle remise en question</h3></a>
<p>
     Cette &#233;volution et le succ&#232;s qui en est issu n'est certes pas
sans poser de nouveaux d&#233;fis aux ONG aujourd'hui. 
<p>
     Frapp&#233;es par la r&#233;cession, engag&#233;es parfois dans une
concurrence financi&#232;re f&#233;roce, les ONG ont bien du mal &#224;
r&#233;sister &#224; l'afflux de fonds publics qui leur sont parfois
propos&#233;s. Ceci ne fait qu'accentuer des rapports de plus en plus
&#233;troits qu'elles maintiennent avec les organisations &#233;tatiques. Si
l'attention que leur accordent ces derni&#232;res peut sembler
b&#233;n&#233;fique, les ONG ne peuvent pour autant perdre de vue leur
identit&#233; non gouvernementale, leur autonomie et leur sp&#233;cificit&#233;,
ni se soustraire &#224; leur responsabilit&#233; &#224; l'&#233;gard tant de leur
base que des populations du Sud qu'elles soutiennent. Nombreuses sont en effet
celles qui se sentent menac&#233;es par des bailleurs de fonds et des
gouvernements qui aimeraient les utiliser &#224; leurs seuls desseins et exigent de
la sorte qu'elles se plient &#224; leurs normes et leurs priorit&#233;s (&#224; ce
titre, certains auteurs parlent d'une homog&#233;n&#233;isation accrue des
ONG). L'aide d'urgence, si elle constitue un cas particuliers, de par sa participation
plus que  jamais au coeur de la dynamique des conflits, confirme cette tendance. 
<p>
     De nombreux gouvernements se sont mis &#233;galement &#224; chasser
activement sur le propre terrain des ONG du Nord et cherchent des formules qui
leur permettent de traiter directement avec les ONG du Sud. La reconnaissance
accrue de ces derni&#232;res n'est pas sans interpeller s&#233;rieusement les
ONG du Nord m&#234;me si peu osent l'avouer. Ce fameux "partenariat" reste en
effet dans beaucoup de cas un rapport dominant/domin&#233;, le dominant
&#233;tant bien s&ucirc;r celui qui dispose des fonds et le domin&#233; celui qui
est plac&#233; sous tutelle. Pour mettre fin &#224; ce paternalisme, les ONG du
Nord ne peuvent se contenter de belles paroles et doivent travailler &#224;
appliquer un nouveau partenariat dans la r&#233;alit&#233; (tel &#233;tait
d'ailleurs un des th&#232;mes majeurs de la conf&#233;rence qui a suivi
l'Assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale des ONG au cours du mois d'avril). Une
n&#233;cessit&#233; &#224; cet &#233;gard est sans doute de soutenir leurs
coll&#232;gues du Sud dans le renforcement de leurs capacit&#233;s, homologues
du Sud qui r&#233;clament pour la plupart de l'argent plut&#244;t que de
l'ing&#233;rence.
<p>
     Un autre point de r&#233;flexion, un autre obstacle auquel doivent faire face
les ONG &#224; l'heure actuelle est la difficult&#233; qu'elles ont &#224;
travailler s&#233;rieusement ensemble, pourtant gage de l'extension de leur
r&#244;le dans le secteur du d&#233;veloppement. Comme le fait remarquer
Korten, il semble plus facile, malgr&#233; les critiques qu'elles peuvent leur
adresser, de collaborer avec les gouvernements que les unes avec les autres. Les
quelques coordinations r&#233;elles d'activit&#233;s se font essentiellement le
fait d'ONG de m&#234;me appartenance. Pourtant, une formulation commune de
strat&#233;gies &#224; moyen et &#224; long terme est primordiale pour un
meilleur d&#233;veloppement. 
<p>
     D'autres &#233;l&#233;ments peuvent entrer encore en ligne de compte
dans cette remise en question des ONG. C'est le cas notamment d'une
professionnalisation qui cherche ses marques ou encore d'une r&#233;colte de
fonds priv&#233;s qui n'est pas sans lever des interrogations. Les ONG, s'il est
d&#233;licat de parler de r&#233;elle crise d'identit&#233;, sont
incontestablement &#224; un tournant de leur histoire. Il s'agit pour elles de le
n&#233;gocier au nom de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile qu'elles disent
repr&#233;senter pour rester ce qu'elles ont d&#233;montr&#233; depuis des
d&#233;cennies: des structures exp&#233;riment&#233;es, comp&#233;tentes
et  efficaces pour combattre la pauvret&#233;.

<b>
Depuis une dizaine d'ann&#233;es, la g&#233;n&#233;rosit&#233; du public envers
les plus d&#233;munis est l'objet de bien des sollicitudes. La r&#233;colte de
fonds s'est pli&#233;e aux lois de la communication et du marketing et est
d&#233;sormais source de concurrence. Si la majorit&#233; des ONG la pratiquent
avec d&#233;ontologie, d'autres, &#224; trop s'y frotter, y ont d&#233;j&#224;
en partie noy&#233; leur &#226;me. Une d&#233;rive n&#233;gative pour tout le
milieu associatif mais &#233;galement pour le Sud.</b>
<p>
     Qui peut nier aujourd'hui ne jamais avoir &#233;t&#233; sollicit&#233; par
une ONG? Que cela soit en recevant un petit fascicule personnalis&#233; ou que
cela soit, au d&#233;tour d'une rue, par le sourire d'un boy-scout nous vantant
un objet symbolique. Et si ce n'est le cas, qui n'a jamais &#233;t&#233;
interpell&#233; par une organisation qui s'est affich&#233;e sur un mur ou via
un spot t&#233;l&#233;vis&#233;? La r&#233;colte de fonds propres pour toute ONG
soucieuse de son ind&#233;pendance est fondamentale; mais le temps des
qu&#234;tes traditionnelles est r&#233;volu. Il n'y a gu&#232;re plus qu'au
Royaume-Uni que les charities tendent encore une tirelire aux &#226;mes
g&#233;n&#233;reuses. Et quand bien m&#234;me, l&#224; comme ailleurs,
l'&#233;poque est &#224; la professionnalisation de la r&#233;colte de fonds.
Aussi, m&#234;me utiliser le terme "r&#233;colte de fonds" peut para&#238;tre
d&#233;suet &#224; une &#233;poque o&ugrave; l'on parle d&#233;sormais de
fundraising.
<p>
<a name="mar"><h3>Le marketing du don</h3></a>
<p>
     Si le succ&#232;s d'une r&#233;colte de fonds d&#233;pend en grande partie
de la notori&#233;t&#233; de l'organisation (ce qui ne rime pas toujours avec
efficacit&#233;), une bonne capacit&#233; de mobilisation est devenue
&#233;galement d&#233;terminante. M&#234;me si certaines ont
pr&#233;f&#233;r&#233; d&#233;l&#233;guer cette mission &#224; des agences
de marketing sp&#233;cialis&#233;es, beaucoup d'ONG ont d&ucirc; op&#233;rer
une restructuration de leur personnel caract&#233;ris&#233;e par une
professionnalisation en mati&#232;re de r&#233;colte de fonds. L'amateurisme n'est
plus de mise. Signe des temps ou dans un but de rivaliser avec les autres, elles ont
adopt&#233; les modes de gestion et de fonctionnement ainsi qu'un comportement
les apparentant aux entreprises, sans pour autant se transformer en pure
soci&#233;t&#233; commerciale. La r&#233;colte de fonds s'est donc pli&#233;e
aux lois de la communication et du marketing publicitaire. Le "marketing des valeurs"
a aujourd'hui ses manuels, ses s&#233;minaires, ses sp&#233;cialistes et ses
techniques. Ce sont les spots t&#233;l&#233;vis&#233;s, les campagnes
d'affichages qui regorgent parfois d'imagination, tous ces objets symboliques &#224;
l'effigie de l'organisation (stylo, module, t-shirts,...), et bien s&ucirc;r ce qui s'est
r&#233;v&#233;l&#233; &#234;tre le meilleur moyen pour recruter des donateurs
potentiels ou pour fid&#233;liser les donateurs r&#233;els: le direct mailing. 
<p>
     Pour beaucoup, le don est donc devenu un produit qu'il faut d&#233;fendre au
m&#234;me titre que tout autre produit commercial. Et comme tout produit
commercial, le don est source de concurrence. Cette concurrence n'est pas
n&#233;gative en soi puisque c'est l'essence-m&#234;me d'une r&#233;colte de
fonds. Il est cependant indubitable que toutes ne sont pas sur un pied
d'&#233;galit&#233;; la majorit&#233; des dons sont accapar&#233;s par les
quelques "grosses" ONG. Question de notori&#233;t&#233; bien s&ucirc;r mais
&#233;galement question de moyens financiers. Pour pouvoir se permettre un mailing,
une ONG doit y consacrer une partie de ses ressources. Or, un mailing co&ucirc;te
cher. "Pour un mailing de recrutement de nouveaux donateurs, il faut compter en
moyenne que seuls 50%, rarement plus, des fonds r&#233;colt&#233;s iront aux
projets de l'ONG, le reste couvrira les frais. En fid&#233;lisation, par contre, les frais
de mailing sont de l'ordre de 10 &#224; 20%" affirme Karel Claes, directeur de
l'agence Direct Social Communications. 
<p>
     Toute association ne peut se permettre un tel investissement, d'autant plus que
le nombre de donateurs potentiels n'est pas illimit&#233; (tous les professionnels
s'accordant en effet pour affirmer qu'il n'en existe en r&#233;alit&#233; qu'un vivier
bien d&#233;fini). Le fichier dont dispose l'association peut constituer d&#232;s lors
son v&#233;ritable fonds de commerce: "les meilleurs fichiers sont ceux dans lesquels
on retrouve le profil id&#233;al du donateur, soit, en Belgique, une personne
relativement &#226;g&#233;e, de sexe f&#233;minin et si possible de tendance
catholique". 
<p>
     Notori&#233;t&#233;, moyens financiers, ph&#233;nom&#232;ne de mode
aussi. Certaines associations correspondent plus aux pr&#233;occupations
imm&#233;diates du public &#224; une certaine p&#233;riode donn&#233;e (avec
l'aide des m&#233;dias). On peut remarquer cela avec les ONG qui d&#233;fendent
l'environnement; en terme de r&#233;colte de fonds priv&#233;s, ce type
d'association a connu une pouss&#233;e tr&#232;s forte mais semble
d&#233;j&#224; sur le d&#233;clin. Comme tout autre produit commercial, le don
a donc son propre cycle de vie. Certains pr&#233;tendent d'ailleurs que les prochaines
"victimes" seront les organisations d'urgence. Il est vrai qu'elles font une perc&#233;e
sur le march&#233; du don depuis quelques ann&#233;es. Mais l'adage est connu:
toutes les modes se d&#233;modent. 
<p>
     Les parts de march&#233; perdues par une ONG - pour rester dans le langage
commercial - ne sont pas pour autant r&#233;cup&#233;r&#233;es par d'autres. En
effet, si gr&#226;ce &#224; cette nouvelle approche de la r&#233;colte de fonds, les
dons priv&#233;s ont connu en une d&#233;cennie une augmentation spectaculaire
tant en nombre qu'en montant, la tendance s'inverse depuis deux ou trois ans, du
moins en ce qui concerne le nombre de donateurs (le montant total des dons reste
&#233;quilibr&#233;, la baisse de donations &#233;tant compens&#233;e par des
dons plus &#233;lev&#233;s). La raison est double. Il y a bien entendu le contexte
&#233;conomique actuel, le public ayant plus de mal &#224; sortir son portefeuille
en p&#233;riode de r&#233;cession. Une seconde raison tient elle &#224;
l'essoufflement, &#224; la lassitude du public face &#224; la prolif&#233;ration de
sollicitations engendr&#233;es non seulement par certaines ONG qui ont une
f&#226;cheuse tendance &#224; les multiplier au gr&#233; des nombreuses urgences
(c'est ce que les m&#233;dias anglophones ont appel&#233; aid fatigue) mais aussi
par le foisonnement d'ONG.
<p>
     Pour se faire une place aux yeux du public dans le flot de sollicitations, certaines
ONG n'h&#233;sitent pas &#224; se d&#233;mener en cr&#233;ativit&#233;. Mais
attention, danger! Car s'il existe bel et bien un march&#233; du don, celui-ci doit
demeurer encadr&#233; d'une r&#233;elle &#233;thique. La fin ne justifie pas
toujours les moyens et cette course &#224; la g&#233;n&#233;rosit&#233; a
entra&#238;n&#233; plus d'une fois des d&#233;rapages.
<p>
     Si certaines moeurs li&#233;es &#224; la r&#233;colte de fonds sont
douteuses, telles par exemple les ventes d'objets qui sont &#224; mille lieues de tout
symbolisme, d'autres par contre sont sources de s&#233;rieuses inqui&#233;tudes.
Le but est clair: rentabilit&#233;.
<p>
<a name="fin"><h3>La fin ne justifie pas toujours les moyens</h3></a>
<p>
     Une ONG qui pratique la r&#233;colte de fonds priv&#233;s se doit
d'&#234;tre honn&#234;te avec le public. Mais dans le m&#234;me temps, elle est
consciente de devoir lui pr&#233;senter ses actions de la mani&#232;re la plus
rentable possible en termes financiers. Et malheureusement, honn&#234;tet&#233;
ne rime pas toujours avec rentabilit&#233;. Diff&#233;rents &#233;l&#233;ments
peuvent intervenir. Il y a bien entendu l'action en elle-m&#234;me. Toute action n'est
pas "porteuse"; or, comme dit John Clark, "bien que tout le monde s'accorde avec
l'adage selon lequel il vaut mieux apprendre aux gens &#224; p&#234;cher que de
leur donner du poisson, quand il s'agit de donner de l'argent, le donateur priv&#233;
pr&#233;f&#232;re s'en tenir &#224; payer pour les poissons." Si la majorit&#233;
des ONG ont pr&#244;n&#233; sans le moindre atermoiement pour
l'int&#233;grit&#233;, d'autres, relativement rares il est vrai, ont choisi la voie de la
tergiversation. Celles-l&#224; n'h&#233;sitent pas &#224; pr&#233;senter une
dichotomie r&#233;elle entre leur action et l'image qui en est faite au public. 
<p>
     Par contre, bien plus nombreuses sont ces ONG qui masquent &#224; leurs
donateurs les frais issus de leur r&#233;colte de fonds. En France, les sommes
consacr&#233;es &#224; ce budget sont en moyenne de 18%, un rien plus qu'en
Belgique. Aux Pays-Bas, les frais entra&#238;n&#233;s par une r&#233;colte de
fonds peuvent atteindre 37%. Or, si on se penche sur les bilans des ONG (quand ceux-
ci sont publi&#233;s), certains d'entre eux t&#233;moignent en effet de chiffres dont
la sinc&#233;rit&#233; laisse &#224; d&#233;sirer, c'est le moins que l'on puisse
dire. Ainsi, que se cache-t-il sous ces 25% plac&#233;s sous les appellations "frais
divers" et autres "frais d'administration"? Ou encore, pourquoi assimiler r&#233;colte
de fonds et information? Bien s&ucirc;r, il y a la lettre du r&#233;viseur d'entreprise
appos&#233;e soigneusement au c&#244;t&#233; du bilan. Mais dans la plupart des
cas, celui-ci ne se prononce que sur la mat&#233;rialit&#233; de la gestion et non sur
l'utilisation qualitative des fonds. Cette attitude de l'ONG qui n'a pas le courage
d'informer le public qu'elle fait une activit&#233; valable mais qui entra&#238;ne des
frais est un manque &#233;vident de correction vis-&#224;-vis de ses donateurs. 
<p>
     Tant de d&#233;rapages qui nuisent &#224; l'image de marque du monde
associatif dans son ensemble et &#224; la r&#233;colte de fonds en particulier.
Agr&#233;ment&#233;e par les critiques des m&#233;dias (certaines ONG se sont
r&#233;v&#233;l&#233;es &#234;tre de parfaites escroqueries), dont certaines
&#233;missions t&#233;l&#233;vis&#233;es qui ne se sont pas donn&#233; la peine
de faire la part des choses, la m&#233;fiance du public &#224; l'&#233;gard des
ONG va grandissante. Or, dans le d&#233;bat actuel quant &#224; l'autonomie des
ONG, recueillir des fonds propres reste plus que jamais primordial. Aussi, les ONG ne
sont pas les seules &#224; souffrir des quelques vilains petits canards qu'elles
comptent en leur rang. Pour celles-l&#224;, les populations du Sud peuvent
&#233;galement &#234;tre des victimes toutes d&#233;sign&#233;es.
<p>
<a name="cha"><h3>"Charity show"</h3></a>
<p>
     Revenons dix ans en arri&#232;re. Pour le public, les ann&#233;es 80 dans
l'actualit&#233; du d&#233;veloppement - ou du tiers monde - c'est peut-&#234;tre
avant tout la terrible famine qui a frapp&#233; le Sahel; ce sont ces images d'enfants
au ventre creus&#233; par la faim, des mouches plein les yeux, sous le regard
d&#233;sempar&#233; de leur m&#232;re, qu'offre chaque soir la
t&#233;l&#233;vision. "Images pornographiques" vocif&#233;reront certains.
Pourtant, images que l'on re&#231;oit &#233;galement le matin dans sa bo&#238;te
aux lettres depuis que certaines ONG, par app&#226;t du gain, rivalisent de mauvais
go&ucirc;t. Tous les principes d'&#233;thique et de d&#233;ontologie, si toutefois
ces ONG en poss&#233;daient auparavant, furent enferm&#233;s au plus profond
d'un tiroir (certaines n'en ont d'ailleurs toujours pas retrouv&#233; la clef). C'est sans
conteste &#224; ce moment-l&#224; qu'est n&#233; ce que beaucoup ont
appel&#233; le "charity show". 
<p>
     L'utilisation de ces images mis&#233;rabilistes, n&#233;gatives, qui n'ont
comme seul but que de choquer les bonnes consciences, d'entra&#238;ner la
compassion du public et de d&#233;clencher le r&#233;flexe du don, ne s'est pas
pour autant arr&#234;t&#233;e avec l'essoufflement m&#233;diatique de la famine
sah&#233;lienne. Pour ces ONG peu scrupuleuses, toute situation tragique reste
bonne &#224; prendre. Pour preuve, une ONG dont la notori&#233;t&#233; n'est
cependant plus &#224; construire n'a pas h&#233;sit&#233; &#224; exp&#233;dier
un mailing avec la photo de la petite colombienne ensevelie vivante dans les
d&#233;combres d'Arm&#233;ro. Difficile d'aller plus loin! Pourtant, on pourrait citer
une flop&#233;e d'autres exemples. Aujourd'hui, cette tendance semble se tasser.
Mais dans le contexte actuel, un retour &#224; la compassion ne serait pas
&#233;tonnant.
<p>
     Bien entendu, certaines ONG d&#233;fendront leur cause en invoquant les
situations d'urgence. L'aide est n&#233;cessaire toute de suite et les fonds ne
peuvent attendre. Une image choc est donc excusable. D'ailleurs, ne d&#233;crit-elle
pas la r&#233;alit&#233;? Bien s&ucirc;r. Mais est-ce une excuse suffisante pour
porter atteinte &#224; la dignit&#233; humaine? Et quand bien m&#234;me, combien
sont-elles ces ONG qui travaillent avec l'urgence? Bien peu nombreuses en regard de
l'amas d'images mis&#233;rabilistes d&#233;vers&#233;es. 
<p>
     Une telle approche nuit au d&#233;veloppement. En confortant la vision d'une
population assist&#233;e et passive, l'utilisation de telles images,
accompagn&#233;es bien souvent par des textes tout aussi racoleurs ("si vous ne
donnez pas 100 francs tout de suite, cet enfant va crever de faim..."), porte
pr&#233;judice &#224; des populations du Sud qui s'efforcent de pr&#233;senter
une image contraire, c'est-&#224;-dire l'image de populations prenant en charge leur
propre d&#233;veloppement. Diff&#233;rents sondages men&#233;s aupr&#232;s
du public europ&#233;en attestent d'ailleurs cet &#233;tat de fait. Tous les efforts
de sensibilisation et d'&#233;ducation au d&#233;veloppement men&#233;s par les
ONG (parfois celles-l&#224; m&#234;mes qui utilisent ces images dans leur
r&#233;colte de fonds, ce qui n'est pas sans entra&#238;ner des tensions internes)
en sont contrecarr&#233;s.  
<p>
<a name="eti"><h3>L'&#233;thique pour seule finalit&#233;</h3></a>
<p>
     Pour restaurer une d&#233;ontologie dans le milieu associatif, c'est-&#224;-dire
obliger les perturbateurs &#224; revenir dans le droit chemin, diff&#233;rents codes
de conduite de la r&#233;colte de fonds ont &#233;t&#233; mis sur pied. Certains
r&#233;glementent l'utilisation des fichiers et la publication des comptes, d'autres
traitent des images et des messages; d'autres encore codifient l'ensemble de ces
diff&#233;rents th&#232;mes. Par ceux-ci, les associations signataires s'engagent
&#224; garantir tant la dignit&#233; des b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires que la vie
priv&#233;e des donateurs. Elles s'engagent en outre &#224; assurer le s&#233;rieux
de leurs activit&#233;s. Dans certains pays, tels que la France, les Pays-Bas ou
l'Allemagne, ce code de conduite est n&#233; dþune volont&#233; commune des
ONG. En Belgique, par contre, un tel code nþa toujours pas abouti car si cette initiative
&#233;tait n&#233;cessaire, elle reste source de nombreux d&#233;saccords. 
<p>
     Car toutes les ONG ne partagent pas une m&#234;me intention. Par exemple,
de nombreux reproches ont &#233;t&#233; adress&#233;s &#224; certaines ONG
(souvent les plus concern&#233;es par ces codes) qui n'y voyaient que leur
int&#233;r&#234;t personnel, c'est-&#224;-dire celui de s'octroyer de la sorte un
label de qualit&#233; quand elles restent bien loin d'une d&#233;ontologie
exemplaire. Les codes qu'elles proposent pr&#233;sentent effectivement un
degr&#233; d'&#233;thique qui p&#234;che par le bas; soit que certains
&#233;l&#233;ments soient relativement vagues, ce qui porte &#224; diverses
interpr&#233;tations, soit que certains &#233;l&#233;ments aient purement et
simplement &#233;t&#233; omis. Les ONG, plus nombreuses, exigeant, elles, des
r&#232;gles maximales et refusant d&#232;s lors d'y apposer leur signature, se
verraient de la sorte refuser le label! L'objectif d'un code de d&#233;ontologie est tout
sauf un instrument promotionnel.
<p>
     Un autre &#233;l&#233;ment de discorde est la n&#233;cessit&#233; ou non
d'un organe de contr&#244;le. Un code de conduite sans aspect contraignant n'a que
tr&#232;s peu de sens mais &#224; qui accorder cette t&#226;che? Cette question
a &#233;t&#233; tranch&#233;e cependant quelquefois puisque dans des pays
comme la France ou le Royaume-Uni (la fameuse Charity Commission), cette mission
est exerc&#233;e par un service de l'Etat alors que dans d'autres, tels la
Su&#232;de, les Pays-Bas, la Suisse ou l'Allemagne, ce sont des instituts ou
fondations ind&#233;pendantes qui s'en chargent.
<p>
     Tous les pays n'ont cependant pas encore leur r&#233;glementation en
mati&#232;re d'&#233;thique de la r&#233;colte de fonds. Cette absence est
compens&#233;e en partie par des initiatives &#224; plus large &#233;chelle. C'est
le cas notamment du code de conduite quant aux images et messages
&#233;labor&#233;es par le Comit&#233; de Liaison.
<p>
     Cela dit, la meilleure contrainte, finalement, demeure sans conteste un examen
de conscience. Pour celles qui n'ont rien &#224; se reprocher, celles pour qui la
r&#233;colte de fonds est un outil d'autonomie au service des
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires, la d&#233;ontologie passera toujours avant la
n&#233;cessit&#233; marketing. Pour les autres, par contre, le risque est
d&#233;sormais grand de perdre de vue leur mission premi&#232;re et d'y noyer
d&#233;finitivement leur &#226;me.

<P>
<B>Dans les coulisses de la r&#233;union annuelle des partenaires sociaux de l'UE et des ACP qui s'est tenue &#224; Bruxelles du 6 au 8 d&#233;cembre 1995, Le Courrier a rencontr&#233; deux figures phares du mouvement syndical africain, Hassan Sunmonu, secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral de l'Organisation de l'unit&#233; syndicale africaine (OATUU), et Andrew Kailembo, secr&#233;taire g&#233;n&#233;ral de la section africaine de la Conf&#233;d&#233;ration internationale des syndicats libres (CISL-AFRO), pour s'entretenir avec eux de l'&#233;volution du syndicalisme en Afrique.
</B>
<P>
Le vent du changement d&#233;mocratique qui souffle actuellement sur l'Afrique a ouvert la porte &#224; la r&#233;apparition du syndicalisme libre. On a cependant observ&#233; dans le m&#234;me temps une augmentation des violations des libert&#233;s des travailleurs et des droits syndicaux par les gouvernements. Il n'en reste pas moins que, si les ajustements structurels et la d&#233;valuation du franc CFA l'ont emp&#234;ch&#233; de tirer parti du pluralisme politique, le mouvement syndical a largement contribu&#233; &#224; pr&#233;cipiter la fin de plusieurs r&#233;gimes unipartites, notamment au Mali, en Zambie et au Malawi, non sans r&#233;percussions sur son propre pluralisme.
<P>
Elu leader de la CISL-AFRO (Nairobi) en 1993, Andrew Kailembo estime que certains gouvernements redoutent le r&#244;le que jouent les syndicats dans ce processus de d&#233;mocratisation, &#171; surtout lorsqu'ils se rendent compte qu'ils sont ind&#233;pendants, qu'ils collaborent avec une presse libre et qu'ils dialoguent avec la soci&#233;t&#233; civile &#187;. Sa conf&#233;d&#233;ration regroupe 44 syndicats dans 40 pays africains et rassemble quelque 27 millions d'affili&#233;s.
<P>
En mai 1995, Hassan Sunmonu a vu son mandat renouvel&#233; pour quatre ans &#224; la t&#234;te de l'OATUU, bas&#233;e &#224; Accra. Son organisation pr&#233;tend repr&#233;senter toutes les tendances syndicales africaines, y compris les non-align&#233;s. Il se dit convaincu que les syndicats ont une mission de premier plan &#224; exercer sur le continent africain: &#171; Nos gouvernements sont devenus intol&#233;rants &#224; notre &#233;gard lorsqu'ils ont compris que, dans plusieurs pays, le mouvement syndical aidait la soci&#233;t&#233; civile &#224; r&#233;clamer le r&#233;tablissement des droits d&#233;mocratiques car, jusqu'&#224; pr&#233;sent, ils croyaient que la lutte syndicale se limitait &#224; r&#233;clamer du pain pour le peuple. Or, tout &#234;tre humain est par d&#233;finition un animal politique et j'estime que nous avons le droit de dire ce que nous pensons de la fa&#231;on dont nous sommes dirig&#233;s. Les syndicats aiment rappeler qu'ils ont figur&#233; parmi les principaux artisans de la lutte contre le colonialisme et pour l'ind&#233;pendance. Aujourd'hui, l'heure est venue d'instaurer de v&#233;ritables d&#233;mocraties en Afrique. Et qui dit d&#233;mocratie dit libert&#233; et ind&#233;pendance des syndicats. &#187;
<P>
Les deux conf&#233;d&#233;rations s'attachent &#224; d&#233;noncer les violations des droits syndicaux et des libert&#233;s des travailleurs. M. Sunmonu commente ainsi sa fa&#231;on de proc&#233;der: &#171; Nous rencontrons les gouvernements pour leur exposer les dol&#233;ances de nos affili&#233;s et pour en d&#233;battre avec eux. Nous ne nous bornons donc pas &#224; les accuser de violations, nous essayons de leur faire comprendre notre point de vue. Certains pays sont parfois tr&#232;s embarrass&#233;s &#224; la lecture de notre rapport d'activit&#233;s... &#187;
<P>
M. Sunmonu et son homologue plaident tous deux en faveur d'un resserrement du dialogue avec le FMI et la Banque mondiale au sujet des programmes d'ajustement structurel. Ils craignent en effet qu'on n'y tienne pas suffisamment compte des desiderata des partenaires sociaux. Une &#233;tude publi&#233;e r&#233;cemment par la CISL - bas&#233;e &#224; Bruxelles, cette organisation regroupe 127 millions d'affili&#233;s de 124 pays, dont treize d'Afrique francophone -y fait d'ailleurs &#233;cho et affirme que les ajustements structurels ont retard&#233; la concr&#233;tisation des souhaits des syndicats en mati&#232;re de pluralisme et de progr&#232;s social.
<P>
Ce rapport renvoie directement &#224; celui de la Banque mondiale pour 1995, dans lequel on peut lire que &#171; les ajustements structurels ne vont pas sans poser un "r&#233;el d&#233;fi" &#187;. De son c&#244;t&#233;, la CISL recommande &#171; l'intervention sur les march&#233;s du travail afin de lever les pr&#233;jug&#233;s &#224; l'encontre des entreprises et des exploitations agricoles de taille r&#233;duite et informelles &#187;. Elle consid&#232;re que, &#171; pour am&#233;liorer la qualit&#233; des services offerts, il est crucial de r&#233;former le secteur public &#187; et lance un appel au &#171; d&#233;graissement simultan&#233; du personnel de la fonction publique et &#224; la cr&#233;ation d'une &#233;chelle des salaires de nature plus comp&#233;titive &#187;.
<P>
&#171; Les hommes politiques &#187;, lit-on &#233;galement dans ce rapport, &#171; ont de nouveau la tentation d'user de la r&#233;pression afin de stabiliser les tensions sociales et de faire accepter les conditions d'octroi de l'aide sans rencontrer la moindre opposition &#187;. En effet, l'existence d'une &#171; main-d'&#156;uvre docile &#187; attire les investissements &#233;trangers. La CISL annonce aussi un retour au sc&#233;nario des ann&#233;es soixante, l'&#233;poque o&#249;, dans leurs efforts de centralisation destin&#233;s &#224; atteindre les objectifs des premiers plans quinquennaux, les politiciens ont r&#233;duit pour la premi&#232;re fois &#224; n&#233;ant les structures pluralistes de l'Afrique francophone. Les syndicats avaient alors &#233;t&#233; aval&#233;s et les employeurs du secteur priv&#233; marginalis&#233;s, l'&#201;tat ayant pris le contr&#244;le presque absolu de toutes les relations industrielles.
<P>
Selon les termes du rapport de la CISL, &#171; le train des mesures d'ajustement structurel a quitt&#233; la gare il y a quelques ann&#233;es, avec les travailleurs et les syndicats &#224; son bord. La question &#224; l'ordre du jour n'est donc plus "&#192; quelle heure part-il?", mais plut&#244;t: "Dans quelle direction va-t-il?" Dans leur recherche de moyens pour restructurer la l&#233;gislation sur le travail et les relations industrielles afin de relancer la croissance &#233;conomique, les dirigeants politiques doivent satisfaire aux conditions que leur fixent les &#233;tablissements financiers internationaux. Les tensions latentes apparaissent au grand jour d&#232;s qu'il est question de promulguer de nouvelles lois sur l'emploi. S'ils exigent une plus grande flexibilit&#233; du travail et du temps de travail, les gouvernements se doivent d'imposer moins de restrictions dans des domaines tels que les contrats d'emploi, les proc&#233;dures d'embauche, l'inspection du travail, les licenciements pour motif &#233;conomique et le travail temporaire. &#187;
<P>
En 1994, la d&#233;valuation de 50 % du franc CFA a eu &#171; des r&#233;percussions profondes sur les salari&#233;s et a sap&#233; davantage la cr&#233;dibilit&#233; des syndicats &#187;. En l'absence d'une concertation pr&#233;alable, ceux-ci avaient &#233;t&#233; pris par surprise. Il y eut quelques gr&#232;ves de protestation et quelques manifestations au B&#233;nin, au Burkina Faso, au Gabon et au Niger. Les syndicats se sont &#233;galement mobilis&#233;s pour exiger des augmentations salariales de l'ordre de 35 % au Tchad, de 50 % au Burkina Faso, au Mali, au S&#233;n&#233;gal et au Togo et de 100 % au Gabon.
<P>
Alors qu'Andrew Kailembo &#233;voque la n&#233;cessit&#233; pour le FMI et la Banque mondiale de dialoguer avec les partenaires sociaux, Hassan Sunmonu d&#233;plore que la &#171; variante africaine &#187; aux ajustements structurels qui avait &#233;t&#233; avalis&#233;e par les nations africaines en 1989 n'ait jamais pu &#234;tre mise en &#156;uvre. &#171; La Banque mondiale n'agit pas dans le bon sens, tout simplement parce qu'elle n'a pas invit&#233; les partenaires sociaux &#224; la table des n&#233;gociations &#187;, confie-t-il. &#171; Il faut instaurer le dialogue social. Nous critiquons les interventions de la Banque mondiale dans des pays comme le Tchad et le S&#233;n&#233;gal parce qu'elle d&#233;p&#234;che aupr&#232;s de leurs gouvernements des mandataires qui les encouragent &#224; diluer ou &#224; abandonner leur l&#233;gislation sur l'emploi. Or, il s'agit l&#224; d'un domaine qui n'est pas du ressort de la Banque mondiale, mais de l'Organisation internationale du travail. &#187;
<P>
Cette ann&#233;e, la CISL a mis sur pied sept s&#233;minaires sur les ajustements structurels au Ghana, au Tchad, au S&#233;n&#233;gal, au Gabon et en Ouganda. Parmi les participants, on y a remarqu&#233; la pr&#233;sence de ministres des Finances et de l'&#201;conomie, de repr&#233;sentants de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile et de responsables de la Banque mondiale et du FMI.
<P>
&#171; Comment se fait-il &#187;, s'interroge M. Kailembo, &#171; que le gouvernement ougandais puisse annoncer qu'il envisage de licencier 10 000 personnes sans &#233;voquer au pr&#233;alable la question avec les partenaires sociaux? Tout est dans la mani&#232;re dont s'effectue ce d&#233;graissage. Il faut assurer une certaine s&#233;curit&#233; aux travailleurs cong&#233;di&#233;s, il faut qu'ils conservent un moyen de subsistance. On ne met pas au ch&#244;mage autant de personnes du jour au lendemain, sans quoi c'est l'anarchie. Il faut savoir qu'en Afrique, la s&#233;curit&#233; sociale est inexistante: pour chaque travailleur remerci&#233;, ce sont 10 &#224; 20 personnes qu'on prive de revenus! &#187; Il note cependant que le FMI et la Banque mondiale commencent &#224; tenir compte de ces probl&#232;mes.
<P>
De son c&#244;t&#233;, M. Sunmonu s'attache &#224; la variante africaine: &#171; L'ajustement structurel, qu'est-ce que cela signifie? Tr&#232;s certainement, des sacrifices. Mais le tout est de savoir comment r&#233;partir &#233;quitablement les r&#233;sultats de ces sacrifices. Or, que constate-t-on? Actuellement, seuls 2 % de la population r&#233;coltent 98 % de tous les avantages de cette politique - et ces 2 % ne se sont jamais priv&#233;s de rien... &#187;
<P>
Les deux conf&#233;d&#233;rations s'int&#233;ressent beaucoup aux programmes &#233;ducatifs de grande envergure, relatifs aux droits syndicaux et aux libert&#233;s des travailleurs ou &#224; l'int&#233;gration &#233;conomique en Afrique. L'OATUU met en &#156;uvre des programmes de formation des travailleurs &#224; la participation, &#224; la prise d'initiatives, &#224; la responsabilit&#233; des dirigeants, aux droits de l'homme, aux libert&#233;s syndicales, &#224; la croissance socio&#233;conomique et aux piliers du trait&#233; de la Communaut&#233; &#233;conomique africaine adopt&#233; en juillet 1990.
<P>
Pr&#244;nant le d&#233;veloppement des ressources humaines et des syndicats dans tous les pays, Hassan Sunmonu projette d'organiser un s&#233;minaire sous-r&#233;gional qui se cl&#244;turerait par un vaste rassemblement &#224; l'&#233;chelle du continent africain. L'OIT a promis de cofinancer trois r&#233;unions entre des leaders syndicaux, des d&#233;l&#233;gu&#233;s et des affili&#233;s, mais aussi des repr&#233;sentants d'organisations de femmes et du monde de l'enseignement et de la recherche au Nigeria, en Tanzanie et en Guin&#233;e. &#171; Nous exhortons &#233;galement les gouvernements africains &#224; faire preuve de la volont&#233; politique n&#233;cessaire &#224; l'int&#233;gration de leurs &#233;conomies par la cr&#233;ation de la Communaut&#233; &#233;conomique africaine &#187;.
<P>
L'OATUU nourrit &#233;galement l'ambition de se positionner comme un &#171; cr&#233;ateur d'emplois &#187;, notamment en investissant dans les petites et moyennes entreprises. C'est ainsi qu'en Tunisie, un de ses affili&#233;s est propri&#233;taire d'une compagnie d'assurances et qu'un autre g&#232;re un h&#244;tel. Au m&#234;me titre que la Chine, elle esp&#232;re pouvoir b&#233;n&#233;ficier du soutien du FED pour cr&#233;er un Coll&#232;ge africain du travail et pour constituer un nouveau secr&#233;tariat.
<P>
Les deux hommes estiment que l'Europe pourrait servir les droits des travailleurs africains en rendant les &#233;changes tributaires de leur respect. Elle pourrait ainsi prendre des sanctions chaque fois que ces droits sont viol&#233;s. En clair, ils &#233;voquent la fameuse &#171; clause sociale &#187; des accords commerciaux, tellement controvers&#233;e: &#171; Nous pensons que l'UE pourrait nous aider en sanctionnant les pays qui bafouent les droits syndicaux &#187;, d&#233;clare M. Kailembo.
<P>
Par ailleurs, Hassan Sunmonu pr&#233;voit des difficult&#233;s quant &#224; l'attribution des r&#244;les: qui sera l'accusateur? qui le juge? Il conviendrait selon lui de mettre en place une structure semblable &#224; celle de l'OIT. Chaque fois qu'un gouvernement violerait certaines libert&#233;s, il serait possible de porter plainte contre lui devant un comit&#233;, lequel trancherait l'affaire en s'appuyant sur les normes internationales. &#171; Nous voulons de la justice et de la transparence. Nous exigeons l'application des normes universelles dans des domaines tels que le travail des enfants. &#187;
<P>
&#192; l'issue de notre entretien, les deux secr&#233;taires g&#233;n&#233;raux parlent de l'avenir avec vivacit&#233; et rappellent les consid&#233;rations qui terminent l'&#233;tude de la CISL: &#171; L'Afrique se trouve au seuil d'une nouvelle &#232;re politique, &#233;conomique et sociale o&#249; les syndicats seront appel&#233;s &#224; jouer un r&#244;le semblable &#224; celui qu'ils ont tenu lors de la lutte pour l'ind&#233;pendance de leur pays. Pour relever ce d&#233;fi, il faut que leurs dirigeants soient anim&#233;s d'une vision nouvelle et que, d&#233;passant les contraintes du pass&#233;, les travailleurs fa&#231;onnent un syndicalisme innovateur et authentiquement africain. &#187;

Nous tenons beaucoup &#224; notre ind&#233;pendance:<br>rencontre avec Michael

<i>Les "acteurs" engag&#233;s dans le processus de d&#233;veloppement du tiers monde sont
nombreux: gouvernements, institutions multilat&#233;rales, agences bilat&#233;rales, entreprises
priv&#233;es et, bien entendu, "organisations non gouvernementales" ou ONG - terme couvrant un
large &#233;ventail d'organismes aux activit&#233;s multiples et vari&#233;es. Nous consacrons
notre Dossier &#224; l'&#233;tude de certaines de ces activit&#233;s ainsi qu'au r&ocirc;le plus
large que peuvent jouer les ONG dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
Notre premier interlocuteur a &#233;t&#233; Michael Aaronson, Directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral du
Save the Children, importante ONG d'origine britannique. Dipl&ocirc;m&#233; d'Oxford, M.
Aaronson a commenc&#233; sa carri&#232;re par deux ann&#233;es au Nig&#233;ria en
qualit&#233; de coop&#233;rant pour Save the Children. C'est l&#224;, dit-il, qu'il a
"attrap&#233; le virus de l'Afrique". Il fut ensuite diplomate britannique pendant 16 ans avant de
revenir travailler pour Save the Children, il y a sept ans, en tant que responsable de la supervision
des op&#233;rations &#224; l'&#233;tranger. Il a &#233;t&#233; nomm&#233; Directeur
g&#233;n&#233;ral le 1er mai dernier. Nous lui avons tout d'abord demand&#233; de d&#233;crire
le r&ocirc;le sp&#233;cifique de Save the Children avant d'&#233;voquer celui des ONG du Nord
de mani&#232;re plus g&#233;n&#233;rale.</i>
<p>

-     Nous assumons plusieurs r&ocirc;les. Je pense que la premi&#232;re justification de notre
pr&#233;sence dans un pays &#233;tranger est la conviction de pouvoir y apporter une contribution
significative, une valeur ajout&#233;e en venant suppl&#233;er aux aptitudes, aux capacit&#233;s
et aux ressources locales. En d'autres termes, en apportant ou en r&#233;alisant quelque chose qui
ne peut &ecirc;tre acquis ou fait sur place. Nous avons par ailleurs un r&ocirc;le croissant &#224;
jouer dans nos propres pays du Nord, et dans l'Union europ&#233;enne en particulier, en tant que
d&#233;fenseurs de la cause du Sud. Nous sommes les avocats du processus de
d&#233;veloppement, et du d&#233;veloppement humain surtout, puisque tel est l'objectif ultime.
Notre exp&#233;rience en mati&#232;re de projets de d&#233;veloppement dans le Sud doit nous
permettre de parler avec autorit&#233; et d'exercer une certaine influence sur les grandes
institutions du Nord. Il s'agit &#233;videmment, dans notre cas, du Gouvernement britannique et
de la Commission europ&#233;enne en particulier. Nous tenons &#233;galement beaucoup &#224;
notre ind&#233;pendance. Nous ne sommes les ex&#233;cutants de la politique de personne, sauf
lorsqu'il y a convergence d'int&#233;r&ecirc;ts mutuels. Bref, notre premi&#232;re mission est
d'&ecirc;tre pr&#233;sents pour r&#233;pondre &#224; des besoins; mais nous consid&#233;rons
que notre exp&#233;rience doit servir &#224; influencer l'&#233;laboration des politiques en la
mati&#232;re.
<p>
<i>Vous semble-t-il difficile d'assumer ce double r&ocirc;le, &#224; savoir l'apport d'une aide
au d&#233;veloppement et des activit&#233;s de lobby?</i>
<p>
-     Non, je ne pense pas qu'il y ait de conflits d'int&#233;r&ecirc;ts. Je n'aime pas beaucoup
le terme de lobby, je pr&#233;f&#232;re parler de valorisation de notre exp&#233;rience; mais je
ne consid&#232;re en tous cas pas qu'il s'agisse d'une activit&#233; distincte. A condition qu'elle
s'appuie sur notre exp&#233;rience de terrain, je ne pense pas qu'il y ait de contradiction.
Apr&#232;s tout, si la Commission europ&#233;enne, par exemple, finance une ONG comme Save
the Children pour mener un programme de d&#233;veloppement quelque part en Afrique, il est
normal qu'elle souhaite que son action soit la plus efficace possible. Si l'exp&#233;rience nous
conduit &#224; penser que les conditions impos&#233;es par le donateur nous rendent la
t&#226;che plus difficile, je pense qu'il est de l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t du donateur comme du
n&ocirc;tre de les assouplir.
<p>
Nous avons largement particip&#233;, conjointement &#224; d'autres ONG europ&#233;ennes,
&#224; l'examen des conditions g&#233;n&#233;rales de cofinancement avec la Commission. Un
processus de r&#233;vision a &#233;t&#233; entam&#233;, comme vous le savez, mais j'estime
pour ma part qu'il dure depuis beaucoup trop longtemps. Sur le plan de l'aide humanitaire, Save the
Children s'est &#233;galement montr&#233; tr&#232;s actif via son bureau de liaison &#224;
Bruxelles. Nous avons &#233;t&#233; l'un des premiers organismes &#224; signer un accord cadre
de partenariat avec ECHO (Office humanitaire de la Communaut&#233; europ&#233;enne). Nous
participons aux efforts actuels de r&#233;vision de l'accord cadre, car nous avons aussi le
sentiment qu'un certain nombre de dispositions nous emp&ecirc;chent d'effectuer efficacement
notre t&#226;che, et de donner satisfaction &#224; la Commission. Nous nous associons donc
&#224; d'autres pour faire du "lobby" en vue d'une modification de ces dispositions.
<p>
<i>On comprend assez ais&#233;ment pourquoi des instances "publiques" telles que la
Commission ou des organismes nationaux demandent aux ONG d'effectuer certaines missions car
elles sont en mesure "d'aller l&#224; o&ugrave; d'autres n'arrivent pas". Mais n'y a-t-il pas un
risque pour votre organisation d'&ecirc;tre int&#233;gr&#233;e au syst&#232;me? Vous tenez
certainement &#224; maintenir votre activit&#233; et l'emploi de votre personnel. A partir du
moment o&ugrave; cet objectif exige davantage de cofinancement, l'argent des contribuables
devenant une source majeure de revenus, ne craignez-vous pas de compromettre votre
ind&#233;pendance?</i>
<p>
-     Ce danger existe incontestablement et il est important que les ONG en soient conscientes
pour l'&#233;viter. Il est parfaitement l&#233;gitime pour une instance publique charg&#233;e de
mettre en oeuvre une action particuli&#232;re, de se tourner vers d'autres, et notamment vers des
ONG, pour r&#233;aliser cet objectif. Nous devons faire preuve de r&#233;alisme dans ce domaine
et nous souvenir d'o&ugrave; viennent les autorit&#233;s publiques. Mais je pense que nous
attendons &#233;galement de leur part une perception sophistiqu&#233;e de notre r&ocirc;le. Nous
avons de plus en plus souvent le sentiment que certaines autorit&#233;s en ont une perception
simpliste et nous consid&#232;rent presque comme des sous-traitants. Cette tendance est
perceptible dans certains services de la Commission, qui ne comprennent pas que nous sommes des
organisations ind&#233;pendantes ayant notre propre mission et notre propre mandat, de
m&ecirc;me d'ailleurs que nos propres mandants et responsabilit&#233;s vis-&#224;-vis de ceux
pour qui nous travaillons dans le monde en d&#233;veloppement et de ceux qui soutiennent notre
action dans notre pays d'origine. Il est &#233;videmment r&#233;jouissant que l'UE, par exemple,
souhaite nous aider &#224; r&#233;aliser nos objectifs mais elle doit bien comprendre notre
position de d&#233;part. Il est essentiel pour nous de la d&#233;fendre, faute de quoi nous
pourrions conna&icirc;tre une distorsion de nos efforts. Je ne crois pas qu'il doive y avoir
confrontation; je crois simplement que les diff&#233;rentes parties doivent chercher &#224; mieux
se comprendre.
<p>
Save the Children b&#233;n&#233;ficie d'un financement important de la part de sources
gouvernementales et europ&#233;ennes. Le volume de nos transactions annuelles est de l'ordre de
100 millions de livres Sterling (120 millions d'&#233;cus), dont la moiti&#233; provient de
subventions d'organismes officiels. Mais l'autre moiti&#233; provient de souscriptions priv&#233;es
volontaires, et c'est tr&#232;s important. Cela prouve en effet que m&ecirc;me si notre
activit&#233; est largement financ&#233;e par des subventions, nous disposons aussi d'une large
base b&#233;n&#233;vole de mobilisation de fonds. C'est d'ailleurs cette base qui nous permet
d'obtenir l'argent des donateurs institutionnels. Nous ne sommes pas tenus de prendre l'argent
parce que, sans lui, nous ne pourrions effectuer notre t&#226;che. Nous savons tr&#232;s
pr&#233;cis&#233;ment ce que nous voulons faire. Si les gens veulent nous financer pour cette
t&#226;che, tant mieux - ils sont contents et nous aussi. En d'autres termes, l'essentiel est d'avoir
sa propre base de financement, forte et ind&#233;pendante.
<p>
<i>Etes-vous satisfait de la relation avec l'UE et du fonctionnement du Comit&#233; de liaison
avec les ONG?</i>
<p>
-     Je ne suis membre du Comit&#233; que depuis un an mais mon exp&#233;rience de
repr&#233;sentant britannique me fait penser que certains services de la Commission - &#224;
savoir ceux qui travaillent r&#233;guli&#232;rement avec des ONG - souhaitent am&#233;liorer
ce partenariat. D'autres services, qui collaborent depuis moins longtemps avec les ONG, ont encore
- &#224; mon avis - beaucoup &#224; apprendre &#224; notre propos. Il est &#233;vident que
les fonctionnaires de l'unit&#233; ONG de la DG VIII (Direction g&#233;n&#233;rale
D&#233;veloppement) ont une vaste exp&#233;rience et une bonne connaissance du r&ocirc;le des
ONG. Mais il faut imp&#233;rativement que l'on comprenne mieux, ailleurs &#224; la Commission,
ce que nous sommes et le r&ocirc;le que nous pouvons jouer.
<p>
<i>On peut lire dans le hall de votre immeuble une citation de Sir Philip Gibbs, qui a
d&#233;clar&#233; juste apr&#232;s la fin de la Premi&#232;re guerre mondiale: "Le vernis de
mat&#233;rialisme et de cynisme qui durcit aujourd'hui l'Europe cache un id&#233;alisme ardent
et g&#233;n&#233;reux dont la pouss&#233;e fera bient&ocirc;t craquer ce vernis pour
&#233;clater au grand jour". Soixante-quinze ans plus tard, notre monde semble encore largement,
voire de plus en plus, sous l'emprise du mat&#233;rialisme et du cynisme. Etant donn&#233; votre
large base de souscripteurs individuels, ne craignez-vous pas un ph&#233;nom&#232;ne de
"lassitude de l'aide"?</i>

<p>

-     Cette tendance est effectivement pr&#233;occupante. Plusieurs facteurs la sous-tendent:
la r&#233;cession internationale, certainement, et le fait que la vie devient plus difficile pour tout
le monde; mais &#233;galement, &#224; mon avis, les bouleversements politiques li&#233;s
&#224; la fin de la guerre froide et qui ont engendr&#233; toutes sortes d'&#233;v&#232;nements
d&#233;primants et d&#233;stabilisants. L'image du tiers monde devient globalement de moins en
moins positive. Les espoirs irr&#233;alistes de ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es, brutalement
an&#233;antis, sont un autre facteur dont il faut tenir compte. Personne ne parle plus du Nouvel
Ordre Mondial alors que, assez r&#233;cemment encore, tout le monde en parlait. C'est ce qui a
conduit les Am&#233;ricains &#224; leur intervention catastrophique en Somalie. C'est le type
d'id&#233;alisme que l'on trouvait dans "l'Agenda pour la Paix" de Boutros Boutros Ghali, dont il
reconna&icirc;t lui-m&ecirc;me aujourd'hui, de mani&#232;re quasiment officielle, qu'il manquait
de r&#233;alisme. C'est ce sentiment qui a conduit le Conseil de S&#233;curit&#233; des NU
&#224; des engagements plut&ocirc;t imprudents en Afrique, dont les rapports n&#233;gatifs
tendent &#224; &ecirc;tre d&#233;courageants. 
<p>
Ce que nous avons vu en Somalie et ailleurs complique certainement la t&#226;che pour des
organisations comme la n&ocirc;tre. Cette situation doit certainement causer certains
probl&#232;mes &#224; l'UE &#233;galement, en tant que donateur, pour justifier son action
devant ses propres mandats.
<p>
Je ne crois pas que je parlerais de "lassitude de l'aide" pour autant. Je ne pense pas que l'opinion
publique soit moins touch&#233;e ou que la compassion tende &#224; dispara&icirc;tre. Je crois
plut&ocirc;t que l'on assiste &#224; une &#233;norme confusion quant aux solutions &#224;
adopter. Les gens pensaient que les choses seraient beaucoup plus faciles - c'est ce qu'on leur avait
dit - mais la r&#233;alit&#233; s'est av&#233;r&#233;e tr&#232;s diff&#233;rente.
<p>
<i>En ce qui concerne cette "lassitude de l'aide" parmi les donateurs officiels, on dit que le
Congr&#232;s am&#233;ricain cherche &#224; r&#233;duire un budget d'aide d&#233;j&#224;
modeste. L'Union europ&#233;enne rencontre, dans le m&ecirc;me temps, un probl&#232;me de
financement pour la seconde partie de Lom&#233; IV. Ce type de situation vous
pr&#233;occupe-t-il?</i>
<p>
-     Oui. Nous avons tous les yeux braqu&#233;s sur le Capitole. Nous sommes
&#233;galement inquiets des &#233;volutions au sein de l'UE en ce qui concerne la seconde partie
de Lom&#233; IV et plus particuli&#232;rement encore, je l'avoue, en ce qui concerne la position
minimaliste prise par le gouvernement britannique. Celui-ci semble vouloir accuser l'Europe de la
diminution de ses propres programmes bilat&#233;raux et instaurer une sorte de rivalit&#233; entre
les deux.
<p>
<i>Le gouvernement britannique affirme vouloir &#233;tendre ses programmes
bilat&#233;raux. Y croyez-vous?</i>
<p>
-     Je crois franchement que c'est une manoeuvre de diversion. L'enjeu r&#233;el r&#233;side
dans les priorit&#233;s politiques de l'Europe. Il semble qu'une priorit&#233; accrue soit
accord&#233;e aux relations avec les pays de l'Est et de la M&#233;diterran&#233;e, et elle ne
peut s'op&#233;rer qu'aux d&#233;pens des relations avec le Sud. Il faut &#224; tous prix soutenir
le processus de transition en Europe de l'Est et dans l'ex-Union sovi&#233;tique. C'est tr&#232;s
important. Nous devrions &#233;galement nous pencher sur les probl&#232;mes des pays
m&#233;diterran&#233;ens. Mais certainement pas au d&#233;triment du monde en
d&#233;veloppement. En termes absolus, le niveau de pauvret&#233; et de souffrance y
d&#233;passe encore tout ce qu'on peut voir dans des pays plus proches. La compression de l'aide
&#224; l'Afrique semble donc la cons&#233;quence directe de l'absence de fonds
suppl&#233;mentaires. Toute la question est l&#224;. Et toute discussion quant au fait de savoir
si un programme bilat&#233;ral vaut mieux qu'un programme europ&#233;en ne vise qu'&#224;
dissimuler le vrai probl&#232;me - et s'appuie sur un sentiment nationaliste qui fait qu'en
Grande-Bretagne, tout coup port&#233; &#224; l'Europe est applaudi. Je suis &#233;coeur&#233;
de voir &#224; quel point la politique britannique ignore d&#233;lib&#233;r&#233;ment les
avantages que ce pays pourrait tirer d'une collaboration avec ses partenaires europ&#233;ens en
tentant de faire mieux tous ensemble que chacun dans son coin. Le d&#233;bat ne se situe jamais
&#224; ce niveau; il est men&#233; en termes exclusivement n&#233;gatifs sur le point de savoir
ce que nous allons devoir "l&#226;cher", et je trouve cela particuli&#232;rement attristant.
<p>
Il est r&#233;confortant de constater que les Britanniques ont une bien meilleure r&#233;putation
en Europe en ce qui concerne les ONG. En tant que repr&#233;sentant des ONG britanniques, je
note que notre travail est hautement appr&#233;ci&#233; et tr&#232;s bien accueilli par nos
coll&#232;gues europ&#233;ens. Cette situation s'explique du fait que nous sommes tous
conditionn&#233;s &#224; penser en termes de "comment faire mieux en collaborant?" Cette
approche fait partie int&#233;grante de la culture et de l'&#233;thique  des ONG, et je pense
qu'elle constitue un contraste tr&#232;s net avec l'attitude n&#233;gative, &#233;go&iuml;ste,
born&#233;e et d&#233;primante des politiciens de ce pays - et j'ajoute "des politiciens de tous
bords". Nous avons manifestement ici un probl&#232;me d'esprit de clocher (britannique)...
<p>
<i>Des organisations tr&#232;s diverses semblent se multiplier sous l'&#233;tiquette
tr&#232;s large d'ONG. Et d&#232;s qu'une crise survient - au Rwanda, par exemple - elles s'y
pr&#233;cipitent toutes en provoquant des probl&#232;mes de coordination (et autres). Que
penses-vous de ce ph&#233;nom&#232;ne?</i>
<p>
-     Les ONG &#233;tablies depuis longtemps et que je qualifierais de professionnelles (en
esp&#233;rant pouvoir consid&#233;rer que nous en faisons partie) s'inqui&#232;tent beaucoup
de cette prolif&#233;ration r&#233;cente. Le Rwanda fournit un exemple frappant &#224; cet
&#233;gard puisque l'on a compt&#233; 130 organisations travaillant dans les camps de
r&#233;fugi&#233;s au Za&iuml;re et une centaine d'autres t&#226;chant de prendre pied au
Rwanda m&ecirc;me. Beaucoup d'entre elles &#233;taient franchement sous-&#233;quip&#233;es.
Elles ne pouvaient apporter de contribution majeure et semblaient &ecirc;tre uniquement venues pour
leur image et la mobilisation de fonds. Elles ne manifestaient en tous cas aucun d&#233;sir de
participer &#224; une action concert&#233;e. Aussi, ceux d'entre nous qui repr&#233;sentent le
point de vue britannique au Comit&#233; de Liaison CE-ONG sont-ils fermement
d&#233;cid&#233;s &#224; d&#233;battre de cette question en mettant cartes sur table. En tant
que communaut&#233; d'ONG, nous devons peu &#224; peu imposer nos propres normes en
&#233;laborant, par exemple, des codes de conduite. C'est la r&#233;putation des ONG qui est
en jeu, et je pense qu'il nous appartient d'y veiller.
<p>
<i>Et les ONG du Sud? Leur &#233;mergence fait-elle partie int&#233;grante, selon vous, du
processus de d&#233;veloppement?</i>
<p>
"Nous devons veiller &#224; ne pas imposer nos propres mod&#232;les de soci&#233;t&#233;
civile aux pays du Sud"
<p>
-     Cet aspect de notre travail est tr&#232;s important m&ecirc;me s'il tient un peu de la
marotte depuis quelque temps. Il ne faut absolument pas perdre de vue, par ailleurs, les dangers que
cette &#233;volution comporte: nous devons absolument veiller &#224; ne pas imposer nos
mod&#232;les ext&#233;rieurs de soci&#233;t&#233; civile aux pays du Sud. En ce qui concerne
Save the Children, par exemple, il me semblerait totalement inad&#233;quat de commencer &#224;
ouvrir des petits bureaux locaux en Afrique. Mais c'est aux populations des pays en
d&#233;veloppement qu'il appartient de d&#233;cider du type d'ONG qu'elles souhaitent voir se
mettre en place dans leur soci&#233;t&#233; civile. Il ne nous appartient pas, &#224; nous,
d'imposer une cadence ou un mod&#232;le. Nous ne devons jamais oublier que les ONG ne
constituent qu'une petite partie du large &#233;ventail de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile. Les gens
ont tendance &#224; parler des ONG sans discernement, en ne faisant aucune distinction entre les
ONG locales et les organisations bas&#233;es sur les communaut&#233;s. Or ces derni&#232;res
sont davantage repr&#233;sentatives des communaut&#233;s. Les ONG tendent &#224;
repr&#233;senter l'&#233;lite, les philanthrope ou autres. Il ne faut certainement pas le regretter
- c'est d'ailleurs ainsi qu'est n&#233; Save the Children - mais le d&#233;veloppement d'une
soci&#233;t&#233; civile est extr&ecirc;mement important.  Les ONG locales ont un r&ocirc;le
&#224; jouer &#224; cet &#233;gard et nous, en tant qu'&#233;trangers, devons tenir compte
du contexte local et ne pas nous laisser s&#233;duire par les derni&#232;res modes.
<p>
<i>L'accent semble se mettre davantage sur les activit&#233;s humanitaires que sur l'aide
traditionnelle au d&#233;veloppement. Cette tendance se manifeste-t-elle &#233;galement au sein
de votre organisation?</i>
<p>
-     Il est &#233;vident que cette &#233;volution nous pr&#233;occupe beaucoup et qu'elle
nous ram&#232;ne &#224; l'une de vos pr&#233;c&#233;dentes questions. L'enjeu actuel semble
&ecirc;tre l'ampleur de l'engagement du Nord &#224; l'&#233;gard du d&#233;veloppement
&#224; long terme dans le Sud. On constate un certain d&#233;senchantement qui se traduit par
une attitude beaucoup plus ferme en mati&#232;re de conditionalit&#233;, ainsi que par un
sentiment de devoir aller l&#224; o&ugrave; la souffrance est immense mais, surtout, l&#224;
o&ugrave; se trouve la t&#233;l&#233;vision. Si nous n'agissions pas, nous aurions une mauvaise
image aupr&#232;s de nos mandants. Mais, pratiquement, cela signifie que d'importantes
ressources qui auraient pu servir au d&#233;veloppement sont d&#233;sormais affect&#233;es
&#224; l'aide humanitaire. Il ne s'agit d'ailleurs pas d'aide "humanitaire" au sens strict mais  d'une
aide d'urgence largement politis&#233;e.
<p>
<i>Ne pourriez-vous accorder un certain cr&#233;dit &#224; cette approche dans la mesure
o&ugrave;, apr&#232;s 30 ann&#233;es d'efforts, les r&#233;sultats de l'aide au
d&#233;veloppement ne sont pas franchement convaincants?</i>
<p>
-     Je vous r&#233;pondrai en disant "A qui la faute?" Avons-nous r&#233;ellement le droit
de p&#233;naliser les Africains? Peut-&ecirc;tre devrions-nous plut&ocirc;t faire le bilan de nos
propres pratiques et nous demander si nous avons adopt&#233; la bonne approche. Il est
&#233;vident que des erreurs ont &#233;t&#233; commises de part et d'autre. L'Afrique s'est fait
&#233;norm&#233;ment de tort en admettant la mauvaise gestion de certains Etats, la corruption,
la guerre civile, etc. mais je pense que nous n'avons pas le droit de juger &#224; distance en
ignorant le contexte historique et contemportain de ce continent. L'excuse est trop facile.
Permettez-moi de vous citer un exemple r&#233;cent qui me para&icirc;t caract&#233;ristique:
apr&#232;s le massacre de Kibeho au Rwanda, la Commission a annonc&#233; la suspension de
toute aide via le gouvernement de Kigali. Je pense que cette d&#233;claration est plus
r&#233;v&#233;latrice d'un sentiment de carence en Europe que d'une prise de position face aux
&#233;v&#232;nements au Rwanda. Je pense qu'elle atteste de la culpabilit&#233; de l'Europe
de ne pas avoir agi au Rwanda autrement que de mani&#232;re superficielle. Il n'y a pas eu de
v&#233;ritable engagement dans le processus de r&#233;conciliation, de justice, de
r&#233;habilitation et de reconstruction. Il n'y a eu qu'une avalanche d'argent
d&#233;vers&#233;e dans des camps intenables de r&#233;fugi&#233;s le long des
fronti&#232;res.
<p>
Vous m'avez &#233;galement demand&#233; si cette situation a pos&#233; des probl&#232;mes
&#224; Save the Children. L'un de nos objectifs est la poursuite de l'aide d'urgence mais dans un
contexte de d&#233;veloppement &#224; long terme. En d'autres termes, nous ne souhaitons pas
devenir l'&#233;quipe volante de l'aide humanitaire. Notre engagement porte sur le
d&#233;veloppement &#224; longue &#233;ch&#233;ance. Il va de soi que nous tentons
&#233;galement d'apporter des secours lorsque la vie ou le bien-&ecirc;tre des enfants est
menac&#233; - mais nous inscrivons toujours ces actions dans une perspective de long terme et
nous ne nous &#233;cartons jamais de nos propres objectifs.
<p>
<i>Permettez-moi d'&#233;largir ce d&#233;bat en vous demandant votre avis sur l'ajustement
structurel. Certains placent de grands espoirs dans ce processus - qu'ils vont parfois jusqu'&#224;
consid&#233;rer comme une v&#233;ritable panac&#233;e en vue d'un d&#233;veloppement
durable. Etes-vous d'accord avec cette analyse ou son fondement vous semble-t-il
pr&#233;caire?</i>
<p>
-     Je crois qu'il n'existe aucune panac&#233;e en mati&#232;re de d&#233;veloppement, et
certainement aucune panac&#233;e &#233;conomique. Je pense que toute l'approche de
l'ajustement structurel atteste d'une fixation d&#233;plac&#233;e sur certains mod&#232;les
&#233;conomiques et d'une vision selon laquelle le d&#233;veloppement concerne
l'&#233;conomie - alors qu'il concerne les gens. La croissance &#233;conomique est un moyen de
r&#233;aliser cet objectif, mais elle n'est pas un objectif en soi. Bien pens&#233;e, elle permet
d'augmenter la richesse et, ce qui est plus important encore, le bien-&ecirc;tre parmi les habitants
de ce monde. Il existe probablement, au niveau macro-&#233;conomique, des arguments
parfaitement valables en faveur de l'ajustement structurel - fussent-ils parfois contest&#233;s - mais
il est manifeste qu'au niveau du commun des mortels, en Afrique plus particuli&#232;rement, les
politiques d'ajustement ont engendr&#233; des souffrances et des &#233;preuves
suppl&#233;mentaires. Sans aucune garantie que les gains &#233;conomiques r&#233;alis&#233;s
gr&#226;ce &#224; cet ajustement b&#233;n&#233;ficieront &#224; l'ensemble de la population.
Certains cas sont tristement r&#233;v&#233;lateurs &#224; cet &#233;gard. Ce qui s'est
pass&#233; dans le cadre des services sanitaires au Zimbabwe suite &#224; l'ajustement structurel
n'est qu'un exemple parmi d'autres. J'estime que le d&#233;veloppement est trop important pour
&#234;tre confi&#233; aux &#233;conomistes.
<p>
<i>Le processus de d&#233;mocratisation est un autre bouleversement qui appara&icirc;t,
&#224; premi&#232;re vue, tr&#232;s encourageant. Cette &#233;volution a-t-elle facilit&#233;
pour vous, op&#233;rant pour le compte d'une ONG, les transactions avec les administrations
locales?</i>
<p>
-     Il se passe beaucoup de choses encourageantes en Afrique mais je pense qu'une
organisation comme Save the Children aura toujours une perspective diff&#233;rente dans ce
contexte. M&ecirc;me dans les pays qui ont le plus souffert de r&#233;gimes non
d&#233;mocratiques, nous sommes toujours parvenus &#224; trouver des gens avec lesquels
collaborer, des gens d&#233;cid&#233;s &#224; am&#233;liorer les conditions de vie des enfants.
Je pense, par exemple, &#224; l'Ethiopie au temps de Mengistu. Nous y avons travaill&#233; sans
probl&#232;me pendant des ann&#233;es et n'avons fait aucun compromis avec les
autorit&#233;s.
<p>
"Les enfants sont des acteurs sociaux &#224; part enti&#232;re"
<p>
Elles &#233;taient suffisamment intelligentes, quels qu'aient &#233;t&#233; leurs travers par
ailleurs, pour savoir qu'elles avaient besoin de nous; elles acceptaient donc de nous laisser travailler
&#224; notre propre id&#233;e. Il va de soi que nous entretenons une meilleure relation, plus
&#233;troite et en d&#233;finitive plus productive, avec le nouveau r&#233;gime &#233;thiopien
car le syst&#232;me d&#233;mocratique a ouvert toute une s&#233;rie de possibilit&#233;s qui
n'existaient pas auparavant. Je veux dire, en essayant de ne pas para&icirc;tre pr&#233;tentieux,
que des organisations telles que la n&ocirc;tre parviennent &#224; aller o&ugrave; d'autres
n'arrivent pas - comme vous l'avez dit vous-m&ecirc;me. Cela nous fait voir les pays dans lesquels
nous travaillons dans une perspective diff&#233;rente.
<p>
<i>Que pensez-vous de l'affirmation selon laquelle il ne peut y avoir de d&#233;veloppement
sans d&#233;mocratie? Certains affirment le contraire, &#224; savoir que la mise en place d'un
syst&#232;me d&#233;mocratique freine le d&#233;marrage &#233;conomique en raison d'une
concurrence entre les int&#233;r&ecirc;ts en jeu.</i>
<p>
-     Je serais certainement d'accord pour dire qu'il ne peut y avoir de d&#233;veloppement sans
respect des droits de l'homme. Mais cette affirmation est quelque peu diff&#233;rente. Le
probl&#232;me, lorsque l'on parle de d&#233;mocratie, est le fait que chacun se
r&#233;f&#232;re &#224; ses propres mod&#232;les. Je ne crois pas qu'il ait &#233;t&#233;
d&#233;montr&#233;, par exemple, que la forme de gouvernement dite de Westminster soit celle
qui convienne le mieux &#224; l'Afrique. La question reste ouverte. Ne trouverions-nous pas
insolent de la part des Africains de nous dire comment g&#233;rer nos propres d&#233;mocraties?
Ils ont donc parfaitement le droit de se vexer lorsque nous les jugeons uniquement sur leur
incapacit&#233; de g&#233;rer un syst&#232;me qui est le n&ocirc;tre.
<p>
<i>Pour en revenir finalement &#224; Save the Children, comment voyez-vous s'orienter votre
organisation &#224; l'aube du prochain mill&#233;naire?</i>
<p>
-     Nous voulons promouvoir le r&#244;le des enfants dans le d&#233;veloppement. Notre
Charte est celle des droits des enfants, lesquels sont d&#233;sormais repris dans une Convention
des Nations Unies. Elle d&#233;finit les valeurs qui sous-tendent tout notre travail. Notre
volont&#233; de chercher &#224; r&#233;pondre aux besoins des enfants s'inscrit donc dans cette
obligation de garantir leurs droits. Mais je pense que des arguments beaucoup plus pragmatiques
justifient &#233;galement cette action. Les enfants sont des acteurs sociaux &#224; part
enti&#232;re. Ils forment, dans de nombreux pays, plus de la moiti&#233; de la population. Ils
apportent souvent, d'autre part, une contribution significative &#224; l'&#233;conomie des
m&#233;nages. Mais leur situation n'est g&#233;n&#233;ralement d&#233;finie que par rapport
aux adultes, de sorte que personne ne conna&icirc;t r&#233;ellement leur position ou leur r&ocirc;le
dans le processus de d&#233;veloppement. Nous pensons qu'il faut rem&#233;dier &#224; cet
&#233;tat de choses, et l'on peut &#233;tablir &#224; cet &#233;gard un parall&#232;le avec le
r&ocirc;le des femmes. La place actuelle des enfants dans les r&#233;flexions des dirigeants et des
responsables de la planification peut &ecirc;tre compar&#233;e &#224; celle qu'occupaient les
femmes il y a vingt ou vingt-cinq ans. Nul ne songe &#224; nier aujourd'hui l'importance cruciale
des femmes dans le d&#233;veloppement, ni l'attention particuli&#232;re que les politiques et
programmes doivent leur porter. On pourrait en dire de m&ecirc;me des enfants. L'un de nos
objectifs prioritaires est donc de promouvoir la place des enfants dans le d&#233;veloppement en
tant que moyen d'accro&icirc;tre l'efficacit&#233; des programmes de d&#233;veloppement.

<b>
Les Dossiers du Courrier visent &#224; fournir une analyse approfondie
d'un sujet ou d'un secteur particulier en l'abordant de divers points de
vue. L'auteur de cet article exprime sa propre opinion  - souvent
percutante -  de l'&#233;volution des ONG dans le contexte politique
et &#233;conomique de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement
et ses cons&#233;quences.</b>
<p>
     Historiquement, elles sont apparues au d&#233;but des
ann&#233;es 60. Les puissances coloniales d'alors ne pouvaient plus
tout aussi facilement imposer leurs vues aux anciens pays
colonis&#233;s. Les missionnaires qui avaient veill&#233; durant toute
la p&#233;riode coloniale &#224; la sant&#233; et &#224;
l'&#233;ducation des "indig&#232;nes", se retrouvaient tout &#224;
coup d&#233;pendant des autorit&#233;s souveraines des nouveaux
Etats ind&#233;pendants. Le volontariat outre-mer fut alors la
r&#233;ponse qui donna l'assise juridique et financi&#232;re aux
missionnaires pour leur permettre de poursuivre leur travail. 
<p>
     Dans la plupart des pays du Nord, une grande partie de la
population avait &#233;t&#233; sensibilis&#233;e &#224; la
mis&#232;re du tiers-monde et tentait vaille que vaille d'aider &#224;
sa mani&#232;re, le plus souvent en r&#233;coltant de l'argent pour
financer de petits projets qui offraient l'avantage d'&#234;tre
directement en prise avec les r&#233;alit&#233;s locales. Cette
d&#233;marche et les r&#233;sultats positifs qui en d&#233;coulaient
&#233;taient remarquables en regard des milliards
d&#233;pens&#233;s par les coop&#233;rations officielles qui ne
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaient que tr&#232;s peu aux populations locales.
Mais ces coop&#233;rations officielles n'&#233;taient bien souvent
qu'un des &#233;l&#233;ments de la politique des anciennes
puissances coloniales, dor&#233;navant appel&#233;es n&#233;o-
coloniales. 
<p>
     Le cofinancement dans la plupart des pays europ&#233;ens est
sans doute n&#233; de cette double r&#233;alit&#233;. D'une part,
il a fourni des r&#233;ponses aux critiques que les Etats ex-coloniaux
ne manquaient pas d'affronter en permettant au travers des ONG
d'atteindre la population locale mais d'autre part, il a aussi permis, par
le financement d'organisations li&#233;es de pr&#232;s aux structures
d'Eglises et de partis politiques de continuer leur oeuvre n&#233;o-
coloniale. Le cofinancement &#233;tait &#233;galement la suite
logique d'un r&#233;el engagement des populations du Nord
&#233;branl&#233;es par le contraste entre leur bien-&#234;tre des
"golden sixties" et la mis&#232;re des pays du Sud. Cet engagement
puisait certainement plus son dynamisme aux sources de la
charit&#233; chr&#233;tienne qu'&#224; celles des traditions de
l'internationalisme prol&#233;tarien. Certes, on ne finan&#231;ait plus
les &#233;glises comme du temps de la colonie; on cofinan&#231;ait
des projets dans lesquels la salle polyvalente &#233;tait la pi&#232;ce
ma&#238;tresse. Le lundi, elle servait d'atelier de coupe-couture, le
mardi pour la cat&#233;ch&#232;se, le mercredi pour la r&#233;union
des jeunes, le dimanche pour la messe! De la m&#234;me
mani&#232;re, les ONG li&#233;es structurellement aux partis
politiques b&#233;n&#233;ficiaient des largesses de leurs ministres de
la coop&#233;ration qui s'&#233;taient r&#233;unis la veille avec
leurs coll&#232;gues de l'Internationale pour faire le point avec leurs
partis fr&#232;res du Sud. Des projets cofinanc&#233;s en
d&#233;couleraient qui devaient ici lutter pour la consolidation de la
d&#233;mocratie (lisez: maintenir 10 cadres du parti) ou l&#224;
mettre sur pied un dispensaire (lisez: pr&#233;parer la base
&#233;lectorale d'un futur candidat du parti aux &#233;lections). 
<p>
     Les bouleversements politiques des ann&#233;es 70 dans les
pays du Sud ont &#233;galement amen&#233; leur lot de
changements au sein des ONG en sortant celles-ci non seulement d'une
approche caritative mais en leur donnant &#233;galement une
dimension beaucoup plus politique sur l'ensemble des questions
li&#233;es au d&#233;veloppement. Les ONG sont alors devenues de
v&#233;ritables avocats des causes des peuples du Sud et ont
commenc&#233; progressivement &#224; d&#233;ranger ceux qui
jusqu'alors les avaient financ&#233;es. Les ONG se retrouvaient sur
tous les combats, d&#233;non&#231;aient la domination
n&#233;o-coloniale des Etats, la domination des multinationales (Etats
dans les Etats) mais aussi les atteintes aux droits de l'homme et aux
droits des peuples. Aucun th&#232;me &#224; leurs yeux
n'&#233;tait tabou!
<p>
     L'aggravation de la crise &#233;conomique mondiale et
l'accaparement chaque fois plus important des richesses de la
plan&#232;te par un groupe plus r&#233;duit de
privil&#233;gi&#233;s ainsi que les bouleversements politiques suite
&#224; la chute du mur de Berlin ont plong&#233; la plupart des pays
d'Afrique et certains autres qui n'avaient pas encore pu d&#233;coller
dans d'effroyables crises. Les pays occidentaux, &#224; coup
d'ajustements structurels, de multipartismes, d'interventions militaires
et humanitaires ont alors une nouvelle fois impos&#233; leurs
solutions. Dans ce sc&#233;nario, les ONG furent appel&#233;es
chaque fois plus &#224; devoir jouer un r&#244;le de sous-traitant des
politiques d&#233;finies par les gouvernements. Cette situation est
particuli&#232;rement caricaturale dans les politiques d'aide d'urgence;
nous vivons sans doute aujourd'hui l'apog&#233;e des french and
belgian doctors, simples outils des politiques d'Etat.
<p>
     Les Etats ainsi que les organisations multilat&#233;rales ont
consid&#233;rablement d&#233;velopp&#233; cette politique de sous-
traitance qui fait faire aux autres beaucoup moins cher ce qu'ils
aimeraient bien faire. Pourquoi d&#232;s lors ne pas confier la mise en
oeuvre des politiques d'Etats &#224; ces bureaux d'&#233;tude bon
march&#233; que sont les ONG? Quelques "affaires" ainsi que les
lobby politiques pousseront les pouvoirs publics &#224; imaginer de
nouvelles r&#233;glementations qui aboutissent &#224; ne maintenir
que quelques ONG &#233;lues, celles qui satisfont aux nouvelles
exigences plus draconiennes des cofinanceurs. Au r&#232;gne des
politiques aujourd'hui en disgr&#226;ce succ&#232;de celui des
contr&#244;leurs...
<p>
     Cette &#233;volution est particuli&#232;rement dangereuse
puisqu'elle aboutit &#224; limiter consid&#233;rablement le nombre
des ONG et ne maintient que celles qui ont donn&#233; les gages
impos&#233;s du professionnalisme. Le risque est grand d&#232;s lors
de ne plus avoir de v&#233;ritables ONG qui soient l'expression des
pr&#233;occupations des citoyens. Le premier perdant serait sans nul
doute les pouvoirs publics qui se retrouveraient sans v&#233;ritable
interlocuteur. Orphelin de ses contradicteurs, priv&#233; de dynamique
critique, les gouvernants n'auraient en face d'eux que le vide: leur
propre politique n'aurait plus de valeur que celle que l'on accorde au
totalitarisme.

<a name="int"><i>Le Comit&#233; de Liaison est l'interlocuteur privil&#233;gi&#233; entre</a> les ONG et l'Union
Europ&#233;enne. Nous avons interrog&#233; son pr&#233;sident nouvellement &#233;lu,
Agostinho Jardim Gon&#231;alves. Aumonier et journaliste portugais, Mr Gon&#231;alves
conna&icirc;t depuis longtemps le secteur de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement.
Dans le pass&#233;, charg&#233; de mission pour le CCFD, pr&#233;sident du Groupe
"Am&#233;rique latine" pour la CISDE, mais aussi directeur national de l'Agence
Internationale de Presse "Inter-Press Service" au Portugal, il est aujourd'hui le fondateur et
directeur de OIKOS dans son pays. Nous lui avons tout d'abord demander comment il
envisageait son nouveau statut de Pr&#233;sident du Comit&#233; de liaison.
</i>
<p>
-  Je crois que dans le fond le r&ocirc;le du Pr&#233;sident est d'assurer aux
diff&#233;rentes organisations du comit&#233; une coh&#233;rence et en m&ecirc;me
temps d'animer et de donner au comit&#233; un &#233;lan, un dynamisme dont le
comit&#233; a besoin du fait qu'il est compos&#233; de gens avec des exp&#233;riences
tr&#232;s diff&#233;rentes. Il ne faut pas privil&#233;gier l'une ou l'autre exp&#233;rience,
mais bien les inscrire toutes  dans un dynamisme qui sert le but du comit&#233; de liaison.
Ceci dit, je dois dire qu'apr&#232;s les Pays Bas, la Belgique, l'Irlande ou la France, c'est la
premi&#232;re fois qu'on nomme un Pr&#233;sident originaire d'un pays du Sud de l'Europe,
et un des derniers pays &#224; faire partie de l'Union Europ&#233;enne. Je suis donc
conscient d'&ecirc;tre porteur non seulement d'une responsabilit&#233; de conservation, de
coordination et de r&#233;alisation mais aussi d'une culture propre des pays au Sud de
l'Europe. Je crois que cette rencontre des differentes cultures et d'une consertation entre
elles peut rendre encore plus riche le travail des ONG europ&#233;ennes.  
<p>
<i>L'atout, la richesse des ONG c'est sans aucun doute leur diversit&#233;. Un Comit&#233;
de liaison qui rassemble plus de 700 ONG peut-il maintenir cette diversit&#233;?</i>
<p>
- Les ONG refl&#232;tent la r&#233;alit&#233; europ&#233;enne. On travaille pour
l'Union Europ&#233;enne mais on a le souci de ne pas effacer la richesse qui provient de
cette diversit&#233;. Ceci est vrai dans la construction europ&#233;enne mais aussi dans
les soci&#233;t&#233;s civiles dont les ONG sont une sorte d'&#233;mergence, de
signification. Le comit&#233; de liaison n'a pas l'intention d'uniformiser le travail des ONG.
Il reste un espace, un forum o&ugrave; les differentes ONG peuvent partager leur histoire,
leur exp&#233;reince et leurs propos tout en voulant rester ensemble et contribuer &#224;
la construction de l'Europe dans le domaine pr&#233;cis de la solidarit&#233; avec les pays
en d&#233;veloppement par le biais de la coop&#233;ration. La fa&#231;on d'y aboutir est,
elle, diff&#233;rente selon chaque pays et selon les differentes ONG. On ne veut pas du tout
effacer la richesse de tout ce qui est spontan&#233; dans le travail des ONG ou arriver
&#224; quelque chose de trop uniforme qui appauvrirait leur travail.
<p>
<i>Dans les rapports que le Comit&#233; entretient avec l'Union Europ&#233;enne, cette diversit&#233; ne se r&#233;fl&#232;te cependant pas toujours?</i>
<p>
- Le comit&#233; de liaison est un interlocuteur privil&#233;gi&#233; des instances
europ&#233;ennes et accept&#233; comme tel pour ce qui concerne la politique de
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement. A ce titre, il  est un des signes de la vitalit&#233;
des soci&#233;t&#233; civiles des 15 pays membres de l'UE.  Les ONG, tant du Sud que
du Nord, peuvent pr&#233;senter leur projet, leur programme, d&#233;cider des
crit&#232;res d'acception ou de refus avec la Commission en toute libert&#233; et le
Comit&#233; de liaison est l&#224; pour rapporter leurs souhaits et "leurs revendications"
en mati&#232;re de coop&#233;ration europ&#233;enne au d&#233;veloppement. Le
Comit&#233; reste d&#232;s lors l'espace o&ugrave; doit se d&#233;battre quel est la
dimension de l'apport des ONG dans la construction de l'Europe solidaire. Tout cela fait
partie d'un dialogue continu, d'une interlocution.  
<p>
     Ceci dit, il y a un autre probl&#232;me qui est li&#233; plut&ocirc;t au niveau du
Comit&#233; de liaison et qui est de savoir qu'est ce que le Comit&#233; de liaison
repr&#233;sente. Est-ce qu'il repr&#233;sente simplement les grandes ONG, les ONG qui
ont un pouvoir de r&#233;fl&#233;chir sur certaines choses, de d&#233;velopper un travail
de lobbying, d'avoir des projets significatifs dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement, etc.? Ou
est-ce que le Comit&#233; de liaison est aussi ouvert &#224; l'action des petites ONG, de
la petite association qui veut d&#233;velopper un travail solidaire? Pour ma part, je crois que
on n'a pas de r&#233;ponse claire l&#224;-dessus parce que tout cela doit se passer au
niveau de chaque pays. C'est en effet dans chaque pays que les choses se passent. C'est
l&#224; qu'il y a, je ne dis pas affrontement, mais un certain d&#233;callage, une certaines
diff&#233;rence de pouvoir entre les grandes et les petites ONG. 
<p>
     Lors de la derni&#232;re Assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale, une des conclusions
&#233;tait justement de renforcer les rapports entre le Comit&#233; de liaison et les
plateformes nationales car je crois que jusqu'ici, malgr&#233; tous les efforts qu'on a
d&#233;velopp&#233;, on n'a pas encore abouti &#224; une relation institutionnelle vraiment
f&#233;conde entre le Comit&#233; de liaison et les plateformes nationales. C'est une
revendication de la part des ONG des diff&#233;rents pays et &#233;galement des
diff&#233;rents Etats membres. Le Comit&#233; de liaison se doit de donner de l'importance
&#224; l'action des plateformes nationales dans tout ce dynamisme de la coop&#233;ration
europ&#233;enne avec les pays en d&#233;veloppement  et d'y inclure les grandes et petites
ONG.
<p>
<i>Les ONG se doivent en effet de travailler en coordinatio les unes avec les autres. La
recherche de financement et la concurrence qui en est issue ne limitent-elles pas cette
coordination &#224; de belles paroles?</i>
<p>
- On parle beaucoup de concurrence et on en parle plus qu'elle n'existe. C'est vrai que
les ONG essaient d'avoir des moyens financiers importants, surtout celles qui travaillent sur
le terrain, n&#233;cessiteuses de fonds propres pour soutenir leur projets et c'est vrai que
dans certains pays, elles travaillent sur les m&ecirc;mes r&#233;gions, sur les m&ecirc;mes
domaines et avec les m&ecirc;mes couches sociales.  Mais ceci dit, quand on parle de
coordination entre les ONG, on pense surtout &#224; toute une compl&#233;mentarit&#233;
qu'il faut avoir et qui doit exister pour rendre encore plus efficace l'action des ONG. Je
m'explique. Par exemle, il y a des ONG qui sont vraiment des ONG expertes dans le domaine
de l'aide humanitaire, il y en a d'autres qui ont fait leur chemin dans le d&#233;veloppement,
dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement, par le transfert de technologie, le tranfert de
ressources humaines, etc.  Il y en a d'autres encore qui ont fait une exp&#233;rience
excellente dans le domaine du lobbying politique. Cette sp&#233;cialisation des
diff&#233;rentes ONG  ne peut rester isol&#233;e de l'exp&#233;rience des autres parce
que la vie n'est pas comme &#231;a, la vie n'est pas compartiment&#233;e. Un pays qui a
souffert des cons&#233;quences d'une guerre a besoin d'une aide d'urgence et les ONG qui
veulent faire du d&#233;veloppement ne peuvent l'oublier de m&ecirc;me que celles qui font
de l'urgence ne peuvent oublier que l'urgence est  ponctuelle, transitoire. Les ONG ne
peuvent travailler en ignorant ce que font les autres mais doivent essayer au contraire de
partager les appels, les d&#233;fis, les exp&#233;riences, et m&ecirc;me les moyens et les
ressources. Ce qu'il se passe actuellement au Rwanda ou en Angola par exemple est
malheureux car c'est impensable que les ONG puissent continuer &#224; travailler chacun
&#224; sa fa&#231;on, sans se mettre d'accord sur une coordination qui rende plus efficace
le travail des unes et des autres.
<p>
<i>Quand on regarde le monde des ONG en g&#233;n&#233;ral, un fait caract&#233;ristique
de ces derni&#232;res ann&#233;es c'est bien s&ucirc;r l'&#233;mergence et la
reconnaissance des ONG du Sud, entra&icirc;nant in&#233;vitablement un repositionnement
de certaines ONG du Nord.</i>
<p>
- Disons tout d'abord que persiste encore, selon moi, un besoin de r&#233;fl&#233;chir,
d'approffondir les relations qu'il y a entre soci&#233;t&#233; civile du Nord et du Sud, entre
ONG du Nord et ONG du Sud. Que l'on puisse approfondir cette relation peuple &#224;
peuple avec, dans une concertation, dans une collaboration, les Etats et les instances
intergouvernementales, est d'une richesse &#233;norme. Car c'est le rapprochement des
peuples; ce sont des mouvements dynamiques qui font que les populations se mettent en
solidarit&#233; pour la construction d'une justice, d'une paix mondiale. 
<p>
     Ceci dit, je crois que l'histoire est l'histoire et le temps est le temps. Le fait que
certaines instances europ&#233;eennes aient d&#233;cid&#233; de d&#233;clancher des
processus d'un rapprochement direct ou d'une coop&#233;ration directe avec des ONG du
Sud de mani&#232;re un peu pr&#233;cipit&#233;e ne va pas emp&ecirc;cher les ONG du
Nord de continuer cette recherche d'un approfondissement de la coop&#233;ration entre
ONG et ONG. Ce sera bien s&ucirc;r tr&#232;s difficile s'il n'y a pas une bonne
pr&#233;paration et une sorte d'esprit d'&#233;valuation permanente. Le tout est de maintenir
une concertation et je puis dire, par exemple en ce qui concerne la coop&#233;ration
d&#233;centralis&#233;e o&ugrave; il y a vraiment de plus en plus un engagement des ONG
du sud dans tout processus nouveau, que tout cela est fait dans un tr&#232;s bon esprit de
collaboration entre le Comit&#233; de liaison et la CE. L&#224; on est toujours au courant,
on participe dans la r&#233;flexion, on participe, disons on chemine avec la Commission
dans la recherche, ses nouvelles relations mais il nous semble qu'elle doit &ecirc;tre
accompagn&#233;e d'une certaine prudence pour qu'elle soit vraiment efficace.
<p>
<i>Continuer de travailler dans un partenariat avec les ONG du sud... Lors de son allocation
lors de l'Assembl&#233;e G&#233;n&#233;rale, Mr. Guido Dumon, votre
pr&#233;decesseur, disait que d'apr&#232;s lui, ce partenariat avait &#233;t&#233; un
&#233;chec.</i>
<p>
- Je crois qu'il faut reconna&icirc;tre que le partenariat a &#233;t&#233; un &#233;chec
dans le sens o&ugrave; l'id&#233;e que l'on s'en faisait en a &#233;t&#233; un. S'il ne s'est
pas r&#233;alis&#233; tel qu'on l'avait pr&#233;vu, d'un autre c&ocirc;t&#233; il y a eu des
interventions, dans le chemin que nous avons suivi, qui n'ont pas permis un partenariat tel
qu'il est &#233;crit dans les manuels et dans les propos des responsables et des dirigeants.
Il faudrait &ecirc;tre r&#233;aliste pour dire que si le partenariat est un propos, est un
id&#233;al, mais que les pays ont des situations &#233;conomiques diff&#233;rentes les uns
des autres, or chacun sait que quand l'un a des ressources sup&#233;rieures aux autres,
il exerce une position qui d&#232;s le d&#233;part, ne favorise vraiment pas le partenariat.
Il y a des donateurs et des receveurs et celui qui re&#231;oit n'a pas la m&ecirc;me force que
le donateur, m&ecirc;me s'il peut y avoir une bonne volont&#233; au d&#233;part. D'un autre
c&ocirc;t&#233;, on conna&icirc;t l'histoire de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement
et que le partenariat n'est pas isol&#233; de la r&#233;alit&#233;, de ce qu'il se passe dans
le monde, des relations entre le nord et le sud. Cette r&#233;alit&#233; peut se
r&#233;pecuter &#233;galement dans les relations entre les ONG du nord et les ONG du
Sud au niveau des ressources, au niveau du commerce international, au niveau des
transferts technologiques, etc. il existe indubitablement des interf&#233;rences qui ont
emp&ecirc;ch&#233; qu'un partenariat tel qu'on l'avait souhait&#233; se r&#233;alise. 
<p>
     Aujourd'hui cependant, il semble bien qu'il y ait des signes plut&ocirc;t positifs. Non
seulement, persiste au sein des ONG la volont&#233; que le partenariat reste quelque chose
de vital mais aussi, les exp&#233;riences montrent que l'on sait dor&#233;navant dans quel
sens avancer et quels sont les pi&#232;ges &#224; &#233;viter. 
<p>
<i>Comment &#233;valueriez-vous l'impact du travail du Comit&#233; de liaison ?</i>
<p>
- La cr&#233;ation du Comit&#233; &#233;tait un geste historique important, c'est
&#224; dire d'&#233;tablir  face &#224; une Europe construite avec des buts
&#233;conomiques clairs et des propos politiques, un organisme qui respecte l'autonomie
de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile et lance le pont pour un dialogue fructueux et permanent avec
elle.  Si on veut &#233;valuer son action, je crois pour ma part que si l'on a d&#233;j&#224;
fait beaucoup de choses et avons d&#233;velopp&#233; une certaine fa&#231;on de
s'inscrire dans ce mouvement de coop&#233;ration entre l'Europe et les pays du sud, on
aurait pu cependant avancer plus vite. Je crois qu'il y a des r&#233;flexions de fonds qui
probablement ne pouvaient pas se faire dans le pass&#233; mais qu'il faut faire le plus vite
possible. Il y a tout un &#233;largissement de cette interaction entre le Comit&#233; de
liaison et les instances de l'Union europ&#233;enne &#224; effectuer, que ce soit avec le
Parlement Europ&#233;en, le Conseil des Ministres, le COREPER ou la Commission (non
seulement avec l'unit&#233; ONG mais aussi avec la Commission dans son ensemble). Mon
souhait serait que l'on avance plus vite.
<p>
<i>Quelles sont d&#232;s lors les priorit&#233;s actuelles?</i>
<p>
- Aujourd'hui, la priorit&#233; c'est vraiment la politique de coop&#233;ration de l'Union
Europ&#233;enne parce que on ne peut pas travailler en marge d'elle, &#224; contre-courant.
L'Union europ&#233;enne pourrait avoir une tr&#232;s bonne politique de coop&#233;ration
avec les ONG mais si elle ne se dote pas d'une politique coh&#233;rente, les ONG vont
trouver des obstacles pour vraiment rendre efficace leur action. La priorit&#233; est donc la
contibution du Comit&#233; de liaison &#224; la d&#233;finition et &#224; l'implantation
d'une politique de coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement coh&#233;rente de la part de
l'Union europ&#233;enne. Cela peut se faire de diff&#233;rentes fa&#231;ons. Le dialogue
est important, la capacit&#233; de prendre le temps d'&#233;voquer les questions cl&#233;s
l'est tout autant. La derni&#232;re Assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale a d'ailleurs montrer
le pas en soulevant la question de la r&#233;vision du Trait&#233; de Maastricht. De
m&ecirc;me, il faut que le Comit&#233; de liaison puisse participer, &#224; sa fa&#231;on,
&#224; la Conf&#233;rence Intergouvernementale de l'ann&#233;e prochaine. Lom&#233;
est &#233;galement un point primordial. Ce n'est pas seulement une question de co-financement de projets, de moyens financiers ou d'autres aspects techniques; Il y a des
aspects plus profonds dont la d&#233;finition des strat&#233;gies de coop&#233;ration.
<p>
<i>A cet &#233;gard, quel est votre sentiment sur l'avenir de la Convention de Lom&#233;?</i>
<p>
- Je dirais que ce qui me semble tr&#232;s dangereux, c'est si on s'oriente vers
quelque chose qui fasse perdre toute la richesse d'une formule telle que Lom&#233; se
pr&#233;sentait. Lom&#233;, malgr&#233; tous ses d&#233;fauts et ses difficult&#233;s,
malgr&#233; ses &#233;checs aussi, a repr&#233;sent&#233; une volont&#233; politique
de coop&#233;rer &#224; un niveau de n&#233;gociation &#233;lev&#233;, de respecter un
aspect important du partenariat. C'est une coop&#233;ration multilat&#233;rale mais qui n'est
pas rest&#233;e dans les belles paroles. Il y a eu vraiment des choses concr&#232;tes, des
n&#233;gociations concr&#232;tes, des m&#233;canismes qui ont &#233;t&#233; mis en
route et en place pour vraiment r&#233;aliser quelque chose qui concernait les uns et les
autres. A mon avis, si on tue cet aspect, on fera marche arri&#232;re dans l'histoire de la
coop&#233;ration. 
<p>
     Deuxi&#232;mement, je crois qu'il y a toute une exp&#233;rience accumul&#233;e
au niveau de la coop&#233;ration, une multitude de gens qui se sont mobilis&#233;s pour
qu'existe ce rapprochement de l'Europe avec les pays en d&#233;veloppement, les pays
ACP. Ce serait dommage d&#232;s lors que l'on dise "bon, maintenant, tout &#231;a n'est
rien, allons dans un autre sens". Moi je serais plut&ocirc;t pour une &#233;valuation
tr&#232;s s&#233;rieuse; je crois que ce qu'on a fait pour la r&#233;vision de Lom&#233;
&#224; mi-parcours, c'&#233;tait tr&#232;s faible. Plus inquiets quand aux fonds, quant
&#224; l'enveloppe financi&#232;re, les vrais probl&#232;mes n'ont pas &#233;t&#233;
abord&#233;s. Toute une r&#233;flexion avait &#233;t&#233; faite par le Comit&#233; de
liaison avec d'autres r&#233;seaux europ&#233;ens, mais elle ne fut pas pr&#233;sente
dans la r&#233;flexion fianle. On avait pourtant partag&#233; nos r&#233;flexions;  pour la
premi&#232;re fois, on a assist&#233; &#224; une v&#233;ritable relation entre ONG et
Etats comme on ne l'avait jamais connue dans le pass&#233;, mais les choses se sont
pass&#233;es dans des compartiments vraiment s&#233;par&#233;s &#224; des niveaux
plus officiels. Probablement, c'est un peu le r&#233;sultat de cette vie internationale qui ne
pr&#233;sente souvent pas les conditions les plus ad&#233;quates pour une collaboration
permanente. Une meilleure &#233;valuation &#233;tait donc n&#233;cessaire pour
d&#233;passer les blocages qui viennent de l'Europe et surtout des pays ACP telles que les
questions de comp&#233;tence ou diff&#233;rentes autres questions qui sont obstacles
&#224; l'efficacit&#233; de Lom&#233;. 
<p>
     Si Lom&#233; &#233;choue, &#224; tel point qu'on l'efface de l'histoire, je pense que
la seule chose qui va rester pour l'avenir, c'est ce mouvement de charit&#233; internationale,
d'assistance, d'urgence et rien de plus.
<p>
<i>Est ce &#224; dire qu'aujourd'hui les ONG ont avant tout un r&ocirc;le politique ?</i>
<p>
- C'est la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement qui a une dimension politique
parce que les choses ne peuvent pas rester au niveau de la bonne volont&#233; des gens
dans une sorte de mis&#233;ricorde face &#224; la souffrance. Cela suppose un
changement de structures qui passe par une red&#233;finition des politiques de
coop&#233;ration et les ONG y ont un r&ocirc;le &#224; jouer. 
<p>
     Les ONG d'aujourd'hui refusent de n'&ecirc;tre que des t&#233;moins, d'intervenir
&#224; un moment donn&#233; parce que la souffrance exige cette intervention.  On parle
de d&#233;mocratie mais on la con&#231;oit parfois tout en laissant de c&ocirc;t&#233; deux
ou trois domaines dans lesquels les Etats ne veulent pas de l'intervention de la
soci&#233;t&#233; civile. C'est le cas des relations ext&#233;rieures ou de la d&#233;fense.
Ce sont des domaines qui sont presque le monopole des Etats or, petit &#224; petit,
l'approfondissement de la conscience d&#233;mocratique suppose que l'on intervienne aussi
dans les relations entre les peuples en donnant notre opinion politique comme on la donne
pour les questions sociales ou pour les questions &#233;conomiques, qui sont
d&#233;j&#224; des acquis de la d&#233;mocratie. La d&#233;mocratie, c'est cette
capacit&#233; et ce droit d'intervenir aussi dans la politique des relations ext&#233;rieures.
Le but n'est pas seulement d'assurer la paix entre les peuples, il est aussi d'assurer une
justice internationale et  les ONG y ont un r&ocirc;le primordial.

<b>Le 9 juillet 1992, le centi&#232;me avis du Conseil consultatif national pour la coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement (NAR) sur le r&ocirc;le des organisations priv&#233;es dans le processus de
structuration  de la soci&#233;t&#233;, a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; au ministre de la
Coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement J.P. Pronk.</b>
<p>
<h3>R&#233;sum&#233; des probl&#232;mes et questions soulev&#233;es par l'avis</h3>

L'attention accrue pour la d&#233;mocratisation, la bonne gestion et le d&#233;veloppement durable a
incit&#233; le Conseil &#224; se pencher sur le r&ocirc;le jou&#233; dans la soci&#233;t&#233; par les
organisations non-gouvernementales (ONG). L'importance de l'initiative priv&#233;e pour le
d&#233;veloppement social est souvent peu d&#233;taill&#233; sur le plan politique. La cause r&#233;side
dans la complexit&#233; du th&#232;me, ce qui permet d'envisager plusieurs points de vue.
<p>
Un r&#233;seau solide d'organisations priv&#233;es dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement est
indispensable &#224; la r&#233;alisation d'un d&#233;veloppement stable sur une base
d&#233;mocratique, ce que l'on appelle la structuration de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Cette consid&#233;ration
est l'un des principaux points de d&#233;part de l'avis. Les citoyens doivent avoir la possibilit&#233; de
faire entendre leur voix et de d&#233;ployer ensemble des activit&#233;s. Ce n'est qu'alors qu'il sera
possible de contrer l'exercice du pouvoir souvent unilat&#233;ral de l'&Eacute;tat et d'impliquer de plus
grands groupes de la soci&#233;t&#233; dans le processus social. Ce qui est &#224; l'heure actuelle
pratiquement nulle part suffisant.
<p>
Le Conseil plaide en faveur de la d&#233;signation d'un large spectre d'organisations comme 'comportant
un &#233;l&#233;ment de d&#233;veloppement'. L'avis donne des exemples d'associations d'instituteurs et
de professeurs, de journalistes, de m&#233;decins, d'avocats et de juges, d'organisations syndicales,
d'unions de consommateurs, d'organisations d'employeurs, d'organisations culturelles et m&ecirc;me
sportives. Un grand nombre de ces ONG n'appartient pas au circuit des donateurs. Celles-ci devraient entrer
en ligne de compte pour b&#233;n&#233;ficier d'un soutien suppl&#233;mentaire. La coop&#233;ration au
d&#233;veloppement est trop souvent r&#233;duite &#224; la lutte contre la pauvret&#233;.
<p>
<h3>Effet pervers</h3>

Jusqu'&#224; r&#233;cemment, la croissance &#233;conomique, en termes de Produit National Brut
(PNB), &#233;tait le principal crit&#232;re pour d&#233;terminer le 'd&#233;veloppement'. On tient de
plus en plus souvent compte de facteurs sociaux tels que le niveau de la sant&#233; et de l'enseignement.
Dans les d&#233;bats internationaux, la notion de d&#233;veloppement acqui&#232;rt un sens de plus en
plus large. Les droits de l'homme, la d&#233;mocratisation, le niveau de l'enseignement, la position des
femmes et l'environnement y occupent une place importante. La croissance &#233;conomique n'est pas
toujours essentielle pour garantir la 'qualit&#233;' d'une soci&#233;t&#233;. C'est ainsi que le puissant
d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique de certains pays asiatiques notamment est impressionnant &#224;
premi&#232;re vue, mais est tr&#232;s unilat&#233;ral. La majorit&#233; de la soci&#233;t&#233; n'y a
aucune participation. De plus, l'environnement est sacrifi&#233; au progr&#232;s &#233;conomique, de
sorte qu'il ne peut &ecirc;tre question de d&#233;veloppement durable. C'est pourquoi le NAR parle de
'd'effets pervers'.
<p>
Dans le m&ecirc;me temps, l'id&#233;e que les processus de d&#233;veloppement peuvent &ecirc;tre
guid&#233;s par l'ing&#233;nierie sociale, dont les r&#233;sultats peuvent &ecirc;tre
d&#233;termin&#233;s par l'&Eacute;tat ou les donateurs est soumise &#224; une forte &#233;rosion. La
reconnaissance de ce que les processus de d&#233;veloppement pr&#233;sentent plusieurs facettes et sont
tr&#232;s divers souligne la complexit&#233; de la relation entre le d&#233;veloppement et la structuration
de la soci&#233;t&#233;. Ce sont  justement les changements dans les relations Est-Ouest qui modifient la
teneur des discussions sur la 'faisabilit&#233;' de la soci&#233;t&#233;. L'extension de l'enseignement ne
conduit pas automatiquement &#224; la d&#233;mocratisation ou au respect des droits de l'homme, la
croissance &#233;conomique ne va pas n&#233;cessairement de pair avec la d&#233;mocratisation ou la
bonne gestion  de l'&Eacute;tat. On prend de plus en plus conscience que la gestion de l'&Eacute;tat sans le
consensus ou sans la coop&#233;ration de grandes parties de la soci&#233;t&#233; est vou&#233;
t&ocirc;t ou tard &#224; l'&#233;chec. Bien que l'on parle d'objectif d&#233;riv&#233;, le Conseil est
d'avis qu'il est justifi&#233; d'accorder un plus grand int&#233;r&ecirc;t dans la politique au r&ocirc;le
social de l'initiative priv&#233;e.
<p>
<h3>R&#233;sistance</h3>

Les citoyens doivent avoir la possibilit&#233; de faire entendre leur voix et de d&#233;ployer ensemble des
activit&#233;s. Ce n'est qu'alors qu'il sera possible de contrer l'exercice souvent unilat&#233;ral du
pouvoir (de l'Etat) et d'impliquer de plus  grands groupes de la soci&#233;t&#233;  dans le processus
social.
<p>
La fonction de "contre-poids" des organisations priv&#233;es est li&#233;e &#224; leur fonction
d'organisation et de mobilisation. La capacit&#233; d'organisation n'importe pas uniquement dans le cadre
de la lutte contre la pauvret&#233; et la d&#233;fense des int&#233;r&ecirc;ts, mais &#233;galement pour
la formation d'une base d'une politique ad&#233;quate des pouvoirs publics pour la lutte contre la
pauvret&#233; &#224; long terme. Les organisations rendent le public et les pouvoirs publics conscients de
l'environnement et des droits de l'homme. De ce fait, ces th&#232;mes ont davantage de poids lors de
l'examen de ces int&#233;r&ecirc;ts dans le d&#233;bat social et le processus politique.
<p>
Bien que le terme puisse le sugg&#233;rer, la r&#233;sistance n'est pas n&#233;cessairement
n&#233;gative, mais peut avoir une signification positive lorsqu'elle forme un compl&#233;ment &#224;
des forces qui  sans cela  peuvent &ecirc;tre destructives pour la soci&#233;t&#233;. En fonction de la
situation dans le pays, cette r&#233;sistance peut par exemple &ecirc;tre dirig&#233;e contre le pouvoir de
l'&Eacute;tat, les grands propri&#233;taires terriens, les banques, les ententes qui entravent une formation
&#233;quilibr&#233;e des prix et la libert&#233; du march&#233;.
<p>
<h3>Conclusions et recommandations</h3>

Le conseil constate des effets pervers dans de nombreux pays en d&#233;veloppement une situation de
croissance d&#233;vi&#233;e, ce qui donne &#224; la structuration de la soci&#233;t&#233; un
caract&#232;re unilat&#233;ral, domin&#233; par la croissance &#233;conomique ou l'extension
d&#233;mesur&#233;e de l'appareil de l'&Eacute;tat. Ce d&#233;s&#233;quilibre cause souvent des
tensions, parfois m&ecirc;me une r&#233;sistance violente, ce qui  entrave gravement les efforts
d&#233;ploy&#233;s pour parvenir &#224; une forme durable de d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
Dans le dialogue politique avec les pays en d&#233;veloppement, les Pays-Bas peuvent apporter un soutien
positif &#224; la structuration de la soci&#233;t&#233; en plaidant pour une plus grande libert&#233;
d'action pour les organisations priv&#233;es et pour le renforcement de normes reconnues au niveau
international en mati&#232;re de libert&#233; d'expression et d'organisation. Cette politique est
appel&#233;e 'l'alignement positif'. Elle a pour objectif d'augmenter les conditions pos&#233;es pour le
respect de ces normes internationales dans le pays m&ecirc;me, contrairement &#224; 'l'alignement
n&#233;gatif' o&ugrave; il y a menace de sanctions en cas de violation. Bien que celle-ci puisse &ecirc;tre
extr&ecirc;mement efficace,  le Conseil constate  que l'alignement positif produit &#224; long terme un
effet plus structurel.
<p>
Le Conseil recommande de poser trois conditions &#224; la fourniture d'aide aux organisations
priv&#233;es. Tout d'abord, les circonstances sp&#233;cifiques dans lesquelles &#233;voluent les
organisations priv&#233;es doivent &ecirc;tre connues. Il convient de trouver une r&#233;ponse &#224;
des questions telles que "quelle est la relation pouvoirs publics-organisations priv&#233;es", "quelles sont
les organisations qui peuvent fournir une contribution &#224; la structuration de la soci&#233;t&#233;",
"comment les soutenir", si l'on veut parvenir &#224; un soutien justifi&#233;. Une deuxi&#232;me
condition est qu'il faut s'aligner sur l'initiative locale si l'on veut &#233;viter l'apparition de distortions
dans le processus de structuration de la soci&#233;t&#233; venues de l'ext&#233;rieur. En troisi&#232;me
lieu, il doit &ecirc;tre &#233;tabli que les organisations concern&#233;es peuvent fonctionner de
mani&#232;re suffisamment ind&#233;pendante (au plan organisationnel et financier) ou que celles-ci le
seront dans un proche avenir.
<p>

Le Conseil conclut qu'un soutien peut &ecirc;tre accord&#233; aux organisations priv&#233;es par
l'interm&#233;diaire du co-financement aussi bien que par des organisations sectorielles au Nord. En plus du
financement direct on peut &#233;galement envisager de nouvelles formes de financement utilisant un fonds
g&#233;r&#233; dans le pays en d&#233;veloppement. Par ailleurs, des organisations priv&#233;es qui font
partie d'un r&#233;seau international et qui ne disposent pas de moyens suffisants pour participer &#224; de
telles activit&#233;s, pourraient entrer en ligne de compte pour recevoir un soutien plus important. Ce soutien
pour lequel les bourses de voyage constituent un instrument appropri&#233; peut encourager l'&#233;change
d'information, l'apport d'expertise et le renforcement tant de cadres internationaux que d'organisations
participantes.
<p>
Le Conseil estime que les organisations m&#233;ritent une attention sp&#233;ciale. Il suffit de penser &#224;
la formation et au recyclage, &#224; la facilitation des &#233;changes d'exp&#233;riences et de connaissances
et au renforcement de la position des organisations correspondantes. Le Conseil conclut que 'le jumelage', une
relation durable de coop&#233;ration et de soutien entre deux organisations (souvent une au Nord et une au
Sud), peut &ecirc;tre un instrument utilisable. De nombreuses organisations priv&#233;es entretiennent
d&#233;j&#224; des liens avec des organisations apparent&#233;es dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement -
ancr&#233;s ou non dans des structures de coop&#233;ration. De telles relations semblent gagner de
l'importance et m&#233;ritent une attention soutenue. Le Conseil recommande de rechercher o&ugrave; de
telles situations peuvent &ecirc;tre stimul&#233;es. En tant qu'effet secondaire, une telle politique peut
renforcer l'assise de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement au sein de la soci&#233;t&#233;
n&#233;erlandaise.

<b>
La r&#233;ponse &#224; cette question tient essentiellement en quelques mots : parce que
le d&#233;veloppement ne saurait &#234;tre le fait seulement des administrations, au Nord
comme au Sud. Celles-ci ressentent le besoin d'autres perceptions, d'autres m&#233;thodes
de d&#233;veloppement et de coop&#233;ration en plus des leurs. Elles le ressentent de
fa&#231;on de plus en plus claire, au fur et &#224; mesure que les &#233;valuations de
leurs propres programmes ont montr&#233; la n&#233;cessit&#233; d'approches nouvelles
et diversifi&#233;es, dans la mesure &#233;galement o&ugrave; il est apparu plus
nettement qu'une approche technique du d&#233;veloppement, sans participation et
mobilisation suffisantes des populations, m&#232;ne souvent &#224; des r&#233;sultats
limit&#233;s et fragiles et que les ONG sont utiles et efficaces &#224; cet
&#233;gard.</b>
<p>
     De plus, on a assist&#233;, chez nous comme dans les pays en d&#233;veloppement,
&#224; une mobilisation spontan&#233;e des &#233;nergies d'individus, de groupes, de
r&#233;seaux en faveur du d&#233;veloppement. Une Communaut&#233; &#224; visage
humain, se voulant proche des initiatives des citoyens, ne pouvait les n&#233;gliger, d'autant
que leurs moyens sont souvent limit&#233;s par rapport aux champs d'action ouverts &#224;
ces initiatives.
<p>
     Pour ce qui est de la Communaut&#233; europ&#233;enne, la collaboration avec les
ONG n'est nullement le seul fait des fonctionnaires de la Commission charg&#233;s de la
gestion des politiques et instruments de coop&#233;ration. Le Conseil a marqu&#233; son
int&#233;r&#234;t &#224; leur &#233;gard, assez r&#233;cemment encore dans ses
r&#233;solutions de 1991 et 1992.  Le Parlement europ&#233;en surtout, par nature ouvert et
sensible aux mouvements de citoyens, a depuis le d&#233;but encourag&#233; l'appui aux ONG
et a vot&#233; &#224; cet effet des cr&#233;dits en expansion tr&#232;s rapide. C'est
gr&#226;ce &#224; la conjonction des efforts du Parlement et de la Commission qu'ont
&#233;t&#233; obtenus et utilis&#233;s en 1976 les premiers fonds pour les cofinancer. Voyons
tout cela de plus pr&#232;s.
<p>
     Une place fondamentale revient &#224; l'ensemble des associations de base des PVD,
ainsi qu'&#224; leurs ONG d'appui. C'est essentiellement &#224; elles qu'il revient de
cr&#233;er un d&#233;veloppement r&#233;ellement participatif, proche des populations, des
besoins de base tels qu'elles les ressentent, de leurs id&#233;es et m&#233;thodes, faute de quoi
les plus beaux programmes officiels manqueront d'ancrage.
<p>
     C'est aussi un m&#233;rite &#233;minent des associations et ONG, Sud et Nord, de
chercher surtout &#224; aider des populations pauvres, marginalis&#233;es, bien souvent
n&#233;glig&#233;es ou hors d'atteinte des politiques nationales de d&#233;veloppement et de
la coop&#233;ration internationale. M&#234;me pour les ONG, ce n'est pas simple, mais
beaucoup ont au moins le m&#233;rite d'essayer.
<p>
     Il ne s'agit pas d'opposer les ONG aux Etats, encore moins de nier le r&#244;le-
cl&#233; de ceux-ci. Il s'agit de diversifier les efforts et approches de d&#233;veloppement, de
permettre &#224; chacun de jouer son r&#244;le dans des soci&#233;t&#233;s &#224;
structures diversifi&#233;es.  On parle tant de d&#233;mocratie &#224; l'heure actuelle. Mais
on a parfois tendance &#224; oublier qu'il n'y a pas de d&#233;mocratie politique r&#233;elle
et durable sans structures d&#233;mocratiques de base, sans reconnaissance du r&#244;le de
chacun dans le d&#233;veloppement socio-&#233;conomique. La vie associative a un r&#244;le-
cl&#233; &#224; jouer &#224; cet &#233;gard; aux ONG de l'appuyer et &#224; nous,
pouvoirs publics, d'appuyer les ONG dans la mesure o&ugrave; elles en ont besoin.
<p>
     L'axe prioritaire d'intervention des ONG du Nord, et donc de l'appui officiel &#224;
celles-ci, doit en cons&#233;quence viser - directement ou &#224; l'occasion de programmes
de d&#233;veloppement - le renforcement institutionnel de la capacit&#233; d'action autonome
des partenaires Sud.
<p>
     La coop&#233;ration officielle de la Communaut&#233; europ&#233;enne ressent le
besoin de faire une place aux ONG europ&#233;ennes, car elles connaissent souvent mieux que
les administrations le terrain et les partenaires de base et elles ont des approches de
d&#233;veloppement originales. Certes, les ONG Nord ont souvent commenc&#233; en faisant
les choses elles-m&#234;mes au Sud;  c'est fr&#233;quemment encore le cas, parfois pour de
bonnes raisons (situations catastrophiques, manque de partenaires, ...). Mais de plus en plus elles
sont l&#224; principalement pour appuyer les programmes et le renforcement institutionnel de
leurs partenaires.  C'est un nouveau partenariat qui est en cause, qui ne saurait non plus se
limiter &#224; une fonction de bailleur de fonds.
<p>
     Ces principes sont maintenant de rigueur dans la plupart des pays en d&#233;veloppement
car la vie associative y a pris une grande extension, m&#234;me en Afrique o&ugrave; le
mouvement s'est d&#233;velopp&#233; plus r&#233;cemment.
<p>
     Enfin, les responsables des politiques  de coop&#233;ration ont aussi besoin des ONG
pour leur r&#244;le dans les pays du Nord. On a d&#233;j&#224; mentionn&#233; la
mobilisation des populations pour le d&#233;veloppement. Mais il y a plus.  Une politique de
v&#233;ritable coop&#233;ration va &#224; l'encontre d'id&#233;es simplistes, de
pr&#233;jug&#233;s, d'int&#233;r&#234;ts &#233;conomiques et politiques.  Or les
b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires, au Sud, de politiques de coop&#233;ration ne voteront pas aux
prochaines &#233;lections pour les politiciens du Nord qui auront voulu les aider. Ceux-ci ont
donc besoin d'un lobby du d&#233;veloppement pour contrebalancer les lobbies d&#233;fendant
d'autres int&#233;r&#234;ts puissants.
<p>
     Les ONG ont &#233;galement &#224; faire constamment pression, dans l'opinion et sur
les gouvernants, pour de nouvelles approches de relations internationales plus
&#233;quilibr&#233;es, dans la reconnaissance d'une fondamentale interd&#233;pendance Nord-
Sud.  Enfin elles sont amen&#233;es &#224; se faire l'&#233;cho chez nous des populations
et ONG du Sud.
<p>
     Un domaine central de la collaboration entre la Communaut&#233; et les ONG reste,
depuis 1976, celui du cofinancement d'actions structurelles pour le d&#233;veloppement : projets
de d&#233;veloppement dans les PVD et sensibilisation de l'opinion europ&#233;ennes.
<p>
     Relevons un caract&#232;re original de ce domaine de collaboration.  S'il est bien
s&ucirc;r au service des grands objectifs g&#233;n&#233;raux de la politique europ&#233;enne
de coop&#233;ration, qui sont aussi ceux des ONG, celles-ci n'y sont jamais
consid&#233;r&#233;es  comme de simples ex&#233;cutants au service d'objectifs particuliers
des pouvoirs publics. Les cr&#233;dits disponibles sont l&#224; pour appuyer les initiatives
prises par ces repr&#233;sentants de la soci&#233;t&#233; civile que sont les ONG, quitte
&#224; ce que des objectifs plus sp&#233;cifiques puissent &#234;tre identifi&#233;s en
concertation entre les ONG et la Commission ou le Parlement et faire l'objet d'une convergence
d'action. 
<p>
     Mais le r&#244;le des ONG s'est &#233;tendu &#224; travers toutes les politiques de
coop&#233;ration de la Communaut&#233;, &#224; l'initiative des pouvoirs publics ou &#224;
la demande des ONG.  Un cas bien connu est celui des aides d'urgence, o&ugrave; les ONG
tiennent une place consid&#233;rable. Il en est bien d'autres : aides alimentaires, inventions
sp&#233;cifiques dans des secteurs ou dans des pays particuliers, interventions dans des
programmes officiels.
<p>
     Face &#224; la multiplicit&#233; des services administratifs concern&#233;s, parfois
moins sensibles &#224; la sp&#233;cificit&#233; et &#224; la n&#233;cessaire autonomie des
ONG, face au d&#233;sir de ces services et des institutions communautaires de voir les ONG
les aider &#224; poursuivre des objectifs particuliers, face enfin au probl&#232;me d'obtenir
un minimum de coh&#233;rence entre les interventions des diff&#233;rents acteurs du
d&#233;veloppement, il est in&#233;vitable que des probl&#232;mes et incompr&#233;hensions
aient surgi. D'autant plus que certaines organisations, se pr&#233;sentant comme ONG, ont plus
un profil de bureau de consultants &#224; la recherche de contrats.
<p>
     Si l'on ne veut pas tuer la poule aux oeufs d'or, si l'on veut sauvegarder l'approche
originale des ONG qui justifie qu'on leur accorde une telle importance, les probl&#232;mes
devront &#234;tre affront&#233;s ouvertement. Il faut apprendre &#224; combiner les objectifs
et m&#233;thodes des ONG et des pouvoirs publics, dans le respect du r&#244;le de chacun et
dans celui de l'autonomie des ONG.  Cela ne pourra se faire sans v&#233;ritable concertation
entre les parties, tant sur les politiques g&#233;n&#233;rales que sur des programmes
sp&#233;cifiques.
<p>
     C'est sans doute difficile. Ce n'est certainement pas impossible, si les deux
c&#244;t&#233;s respectent un code de conduite ad&#233;quat. Un aspect important &#224;
cet &#233;gard est la r&#232;gle selon laquelle, sauf dans des domaines ou des cas
justifi&#233;s, l'appui des pouvoirs publics est un co-financement, l'ONG apportant, par son
propre apport de ressources, la preuve de la mobilisation du groupe qu'elle repr&#233;sente.

Un premier rapport sur la coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e</h2>
<h4>
<p>
Texte int&#233;gral d'une actualit&#233; parue dans <i>le Courrier
ACP-UE</i><br>No. 157, mai-juin 1996</h4>
<h5>(N.B.: Ce texte peut diverger quelque de la version originale)

<hr>
Un rapport sur les premi&#232;res ann&#233;es d'exp&#233;rience en mati&#232;re de
coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e a &#233;t&#233; approuv&#233; par la Commission en
vue de l'information du Conseil et du Parlement europ&#233;en.
<p>
L'extension rapide de ce type de coop&#233;ration de 1993 &#224; 1995 a permis de fournir un
travail substantiel bas&#233; sur un nombre important de projets et programmes
d&#233;centralis&#233;s qui autorisent certaines conclusions g&#233;n&#233;rales &#224; partir
des exp&#233;riences r&#233;alis&#233;es ou en cours.
<p>
La coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e ne se veut pas un instrument nouveau, mais
davantage une approche diff&#233;rente, compl&#233;mentaire des modes traditionnels de
conception et de mise en oeuvre de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement.  Elle vise
l'ensemble des r&#233;gions d'intervention de la coop&#233;ration : pays ACP, pays et territoires
d'outre-mer, pays d'Am&#233;rique latine et d'Asie et pays m&#233;diterran&#233;ens.
<p>
Il importe de noter que le pr&#233;sent rapport ne couvre pas tous les domaines et acteurs de
d&#233;veloppement qui rel&#232;vent de la coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e dans son
acception la plus large.  En particulier, il ne concerne pas la promotion du r&ocirc;le des
entreprises et le d&#233;veloppement du secteur priv&#233; qui, tout en relevant de la m&ecirc;me
orientation g&#233;n&#233;rale, recourent &#224; des instruments et m&#233;thodes particuliers
en raison de la sp&#233;cificit&#233; des actions dans ces domaines et ont d&#233;j&#224; fait
l'objet de rapports sp&#233;cifiques.
<p>
Sont donc principalement concern&#233;s les pouvoirs publics locaux et la vie associative au sens
large.
<p>
Ce premier bilan met en relief la diversit&#233; des exp&#233;riences - et surtout des lectures qui
sont faites de la coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e - et les multiples d&#233;clinaisons
op&#233;rationnelles auxquelles elle donne lieu en fonction des r&#233;alit&#233;s des
diff&#233;rentes aires g&#233;ographiques.  Il montre aussi qu'il s'agit d'un champ de
r&#233;flexion et d'action en pleine &#233;volution, aux perspectives encore inexploit&#233;es. 
<p>
Dans les pays m&#233;diterran&#233;ens, d'Am&#233;rique latine et d'Asie, ce type de
coop&#233;ration avec les pouvoirs publics locaux ou r&#233;gionaux ainsi qu'avec les
universit&#233;s et les ONG se d&#233;veloppe de plus en plus.  C'es &#233;galement
l'orientation prise dans un nombre croissant de pays ACP o&ugrave; la collaboration avec les ONG
et les pouvoirs locaux, mais aussi le secteur priv&#233;, prend une place de plus en plus
importante.
<p>
Pour conclure, le rapport met en exergue trois angles d'attaque pour d&#233;velopper la
coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e :
<ul>
<li>jeter les bases d'un dialogue plus soutenu avec les acteurs de la coop&#233;ration
d&#233;centralis&#233;e dans les PVD  de pr&#233;f&#233;rence &#224; l'&#233;chelle des pays
ou de sous-ensembles r&#233;gionaux  ;
<li>renforcer le dialogue avec les acteurs potentiels de la coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e
en Europe, le Comit&#233; de liaison des ONG pouvant, en particulier, jouer un r&ocirc;le
important dans la concertation entre ces derniers et les institutions europ&#233;ennes ;
<li>cr&#233;er plus de souplesse et de compl&#233;mentarit&#233; entre les instruments de l'aide de
fa&#231;on &#224; ce que la coop&#233;ration d&#233;centralis&#233;e puisse prendre toute sa
place dans les politiques et programmes de l'UE.

Ireland's aid programme and the provision of expert advice to the
Minister for Foreign Affairs on matters relating to development
cooperation and policy aspects of the aid programme.

facing developing countries, IAAC considered it appropriate to
initiate a fresh examination of the education sector and to study
and reflect on the issues facing Irish Aid to education in the
coming years.  This focus also stemmed from a concern about the
lack of a clear policy on Irish Aid educational assistance to
developing countries, particularly in light of the Department of
Foreign Affairs statement in the Strategy Plan of 1993 that "as
well as identifying individual new projects, longer term
strategic planning is necessary" (p21).
<p>
In order to move towards the emergence of a clear and consistent
policy document on Irish Aid educational assistance, IAAC
initiated a 3 part strategy:
<ol>
<li>A study on Irish Aid and Education was commissioned in
     September 1994;
<li>On publication of the study, a one-day consultative seminar
     was held in March 1995;
<li>A comprehensive report on Irish Aid and Education including
     recommendations to the Minister was formulated by IAAC.
</ol>
<p>
<A NAME="stu"><H3>1.2   Study on Irish Aid and Education</H3></A>
<p>
In September 1994, IAAC commission Ms Cathy Gaynor to undertake
a study on Irish Aid and Education, under the guidance of a sub-
committee.  The study examined the dimensions of a policy and
strategy for Irish Aid support to education in developing
countries.  It provided an overview of current issues in
education in developing countries and of recent Irish
involvement, both official and non-governmental, in the education
sector.  It outlined the findings from a literature review and
from discussions with, and information provided by, Irish
agencies and individuals.  It analyzed recent trends in Irish Aid
to education and made suggestions on possible principles and
strategies for future Irish Aid to education.  It was intended
that the study would facilitate the process of formulation of an
Irish Aid Policy on education and its implementation.
<p>
The study entitled "Irish Aid and Education: Strategic
Challenges.  Setting Priorities for Irish Aid Assistance to 
Education in the Developing World", was published in December
1994.  
<p>

<A NAME="con"><H3>1.3   Consultative Seminar on Irish Aid and Education</H3></A>
<p>
Following the publication of Ms Gaynor's study, IAAC hosted a
one-day Consultative Seminar on Irish Aid and Education on March
27th 1995.  The aim of the Seminar was to provide a forum to hear
the views of the many individuals, NGOs, missionary organisations
and academic institutions involved in education in developing
countries both on issues raised in the study and on other issues
pertaining to education and development policy.  The study was
also circulated to all Development Cooperation Offices for their
observations/comments.
<p>
At the Seminar, Ms Cathy Gaynor outlined the study and its
findings and recommendations.  Four guest speakers then addressed
the Seminar on targeted aspects of the study:
<ul>
<li>The Place of Education in the Irish Aid Programme
     Mr John Grindle, Development Consultant
<li>Priorities for Irish Aid to Education
     Dr Dzingai Mutumbuka, Senior Education Specialist, World
     Bank
<li>Effective Delivery of Irish Aid to Education
     Mr Mike Kiernan, Chief Technical Advisor for Education,
     DANIDA
<li>Structures to Utilize and Strengthen Irish Educational
     Expertise for Development
     Sr Aoife Hynes, Loreto Sisters.
</ul>
<p>
The Seminar then broke into Working Groups where participants
addressed the above issues in detail.
<p>
It was intended that suggestions, recommendations and issues
emanating from the Seminar would be taken on board by IAAC when
formulating their final Report to the Minister.
<p>

<A NAME="rec"><H3>1.4 IAAC Recommendations on Irish Aid and Education</H3></A>
<p>
Having received Ms Cathy Gaynor's comprehensive and challenging
study on Irish Aid and Education and having studied the
recommendations and observations emanating from the Seminar, IAAC
is now in a position to highlight key issues in the area of Irish
Aid to education in developing countries and to outline
principles and priorities for the development of a comprehensive
policy on education in Irish Aid.  IAAC recommendations are
synopsised in this section.  The reader is referred to section
2 of this report for more in-depth discussion and elaboration of
the issues and recommendations.

<p>
<H3>1.5 Summary of Recommendations</H3>


<H4>     RECOMMENDATION 1</H4>
<p>
     - that a permanent structure with expertise in education be
     established in Irish Aid with responsibility for:
          a)  continually evolving and developing Irish Aid
          policy on education;
          b) monitoring criteria for all aid allocation to
          education projects and programmes;
          c) establishing effective procedures for the
          continuous monitoring and evaluation of education
          projects and programmes supported by Irish Aid;
          d) developing structures and strategies to facilitate
          networking and collaboration between all those
          involved in education in the developing world.
<p>
<H4>RECOMMENDATION 2</H4>
<p>
     - that this Report from IAAC, which is based on Ms.Cathy
     Gaynor's study and the ensuing consultative process, be
     adopted as the starting point for the development of a
     comprehensive policy on education in Irish Aid. 
<p>
<H4>RECOMMENDATION 3</H4>
<p>
     - that the current level of Irish Aid support to education
     projects and programmes be maintained.
<p>
<H4>RECOMMENDATION 4:</H4>
 
     - that Irish Aid to education should place major emphasis
     on support for primary and basic education.
<p>

 <H4>RECOMMENDATION 5:</H4>
<p>
     - that support for secondary and tertiary education be
     maintained where necessary and appropriate.
<p>
<H4>RECOMMENDATION 6: </H4>
<p>
     - that a study be undertaken on non-formal education in
     developing countries and that the importance of non-formal
     education continue to be recognised by strengthening
     support for NGOs engaged in non-formal educational
     activities.
<p>

<H4>RECOMMENDATION 7: </H4>
<p>
     - that a proportion of the fellowship budget be allocated
     to fellowships which directly support the education system
     in developing countries and that the fellowship scheme be
     continually monitored to ensure its effectiveness.
<p>
<H4>RECOMMENDATION 8:</H4>
<p>
     - that all Irish Aid support for education be based on
     three principles:
<p>
          -    an increase in host countries capacity to plan
               and manage education;
          -    improvement in educational access and equity; and
          -    improvement in the quality of education.
<p>
<H4>RECOMMENDATION 9:</H4>
<p>
     - that APSO develop a strategy on its support to the
     education sector consistent with Irish Aid policy.

Public enterprise boards in Africa:<br>Mandates and
capacities<br>
<i>Anthony Land and Joan Corkery</i><p></h3>
<h5>(Summary of ECDPM Policy Management Brief Number 4, July 1995)<br>

<hr>
Public enterprise reform has been a central element in programmes of structural adjustment in
Africa since the 1980s. Privatisation has been advanced as the way to reduce the budgetary
burden on the state, and create opportunities for private sector involvement in key areas of the
economy.
<p>
Privatisation has, however, fallen short of expectations. Large scale and rapid divestiture in
countries with an under-developed private sector has been difficult. There is also some evidence
that, in certain circumstances, public enterprises can actually play an effective role in social and
economic development. Measures to enhance the performance of enterprises where privatisation
is not an appropriate option have therefore grown in importance. Enhancing the governance
structure, including the role of the board, has begun to attract attention from managers and
policy-makers.
<p>
Of particular concern is the delicate balancing act that boards must play. In effect, they are the
meeting point between government and executive management. Their role and how they
discharge it are critical to achieving the balance between the organisational autonomy seen as
necessary by managers of the enterprise, and the control required by government. 
<p>
Drawing on the findings of studies conducted in Ghana and Sierra Leone, this brief considers
the requirements for boards to be effective, and it suggests ways in which constraints to board
performance can be overcome. It concentrates on two areas. First, on the need for boards to
have mandates which clearly define their roles, and their relationships with other elements of the
governance structure, and second, on the need for boards to have sufficient capacity to discharge
their mandate.

<i>Anthony Land et Joan Corkery</i><p></h3>

<hr>
La r&#233;forme de l'entreprise publique a &#233;t&#233; un &#233;l&#233;ment central des
programmes d'ajustement structurel men&#233;s en Afrique depuis les ann&#233;es quatre-
vingts. La privatisation a souvent &#233;t&#233; propos&#233;e comme un moyen permettant
la r&#233;duction du fardeau budg&#233;taire de l'Etat et la cr&#233;ation
d'opportunit&#233;s impliquant le secteur priv&#233; dans des zones clefs de l'&#233;conomie.
<p>
La privatisation cependant n'a pas tenu ses promesses. Un d&#233;sengagement rapide et de
grande envergure dans des pays o&#249; le secteur priv&#233; est sous-d&#233;velopp&#233;
a &#233;t&#233; difficile. Il appara&#140;t aussi que, dans certains cas, les entreprises publiques
peuvent r&#233;ellement jouer un r&#244;le efficace dans le d&#233;veloppement social et
&#233;conomique. Par cons&#233;quent, des mesures visant &#224; accro&#140;tre les performances
des entreprises pour lesquelles la privatisation n'est pas une option appropri&#233;e ont acquis
une nouvelle importance. Le d&#233;veloppement des structures de direction, sans oublier le
r&#244;le du conseil d'administration, a commenc&#233; &#224; attirer l'attention des
managers et des d&#233;cideurs politiques.
<p>
L'&#233;quilibre d&#233;licat que les conseils d'administration sont amen&#233;s &#224;
&#233;tablir pr&#233;sente un int&#233;r&#234;t particulier. En effet, c'est &#224; ce niveau
que se rencontrent le gouvernement et la direction ex&#233;cutive. Leur r&#244;le et la fa&#135;on
dont ils le remplissent sont essentiels pour assurer l'&#233;quilibre entre l'autonomie
organisationnelle jug&#233;e n&#233;cessaire par la direction de l'entreprise, et le con
tr&#244;le impos&#233; par le gouvernement.
<p>
En s'appuyant sur les r&#233;sultats d'&#233;tudes men&#233;es au Ghana et en Sierra Leone,
cette Notice consid&#232;re que les contraintes qui p&#232;sent sur les conseils d'administration
sont r&#233;elles et sugg&#232;re des moyens d'en venir &#224; bout. Elle se concentre sur
deux domaines: d'abord, sur la n&#233;cessit&#233; pour les conseils de disposer de mandats
d&#233;finissant clairement leur r&#244;le et leurs relations avec les autres composantes de la
structure de direction; ensuite, sur la n&#233;cessit&#233; pour les conseils de disposer des
moyens permettant l'acquittement de ces mandats.

<hr>
<P>
A crucial debate has begun on the future of European Union (EU)
development co-operation which will culminate in a new generation
of international agreements in the year 2000. The conclusions
to this debate will have far-reaching consequences for people
living in poverty and conflict across the globe.
<P>
This paper sets out the principles which <I>Eurostep</I> believes
should act as the foundations of the debate. They derive from
a vision that the EU must provide international leadership in
promoting growth with equity for human development. Trade, aid
and investment instruments available to the EU must be directed
at poverty reduction, sustainable development and reducing conflict
which markets alone will not achieve. 
<P>
<A NAME=es1></A><B>1. Geographical Focus</B>
<P>
The nature of the next generation of co-operation for development
should be defined within a single framework agreement setting
out its principles, aims and concrete objectives defined by a
limited number of social and economic indicators of success in
terms of transforming poor peoples' lives.
<P>
Within this framework there should be a special agreement with
an evolving ACP group which rapidly changes its nature to a group
of nations with lower human development indicators combined with
a proven commitment to reaching clear development goals. These
will be achieved through strategies which include collaboration
with the EU in development co-operation and action in concert
at multilateral fora in the negotiation of global agreements on
trade, investment and structural adjustment.
<P>
Within this evolving ACP group,  grants should be restricted to
low income countries and programmes in middle income countries
aimed directly at assisting the poorest in education, health,
and sustainable livelihoods. Non-reciprocal trade agreements should
be expanded to a broader set of low income countries with special
emphasis given to trade in sectors where there is strong potential
for poverty reduction and the promotion of equity.
<P>
<A NAME=es2></A><B>2. Aid With Impact - Investing in Social Development</B>
<P>
Given the real cuts in ODA across Europe in the last five years,
member states and the European Community should seek to reverse
this trend in total EU aid. Any increase in aid controlled by
the Community should be contingent on proof of high quality through
investing in social development; promoting participation; insisting
on coherence of wider trade and investment policies with development
co-operation objectives; concrete human development targets; and
improved impact assessment.
<P>
There is an urgent need for rebalancing the geographic distribution
of EU aid and trade agreements in favour of LDCs if it is to remain
coherent with the EU's expressed development goals in Chapter
17 of the Maastricht Treaty.
<P>
Public support for EU development co-operation rests on the belief
that it reduces poverty, increases human security, and is sustainable.
For this support to be sustained, <I>Eurostep</I> believes the
next generation of EU aid must invest at least 50 per cent of
funds in social development as agreed at the World Summit on Social
Development. This will include:
<UL>
<LI>The basic social services identified in the 20:20 compact:
basic education, primary health care, nutrition, safe drinking
water and sanitation.
<LI>Support to income generating projects for poor people in rural
areas and the urban informal sector. This should aim to improve
the competitiveness of small and medium-sized businesses in labour
intensive industries through credit, training, marketing information,
technology transfer, infrastructure.
<LI>A commitment to implement the gender policy of the European
Community and direct development co-operation to promote the equal
participation of women in society and women's right to equality,
including in land, property, and credit.
<LI>Strengthening social organisations (farmers, women, trade
unions, human rights) to increase their influence and promote
growth with equity.
</UL>

<P>
<A NAME=es3></A><B>3. Debt Reduction</B>
<P>
The Commission should use its development tools to support debt
relief to the evolving ACP group. It should also informally co-ordinate
EU member states at the World Bank and IMF to guarantee coherence
with the EU's stated goals of poverty eradication and gradual
integration of developing countries into the global economy.
<P>
<A NAME=es4></A><B>4. Conflict Prevention and Resolution</B>
<P>
Human security must be central to future EU development co-operation.
This will demand:
<UL>
<LI>A future approach to development which is mindful of how co-operation
can ease or foment conflict. All programmes should be assessed
according to criteria which indicate their contribution to promoting
equity while managing the inevitable tensions of social change.
<LI>An approach which addresses the structural roots of conflict
and contribute to actors having a greater stake in peace than
war.
<LI>Adequate resources to guarantee the right to protection from
violence of civilians, particularly women and children.
<LI>Support to women's role in reducing social tension, and their
often central role in prevention, reconstruction and rehabilitation.
<LI>Coherence of the Common Foreign and Security Policy with the
EU's development co-operation objectives.
<LI>Humanitarian aid must be rebalanced to make its distribution
between regions of conflict proportionate to the threat which
emergencies pose to the rights of victims. Currently 45 per cent
of the budget is skewed to central and eastern Europe and the
former Soviet Union. 
<LI>Humanitarian aid should demonstrate cost-effectiveness and
high quality. The latter would be reinforced by joining with NGOs
in developing standards in the provision of water, food, shelter,
and health.

<P>
<A NAME=es5></A><B>5. Trade and Investment</B>
<P>
To be effective in promoting human development, the EU must integrate
its trade policy and development assistance strategy, in dialogue
with southern governments. Eurostep proposes a negotiation to
draw up a new trade agreement with the evolving ACP group which
would:
<UL>
<LI>Establish explicit development objectives, including the promotion
of growth with equity, poverty reduction, food security, worker's
rights and environmental improvement. These social and environmental
goals in trade should be assisted through technology transfer,
debt relief and concessional finance.
<LI>Extend the preferences currently given to ACP countries to
other developing countries with low human development indicators
and strong commitment to improvement.
<LI>A new approach to trade preferences, particularly those which
are non-reciprocal, which will allow them to be targeted effectively
at products which are particularly helpful to poor producers and
sectors where minimum standards of worker's rights are guaranteed.
</UL>


<P>
<A NAME=es5.1></A><B>5.1 Regional Trade Agreements</B>
<P>
At this time, regional and inter-regional trade agreements are
being uses to pursue rapid and indiscriminate liberalisation of
trade and investment. To ensure potential benefits promote growth
with equity, the EU should seek agreements designed to maximise
the opportunities of the poor majorities in developing countries
while not undermining their livelihoods and food security.
<P>
Regional agreements should also receive strong technical assistance
from the EU to support the establishment of regional competition
policies and business regulation, to guard against unfair competition
which stymies indigenous companies and domestic investment.
<P>
<A NAME=es5.2></A><B>5.2 A New EU and LDC Agreement and the WTO</B>
<P>
If the EU and LDCs build an integrated trade and development policy
for the next era they should seek to lead global debates on international
trade and investment. Acting in concert at the WTO for common
goals, these two groups would form a substantial bloc in an organisation
of one country one vote. The coming debates on social and environmental
clauses, and reviews of TRIMs and TRIPs provide an opportunity
for collaboration with enormous influence and mutual long term
benefits.
<P>
<A NAME=es6></A><B>6. Partnership and Participation</B>
<P>
Partnership, as a fundamental principle of the Lome agreements,
has shown itself to be a powerful development tool involving equality
between partners, respect for sovereignty, solidarity and mutual
interdependence. <I>Eurostep</I> believes these principles must
be preserved in future framework agreements. While this paper
proposes social conditionality on aid, we believe this is not
in contradiction with partnership if the following conditions
are  met:
<UL>
<LI>Conditionality based on universal human rights enshrined in
international law.
<LI>The design of transparent criteria and objective mechanisms,
universally applied.
</UL>

<P>
The concept of partnership must also be extended to foster greater
participation of social organisations, including NGOs in the design,
implementation and evaluation of policies and programmes.
<P>
<A NAME=es7></A><B>7. Harmonising EU Policy</B>
<P>
One of the principle indicators of the EU's commitment to human
development will be whether coherence is established between its
development co-operation objectives and its trade, agricultural,
fisheries, and common foreign and security policies. The paper
makes particular recommendations for each of these areas.
<P>
<P>
<I>Eurostep</I> has produced this paper as a contribution to the
debates that are now taking place on the future shape and form
of the European Union development co-operation agreements.  The
perspectives set out in the paper are drawn from the experiences
gain in development of <I>Eurostep's</I> member organisations
through their involvement in development programmes in Africa,
Asia and Latin America.  The paper was prepared by the Oxfam-UKI
Policy Department in consultation with other member organisations

<h3>Executive Summary</h3>
<P>
There are two basic facts which should be borne in mind by the
governments who will review the EU's foreign policy as part of
the Inter-Governmental Conference (IGC) during 1996 and 1997.
 The first is that one in four of the world's people live in a
state of absolute want  -  and that number is increasing.  The
second is that 27 million of these people are in that state because
they have been forced to flee from wars: the number of refugees
and displaced people has increased by nearly 60 per cent in the
last five years.  
<P>
When the Maastricht Treaty was agreed in December 1991, it committed
the EU to a &quot;campaign against poverty<I>&quot;</I> around
the world, and set up the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP),
one of the aims of which was to improve Europe's contribution
to preserving international peace.  That neither aim has been
successful is perhaps obvious; poverty and the suffering caused
by conflicts have increased more in the 1990s than at any time
for 50 years.  This paper argues that the EU has not simply been
swamped by global trends but has failed because of a lack of political
will to seriously tackle issues beyond its narrowest interests.
 In this, EU foreign policy since Maastricht compares unfavourably
with positive interventions in the 1980s such as those in central
America.
<P>
The IGC, launched at the Turin summit in March 1996, will review
the incipient CFSP and set its course for the future.  This comes
at a time when the EU and its members are widely seen to have
failed even where they have focused  -  in former Yugoslavia 
-  as well as having offered little to prevent the spreading conflicts
in many parts of Africa and Asia.  Of these, the situation in
Rwanda, Burundi and their neighbours continues to be one of the
starkest examples.
<P>
EU governments now have an opportunity to revise the CFSP in order
to improve their collective impact internationally  -  and to
tackle the big challenges of reducing poverty and insecurity in
line with the broad principles to which they committed themselves
in the Maastricht Treaty.
 
<P>
This paper argues that EU foreign policy has failed to address
these global challenges for two basic reasons:
<UL>
<LI>The excessive concentration on perceived threats to a fortress
Europe<I> </I>from central and eastern Europe, and the Mediterranean.
 Though it is inevitable that these areas figure highly in the
EU's priorities, and indeed many of <I>Eurostep's </I>member organisations
are responding to the very real poverty in these regions, the
paper argues that this concentration has been carried to a disproportionate
extreme which has been at the expense of the EU's developing a
global foreign policy.
<LI>The failure to implement the Maastricht Treaty's commitment
that all EU policy to developing countries should help to foster
&quot;sustainable economic and social development&quot;.<I> </I>The
objectives of the EU as the world's largest aid donor have been
undermined by the failure to direct the CFSP towards the prevention
of conflicts and the abuse of basic rights which are at their
root.  This has produced a continuing lack of &quot;coherence&quot;<I>
</I>(in the language of the EU)<I> </I> between the CFSP and the
EU's development cooperation and humanitarian aid.
</UL>

<P>
Both these trends have been made possible by the vagueness of
the Maastricht Treaty's mandate for the CFSP, which the IGC will
now be able to revise.
<P>
Preparing for the IGC, EU member governments appear to be divided
into those who, on the one hand, take a narrow, short-term view,
and those taking a wider and longer-term perspective of the EU's
interests.  <I>Eurostep </I>argues for the latter view: that the
CFSP requires a clear purpose based upon the protection of basic
rights around the world, wholly consistent with the need to uphold
what Maastricht called  -  but did not define  -  the EU's &quot;common
values&quot; and &quot;fundamental interests&quot;.<I>   </I>
<P>
The paper sets out how the IGC could revise the CFSP mandate to explicitly commit it to:
<UL>
<LI>uphold human rights and humanitarian law
<LI>work for the prevention and resolution of conflicts, including
those within states
<LI>a global scope, not limited to Europe's &quot;near abroad&quot;
<LI>&quot;coherence&quot; with the Maastricht Treaty's commitment
to &quot;campaign against poverty in developing countries&quot;,
and ensuring a coordinated approach to reducing poverty through
its development cooperation, trade and humanitarian aid policies
</UL>

<P>
Such a mandate should lead to:
<UL>
<LI>increased EU development aid, essential for the long-term
stability of many regions
<LI>wider-ranging and more determined preventive diplomacy, using
all of the EU's range of incentives and pressures on contending
parties to avert conflicts
<LI>using the influence of the single largest group of shareholders
in the World Bank and IMF to ensure poverty-reduction is placed
at the heart of the design of economic reform programmes
<LI>greater support for the UN and Third World regional organisations
in their own efforts to support truly sustainable peace and development.
</UL>

<P>
It would not be fair to condemn the EU as the only political entity
whose foreign policy has floundered in the post-Cold War world.
 Nor is it the only one to exhibit the same two trends of disengaging
from those parts of the developing world which it no longer perceives
to represent an economic or strategic interest, and using aid
as an alternative to, not as a part of,  a &quot;coherent&quot;
approach to reducing poverty and increasing security.  Since November
1994, the influence of the US Congress has accelerated these trends
in US foreign policy.
<P>
The challenge to the EU and its member states is not to follow
the US into isolationism, not to allow the UN and other global
institutions to wither, but to make Europe a leading, united and
positive player in international relations.  The paper concludes
by arguing that the EU, in concert with governments North and
South, must play a key role in injecting new momentum into the
UN and making it an effective and indispensable global organisation.
<P>
<h3>The Inter-Governmental Conference</h3>
<P>
The sixth Inter-Governmental Conference of the EU's member states
will not only decide how Europe is to develop into the twenty-first
century.  It will also set out the role which Europe can play
in a rapidly changing world.  As part of its mandate the IGC is
set to review the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy which
came into being in November 1993, established at Maastricht in
an attempt to give greater cohesion to European governments' international
relations.
<P>
The IGC was formally convened by the Madrid EU summit on 16 December
1995 and opened on 29 March, under the EU's current Italian Presidency.
 The negotiations will continue through the Irish Presidency in
the second half of 1996, into the Dutch Presidency in early and
may not reach a conclusion until the Luxembourg Presidency which
ends in December 1997.

 
<P>
<B>A rapidly-changing world  -  a slowly changing EU</B>
<P>
The six years since the Berlin Wall came down in November 1989
have seen an unprecedented increase in the scale of conflicts
in many parts of the world, and the consequent human suffering.
 The UN High Commissioner for Refugees reported in November 1995
that the number of people who have fled from wars  -  almost all
internal  -  has risen to twenty-seven million, ten million more
than at the beginning of this decade.  
<P>
As many as 43 countries (one in four of UN member states) are
now caught up in major refugee crises  -  each one involving more
than 100,000 people  -  as states either producing or receiving
that number of refugees.  At the same time, a quarter of the world's
population now live in a state of absolute want, denied their
basic rights to vital necessities, a sustainable livelihood  -
 and, frequently, protection from violence.
<P>
Behind much of this violence is a world where there is more inequality
and where many people are becoming very much poorer.  The poorest
fifth of the world's population, living beyond the margins of
the global economy,  now have incomes which are no higher than
4 per cent of those of the richest fifth.  With 35 per cent of
the world's land already degraded, the pressure on such marginalised
people to fight over dwindling resources has also contributed,
arguably to a very significant extent, to conflicts in countries
such as Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi and Mali.  Thousands find that
they can indeed profit through war, as in Bosnia, Sierra Leone
and Sudan.  The 1990s has become the least stable decade since
the 1940s.
<P>
As insecurity has risen, the response of the international community
has been weakened by the growing isolationism in the US and in
Europe; and the decline in support for the UN as a vehicle for
both development and collective security. The heady optimism of
1990-91, when it was hoped that the Cold War would be replaced
by peace, has evaporated.  In its place, we see a vacuum of will
 -  a refusal by most governments to seriously engage in problems
beyond their short-term interests.
<P>
The EU and its member states taken together, are the world's largest
donor of aid  -  4.054 billion ecu in 1994, representing  46.4
per cent of total Official Development Aid from all OECD countries
 -  and a major contributor to UN peace-keeping missions.  As
such, they carry a significant part of the burden of picking up
the pieces of the world's conflicts.  Yet the CFSP has not developed
into an effective diplomatic tool to help prevent conflict.  In
short, the spiralling scale of conflict in much of the world has
far outstripped the EU's response to it, and alongside the massive
human suffering caused, the citizens of the EU are paying a price
for the failure to invest more in preventive diplomacy and the
lack of political will to address some of the underlying causes.
  
<P>
EU member governments do not lack capacity.  Even with current
restrictions on spending, no other body besides the US combines
the EU members' diplomatic, financial, political and military
capacity  -  and therefore the potential both to exert a wide
range of pressures and incentives on contending parties to avert
or end conflicts, and to provide reconstruction aid to help make
peace endure.  What is lacking is the ability of EU member states
to direct some of that capacity towards clear and common goals,
which will require much greater coordination of foreign and security
policy than the CFSP procedures currently deliver.
<P>
The oft-stated description of the EU as an economic giant but
a political dwarf remains true.  The EU's role in harmonising
world trade in the final GATT Uruguay Round, and in establishing
the World Trade Organisation, demonstrated its global economic
leverage as never before.  But meanwhile the CFSP, as currently
operating, continues to highlight the EU's political weakness.
<P>
<B>Near neighbours</B>
<P>
Even the EU's policy towards the conflict in former Yugoslavia,
which was prioritised as a foreign policy issue, failed.  The
early aim of maintaining the status quo ante showed a failure
to appreciate the gravity of the crisis, which was then compounded
by the hopeful assumption that promises of EU aid and economic
sanctions would be enough to stop the brutal excesses of Serb
and Croat nationalism.  Indeed, the EU's recognition of Croatia
and Slovenia in January 1992, at Germany's behest, is widely credited
with making the crisis worse rather than better.
<P>
Only with reluctance did the UK and France eventually accept the
US strategy of using force to protect UN<I> &quot;</I>safe areas&quot;,<I>
</I>after Srebrenica fell in July 1995.  Under the US leadership
the parties were pushed to the negotiating table in Dayton.  And
now, despite the $170 billion which EU members spend on their
defence (at 1994 figures), and their two million active service
personnel, it is also the US which provides the largest contingent
of the Implementation Force  -  and reaps most of the political
capital.
<P>
Turning to Europe's southern neighbours, the EU has played a significant
role in supporting the Middle East peace process, not only in
the 1990s but since the mid-1970s.  Yet EU policy towards the
Maghreb region of North Africa for most of this period has been
marked by a failure to look ahead.  Worsening levels of poverty
 -  unemployment rates of 40 per cent to 70 per cent in the cities
of Algeria and Morocco  -  have helped to create a highly combustible
sense of frustration, and increase the attractiveness of both
fundamentalist politics, and migration to southern Europe.  Yet
while Europe perceived a threat to its security, this was only
exacerbated by years of political inertia until Algeria's fundamentalists
won the (swiftly annulled) 1992 elections.  Europe and the international
community refused to reduce Algeria's crushing debt burden or
to provide development assistance and trading opportunities to
offer hope to increasingly marginalised populations.
<P>
More recent policy has been along the twin tracks of economic
support  -  writing off debts, billions of dollars of aid through
the IMF, the prospect of a free-trade area by 2010  - and the
request to NATO to develop a security network for 'protecting'
southern Europe from economic and political refugees and wider
instability in the region.  The Euro-Meditteranean Conference,
held in Barcelona in November 1995, committed the EU to a &quot;substantial
increase&quot;<I> </I>in aid and the progressive negotiation of
the free-trade area as part of a Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.  The process will be overseen by regular
meetings of EU and Mediterranean foreign ministers, the next being
in early 1997.  The question now to be asked is: would Europe's
security not have been better served, and the costs of NATO's
involvement reduced, if EU governments had decided earlier that
the Mediterranean was a region requiring such  &quot;preventive
development&quot;, the use of development assistance as a fundamental
part of a strategy to tackle poverty and marginalisation and to
help to prevent terrorism and conflict?
<P>
<B>Agreeing the CFSP</B>
<P>
Yet declarations by most western European governments that they
should speak with one voice to preserve a significant world role
are even older than the original Common Market, and were made
at the June 1955 conference in Messina, Sicily, which prepared
the way for future integration.  In 1969, the Hague summit established
European Political Cooperation (EPC) which became the forerunner
of the CFSP.  Then in 1991, the negotiations culminating in the
Maastricht summit sought to establish further practice on this
principle of diplomatic cooperation and to agree various mechanisms
and general aims.  As in all other aspects of EU policy, there
was some disagreement between the more and the less cautious member
states.  In the case of the CFSP, the UK was joined by Ireland
and Denmark arguing successfully for rather limited cooperation
on foreign policy.
<P>
When Title V of the Maastricht Treaty agreed in December 1991
to set up the CFSP, it set out its purpose in terms so general
that most of them could have been written at any time since Messina.
 They hardly reflected the fact that, even by 1991, Europe was
facing a very different world from that which had persisted under
the Cold War.  Maastricht's Article J.1 (2) stated the CFSP's
aims as:
<P>
<I> </I>To safeguard the common values, fundamental interests
and independence of the Union; to strengthen the security of the
Union and its member states in all ways; to preserve the peace
and strengthen international security, in accordance with the
principles of the United Nations Charter as well as the principles
of the Helsinki Final Act and the objectives of the Paris Charter;
to develop and consolidate the rule of law, and respect for human
rights and fundamental freedoms
<P>
 
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty was not consistently quite so vague on all
the EU's external policy.  Title XVII, which covers development
cooperation, includes (in Article 130u) commitments to foster:
&quot;the sustainable economic and social development of the developing
countries, and more particularly the most disadvantaged among
them . . (and to) campaign against poverty in the developing countries&quot;<I>.</I>
 Article 130v also stated that &quot;the Community shall take
account of the objectives referred to in Article 130u in the policies
that it implements which are likely to affect developing countries&quot;.
  
<P>
The EU thereby committed itself to eradicating poverty, to focusing
upon &quot;developing countries&quot;<I> </I>and to making efforts
towards the &quot;coherence&quot; of other external policy, including
the CFSP, with its development cooperation.  The Maastricht Treaty
recognised the moral and  -  in the long term  -  enlightened
self-interest of reversing the global trend of increasing poverty
and conflict.
<P>
<B>Looking east</B>
<P>
This commitment to &quot;developing countries&quot;, and the CFSP's
stated objective to strengthen &quot;<I>international </I>security&quot;<I>,
</I>might have been taken to mean that the EU would have a global
foreign policy, including support for the UN, responding to the
changes of an increasingly unstable world.  In effect, however,
the early years of the CFSP have seen a stark mismatch between
these ambitious but vague global principles and the reality of
a pursuit of ever narrower interests.
<P>
 
<P>
Following the priorities set at the EU's  Essen summit in December
1994, the EU has focused primarily on the security and stability
of the current EU's &quot;near abroad&quot; central and eastern
Europe (much of it envisaged to become part of the enlarged EU
over the next five to fifteen years) and the twelve Mediterranean
countries which may join the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership.
<P>
Though dominated by policy towards former Yugoslavia, there has
been a wider turning to the east, including the<I> </I>Stability
Pact<I>, </I>proposed by former French Premier Edouard Balladur
and agreed with nine prospective members of the EU in March 1995.
The Pact process codified existing international agreements and helped
to broker new ones on border disputes and minority rights, and
set up two regional round tables to help to diffuse tensions in
the Baltic states and in south-eastern Europe.
<P>
In presenting the Commission's report in November 1995 on the
EU's future enlargement, Commission President Jacques Santer reiterated
that successful enlargement to the east would be vital for the
peace and stability of Europe.  That the EU should focus considerable
resources on the east is quite justified, not only for that reason,
but also because of the region's increasing poverty, and the human
suffering which will follow a failure to prevent further conflict.
 For example, UNICEF reported in 1995 that, of the Russian population,
60 per cent were now below the poverty line, and 23.4 per cent
living in extreme poverty.  Even the more affluent countries of
central Europe, the so-called Visegrad Four  -  Slovenia, Hungary,
Poland and the Czech Republic  -  are poor by western European
standards; the last, the most prosperous country in central and
eastern Europe, has a per capita income only half that of the
EU average.
<P>
There are real prospects of further abuse of human rights, and
of conflict.  There are tensions over Russian minorities in the
former Soviet Baltic states, over Crimea's relations with the
Kiev central government, and over Hungarian minorities in central
Europe; and it is still possible that the precarious peace in
former Yugoslavia may collapse and conflict spread further south
into the Balkans.
<P>
The need for generous aid to the EU's neighbours around the Mediterranean
as well should not be in dispute.  But what is not justifiable
is the <I>disproportionate</I><B> </B>attention, and use of resources
in the Mediterranean, and central and eastern Europe, compared
to other regions of the world, many of which are home to more
people living in poverty, and at even more risk of further conflict.
 
<P>
The Human Development Index for each country, calculated annually
by the UN Development Program (UNDP) is the most widely respected
benchmark of comparative poverty around the world.  The latest
(1992) figures published in the 1995 <I>Human Development Report
</I>places only four European countries  -  Armenia, Azerbaijan,
Georgia and Romania  -  in the bottom half of the league table
of 174 states for which comparative statistics are available (which
does not include former Yugoslavia).  Most Maghreb countries also
lie near the middle of the league: for example, Algeria is number
85.  Without exception, all the states beneath 100 are in the
South, with a strong correlation between the low ranking and conflict.
 
<P>
The bottom twenty countries include Rwanda, Burundi, Liberia,
Sierra Leone, Angola, Mozambique, Afghanistan, Uganda, Mali, Ethiopia
and Somalia.  EU funds to those countries in 1994 totalled nearly
90 million ecu; but in the same year, funds to former Yugoslavia
amounted to 269 million ecu.  The balance of need is not reflected
in the distribution of EU aid around the world.
<P>
Though EU aid actually increased by 75 per cent between 1990 and
1993, the majority of this represented the surge in aid to central
and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (from zero to 719
million ecu, excluding humanitarian aid) and the trebling of assistance
to the EU's Mediterranean neighbours (from 103 to 353 million
ecu).  Including all forms of aid, and aid from member governments
as well as through the EU, assistance to the east between 1990
and 1994 totalled 38.7 billion ecu.  Of the 1996 budget for EU
humanitarian aid, 1.5 billion ecu of the total 3.34 billion is
designated for central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union.
<P>
At the June 1995 Cannes summit of EU heads of government, allocations
from the Community budget alone to the EU's Mediterranean neighbours
were projected by the Commission to increase further in absolute
terms by 108 per cent in the five years to the end of 1999 (to
4.685 billion ecu), and to central and eastern Europe by 41.5
per cent (to 6.93 billion ecu), excluding the former Soviet Union.
 
<P>
<B>Turning aside from the South</B>
<P>
In contrast, the allocations of the European Development Fund
to the so-called African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) group of
70 countries, under the fourth Lom&eacute; Convention, are set
to stagnate in real terms (at 13.3 billion ecu) for the same five-year
period.  Aid to Asia and Latin America, which comes from the Commission's
core budget, is also expected to remain static when it is agreed
in early 1996 for the years up to 1999.
<P>
Beyond the &quot;near abroad&quot;, EU assistance has still been
concentrated upon economically-advanced regions, as made clear
by the June 1995 Communication from the Commission which set out
the main focus in the South as the ASEAN (Malaysia, Indonesia,
Thailand, Philippines, Singapore, Brunei) and Mercosur (Brazil,
Argentina, Paraguay) countries.  Whilst there is extreme inequality
and large numbers of poor people in several of these countries,
the poorest of these, Indonesia, is still ranked by UNDP as better
off than 70 countries in the world, making these countries potentially
better able to address poverty.
<P>
This distribution of resources does not correspond to the regions
where the existing general principles of the CFSP are most threatened
 -  where peace and international security are in greatest peril.
 What it does reflect is the EU's overriding economic interests
 -  in effect, overriding other &quot;fundamental interests&quot;
<I> </I>-  and its desire to see central and eastern Europe become
more stable and prosperous, and become ready for entry into the
EU, and to reduce the perceived threat of migration and terrorism
from across the Mediterranean.
<P>
<B>The wider view</B>
<P>
Exceptions to this  -  for example, significant European support
for the peace processes in South Africa, and, in the mid- and
late-1980s, in central America  -   serve to illustrate the general
preoccupation with narrow priorities; but they also illustrate
the EU's potential to make a difference, even in regions where
it has little direct interest, when it chooses to do so.  
<P>
Between 1983 and 1990, the European Community played an active
role in seeking to end the conflicts in the central America countries
of Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, which together killed
160,000 during the 1980s.  It supported the Contadora<I> </I>Group
of Latin American governments involved in negotiating peace, including
in the formal dialogue between them and the EC known as the San
Jose process.  The EC gave economic assistance to the Sandinista
government to help to limit Nicaragua's dependence upon the Soviet
Union, and hence the capacity of this regional conflict to become
a major crisis for the then critical East-West relations.  Though
EC policy was not &quot;pro-Sandinista&quot;, and &quot;democratising&quot;
Nicaragua was one of its stated aims, the EC lobbied the US and
others to accept the legitimacy of the Sandinista government and
its basic aims, and supported Latin American diplomacy to prevent
the US excluding Nicaragua from the peace process, and in preventing
direct US military involvement.
<P>
As a 1995 study of European policy to the region concluded: 
<P>
EC policy formed part of the international opposition to US policy.
 The EC's contribution was significant in that it provided diplomatic
support to Latin and Central American diplomacy and also 'legitimate'
 -  that is, non-Communist  -  opposition to US policy<I>  </I>(Hazel
Smith: <I>EU Foreign Policy and Central</I> <I>America</I>).
<P>
EC policy was therefore successful and beneficial, and  -  though
driven primarily by the European view that the policies of both
Presidents Reagan and Bush unnecessarily threatened East-West
stability  -  it was not based upon a narrow, short-term interest.

<P>
One part of the motivation appeared to be the genuine desire to
support central America's inter-related economic and political
development, the same pursuit of regional peace and prosperity
upon which the EC itself was based.  
<P>
Sadly,  the end of the Cold War has produced a considerable decline
in EU diplomatic interest in central America.  Nor has there been
a major diplomatic focus on the increasing scale of conflicts
in Africa and, for example, substantial support for the Organisation
of African Unity's efforts at conflict-prevention on the continent.
 Instead, the 1990s have seen EU attention increasingly concentrate
on the new dangers and opportunities in eastern Europe.
<P>
<B>The pressure of enlargement</B>
<P>
It is ironical that, while the Maastricht Treaty gave the EU's
development objectives their first basis in European Community
law, and the CFSP was born with the ambitious if vague aim of
promoting &quot;international security&quot;, the reality since
1991 has been that the EU's increasing preoccupation with enlargement
and the &quot;near abroad&quot;, and the pressures of economic
competitiveness and trade relations, are all at the expense of
commitments to the world's poor countries and poorest people.
<P>
It is perhaps the prospect of enlarging the EU to the east which
has had the greatest impact in concentrating the focus of so much
EU aid, and of the CFSP.  Yet the timetable for enlargement is
far from certain.  Optimists speak of the Visegrad Four<I>  </I>(Poland,
Hungary, Slovenia and the Czech Republic) and Malta and Cyprus
acceding by the year 2000.  Perhaps all other eastern European
states, including Russia, could be members by 2010.  Yet other
observers doubt whether progress will be so swift.  For many countries,
as Budapest University's Laszlo Andor has written:  &quot;Entry
to the European Union [remains] a mirage on a receding horizon.&quot;
<P>
<B>The cost of inaction</B>
<P>
As the foreign policy-makers of the EU have predominantly looked
east, the response to the increasing scale of conflicts in parts
of the South has been largely left to those giving humanitarian
aid.   And yet when the official EU, US and the UN humanitarian
agencies gathered in Madrid for their first ever Humanitarian
Summit on 14 December 1995, they concluded that: 
<P>
It is clear that humanitarian assistance is neither a solution
nor a panacea for crises which are essentially man-made.  This
is true in Rwanda and Bosnia, but also in many other parts of
the world forgotten by the media, such as Afghanistan, Northern
Iraq, Liberia and Sierra Leone, Tajikistan and the Sudan.
<P>
In the Madrid Declaration, Emma Bonino, EU Commissioner responsible
for the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO), together
with the heads of the UN agencies and of USAID, made an appeal
to the international community at large.  In their first point,
they said:<I> </I>&quot;Determination is required to take whatever
resolute and decisive action may be necessary to resolve crisis
situations  - <I> and not to use humanitarian aid as a substitute
for political action</I>.&quot;
<P>
Yet political inaction has meant that humanitarian aid has indeed
been a substitute for diplomacy.  This was one of the conclusions
of a major evaluation of the International Communities response
to the conflict and genocide in Rwanda.  When faced by conflicts
or emerging crises beyond the &quot;near abroad&quot;, the EU
and its member governments have largely failed to take timely
and determined diplomatic action to help to prevent or resolve
conflicts.  Once a conflict has started, they have also failed
adequately to support peace-keeping missions which could have
helped to protect the civilian victims of those conflicts; and
once a conflict is over, they have failed to provide sufficient
effective long-term development aid which can help to  make peace
endure.  In short, the EU's heavily-branded, televisual humanitarian
aid has masked a policy vacuum on how to deal with conflicts.
<P>
<B>Rwanda</B>
<P>
The genocide in Rwanda stands out as the most extreme example.
<I>Eurostep's</I> member organisations have worked in the country
for 30 years and spent over 40 million ecu in response to the
1994 genocide and the subsequent refugee crises in neighbouring
countries.   In March 1996 the Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance
to Rwanda was published.  It concluded that despite close observers
anticipating mass violence and the advocation of swift interventionist
action, the major powers, including Member States of the EU, that
controlled the UN peacekeeping operations paid only cursory attention
to Rwanda and there were no contingency plans except for withdrawal.
 The report notes that:
<P>
The failure by the international community to make effective demands
on its relationship with a regime whose involvement in organised
killings of civilians was generally suspected and carefully documented
in two 1993 reports - one from a joint NGO mission and the other
by a Special Rapporteur of the UN Commission on Human Rights -
was an act of omission that carries at least some moral co-responsibility
for subsequent events in Rwanda.  Acts of Commission carry heavier
responsibility.
<P>
The warnings referred to were repeated in the months leading up
to April 1994, when the genocide began, and came from official
sources as well as human rights organisations.  In January, the
commander of the UN force in Rwanda, Romeo Dallaire, clearly reported
that the ruling MRND party was already training its Interhamwe
militia in the use of weapons, explosives and close combat tactics,
that they had stockpiles of weapons, and that they had begun registering
all Tutsi in Kigali for what an informant to Dallaire concluded
was a plan for &quot;extermination&quot;.
<P>
This EU failure to take sufficient preventive action was all the
more astonishing given that four EU members  -  the UK, France,
Belgium and Germany  -  had been heavily involved in the Great
Lakes region of central Africa, both historically and in the immediate
run-up to the Arusha Accords.  European views also had a crucial
influence on how the UN Security Council decisions, including
the fateful one of April 1994 to reduce the size of the UN operation,
UNAMIR, which even in its limited state was able to save the lives
of thousands of hunted Tutsi.  Once the Security Council decided
to increase UNAMIR in May 1994, EU governments, alongside others,
failed to commit the financial and technical resources swiftly
enough to enable the enhanced force  -  largely composed of troops
offered by a number of African governments  -  to protect tens
of thousands of others.  
<P>
The EU did, however, then contribute heavily to the humanitarian
relief effort, primarily to refugees from the conflict, giving
18 million ecu within 1994 alone.  Though vital, this European
attention came too late for most.  While about 100,000 people
have died from non-violent causes in the region since April 1994,
between five and ten times that number were deliberately killed
in Rwanda's genocide.  Further, it is without doubt that some
of those 100,000 would not have died if direct humanitarian assistance
had not been so seriously constrained, first by the genocide in
the second quarter of 1994, and then by the insecurity in Goma
and other refugee camps, the scenes of severe intimidation by
former government militia until at least March 1995.
<P>
The generosity of EU aid is therefore in contrast to the diplomatic
inaction through the CFSP.  In the terms and language of the EU,
in which the CFSP is governed by an entirely intergovernmental
&quot;pillar&quot;, and aid is part of the European Community
pillar managed by the Commission, the response to Rwanda can be
seen as a dramatically &quot;incoherent&quot; set of policies.
 It was an example of the EU using aid policy as an alternative
to foreign policy  -  rather than both as parts of a &quot;coherent&quot;
response.
<P>
The precise amount of suffering which could have been avoided
by more timely and concerted international action is impossible
to gauge, though many observers conclude that it was the majority.
  What is beyond reasonable doubt is that at best the genocide
could have been averted altogether, and at worst far more lives
could have been saved, if there had been a greater and more assertive
deployment of UNAMIR from August 1993, combined with considerably
more robust diplomatic pressure on the Rwandese Government.  While
it was pressure from the US, as much as from EU governments, that
kept UNAMIR small to minimise costs, this does not absolve the
EU of its responsibility.  In a very real sense, therefore, perhaps
hundreds of thousands of Rwandans died as the victims of  political
inaction.
<P>
Similarly, it is at least worth asking how much of the vast cost
to the EU and the rest of the international community, of dealing
with the outcome of the genocide, could have been saved by timely
action in 1993.  Even a large preventive deployment of UN troops,
giving an unequivocal message to those planning the massacres,
could have been an economy compared to what has been spent since
then on the continuing relief operations.
<P>
It is also worth noting that, when EU governments choose to, they
do not lack the capacity to respond.  When France  -  reported
to have armed the former Rwandese Government both before and since
the genocide  -  decided to intervene directly in south-west Rwanda
in June 1994, its <I>Operation Turquoise</I> was deployed within
days.  France's role has been characteristic of some EU members
who have pursued their perceived national interests at the expense
of a common EU approach.  In action and inaction, the foreign
policy of different EU governments, incoherent therefore with
each other as well as with EU aid policy, failed to meet the challenge
of genocide.
<P>
<B>Europe's &quot;common values&quot;</B>
<P>
The CFSP should instead represent the EU's &quot;common values&quot;
abroad; this is the term used in the Maastricht Treaty, though
those values were not defined. The EU has a tradition of solidarity
with Europe's former colonies and, indeed, some wider sense of
internationalism: a sense of responsibility without borders. 
However imperfectly, this is already manifested in the Lom&eacute;
Convention with African, Caribbean and Pacific countries, and
in the EU's total aid spending.   Supporting its &quot;common
values&quot; around the world should now also be demonstrated
through the EU's wider foreign policy.
<P>
That is not just because the EU has a role and an interest in
supporting positive developments around the world.  It is also
because the electorates of EU member states perceive that an EU
which fumbles in its foreign policy, without a vision of its role
in an interdependent world, may not be an entity that inspires
confidence in the future.  Public support for European integration
rests fundamentally on the EU's perceived performance.  Chancellor
Kohl observed, at the time of the Maastricht ratification debates
and referenda of 1992, that the EU's performance on former Yugoslavia,
already judged as a failure, was one element of the disillusion
with European integration which, at one time, seemed to threaten
its progress, and which remains a sobering lesson to Europe's
political leaders.
<P>
Though not specified in the Maastricht Treaty, the EU would seem
to be based upon two common values which are highly relevant in
shaping the CFSP in response to the increasing scale of conflict
around the world.  For Jean Monnet and the other founders of what
is now the EU, their task was fundamentally, at least in part,
an exercise in <I>conflict-prevention</I>.  The first half of
this century had seen two wars arising from a combination of rivalries
between the major European powers, particularly France and Germany,
tensions over minorities, and  the national resentments which
poverty can breed.  The experience of the Weimar Republic demonstrated
that poverty, and unemployment in particular, were the breeding
grounds for a populist politics of ethnic supremacy and aggression.
 The leaders of post-war Europe were determined that the second
50 years of the twentieth century would be different.  That they
were successful is an enormous achievement  -  but also represents
a challenge to uphold the principle of conflict-prevention in
Europe's external policy.
<P>
Fundamental to that achievement has been the grounding of western
Europe's peace in prosperity  -  unprecedented prosperity for
most, though certainly not all, of the EU's citizens.  The EU
should apply the same lesson to its external policy.  The Commission
Directorate-General responsible for development, DG VIII, has
already set conflict-prevention and poverty-reduction as strategic
priorities for EU aid.  The former depends upon the latter.
<P>
Secondly, the success of preventing major conflict in western
Europe has been based upon, as well as economic performance, the
acceptance of <I>diversity</I> within and between EU members:
the acceptance of ethnic, religious and political differences.
 In some contexts  -  between France and Germany  -  this was
achieved remarkably quickly after 1945; in others, it has moved
tragically slowly.  This principle upon which modern Europe is
based should be among the &quot;common values&quot; which it represents
in its policy towards countries where intolerance lies at the
root of conflicts.  
<P>
At the same time, it is important to uphold the same value within
the EU, as  intolerance to refugees and immigrants is increasing
in many EU.  Unofficially, this is illustrated by the rising number
of racially-motivated attacks.  Officially, it is manifest in
tighter restrictions on the admission of refugees and asylum-seekers
and on their rights once admitted.  In January 1996, the UN High
Commissioner for Refugees criticised the UK Government on both
the planned asylum and immigration bill, and new legislation to
deprive some refugees of social security payments.  According
to UNHCR, the latter would put the UK &quot;squarely in violation&quot;<I>
</I>of its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the
Child.
<P>
Much has been written elsewhere on the causes of conflicts in
the 1990s which this paper will not attempt to reiterate.  Nevertheless,
it is clear that the rise in ethnic communal politics, often because
those communities are becoming poorer, has been a major factor
in the increasing scale of internal conflicts around the world.
  To counter this should be a priority for the EU, through support
for minorities' rights, and generous aid which is conditional
on governments' respect for every person's basic rights.  The
IGC should define the &quot;common values&quot; underlying the
CFSP,  and place the prevention of conflict and the protection
of diversity at their heart.
<P>
<B>Time to mature</B>
<P>
The Maastricht summit in 1991 left a deliberate ambiguity about
the CFSP  -  and on the related defence issues  - and postponed
decisions until 1996.  The heads of government who meet at the
next IGC will not have the same luxury.  It is no longer tenable
for the EU to have an incipient foreign policy sheltering under
the US as the dominant player in international relations.  
<P>
The rise of isolationism in the US, as it no longer seeks to contain
Soviet communism, but merely protect its economic interests, leaves
a void in the global body politic.  The United Nations as a whole,
and all states who wish to contribute to effective collective
policy and action, are weakened by the reduced interest in the
UN shown by its most powerful member.  Unless this void is filled
by the EU  -  not alone but working with the US and other governments,
making some reality of the idea of an <I>international community</I>
 -  the years around 2000 could see the effective demise of global
institutions, and of the international will to find solutions
to global problems, from environmental destruction to increasing
poverty.
<P>
This medium-term trend of growing US isolationism is probably
not fundamentally altered by the short-term initiative, responding
to EU failure in former Yugoslavia, to lead and dominate the process
towards peace in that region.  Yet the Dayton agreement of November
1995 was a commentary on the EU; and the cautious approach to
the CFSP of some Member States of the EU. European governments
have been seen to fail in preventing or resolving a major conflict
on their continent.
<P>
Though the implementation of the Dayton accord has deployed 20,000
US troops around Tuzla in north-east Bosnia, these are due to
be withdrawn by the end of 1996, and the reluctance with which
US public opinion and Congress accepted the involvement does not
suggest that the deeper trend to isolationism has been reversed.
 In addition to the internal pressures on the EU to mature into
a political as well as an economic entity, changes in the international
situation demand that the 1996-97 IGC is used as an opportunity
to develop a serious and &quot;coherent&quot; common foreign policy.
<P>
<B>Coherence and clarity</B>
<P>
The need for greater clarity for the CFSP is not contentious.
 The Reflection Group preparing for the IGC has recognised the
need to clarify objectives, and cited the EU's enlargement to
the east as one factor making this a necessity.  However, simply
clarifying the CFSP's role in relation to central and eastern
Europe would be an inadequate response from the IGC when the world
surrounding Europe is increasingly unstable.
<P>
Some EU governments argue that clarity should be based on geographical
areas of prime interest to the EU.  This would be to formalise
the increasing tendency of the EU, and the US, to divide the world
into two: areas of economic importance to those blocs  - and the
rest of the world, and its poor and marginalised people, from
which the EU and US are increasingly disengaging.
<P>
Instead, the IGC should take up the proposals of other member
governments, including the Netherlands and Sweden, to state that
the EU's &quot;fundamental interests&quot; include the protection
of global principles, including human rights and democracy.  This
is a crucial area for further debate at the IGC.  The Reflection
Group has already accepted the broad argument that Europe's &quot;territorial
integrity&quot; can not be immune from new post-Cold War threats
resulting from profound changes taking place outside the Union.
 In its interim report of September 1995, it identified in particular
&quot;internal civil strife, protection of minorities, human rights
violations, ecological disaster risks&quot;.
<P>
The task is now to recognise how the wider and longer-term threats
to the EU, and threats to its &quot;common values&quot;, can be
met by a clearer CFSP with more coherence with the rest of EU
external policy.  According to the December 1994 report of the
High-level Group of Experts on the CFSP (commissioned by Hans
van den Broek, the EU Commissioner for External Relations) &quot;the
crisis in our (the EU's) system of beliefs and values&quot;, as
well as new threats to Europe, must be addressed by the CFSP.
 The IGC should ensure that the CFSP is about more than protecting
the short-term and narrow interests of member governments.
<P>
<B>The IGC opportunity</B>
<P>
The IGC has the chance to agree a more detailed mandate for the
CFSP which specifically includes in its aims, and success criteria,
the priority of reducing poverty and conflicts, and strengthening
respect for civil and political, economic and social rights, and
international humanitarian law.  As part of this, it should also
commit itself to making the CFSP coherent with the EU's trade,
development cooperation and humanitarian aid policies.
<P>
<I><B>Eurostep</B></I><B> recommends that the IGC updates the
purpose of the CFSP, stated under Title V, Article J.1 (2) of
the Maastricht Treaty, to:</B>
<UL>
<LI>state explicitly that the CFSP's aims include<B> upholding
human rights and humanitarian law</B>, including the provisions
set down in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Genocide
Convention, the International Covenants on Civil and Political
Rights, and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the Refugee
Convention, the Geneva Conventions and the Inhumane Weapons Convention,
and all Protocols to these agreements;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>state explicitly that<B> conflict-prevention and conflict-resolution</B>
are priority objectives of the CFSP;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>state explicitly  -  thereby make a significant advance on
the ambiguity of the UN Charter -  that the goal of conflict-prevention
and conflict-resolution should refer to <B>internal</B>,<B> as
well as international, conflicts</B>;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>state explicitly that the CFSP is a<B> global foreign policy
</B>framework, seeking to provide support for upholding internationally
agreed human rights and humanitarian law throughout the world;
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI>state explicitly that the CFSP should be <B>coherent</B> <B>with
the Maastricht Treaty's existing commitment to reducing poverty</B>
(Title XVII, Article 130u).
</UL>

<P>

<P>
Under Articles J.2 and J.3 of the Maastricht Treaty, mechanisms
were agreed to formulate &quot;common positions&quot;<I> </I>and
&quot;joint actions&quot; as the vehicles for the CFSP.  The IGC
should also state explicitly that the prevention and resolution
of conflicts are relevant uses for these tools.
<P>
That these should be applied to internal, as well as international,
conflicts reflects the fact that virtually all modern conflicts
are internal.  It also reflects the increasing acceptance over
the last ten years that the historic respect for <I>absolute</I>
national sovereignty should not be a fundamental obstacle to the
protection of universally agreed human rights.  Without such acceptance,
international law has little relevance to the great majority of
current conflicts.  In a revised CFSP mandate, such a reference
to internal conflicts would build on the practice during the 1990s
of EU Member States supporting the series of UN initiatives in
internal conflicts.
<P>
Most issues relating to arms exports are also, at present, excluded
from the EU's common trade policy.  It is important that when
the IGC comes to review this, as is already agreed, the resulting
treaty sets common conditions on future arms transfers to safeguard
civilians' right to protection from violence.
<P>
<B>Improving the structures</B>
<P>
The Maastricht Treaty set down that the CFSP is the second of
the three so-called pillars of the European Union.  Like the third,
Justice and Home Affairs, it is an intergovernmental process.
 It is only the first pillar, the European Community, which allows
for exclusive Commission initiative, and gives the European Parliament
a substantive role. Under the second pillar the Parliament merely
has the right to be informed about the CFSP and, once a year,
to debate its implementation.  Other than the CFSP, all EU external
policy, including development and humanitarian aid,  is under
the Community.
<P>
There are arguments on whether or not the CFSP should continue
as an entirely intergovernmental process, and on how coherence
should be ensured in the decision-making on the CFSP and on the
Community's other external affairs.   What is certain is that
the IGC must establish <I>some</I> means for swift, decisive and
transparent decisions which do not allow future policy to be paralysed
at the lowest common denominator of what all EU governments can
agree.  This will not necessarily mean an extension of qualified
majority voting to some or all CFSP decisions;  in any case, it
is clear that no EU Member State will be bound, against its national
government's will, to deploy its forces in any conflict resolution.
<P>
It must also establish some capacity  -  presumably in the Commission
or the Council of Ministers' Secretariat  -  to plan and monitor
policy, and make recommendations to the decision-making structure.
 This task currently falls between two intergovernmental bodies:
the meeting of the Permanent Representatives of each government
to the EU, and the Political Committee of senior foreign ministry
officials from each state.
<P>
A final problem in the existing structure is that the EU's external
policies are represented by several senior officials of the Commission
on specific issues and to particular fora and countries.  As well
as the Commission President's role in external affairs, External
Relations Commissioner Hans van den Broek has responsibility towards
central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, while
the rest of the world is divided up between the portfolios of
Commissioners Marin, Brittan and Pinheiro.  In the future, the
CFSP may need to be personified in either one Commissioner or
an official of the Council of Ministers of sufficient international
calibre.
<P>
<B>Coherence with aid</B>
<P>
Making these structural improvements will be necessary not least
to overcome the divergence between the CFSP and EU aid policy.
 If the CFSP can develop into a genuinely global foreign policy,
with conflict-prevention and conflict-resolution as priorities,
both the EU's development cooperation and humanitarian assistance
must be directed towards these overall goals.  Conversely, the
objectives of that aid can not be sustainably achieved if they
are overwhelmed by conflicts which the CFSP does not seek to prevent
or resolve.
<P>
Aid policy should be equally coherent with the humanitarian and
human rights aims of the CFSP suggested above.  The EU's humanitarian
aid  -  764 million ecu in 1994  -  should be delivered <I>impartially
</I>to people whose basic rights to water, food and other necessities
are threatened by conflicts or (much less often) natural disasters.
 It would also mean that humanitarian aid was delivered, when
necessary, in combination with diplomatic and, in extreme cases,
security measures to guarantee that the recipients of aid were
also<I> protected</I><B> </B>from violence.  Through coherent
CFSP and aid policies, the EU could play a considerable role in
reversing the sharp decline in respect for civilians' rights to
protection, and in implementing the responsibilities placed upon
all governments under international humanitarian and refugee law.
 
<P>
<B>A European voice in the UN</B>
<P>
Though the EU may have an increased role in directly supporting
regional initiatives in the South, such as the Organisation of
African Unity's growing activities in conflict-prevention, most
of the actions of a more global CFSP should be conducted through
the UN.  The UN should remain the single most significant body
to help to prevent conflict and enhance respect for basic rights
around the world.
<P>
Dr Boutros Boutros-Ghali's visit to London in January 1996, where
the first UN General Assembly was held in 1946, marked the end
of the UN's fiftieth anniversary year.  After the disappointment
of the year, in which very few real reforms were achieved, it
will be in no small part up to the EU and its members to determine
whether the UN continues to decline, or develops its effectiveness
in addressing the global challenges of the twenty-first century.
<P>
A third of the UN Security Council in 1996 are either existing
members of the EU (UK, France, Germany and Italy) or, in the case
of Poland, likely to join by the end of the decade.  Though Germany's
current two-year term will end on 31 December 1996, its possible
elevation to permanent status as part of wider changes to the
Council's membership would further increase the European voice.
<P>
Though an EU seat <I>per se</I> may be neither a short-term prospect,
nor something which would increase the EU's total representation,
the influence of EU member states on the Security Council, when
acting together, is very considerable.  A common EU voice has
already been a feature of EU involvement in other UN fora, where
the country holding the EU Presidency has spoken for all, for
several years.  
<P>
If the US continues its trend towards isolationism, the influence
of the EU could increase still further. The US is already responsible
for $1.434 billion of the UN's &#163;3.33 billion arrears (according
to September 1995 figures). Whether the US Congress now implements
its threat to significantly cut US contributions, or whether the
method for assessing contributions is radically updated to make
it more equitable (which would also let the US off the hook) the
EU's proportional contribution is also likely to become greater.
<P>
The High-level Group on the CFSP said that the EU will increasingly
be expected to cooperate in a &quot;partnership of leadership&quot;<I>
</I>with the US.  Though <I>Eurostep</I> strongly believes that
the UN must become more accountable to Southern governments as
well, there is a very real danger that, as the US role diminishes,
the UN will continue its decline unless EU governments unite in
its support.
<P>
EU member states have already been influential in several areas
of policy to improve the UN's performance in response to conflicts.
 The UK and Germany led the process which resulted in 1992 in
the establishment of the UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs,
which is now, if its authority is enhanced in 1996, the body most
likely to ensure a more effective and coordinated UN humanitarian
performance.  The Netherlands is at the forefront of proposals
for a permanent UN rapid deployment force, the need for which
remains one of the urgent, but so far unheeded, lessons from the
crises in Rwanda and elsewhere.  The EU should increasingly use
the UN as one vital means to realise the humanitarian and human
rights aims set out in the previous section.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B>
<P>
Now is the time for the EU to develop its common foreign policy
to be global in scope: contributing to preventing conflicts, reducing
poverty, and upholding rights beyond the &quot;near abroad&quot;.
 From experience in seven countries in the Balkans and the former
Soviet Union, and in the Mediterranean, there is an urgent need
to address poverty and the threat of renewed or increasing violence.
<I>Eurostep</I> supports the attention which the EU and its members
have been paying to these countries in the first half of the 1990s.
 Yet, from the experience of <I>Eurostep's </I>member organisation's
in 60 other countries, most of them significantly poorer, in sub-Saharan
Africa, Asia and Latin America, we also see the dangers of the
CFSP neglecting the needs of many of the world's poorest people.
<P>
<B>If the IGC simply confirms the CFSP's limited focus on narrow
and short-term interests, it will represent the EU at its most
parochial.  Despite the Maastricht Treaty's commitments to international
security and reducing poverty, the CFSP would become the public
manifestation not of an EU and its members confident of their
role, but of a &quot;little Europe&quot;, nervous of the outside
world.  Those suffering from poverty and conflict worldwide, and
also the citizens of Europe, deserve better. </B><P>

<H1>HOVI <U>H</u>elp Glossary Screen</h1>  
<P>Computer training manuals are packed with complex jargon. With a
conventional book this requires struggling through the index or a dictionary to
try and translate what you are reading into plain English. One of the beauties
of an electronic book like HOVI Help is that any complicated term can be
explained with a quick mouse click to the glossary.</p> 
<P>The picture below shows an example of the extensive HOVI Help glossary.
Everything is explained in simple terms and there are often colour pictures to
illustrate the points. One other nice feature is that all terms are
cross-referenced like the example shown below.</p>
<P align="center"><Img align="bottom" src="screenc.gif"></p>  
<P>If you like what you see, why not browse on to the next page and download a
full working demonstration version of HOVI Help totally free of charge. Try it
for yourself first and then order a copy - remember all profits from the sale of
this software go to provide
<A href="global.html">computers for schools</a> in parts of the world where
people are not as fortunate to have access to the Internet like you do! </p>

<H1>HOVI <U>H</u>elp Practical Screen</h1>   
<P>Extensive experience with computer training has shown that the best way to
learn a program is by trying things out for oneself. Many of the multimedia
training packages available rely on dummy screens which don't allow the user to
experiment. For this reason understanding and memory retention using these
multimedia packages is often poor.</p> 
<P>The picture below shows a typical HOVI Help practical window which &quot;floats&quot;
on top of the program that is being taught. The practical window can be dragged
around the screen to a convenient location. Once the exercise is completed, the
user clicks on the Back button to return to the
<A href="screen1.html">main screen</a>.</p>
<P align="center"><Img align="bottom" src="screenb.gif"></p>  
<P>For large <A href="corporat.html">corporate users</a>, practical screens can
be tailored to the needs of the company using relevant examples. No longer do
you need to put up with the Volcano Coffee Company when your staff want to learn
how to use software for the common day to day tasks in your business. </p>

<html><head><title>No end in sight</title><!!keys: Index on Censorship+Lara Marlowe ></head><body bgcolor="#9f5f9f" link="#ff0000" vlink="#8c1717"><img align=right width=110 height=142 src="index_pix/3_95_coverthumb.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by  <a href="index.html"> Index on Censorship </i></a><hr><h2>No end in sight</h2><font size=+1><b>by Lara Marlowe</b></font><br><i><b>(from Index 3/1995)</b></i><p><i>Caught in the crossfire between a beleaguered government and the outlawed FIS, Algeria's journalists continue to die</i><hr>After his killers stabbed him twice in the back, Smail Yefsah screamed repeatedly, plaintively,'I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything.' It was 8 o'clock in the morning and dozens of passers-by watched as three well-dressed young men then proceeded to shoot the young television presenter in the stomach and chest before making their get-away. Leaving a trail of blood behind him, Yefsah staggered up the stairs of his apartment building to collapse and die in a neighbour's flat on the second floor.<p>Smail Yefsah, murdered on 18 October 1993, was the seventh of 35 Algerian journalists assassinated over the past two years. The circumstances of every killing have been terrible. Many had their throats slashed or were shot at close range in front of their families. Yet because Yefsah's desperate plea of innocence -'I didn't do anything' - summed up the feelings of a whole nation caught between security forces and Islamist guerrillas, his last words struck a chord in the minds of Algerians.<p>Some 40,000 Algerians have died in the rebellion that started when the country's first free parliamentary elections were cancelled by the army in January 1992. According to statistics released by security forces in March this year, 6,388 were killed in 1994. The figures provided by the government show that other professions have suffered greater losses than the press: 682 civil servants, 350 merchants, 304 peasants, 122 veterans of the war of independence and 101 teachers were murdered last year, compared to 21 journalists. But the latter represent a high proportion of the approximately 500 journalists still working in Algeria. And, as the ultimate form of censorship, the assassination of journalists symbolises the freedom of speech lost by all Algerians because of the war. The violence has severely stunted the young, inexperienced press corps which had begun to flourish after the 1989 Constitution was adopted. Until then, only official government media were allowed in Algeria.<p>The two best-known Algerian journalists to be assassinated, Tahar Djaout and Said Mekbel, wrote hauntingly prescient articles just before they were murdered. Djaout's last editorial in Ruptures [see Index 4&5/1994] criticised the government for negotiating with'backward' Islamists. Said Mekbel's daily column'Mesmar J'ha' (Rusty Nail) bore the satirical nickname of former President Chadali Benjedid. Just about anyone who read newspapers in Algeria turned first to Mekbel's witty, cynical, poignant missive each morning. His last piece was dated 3 December 1994, the day he was shot dead in an Algiers restaurant. In it, Mekbel described an Algerian journalist as'this thief who slinks along walls to go home at night...this father who tells his children not to talk about the wicked job he does...this man who makes a wish not to die with his throat slashed...' In homage to Mekbel, Le Matin has continued to re-print his columns.<p>For Algerian Islamists, there is no question of expression in the established, legal media. The clandestine fundamentalist radio and TV stations Wafa (The Pledge) and Inkad (Salvation) broadcast sporadically. Underground papers called Raya Islamiya (Islamic Banner) and Ittissam (Resolution) circulate in small numbers. To transmit a pro-Islamic Salvation Front (FIS) broadcast or print pro-FIS literature is to court death - in much the same way that journalists risk their lives going to work at the fortified ENTV headquarters on the hillside above Algiers or the well-guarded Maison de La Presse Tahar Djaout downtown.<p>Islamists denounce the'selective indignation' shown by Algerian and Western media that cover assassinations of well-known journalists and intellectuals but ignore the widespread torture and summary executions of fundamentalists by security forces. The Algerian media have observed almost to a fault the Orwellian guidelines handed down by interior minister Abderrahmane Meziane-Cherif in June 1994: only the government version of violent incidents may be published, and then only on inside pages; Islamist successes are played down, atrocities committed by Islamist regimes in Iran, Sudan and Afghanistan are given wide coverage.<p>Islamists accuse government intelligence services of killing foreigners and journalists to discredit the outlawed FIS. In March, exiled FIS leaders formally condemned the killing of journalists and other non-combatants for the first time. But within days Rachida Hammadi, a well-known Algerian television journalist, and her sister Houria, a secretary at ENTV, were gunned down on their way to work. A week later, Mohamed Abderrahmani, publisher of the government newspaper El Moudjahid and the doyen of the Algiers press corps, met the same fate. So what of the FIS statement issued in Paris? Did it mean the leadership outside Algeria is cut off from the armed groups inside? Was the condemnation a public relations ploy by exiled Islamists fearful of losing their political refugee status in Germany and the US? Perhaps it meant only that the FIS political leadership is at odds with the more radical GIA concerning the assassination of journalists and other civilians.<p>I once asked the wife of an Islamist leader in Algiers how she could justify the killing of Djaout and others like him.'An intellectual is someone who has taken sides,' she answered coldly. Sadly, secular Algerians who call themselves'democrats' are equally categorical. When Abderrahmani was murdered on 27 March, an influential Algerian journalist understandably told me that while he didn't agree with Abderrahmani,'no matter what a man writes, it doesn't justify killing him.' Yet earlier in March, the very same journalist had participated in a mock tribunal in which imprisoned FIS leaders were condemned to death. He apparently saw no contradiction between his campaign for press freedom and democracy in Algeria and the fact that since 1992 Algeria's Islamists have been deprived of all civil rights.<p><hr>Copyright © Lara Marlowe<hr><TABLE BORDER=6><TR><TD><a href="index.html">Back to INDEX Home Page</a></TD></TR></TABLE><hr></body></html>

<P>
Cet aper&ccedil;u de l'aide bilat&eacute;rale fran&ccedil;aise
au d&eacute;veloppement est une contribution au projet &quot;the
effectiveness of European Union and Member State aid&quot;. Ce
projet vise &agrave; animer un groupe de recherche europ&eacute;en
sur le th&egrave;me de l'analyse de l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement.
Il est coordonn&eacute; par l'Overseas Development Institute (ODI,
Londres) et l'European Center for Developement Policy Management
(ECDPM, Maastricht) et regroupe le DIE (Berlin), le CDR (Copenhague)
et DIAL (Paris).
<P>
Une premi&egrave;re phase des travaux, dans laquelle s'inscrit
la pr&eacute;sente contribution, consiste en une comparaison des
approches, m&eacute;thodes et organisation des diff&eacute;rents
syst&egrave;mes d'aide bilat&eacute;raux, ainsi que de leurs &eacute;volutions
et leurs rapports avec l'aide europ&eacute;enne. Une seconde phase
reposera sur la r&eacute;alisation et l'analyse d'&eacute;tudes
sur l'efficacit&eacute; des aides dans certains pays et/ou secteurs
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.
<P>
Le pr&eacute;sent document aborde dans une premi&egrave;re partie
les grandes caract&eacute;ristiques de l'aide publique fran&ccedil;aise
au d&eacute;veloppement. Un rapide bilan statistique est trac&eacute;,
mais surtout cette partie tente d'identifier les grands objectifs,
strat&eacute;gies et priorit&eacute;s qui animent la politique
d'aide fran&ccedil;aise. La seconde partie d&eacute;crit la conduite
de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise, c'est-&agrave;-dire le dispositif
institutionnel de l'aide ainsi que les processus et proc&eacute;dures
de r&eacute;alisation des diff&eacute;rentes actions. Enfin, une
troisi&egrave;me partie met l'accent sur certains aspects particuliers
de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise, qui constituent les enjeux actuels
: ses &eacute;volutions r&eacute;centes, ses rapports avec l'aide
europ&eacute;enne, la nature de son dialogue avec l'ensemble des
composantes de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; fran&ccedil;aise et la
sensibilit&eacute; des priorit&eacute;s retenues &agrave; l'influence
des priorit&eacute;s des autres syst&egrave;mes d'aide.
<P>
La pr&eacute;sente r&eacute;flexion r&eacute;pond &agrave; des
termes de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence pr&eacute;cis, n&eacute;cessaires
&agrave; l'approche comparative. Il n'a donc pas pour ambition
de constituer un tour d'horizon complet du syst&egrave;me d'aide
fran&ccedil;ais, mais de mettre en lumi&egrave;re certains points
particuliers. Le document est essentiellement descriptif. Il ne
comprend donc pas, &agrave; proprement parler, d'opinions de l'auteur.
Cependant, dans certains cas les positions, strat&eacute;gies
ou orientations du syst&egrave;me d'aide sont implicites et ne
donnent pas lieu &agrave; des principes directeurs &eacute;crits
et accept&eacute;s par tous. Sur ces points, le document donne
la perception personnelle de l'auteur de ces positions, strat&eacute;gies
et orientations telles qu'elle est ressorti de l'examen des analyses
d&eacute;j&agrave; r&eacute;alis&eacute;es et d'interviews de
certains repr&eacute;sentants du syst&egrave;me d'aide fran&ccedil;ais.
<H2><A NAME="DEF"><HR>I. LA DEFINITION DE L'AIDE FRANCAISE AU DEVELOPPEMENT</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="PRINC">1. Les principes de l'aide publique fran&ccedil;aise au d&eacute;veloppement</A>
</H2>

<H3>1.1. Le niveau de l'aide</H3>

<P>
En 1993, l'aide fran&ccedil;aise s'&eacute;levait &agrave; 7.915
millions de dollars, soit 0.63% du PIB. Cela place la France au
troisi&egrave;me rang des donateurs en valeur absolue, et au cinqui&egrave;me
en pourcentage de son PIB.
<P>
<U>Source CAD</U> 
<P>
On constate que l'APD fran&ccedil;aise (qui comprend l'aide accord&eacute;e
au Territoires d'Outre Mer -TOM- d'environ 0.6% du PNB sur les
ann&eacute;es r&eacute;centes) est nettement sup&eacute;rieure
&agrave; la moyenne du CAD, et qu'elle n'a pas particip&eacute;
au net mouvement de baisse constat&eacute; en 1993 o&ugrave; l'aide
est tomb&eacute;e &agrave; 0.29% du PNB du CAD, soit le niveau
le plus bas depuis 1973. L'objectif &eacute;tait, depuis le d&eacute;but
des ann&eacute;es 1980, de parvenir &agrave; un taux de 0.7% du
PIB, hors TOM. Sur la p&eacute;riode r&eacute;cente cette ambition
n'a &eacute;t&eacute; ni d&eacute;mentie ni confirm&eacute;e.
Bien que cherchant par principe &agrave; atteindre un niveau &quot;&eacute;lev&eacute;&quot;,
l'aide fran&ccedil;aise ne semble plus guid&eacute;e par un objectif
quantitatif pr&eacute;cis.
<H3>1.2. Objectifs et r&egrave;gles de conduite</H3>

<P>
L'examen de la politique fran&ccedil;aise en mati&egrave;re d'aide
ext&eacute;rieure am&egrave;ne &agrave; dessiner trois principales
r&egrave;gles de conduite :
<UL>
<LI>adh&eacute;rer aux strat&eacute;gies et politiques multilat&eacute;rales
et contribuer aux grandes questions de d&eacute;veloppement (environnement,
sant&eacute; publique, etc...);
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>peser de l'int&eacute;rieur sur les politiques des pays d&eacute;velopp&eacute;s
vers une plus grande solidarit&eacute; avec le Tiers-Monde;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>montrer une &quot;diff&eacute;rence&quot; dans la politique
bilat&eacute;rale avec un groupe de pays partenaires (les &quot;pays
du champ&quot;), soit tenter de faire appara&icirc;tre un &quot;mod&egrave;le
fran&ccedil;ais&quot; dans le domaine des relations avec les pays
du Sud.
</UL>

<P>
Ces objectifs font, a priori, appara&icirc;tre une certaine coh&eacute;rence.
Il s'agit, sans remettre en cause la solidarit&eacute; et la coordination
occidentale, d'&ecirc;tre &quot;l'avocat des pauvres parmi les
riches&quot;, et d'illustrer cette position &agrave; travers un
mod&egrave;le de coop&eacute;ration bilat&eacute;rale : celui
de la France avec l'Afrique francophone. La finalit&eacute; poursuivie
&agrave; travers ce positionnement est d'affirmer la pr&eacute;sence
internationale de la France &agrave; travers la d&eacute;livrance
d'un discours universaliste, une forte influence locale dans le
Sud et le rayonnement de la francophonie.
<P>
Sans reprendre l'ensemble des options de la politique d'aide fran&ccedil;aise
au regard de ces r&egrave;gles de conduite, on peut se contenter
de mettre en avant quelques exemples caract&eacute;ristiques.
<P>
La Zone franc, les sommets franco-africains, la cellule Afrique
de l'Elys&eacute;e, la &quot;francophonie&quot;, les accords sp&eacute;ciaux
sur les mati&egrave;res premi&egrave;res (gaz alg&eacute;rien,
uranium nig&eacute;rien), l'accent mis sur l'assistance technique
et la coop&eacute;ration militaire, les accords sp&eacute;ciaux
de d&eacute;fense, le recours fr&eacute;quent aux aides budg&eacute;taires
sont, cit&eacute;s en vrac, autant de manifestations qui ressortent
de &quot;l'exemple fran&ccedil;ais&quot; avec ses partenaires
privil&eacute;gi&eacute;s. Elles sont le vecteur de la solidarit&eacute;,
mais aussi de &quot;l'ing&eacute;rence amicale&quot;, de la France
envers les pays de &quot;son champ&quot;. La relation entre la
France et ses partenaires privil&eacute;gi&eacute;s appara&icirc;t
de ce fait tout &agrave; fait unique, &agrave; la fois multiforme
et tr&egrave;s &quot;politique&quot;. L'objectif a &eacute;t&eacute;
de faire &eacute;merger un v&eacute;ritable groupe solidaire de
pays r&eacute;unissant la France et les pays de son champ. Dans
ce cadre un accent important a toujours &eacute;t&eacute; mis
sur la s&eacute;curit&eacute;, la stabilit&eacute; et la coh&eacute;sion
(notamment par l'appui &agrave; la constitution d'un groupe r&eacute;gional)
des principaux partenaires de la France.
<P>
La position fran&ccedil;aise, aupr&egrave;s des instances internationales,
s'est toujours fait l'ap&ocirc;tre d'une n&eacute;cessaire sollicitude
vis-&agrave;-vis des pays du Sud. La France s'est, par exemple,
toujours montr&eacute; plus ouverte que quiconque, parmi ses pairs,
&agrave; reconna&icirc;tre les &quot;m&eacute;faits du march&eacute;&quot;
pour les pays en d&eacute;veloppement producteurs de produits
de base. De m&ecirc;me, la France a souvent soutenu, y compris
par l'exemple (dette bilat&eacute;rale, initiative de Toronto),
des positions cl&eacute;mentes vis-&agrave;-vis de l'endettement
des pays en d&eacute;veloppement. La France n'a dans ce sens gu&egrave;re
pes&eacute; sur la politique des institutions financi&egrave;res
internationales, o&ugrave; son influence est limit&eacute;e. Toutefois,
l'intervention de la France a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;terminante
dans l'instauration d'instruments sp&eacute;ciaux tels que la
Facilit&eacute; Sp&eacute;ciale pour l'Afrique (FSA), le &quot;programme
sp&eacute;cial de la Banque Mondiale en faveur des pays les plus
pauvres et les plus endett&eacute;s de l'Afrique subsaharienne&quot;
ou encore la Facilit&eacute; d'Ajustement structurel du FMI. A
l'oppos&eacute; l'influence fran&ccedil;aise a &eacute;t&eacute;
tr&egrave;s forte sur l'orientation de la politique d'aide europ&eacute;enne.
<P>
Enfin, la participation naturelle de la France aux strat&eacute;gies
collectives des institutions internationales peut &eacute;galement
s'illustrer &agrave; travers de nombreux exemples. On peut citer,
&agrave; ce sujet, les initiatives fran&ccedil;aises sur les questions
d'environnement (appel &agrave; la sauvegarde du patrimoine mondial
en 1989 ou la pr&eacute;paration du sommet de Rio). On peut &eacute;galement
consid&eacute;rer l'int&eacute;gration rapide de l'ajustement
structurel dans les politiques fran&ccedil;aises de d&eacute;veloppement,
alors que ses principes &eacute;taient par ailleurs fortement
contest&eacute;s par une proportion importante des analystes et
d&eacute;cideurs concern&eacute;s. Cet exemple montre que l'adh&eacute;sion
n'est pas seulement un devoir de solidarit&eacute; de la France,
mais aussi une n&eacute;cessit&eacute; de partage de la gestion
de l'aide ext&eacute;rieure avec l'ensemble de la communaut&eacute;
internationale. Cette n&eacute;cessit&eacute; ressort conjointement
du poids financier du soutien aux pays en difficult&eacute;, qui
d&eacute;passe les moyens d'une seule nation, et de la difficult&eacute;
&agrave; g&eacute;rer l'aide conditionnelle au niveau bilat&eacute;ral.
<P>
Les objectifs et r&egrave;gles de conduite d&eacute;crits sont
toujours actuels. Cependant, il est parfois, et sans doute de
plus en plus, difficile de les mener de front. La France appara&icirc;t
souvent partag&eacute;e entre l'ambition d'un discours universaliste
sur le d&eacute;veloppement et une pratique beaucoup plus r&eacute;gionaliste
-la plupart des initiatives prises aupr&egrave;s des instances
internationales le sont tr&egrave;s directement dans l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
des pays africains. Le maintien d'un mod&egrave;le en mati&egrave;re
de coop&eacute;ration avec les pays du champ d'une part est fortement
remis en question par la crise de ces pays, et d'autre part se
heurte parfois &agrave; l'adh&eacute;sion aux strat&eacute;gies
internationales, comme cela a &eacute;t&eacute; le cas pour le
fonctionnement de la zone franc. Enfin, la strat&eacute;gie globale
fran&ccedil;aise, qui a consist&eacute; &agrave; faire appara&icirc;tre
un groupe solidaire de pays, sous le leadership de la France,
d&eacute;passant le clivage Nord-Sud, est, et sera, de plus en
plus difficile &agrave; mesure qu'une nouvelle pr&eacute;occupation
de la politique d'aide de la France devient d'att&eacute;nuer
la pression (financi&egrave;re mais surtout migratoire) sur la
France d'un continent africain entr&eacute; dans la crise.
<P>
En r&eacute;sum&eacute;, la politique actuelle et future de la
France se dessine &agrave; travers un compromis entre ses objectifs
historiques et les nouvelles pr&eacute;occupations issues de la
profonde crise africaine.
<H2><A NAME="DESCR">2. Description de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise au d&eacute;veloppement
</A></H2>

<H3>2.1.Priorit&eacute;s g&eacute;ographiques</H3>

<P>
La priorit&eacute; g&eacute;ographique de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
est dirig&eacute;e en premier lieu vers l'Afrique subsaharienne,
et en second lieu vers l'Afrique du Nord et l'Oc&eacute;anie (les
territoires d'outre-mer).
<P>
<U>Source : CAD</U> 
<P>
On constate que la sp&eacute;cialisation vers l'Afrique s'est
renforc&eacute;e sur la derni&egrave;re d&eacute;cennie, au d&eacute;triment
essentiellement de l'Oc&eacute;anie. La proportion de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
vers l'Afrique subsaharienne n'est pas une exception. Elle est
comparable &agrave; celle de plusieurs pays du CAD -les pays scandinaves,
l'Irlande, la Belgique, le Portugal.
<P>
L'autre priorit&eacute; g&eacute;ographique de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
est l'orientation vers les pays francophones.En 1992 sept des
dix principaux receveurs de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise &eacute;taient
des pays francophones.
<H3>2.2.Priorit&eacute;s sectorielles et types d'intervention
</H3>

<P>
L'aide fran&ccedil;aise se distingue par son caract&egrave;re
g&eacute;n&eacute;raliste.
<P>
<I>&quot;Elle (la politique fran&ccedil;aise de coop&eacute;ration)
entend articuler nos actions d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement autour
de trois axes privil&eacute;gi&eacute;s : le d&eacute;veloppement
humain, le d&eacute;veloppement productif et le d&eacute;veloppement
culturel... En mati&egrave;re d'APD, certaines priorit&eacute;s
nouvelles ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;finies r&eacute;cemment,
venant s'ajouter aux orientations traditionnelles de la France
(agriculture, &eacute;ducation sant&eacute;, culture, etc...).
Il s'agit en particulier de l'environnement, du d&eacute;veloppement
institutionnel et de la lutte contre la pauvret&eacute;. Le traitement
de la dette reste par ailleurs un th&egrave;me essentiel.&quot;</I>

<P>
L'importance donn&eacute;e &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration culturelle
appara&icirc;t comme une sp&eacute;cificit&eacute; de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise.
<P>
Le champ tr&egrave;s ouvert des domaines d'intervention de l'aide
fran&ccedil;aise, manifeste dans les pays du champ, se lit &agrave;
travers la r&eacute;partition des engagements par type d'intervention.

L'aide fran&ccedil;aise a connu les &eacute;volutions g&eacute;n&eacute;rales
de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement, en particulier l'augmentation
de l'aide non sectorielle, au d&eacute;triment notamment de la
part de l'aide aux secteurs productifs. La grande diversit&eacute;
des actions entreprises n'emp&ecirc;che que certains points forts
se d&eacute;gagent, tels que les concours &agrave; l'&eacute;ducation.
Mais cela ressort autant comme le r&eacute;sultat ex post des
instruments utilis&eacute;s que comme une sp&eacute;cialisation
dans les objectifs. La place privil&eacute;gi&eacute;e de l'aide
&agrave; l'&eacute;ducation peut &ecirc;tre rapproch&eacute;e
de l'importance traditionnelle donn&eacute;e &agrave; la coop&eacute;ration
technique dans l'aide fran&ccedil;aise. Importance qui s'est toutefois
largement r&eacute;duite sur les ann&eacute;es r&eacute;centes.
En 1992, la coop&eacute;ration technique repr&eacute;sentait 27%
de l'APD nette en 1992 contre 21% pour la moyenne du CAD. Ces
ratios &eacute;taient de 37% pour l'aide fran&ccedil;aise et 20%
pour le CAD en 1986/87.

une faible proportion de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise (11% en 1992
contre 22% pour la moyenne du CAD sans la contribution &agrave;
l'aide europ&eacute;enne, 23% contre 30% avec cette contribution).
Mais rapport&eacute; au PIB, la France appara&icirc;t au moins
dans la moyenne des pays du CAD et l&eacute;g&egrave;rement au
dessus si l'on comprend l'Union Europ&eacute;enne.
<P>
La France appara&icirc;t comme un faible contributeur au syst&egrave;me
d'aide des Nations-Unies (2% de son aide en 1992 contre 7.7% pour
la moyenne du CAD). En revanche, elle est un des gros contributeurs
de l'aide europ&eacute;enne, tant en proportion de l'aide totale
que du PIB.
<H5>Pr&ecirc;ts et dons</H5>

<P>
La proportion de dons est stable de l'ordre de 70% du total de
l'aide bilat&eacute;rale fran&ccedil;aise, ce qui est sensiblement
inf&eacute;rieur &agrave; la moyenne du CAD qui se situe autour
de 80%.
<H5>Aide li&eacute;e</H5>

<P>
L'aide fran&ccedil;aise pr&eacute;sente actuellement un degr&eacute;
de liaison sensiblement sup&eacute;rieur &agrave; celui de la
moyenne du CAD (52% en 1991 contre 33% &agrave; la moyenne du
CAD). Elle n'a pas suivi le mouvement d'ensemble vers le d&eacute;liement.
Au contraire, le degr&eacute; de liaison a augment&eacute; durant
la premi&egrave;re moiti&eacute; des ann&eacute;es 1980 (puis
diminu&eacute; par la suite).
<P>
<I>&quot;L'APD de la France est en principe li&eacute;e. Cette
disposition, qui est d'origine l&eacute;gislative, r&eacute;pond
au souci d'obtenir le soutien maximum de l'opinion publique fran&ccedil;aise
&agrave; l'aide aux pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Elle correspond
par ailleurs, &agrave; la volont&eacute; d'associer le nombre
le plus large possible d'intervenants (notamment du secteur priv&eacute;)
&agrave; l'ex&eacute;cution du programme d'aide</I> 
<P>
<I>.&quot;</I> 
<P>
L'importante liaison de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise est, une nouvelle
fois, &agrave; rapprocher de sa r&eacute;partition par instruments,
et en particulier de l'importance de la coop&eacute;ration technique.
<H5>Aide aux Organisations non gouvernementales</H5>

<P>
L'aide publique fran&ccedil;aise destin&eacute;e &agrave; subventionner
l'action des ONG se situe, selon le CAD, autour de 0.2% &agrave;
0.4% du total de l'aide bilat&eacute;rale. Cela est nettement
inf&eacute;rieur &agrave; la moyenne du CAD qui, selon les sources
et les ann&eacute;es, oscille entre 1.2% et 2% de l'ensemble de
l'aide.
<P>
La France se situe &agrave; la 15&egrave;me place des 18 pays
de l'OCDE pour la part des aides publiques au d&eacute;veloppement
mises en oeuvre par les ONG. Toutefois, une tendance semble nettement
se dessiner vers une plus forte participation des ONG aux actions
d'aide publique. Un rapport parlementaire r&eacute;cent propose
de porter de 1% &agrave; 5% la part de l'APD consacr&eacute;e
&agrave; la coop&eacute;ration non gouvernementale (rapport Cazenave).
Cet objectif peut rester &agrave; l'&eacute;tat de voeu, n&eacute;anmoins
d&egrave;s 1995 une augmentation de 30% des cr&eacute;dits allou&eacute;s
au ONG par le Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration est programm&eacute;e;
le Ministre de la Coop&eacute;ration ayant annonc&eacute; un objectif
de 10% du FAC ex&eacute;cut&eacute; par les ONG (contre 4% aujourd'hui).

<H5>Le Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration</H5>

<P>
Jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, le minist&egrave;re de la coop&eacute;ration
d&eacute;finissait et mettait en oeuvre la politique de coop&eacute;ration
avec les &quot;pays du champ&quot; (37 Etats, en majorit&eacute;
francophone, de l'Afrique subsaharienne, de l'Oc&eacute;an Indien
et de la zone Cara&iuml;bes), participait aux n&eacute;gociations
internationales, notamment dans le cadre de la mise en oeuvre
des conventions de Lom&eacute;, et pr&eacute;sidait le comit&eacute;
directeur du Fonds d'Aide et de Coop&eacute;ration (FAC), dont
il &eacute;tait l'ordonnateur principal.
<P>
Ce r&ocirc;le a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tendu &agrave; l'identique
en Mai 1995 &agrave; l'ensemble des pays ACP, en m&ecirc;me que
le minist&egrave;re passait sous la tutelle de celui des affaires
&eacute;trang&egrave;res. Mais, l'extension du FAC &agrave; cette
nouvelle zone g&eacute;ographique n'a pas encore &eacute;t&eacute;
d&eacute;cid&eacute;e.
<P>
Le FAC, principal moyen d'intervention du Minist&egrave;re (35%
de son budget environ), est une subvention d'investissement accord&eacute;
par L'Etat fran&ccedil;ais. Sa gestion contr&ocirc;l&eacute;e
par un comit&eacute; directeur permet une souplesse plus grande
en &eacute;chappant partiellement aux r&egrave;gles de la comptabilit&eacute;
fran&ccedil;aise. Ainsi, le FAC n'est pas soumis &agrave; la r&egrave;gle
de l'annuit&eacute; budg&eacute;taire et permet une programmation
pluri-annuelle. De plus le contr&ocirc;leur financier n'a pas
&agrave; s'engager &agrave; son propos, l'avis du comit&eacute;
directeur &eacute;tant suffisant.
<P>
Le Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration est repr&eacute;sent&eacute;
dans les pays du champ par des missions de coop&eacute;ration
et d'action culturelle (au nombre de 32) plac&eacute;es aupr&egrave;s
des ambassades de France. Le r&ocirc;le des missions de coop&eacute;ration
est &agrave; la fois de participer &agrave; la d&eacute;finition
des politiques et des actions &agrave; entreprendre puis d'en
assurer la mise en oeuvre, le contr&ocirc;le et l'ex&eacute;cution.
<H6>Pays du champ en Afrique (situation d&eacute;but 1994)</H6>

<H5>Le Minist&egrave;re des affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res
</H5>

<P>
Le Minist&egrave;re des Affaires Etrang&egrave;res a la responsabilit&eacute;
de l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement en dehors des pays
du champ du minist&egrave;re de la coop&eacute;ration. Il g&egrave;re
la coop&eacute;ration technique avec ces pays et collabore avec
le Minist&egrave;re de l'&eacute;conomie pour l'aide financi&egrave;re
et les concours d'appui &agrave; l'investissement. De plus, il
g&egrave;re les aspects multilat&eacute;raux et les contributions
de la France aupr&egrave;s des organismes du syst&egrave;me des
Nations-Unies (hors les institutions financi&egrave;res). Les
cr&eacute;ations r&eacute;centes, au sein du Minist&egrave;re,
d'une mission de liaison aupr&egrave;s des organisations non gouvernementales
et d'un service de l'action humanitaire r&eacute;pondent &agrave;
une vocation de coordination des actions dans ces nouveaux domaines.
Enfin, le minist&egrave;re vient d'acquerir la tutelle du minist&egrave;re
de la coop&eacute;ration, et pourra ainsi plus &eacute;troitement
coordonner les actions sur l'e,semble des pays en d&eacute;veloppement.
<H5>Le Minist&egrave;re de l'Economie</H5>

<P>
Dans le domaine de l'aide publique, la Direction du Tr&eacute;sor
du Minist&egrave;re des Finances r&eacute;pond &agrave; quatre
types de missions :
<UL>
<LI>elle attribue les pr&ecirc;ts et dons pour projets d'investissement
dans les pays hors champ (r&ocirc;le jou&eacute; par le FAC dans
les pays du champ);
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>elle est en charge de la coop&eacute;ration mon&eacute;taire
avec les pays de la zone franc et elle joue un r&ocirc;le pivot
dans l'instruction des aides &agrave; l'ajustement structurel;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>elle assure le dialogue et le suivi des activit&eacute;s avec
les institutions financi&egrave;res internationales;
</UL>

<UL>
<LI>elle n&eacute;gocie les accords de consolidation de la dette
dans le cadre du club de Paris.
</UL>

<H5>La Caisse Fran&ccedil;aise de D&eacute;veloppement</H5>

<P>
La Caisse Fran&ccedil;aise de D&eacute;veloppement (CFD) est une
institution financi&egrave;re publique sous tutelle du Premier
Ministre et du ministre des Finances. La Caisse finance des investissements
productifs publics ou priv&eacute;s dans tous les secteurs de
l'&eacute;conomie. Elle finance &eacute;galement pour le compte
de l'Etat des programmes d'ajustement. Elle m&egrave;ne des actions
d'assistance technique et de perfectionnement des cadres.
<P>
La CFD poss&egrave;de des repr&eacute;sentations dans ses principaux
pays d'intervention.
<P>
Ant&eacute;rieurement, le partage des t&acirc;ches dans l'aide
publique aux pays du champ &eacute;tait bas&eacute; sur la nature
des transferts : le Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration
g&eacute;rait les dons et la Caisse Fran&ccedil;aise de D&eacute;veloppement
(alors Caisse Centrale de Coop&eacute;ration Economique) les pr&ecirc;ts.
Ce sch&eacute;ma s'est quelque peu complexifi&eacute; ces derni&egrave;res
ann&eacute;es.
<P>
En premier lieu, depuis le sommet franco-africain de la Baule
(1990), l'aide fran&ccedil;aise &agrave; destination des PMA,
non destin&eacute;e au secteur priv&eacute;, est enti&egrave;rement
sous forme de dons. La Caisse n'a pas pour autant abandonn&eacute;
ses relations avec ces pays, mais est devenue elle-m&ecirc;me
organisme donateur. La r&eacute;partition des r&ocirc;les s'effectue
d&eacute;sormais plut&ocirc;t sur des crit&egrave;res sectoriels
: la Caisse prenant en charge les secteurs productifs et &eacute;conomiques
alors que le Minist&egrave;re se tourne davantage vers les secteurs
sociaux.
<P>
En second lieu, le champ d'intervention de la Caisse s'&eacute;tend
ponctuellement au rythme des autorisations successives. Ainsi,
en 1993 son champ d'action s'est &eacute;tendu &agrave; l'Ethiopie,
l'Erythr&eacute;e, le Cambodge, le Viet-Nam et le Laos. Le champ
d'intervention de la Caisse est donc plus &eacute;largi que l'ancien
champ du Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration mais pas &eacute;tendu
&agrave; l'ensemble des pays en d&eacute;veloppement. Les pays
du Maghreb ou le Ghana par exemple font partie des pays d'intervention
de la Caisse (et non des &quot;pays du champ&quot; de la coop&eacute;ration)
mais pas le Nigeria.
<H5>Les autres minist&egrave;res</H5>

<P>
Outre les minist&egrave;res principalement charg&eacute;s de l'aide
au d&eacute;veloppement, de nombreux d&eacute;partements minist&eacute;riels
ont une action en ce domaine, principalement en coop&eacute;ration
technique. C'est le cas en particulier des minist&egrave;res de
l'&eacute;ducation, de la recherche, de la sant&eacute;, de l'agriculture,
de l'industrie, des affaires sociales, de la jeunesse et des sports.
<P>
Ces minist&egrave;res interviennent parfois par l'interm&eacute;diaire
d'instituts sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;s sous leur tutelle.
<H3>1.2. Organisation et coordination </H3>

<P>
La multiplicit&eacute; des intervenants de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
induit une certaine complexit&eacute; dans son fonctionnement.
<P>
Il n'existe pas r&eacute;ellement d'institution leader de l'aide
fran&ccedil;aise. Le Minist&egrave;re des Finances est certes
de loin le plus gros bailleur d'aide (voir tableau ci-dessous),
mais d'une part les contributions des autres intervenants sont
importantes, d'autre part l'essentiel de l'expertise technique
en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement est plut&ocirc;t au
sein des institutions sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es (en particulier
le Minist&egrave;re de la coop&eacute;ration et la CFD).

<P>
Le partage des comp&eacute;tences entre les institutions se fait,
comme cela a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;voqu&eacute;, sur un compromis
entre des crit&egrave;res g&eacute;ographiques et des crit&egrave;res
d'instrument et de secteur d'intervention : le soutien financier
pour le Minist&egrave;re des Finances, l'ajustement et l'investissement
dans les secteurs productifs pour la CFD, l'investissement dans
les secteurs sociaux et l'assistance technique pour le Minist&egrave;re
de la Coop&eacute;ration, les interventions sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;es
pour les autres minist&egrave;res.
<P>
La multiplicit&eacute; des structures impliqu&eacute;es, leur
responsabilit&eacute; respectives sur des champs et des instruments
particuliers, l'importance de la repr&eacute;sentation &agrave;
l'&eacute;tranger font du syst&egrave;me d'aide fran&ccedil;ais
un dispositif particuli&egrave;rement peu concentr&eacute;. Cela
doit &ecirc;tre vu comme une sp&eacute;cificit&eacute; importante
de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise. On pourrait presque dire que l'aide
au d&eacute;veloppement, principalement africain, poss&egrave;de
un caract&egrave;re diffus dans l'administration fran&ccedil;aise.
Il en r&eacute;sulte une connaissance &eacute;largie des probl&egrave;mes
de d&eacute;veloppement, mais aussi une absence de coh&eacute;rence
et de coordination manifeste.
<P>
Le probl&egrave;me de la coordination des intervenants se pose
&eacute;galement pour la repr&eacute;sentation et le dialogue
fran&ccedil;ais avec les institutions internationales. Ainsi le
Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration ne pouvait jusqu'&agrave;
pr&eacute;sent &ecirc;tre l'interlocuteur de l'Union Europ&eacute;enne
ou de la Banque Mondiale que pour les pays du champ, ce qui ne
correspond pas &agrave; une subdivision op&eacute;rationnelle
pour le dialogue international. Seul le Tr&eacute;sor poss&egrave;de
une comp&eacute;tence g&eacute;ographique &eacute;largie &agrave;
l'ensemble du monde en d&eacute;veloppement. Il est l'interlocuteur
naturel des Institutions Financi&egrave;res Internationales et
a la responsabilit&eacute; des n&eacute;gociations avec ces organismes.
Mais, il n'est gu&egrave;re pr&eacute;par&eacute; &agrave; repr&eacute;senter
les positions fran&ccedil;aises en mati&egrave;res d'aide projet
ou de coop&eacute;ration technique par exemple, domaines de comp&eacute;tences
des autres institutions intervenantes.
<P>
De fait, les positions et les actions fran&ccedil;aises en mati&egrave;re
d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement ne peuvent qu'&ecirc;tre arbitr&eacute;es
qu'au niveau interminist&eacute;riel. Cela se fait parfois sous
l'&eacute;gide du Premier Minist&egrave;re ou de la Pr&eacute;sidence
de la R&eacute;publique. Un autre m&eacute;canisme interminist&eacute;riel,
r&eacute;serv&eacute; aux pays du champ, a &eacute;galement vu
le jour en 1991 -le Comit&eacute; d'Orientation et de Programmation
(COP)- qui est cens&eacute; assurer la compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute;
et la coh&eacute;rence des interventions de la coop&eacute;ration
dans les pays du champ. Le COP r&eacute;unit sous la pr&eacute;sidence
du ministre de la Coop&eacute;ration, les repr&eacute;sentants
de son propre minist&egrave;re, du Minist&egrave;re des Affaires
Etrang&egrave;res, du Minist&egrave;re de l'Economie et de la
CFD. Le rapport du CAD note toutefois que cette instance &eacute;prouve
des difficult&eacute;s assumer son r&ocirc;le.
<H2><A NAME="GEST">2. La gestion de l'aide</A></H2>

<H3>2.1. L'aide sectorielle (projets et coop&eacute;ration technique)
</H3>

<H5>Orientations et concertation</H5>

<P>
Dans les pays du champ, la gestion des actions de d&eacute;veloppement
se situe dans un processus de dialogue continu entre le Minist&egrave;re
de la Coop&eacute;ration, les missions locales et les autorit&eacute;s
des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires. L'administration centrale
d&eacute;finit des politiques sectorielles dans lesquelles doivent
s'inscrire les initiatives des missions en mati&egrave;re de programmation
et de proposition. Ces politiques sectorielles constituent un
&eacute;l&eacute;ment nouveau des orientations de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
aux pays du champ, qui &eacute;taient auparavant bas&eacute;es
sur la nature des projets puis sur des programmes (&agrave; partir
du d&eacute;but des ann&eacute;es 1980).
<P>
Ce changement dans l'instrument de coh&eacute;rence des programmes
d'aide a conditionn&eacute; l'&eacute;volution de la concertation
entre les autorit&eacute;s de la France et des pays receveurs.
Les commissions mixtes bilat&eacute;rales, qui avaient auparavant
lieu tr&egrave;s fr&eacute;quemment (le plus souvent tous les
ans) et qui discutaient des actions &agrave; mettre en oeuvre,
deviennent progressivement moins fr&eacute;quentes (tous les 3
ou 4 ans) et portent d&eacute;sormais sur les politiques sectorielles.
Ces commissions mixtes d&eacute;bouchent sur un proc&egrave;s
verbal qui fixe un cadre &agrave; la programmation effectu&eacute;e
par les missions locales et sert &eacute;galement &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration
annuelle de pr&eacute;visions glissantes sur 3 ans des actions
&agrave; entreprendre -les Orientations &agrave; Moyen Terme (OMT)-,
&eacute;tablies conjointement par les repr&eacute;sentations locales
de la Coop&eacute;ration et de la CFD (et examin&eacute;es par
le Comit&eacute; d'Orientation et de Programme-COP).
<P>
Par ailleurs, les repr&eacute;sentations locales de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
participent naturellement aux proc&eacute;dures de concertation
&eacute;largies entre autorit&eacute;s locales et donateur -tables
rondes, groupes consultatifs, etc...
<P>
En dehors de ces concertations formelles, l'organisation d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e
de la gestion des projets est destin&eacute;e &agrave; permettre
une concertation continue tant avec les autorit&eacute;s des pays
receveurs qu'avec les agences des autres donateurs.
<H5>Programmation</H5>

<P>
<I>&quot;La programmation de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise se fait en
fonction de l'enveloppe budg&eacute;taire vot&eacute;e pour les
diff&eacute;rentes branches de l'administration, chaque administration
&eacute;tant responsable de la gestion de son budget. Les r&egrave;gles
du budget permettent une budg&eacute;tisation, et donc programmation,
sur plusieurs ann&eacute;es lorsqu'il s'agit de l'aide &agrave;
l'investissement (FAC, protocoles du Tr&eacute;sor), tandis que
pour la coop&eacute;ration technique il n'y a qu'un seul budget
annuel.&quot;</I> 
<P>
La programmation se fait s&eacute;par&eacute;ment pour chaque
administration responsable. Il n'existe donc pas de programmation
globale par pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire.
<P>
En ce qui concerne les pays du champ, le Budget de la coop&eacute;ration
est dans un premier temps partag&eacute; entre les actions concernant
un Etat (g&eacute;r&eacute;es par les missions locales de coop&eacute;ration),
les actions inter-Etats et les actions d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
g&eacute;n&eacute;ral. Pour le FAC en 1990, ces trois types d'actions
repr&eacute;sentaient respectivement 55%, 12% et 33% du total.
Les fonds destin&eacute;s aux programmes-Etats sont alors r&eacute;partis
selon les b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.
<P>
<I>&quot;Au Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration, un d&eacute;partement
de la programmation est charg&eacute; de pr&eacute;parer la &quot;programmation
Etat&quot; c'est-&agrave;-dire par pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
du champ. Pour cela, le d&eacute;partement s'appuie sur les pr&eacute;parations
du budget du Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration men&eacute;e
par le sous-direction du budget, des contr&ocirc;les et des march&eacute;s
(direction de l'administration g&eacute;n&eacute;rale). Une fois
le budget discut&eacute; et approuv&eacute; par le Parlement (octobre-d&eacute;cembre),
le d&eacute;partement r&eacute;partit les dotations budg&eacute;taires
aux missions de coop&eacute;ration : une pour la coop&eacute;ration
technique, une autre pour les projets d'investissement &agrave;
financer par le FAC, et une troisi&egrave;me pour les petites
interventions comme la formation des boursiers, la livraison de
vaccins et de livres. Les missions sont pri&eacute;es de proposer
des projets et programmes dans le cadre de ces enveloppes... Une
fois les propositions des missions de coop&eacute;ration re&ccedil;ues,
en automne, le Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration et pour
les programmes d'investissement le Comit&eacute; Directeur du
FAC d&eacute;terminent les programmes par pays pour l'ann&eacute;e
prochaine.&quot;</I> 
<P>
Pour les pays hors champ, la programmation se fait sur proposition
du Minist&egrave;re des Finances pour les actions d'investissement
(protocoles du tr&eacute;sor), et sous forme d'une enveloppe globale
pour la coop&eacute;ration technique.
<P>
<I>&quot;La coop&eacute;ration technique avec les pays hors champ,
men&eacute;e par la DGRCST (du Minist&egrave;re des affaires Etrang&egrave;res),
n'est pas programm&eacute;e syst&eacute;matiquement d'avance pour
chaque pays. L'enveloppe disponible pour ces interventions est
plut&ocirc;t utilis&eacute;e en fonction de la demande des autorit&eacute;s
des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.&quot;</I> 
<H5>Le cycle du projet</H5>

<P>
Pour les pays du champ, l'identification des actions &agrave;
entreprendre est largement d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e au niveau
des missions de coop&eacute;ration. Pour l'assistance technique
comme pour les projets bilat&eacute;raux (relevant des programmes-Etats),
les missions locales de coop&eacute;ration ont comp&eacute;tence
pour proposer les actions &agrave; entreprendre. L'initiative
en provient soit du pays receveur, soit de la mission elle-m&ecirc;me
en concertation avec les autorit&eacute;s locales. La mission
dispose de cr&eacute;dits d&eacute;concentr&eacute;s d'intervention
(10% &agrave; 20% des programmes pays) qui lui permettent de prendre
en charge les petits projets (en dessous de 1 million de francs).
Le contr&ocirc;le sur ces projets s'effectue ex post &agrave;
partir d'un compte rendu annuel d'utilisation de ces cr&eacute;dits.
<P>
Pour les actions plus importantes, la mission instruit un dossier
en pr&eacute;parant une fiche de prise en consid&eacute;ration
(3 &agrave; 4 pages) qui est examin&eacute; au niveau central
par le Comit&eacute; d'Examen. En cas d'avis favorable, l'instruction
est poursuivie conjointement aux niveaux local et central pour
aboutir &agrave; un rapport de pr&eacute;sentation plus d&eacute;taill&eacute;
(30 &agrave; 35 pages). Le Comit&eacute; d'Examen donne un nouvel
avis, et transmet en cas de r&eacute;ponse positive au Comit&eacute;
Directeur du FAC pour d&eacute;cision d&eacute;finitive. Le projet,
une fois approuv&eacute;, donne alors lieu &agrave; la signature
d'une convention qui peut inclure des conditions sp&eacute;cifiques
au financement. La dur&eacute;e de la proc&eacute;dure compl&egrave;te,
de l'identification au d&eacute;marrage de la mise en oeuvre,
peut-&ecirc;tre estim&eacute;e en moyenne autour de 1 an et demi.
<P>
La mise en oeuvre peut alors &ecirc;tre ex&eacute;cut&eacute;e
soit par la mission, soit par l'Etat receveur. Dans ce dernier
cas, qui reste minoritaire, les cr&eacute;dits sont d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;s
aux autorit&eacute;s locales responsables avec toutefois un pouvoir
de veto sur l'engagement des d&eacute;penses d&eacute;tenu par
la mission.
<P>
Pour les projets inter-Etats et d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t g&eacute;n&eacute;ral,
le Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration joue le r&ocirc;le
central. Il prend le plus souvent l'initiative des actions &agrave;
entreprendre et des concertations avec les pays concern&eacute;s.
Il instruit les dossiers selon une proc&eacute;dure identique
&agrave; celle pr&eacute;c&eacute;demment d&eacute;crite et met
en oeuvre les projets.
<P>
En dehors du champ, la d&eacute;cision se situe &eacute;galement
au niveau central du Minist&egrave;re concern&eacute; (Finances
ou Affaires Etrang&egrave;res). En revanche, la participation
du pays receveur est en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral plus importante
tant dans l'initiative des actions &agrave; entreprendre que dans
leur mise en oeuvre.
<H3>2.2. L'aide financi&egrave;re</H3>

<H5>Les diff&eacute;rents types d'aide</H5>

<P>
L'aide financi&egrave;re fran&ccedil;aise se partage en trois
types principaux d'intervention : les op&eacute;rations de traitement
de la dette (annulation et consolidation), les aides budg&eacute;taires
et les concours d'ajustement structurel. En 1992, l'aide financi&egrave;re
s'est partag&eacute;e en environ 40% pour le traitement de la
dette, 20% pour l'ajustement structurel et 25% pour les aides
budg&eacute;taires.
<P>
Les op&eacute;rations de traitement de la dette rel&egrave;vent
le plus souvent du Club de Paris, o&ugrave; la France tente de
jouer un r&ocirc;le influent pour adapter le traitement de la
dette &agrave; la situation r&eacute;elle des pays les plus endett&eacute;s.
<P>
Les aides budg&eacute;taires sont accord&eacute;es de mani&egrave;re
ad hoc sur d&eacute;cision des autorit&eacute;s fran&ccedil;aises,
et ne donnent pas lieu en principe &agrave; la signature d'une
convention et l'engagement dans un programme, &agrave; la diff&eacute;rence
des concours d'ajustement structurel.. La proc&eacute;dure qui
r&eacute;git ces derniers m&eacute;rite une certaine attention.
<H5>Les concours d'ajustement structurel</H5>

<P>
En dehors de sa contribution aux programmes multilat&eacute;raux,
la France finance elle-m&ecirc;me ses propres programmes d'ajustement
structurel &agrave; destination de certains pays du champ. La
responsabilit&eacute; des n&eacute;gociations incombe au Minist&egrave;re
des Finances. Les concours associ&eacute;s &agrave; ces programmes
sont g&eacute;r&eacute;s avec la CFD, en &eacute;troite collaboration
avec les Minist&egrave;res des Finances et de la Coop&eacute;ration,
qui en fournit la partie don (subventions et bonifications d'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t
<P>
Les programmes d'ajustement structurel sont pr&eacute;par&eacute;s
de mani&egrave;re tripartite (CFD, Minist&egrave;re des Finances,
Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration) et donnent lieu &agrave;
la signature d'une convention avec le pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire.
Chaque op&eacute;ration de d&eacute;caissement est elle-m&ecirc;me
le r&eacute;sultat d'une proc&eacute;dure tripartite en trois
phases : mission d'instruction, mission financi&egrave;re, passage
en Conseil de Surveillance de la CFD.
<P>
Jusqu'&agrave; une date r&eacute;cente, les programmes d'ajustement
structurel fran&ccedil;ais fonctionnait davantage sur une logique
d'affectation que de conditionnalit&eacute;. Les concours consentis
&eacute;tait dans leur majorit&eacute; affect&eacute;s &agrave;
des d&eacute;penses budg&eacute;taires identifi&eacute;es (souvent
en priorit&eacute; la r&eacute;duction des arri&eacute;r&eacute;s
int&eacute;rieurs de l'Etat par exemple) ou, pour une part faible,
&agrave; des programmes d'appui (appui &agrave; la gestion financi&egrave;re).
La convention financi&egrave;re sign&eacute;e dans le cadre du
programme d'ajustement entre la France et le pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire
contenait certes des &quot;engagements particuliers&quot; &agrave;
r&eacute;aliser par le pays, mais ceux-ci &eacute;taient le plus
souvent de nature technique (par exemple r&eacute;alisation d'un
audit), et d&eacute;bouchaient rarement sur de v&eacute;ritables
conditionnalit&eacute;s.
<P>
Depuis Septembre 1993, sur d&eacute;cision du Premier Ministre,
les programmes d'ajustement structurel fran&ccedil;ais ne peuvent
concerner que les pays en programme avec le FMI. La position fran&ccedil;aise
en mati&egrave;re d'ajustement est donc vraisemblablement en train
d'&eacute;voluer vers des programmes conditionnels coordonn&eacute;s
avec ceux des institutions de Bretton-Woods.
<H3>2.3. Evaluation</H3>

<P>
Un tableau r&eacute;cent et complet des structures et processus
d'&eacute;valuation de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise a &eacute;t&eacute;
fait par le CAD &agrave; l'occasion de l'examen de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise.
Le descriptif ci-dessous en sera donc une s&eacute;rie d'extraits.
<P>
Chacune des institutions charg&eacute;es d'administrer un programme
d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement poss&egrave;de sa propre structure
charg&eacute;e d'&eacute;valuer les r&eacute;sultats des actions
financ&eacute;es.
<P>
<I>Au minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration &quot;depuis 1989,
une mission charg&eacute;e des &eacute;tudes, des &eacute;valuations
et de la prospective (MEEP) organise, entre autres, des &eacute;valuations
de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise aux pays du champ (environ deux &eacute;valuations
par an sur des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires et six &agrave;
huit sur des secteurs d'intervention)... Les &eacute;valuations
par pays analysent le programme de la coop&eacute;ration fran&ccedil;aise
dans son ensemble et tentent de d&eacute;terminer si les objectifs
fix&eacute;s ont &eacute;t&eacute; atteints.... La MEEP produit
des rapports de synth&egrave;se des r&eacute;sultats obtenus des
&eacute;valuations. Ces rapports restent &agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur
de l'administration et ne sont distribu&eacute;s aux autorit&eacute;s
des pays partenaires qu'au cas par cas. La MEEP produit toutefois
un rapport annuel d'activit&eacute;s qui est disponible pour le
public.... L'&eacute;valuation n'est pas seulement un contr&ocirc;le
de conformit&eacute; financi&egrave;re et technique, mais aussi
une analyse approfondie de l'impact sur le d&eacute;veloppement
de l'action &eacute;valu&eacute;e. Trois types d'&eacute;valuation
se distinguent : (i) celles de type g&eacute;ographique; (ii)
celles de type sectoriel; (iii) celles de politique des moyens.&quot;</I>

<P>
*
<P>
<I>Au Minist&egrave;re des Affaires Etrang&egrave;res, &quot;pour
les activit&eacute;s de coop&eacute;ration technique, programm&eacute;es
et g&eacute;r&eacute;es par la direction de la coop&eacute;ration,
la capacit&eacute; d'&eacute;valuation &eacute;tait faible jusqu'&agrave;
pr&eacute;sent ; un Comit&eacute; d'&eacute;valuation et de programmation
pr&eacute;voyait les activit&eacute;s pour l'ann&eacute;e suivante
en se basant sur des rapports des ambassades dans les pays hors
champ. La r&eacute;forme administrative actuellement en cours
au Minist&egrave;re, et plus particuli&egrave;rement &agrave;
la DGRCST, va instaurer une proc&eacute;dure pour un service d'&eacute;valuation
proprement dit : un Comit&eacute; d'&eacute;valuation au niveau
de la DGRCST analysera les politiques et les outils de la coop&eacute;ration
technique.&quot;</I> 
<P>
<I>A la CFD &quot;un service Evaluations r&eacute;trospectives
est en place et a &eacute;valu&eacute; en 1993 14 projets/programmes
op&eacute;rationnels de la Caisse dans un nombre de pays du champ
et de DOM/TOM... La CFD publie certains rapports de synth&egrave;se...
Depuis peu, la Caisse diffuse aussi un bref r&eacute;sum&eacute;
de ses activit&eacute;s d'&eacute;valuation pass&eacute;es et
programm&eacute;es (la lettre de l'&eacute;valuation).&quot;</I>

<P>
<I>Au Minist&egrave;re des Finances, &quot;la cellule &eacute;valuation
de la Direction du Tr&eacute;sor organise, depuis 1987, des &eacute;valuations
de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise aux pays hors champ. Les activit&eacute;s
d'&eacute;valuation portent essentiellement sur les programmes
financ&eacute;s sur protocoles financiers de la Direction du Tr&eacute;sor.
Chaque ann&eacute;e 12 &agrave; 15% environ du nombre de projets
sont &eacute;valu&eacute;s. Des &eacute;valuations par secteur,
type d'aide et pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire sont aussi conduites.
Les &eacute;valuations sont confi&eacute;es &agrave; des experts
externes sous contrat... La cellule &eacute;valuation &eacute;labore
une synth&egrave;se annuelle des &eacute;valuations r&eacute;alis&eacute;es.
Enfin elle anime un groupe de travail de l'&eacute;valuation de
l'aide comprenant les services d'&eacute;valuation des diff&eacute;rents
organismes charg&eacute;s de programme de coop&eacute;ration au
d&eacute;veloppement (MC, MAE, CFD) permettant d'assurer coordination
et &eacute;changes en mati&egrave;re d'&eacute;valuation.&quot;</I>

<P>
Enfin, les OSI n'ayant souvent pas les moyens n&eacute;cessaires
pour entreprendre des &eacute;valuations externes de leurs actions,
une aide &agrave; l'&eacute;valuation peut leur &ecirc;tre apport&eacute;
sous forme d'un fonds d'&eacute;tudes et d'&eacute;valuations.
<H2><A NAME="ENJ"><HR>III. LES ENJEUX ACTUELS</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="EVOL">1. Evolutions r&eacute;centes</A></H2>

<P>
Le syst&egrave;me d'aide fran&ccedil;ais est avant tout marqu&eacute;
par une grande continuit&eacute;. Il n'est pas exag&eacute;r&eacute;
de dire que l'architecture du syst&egrave;me d'aide et les grands
principes qui le gouverne sont inchang&eacute;s depuis la p&eacute;riode
qui a suivi la d&eacute;colonisation. Les instruments utilis&eacute;s,
les priorit&eacute;s sectorielles et g&eacute;ographiques ont
connu quelques modifications (apparition de l'aide programme et
de la conditionnalit&eacute;, &eacute;largissement du champ, nouvelles
priorit&eacute;s), mais l&agrave; encore c'est ind&eacute;niablement
la continuit&eacute; qui pr&eacute;domine.
<P>
Cependant la p&eacute;riode actuelle pourrait s'av&eacute;rer
marquer une inflexion sensible dans les orientations et le positionnement
de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise. Depuis Septembre 1993, les concours
financiers fran&ccedil;ais sont d&eacute;sormais conditionn&eacute;s
&agrave; la conclusion de programmes n&eacute;goci&eacute;s par
les Etats avec les institutions financi&egrave;res internationales.
Cette d&eacute;cision montre clairement d'une part, la reconnaissance
du leadership des IFI pour mener le dialogue avec les pays receveurs
et coordonner les aides bilat&eacute;rales, d'autre part l'acceptation
sans r&eacute;serve de la conditionnalit&eacute; de l'appui des
bailleurs de fonds &agrave; des engagements sur des programmes
et mesures de politique &eacute;conomique. Ces deux points t&eacute;moignent
d'un certain tournant avec les positions pass&eacute;es prises
par les institutions fran&ccedil;aises. Les modifications survenues,
par la suite, dans la gestions de la zone franc (limitation de
la convertibilit&eacute;, d&eacute;valuation) am&egrave;nent certain
observateurs &agrave; parler de rupture dans la politique fran&ccedil;aise
vis-&agrave;-vis de son champ. Cela semble confirm&eacute; par
la r&eacute;forme en cours du Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration
dont le champ a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;tendu &agrave; l'ensemble
des pays ACP.
<P>
S'il ne faut pas sous-estimer la port&eacute;e de telles &eacute;volutions,
il convient &eacute;galement d'en remarquer les &eacute;l&eacute;ments
de continuit&eacute;. Depuis l'engagement de la France dans des
programmes d'ajustement structurel d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but
des ann&eacute;es 1980, l'alignement de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
derri&egrave;re les conditionnalit&eacute;s des institutions internationales
a d&eacute;j&agrave; &eacute;t&eacute; maintes fois pratiqu&eacute;,
m&ecirc;me si cela n'&eacute;tait pas un principe intangible et
si il existe quelques contre-exemples fameux (le soutien de la
France &agrave; la C&ocirc;te d'Ivoire et au Cameroun au d&eacute;but
des ann&eacute;es 1990). De m&ecirc;me, il faut rapprocher les
modifications du fonctionnement de la zone franc de l'appui au
renforcement des ensembles r&eacute;gionaux francophones, notamment
l'UEMOA, pour comprendre que l&agrave; aussi on d&eacute;note
une grande continuit&eacute; dans les objectifs poursuivis par
l'aide fran&ccedil;aise. Enfin, si le champ d'action du minist&egrave;re
de la coop&eacute;ration a &eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;largi, rien
a encore &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;cid&eacute; en ce qui concerne
le FAC (cf infra), bras financier du minist&egrave;re.
<P>
En fait, les changements r&eacute;cents sont l'aboutissement d'un
processus amorc&eacute; depuis longtemps d'une prise en compte
croissante des contraintes &eacute;conomiques et du conteste international
dans les relations entre la France et ses principaux partenaires,
&agrave; partir d'une situation o&ugrave; les relations &eacute;taient
essentiellement politiques et bilat&eacute;rales.
<H2><A NAME="AFAC">2. Aide fran&ccedil;aise et aide communautaire</A></H2>

<H3>2.1.Positions et influence fran&ccedil;aise</H3>

<P>
L'influence fran&ccedil;aise a historiquement &eacute;t&eacute;
tr&egrave;s forte sur l'orientation de l'aide europ&eacute;enne.
L'instauration du FED, l'orientation g&eacute;ographique africaine,
sont directement dues &agrave; l'influence fran&ccedil;aise, qui,
pourrait-on dire, a constitu&eacute; l'inspiration principale
des accords de Yaound&eacute; puis de Lom&eacute;. La France d&eacute;fend
toujours aupr&egrave;s de l'Union Europ&eacute;enne des positions
allant dans le m&ecirc;me sens : soutien &agrave; une politique
financi&egrave;re ambitieuse, maintien de zones prioritaires privil&eacute;gi&eacute;es
de l'aide communautaire -en premier lieu les pays ACP, en second
lieu les pays du Maghreb.
<P>
La France voit dans l'Union Europ&eacute;enne un certain nombre
d'atouts qui pourraient lui permettre de jouer un r&ocirc;le tout
&agrave; fait particulier dans le syst&egrave;me d'aide. L'aide
europ&eacute;enne, relativement d&eacute;gag&eacute;e des contraintes
politiques et autonome par rapport aux appareils administratifs
nationaux, devrait par cette neutralit&eacute; &ecirc;tre &agrave;
m&ecirc;me de d&eacute;gager une conception europ&eacute;enne
du d&eacute;veloppement, commune aux pays membres. Elle appara&icirc;t,
pour les m&ecirc;mes raisons, bien plac&eacute;e pour organiser
un dialogue de partenariat avec les pays receveurs, et notamment
&agrave; d&eacute;fendre les valeurs de gouvernance, Etat de droit
et d&eacute;mocratie. La large comp&eacute;tence de l'Union Europ&eacute;enne
en mati&egrave;re commerciale, ainsi que ses positions vers la
lib&eacute;ralisation des &eacute;changes, devraient lui permettre
de progresser davantage sur la voie d'une politique d'aide int&eacute;gr&eacute;e
&agrave; la politique commerciale. Enfin, les montants importants
de financement &agrave; disposition europ&eacute;enne devraient
lui conf&eacute;rer un avantage dans les grands projets &agrave;
vocation multinationale -grandes infrastructures, projets d'int&eacute;gration
r&eacute;gionale.
<P>
Il est probable que l'influence fran&ccedil;aise sur la politique
d'aide europ&eacute;enne soit d&eacute;clinante, bien qu'encore
importante. L'&eacute;largissement de l'Union, les positions des
pays du nord du continent, les critiques de plus en plus fr&eacute;quemment
formul&eacute;es &agrave; l'encontre du syst&egrave;me de Lom&eacute;
pourraient m&ecirc;me conduire progressivement &agrave; un certain
isolement de la France dans sa d&eacute;fense de priorit&eacute;s
g&eacute;ographiques et d'une politique d'aide ambitieuse et g&eacute;n&eacute;raliste
envers les pays africains.
<H3>2.2. Coordination</H3>

<P>
La coordination entre l'aide fran&ccedil;aise et l'aide europ&eacute;enne
s'effectue dans le cadre des structures communautaires ad hoc
: groupe coop&eacute;ration et d&eacute;veloppement (pr&eacute;paratoire
au conseil des ministres), comit&eacute; du FED. Des concertations
informelles sont &eacute;galement organis&eacute;es au niveau
central ou dans les pays du champ, comme c'est &eacute;galement
le cas avec d'autres coop&eacute;rations bilat&eacute;rales europ&eacute;ennes.
<P>
Peut-on aller plus loin que ce dialogue ? Il convient de rappeler
que la priorit&eacute; de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise est de nature
g&eacute;ographique et non sectorielle. Sur son champ g&eacute;ographique
d'intervention privil&eacute;gi&eacute;, l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
est par vocation g&eacute;n&eacute;raliste. Aussi, le syst&egrave;me
d'aide fran&ccedil;ais est oppos&eacute; &agrave; une tendance
qui irait dans le sens d'une sp&eacute;cialisation sectorielle
des donateurs europ&eacute;ens sous l'&eacute;gide de l'Union
Europ&eacute;enne, sans l'accomplissement d'un processus pr&eacute;alable
de coordination (cf infra). Dans ce sens, l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
n'est pas favorable aux id&eacute;es de compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute;
des aides europ&eacute;ennes et encore plus de substituabilit&eacute;
de ces aides. D'autant plus, qu'&agrave; son sens, il n'appara&icirc;t
pas que l'aide europ&eacute;enne (ou toute autre aide) puisse
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier d'un avantage incontestable et durable
dans un domaine sectoriel (si ce n'est des exemples limit&eacute;s
tels que les grands projets d'infrastructure cit&eacute;s ci-dessus).
<P>
Beaucoup de sp&eacute;cialistes fran&ccedil;ais font officieusement
l'analyse que la coop&eacute;ration europ&eacute;enne s'est en
quelque sorte tromp&eacute;e de vocation en se voulant un ex&eacute;cutant
de projets au m&ecirc;me niveau que les pays membres, alors que
sa sp&eacute;cificit&eacute; l'appelait plut&ocirc;t &agrave;
devenir un p&ocirc;le d'excellence en mati&egrave;re de r&eacute;flexion
sur le d&eacute;veloppement et de conception de politiques et
de strat&eacute;gies. Pour ces sp&eacute;cialistes, la situation
actuelle, largement &agrave; l'oppos&eacute;, rend difficile une
avanc&eacute;e effective vers la coordination des aides europ&eacute;ennes.
<P>
D'une part, l'Union Europ&eacute;enne n'a pas relev&eacute; le
d&eacute;fi de construire une vision europ&eacute;enne du d&eacute;veloppement.
De ce fait, le syst&egrave;me d'aide europ&eacute;en n'appara&icirc;t
que rarement comme un p&ocirc;le attractif de r&eacute;flexion
et de d&eacute;bat. Il est symptomatique de remarquer que les
&eacute;changes d'id&eacute;es sont beaucoup plus nombreux entre
le Minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration et la Banque Mondiale,
en d&eacute;pit de domaines de divergence ou de concurrence, qu'entre
ce m&ecirc;me Minist&egrave;re et la Direction G&eacute;n&eacute;rale
du D&eacute;veloppement de l'Union Europ&eacute;enne. D'autre
part, la pr&eacute;sence sur le terrain du dispositif europ&eacute;en
comme ex&eacute;cuteur de projet au m&ecirc;me titre que les aides
bilat&eacute;rales, bien qu'utile &agrave; la vaste t&acirc;che
&agrave; accomplir, n'ajoute rien en l'&eacute;tat actuel des
choses &agrave; la coordination des donateurs europ&eacute;ens.
<P>
La France n'appara&icirc;t pas favorable &agrave; une coordination
planifi&eacute;e et dirig&eacute;e. Elle pense que la comp&eacute;tence
sectorielle ou g&eacute;ographique ne doit pas se d&eacute;cr&eacute;ter
en termes de territoire -cela ne peut &ecirc;tre efficace-, mais
s'imposer d'elle m&ecirc;me en termes d'efficacit&eacute;. A ce
titre, une r&eacute;elle compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; ne peut
se concevoir que progressivement dans un processus lent de convergence
entre acteurs europ&eacute;ens. En premier lieu, une philosophie
commune devrait &ecirc;tre exprim&eacute;e. Ensuite, sur le terrain,
l'Union pourrait jouer un r&ocirc;le d'animation en faisant jouer
les aides bilat&eacute;rales ensemble, notamment par la concertation
et la circulation d'information. Progressivement alors, chaque
partenaire pourrait spontan&eacute;ment trouver sa fonction dans
une strat&eacute;gie coordonn&eacute;e. Il n'est pas s&ucirc;r
que l'Union Europ&eacute;enne poss&egrave;de actuellement les
moyens humains pour jouer un tel r&ocirc;le.
<H2><A NAME="IMPUT">3. Imputabilit&eacute; (accountability)de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
</A></H2>

<H3>3.1.Diffusion de l'information</H3>

<P>
Tout le monde s'accorde &agrave; reconna&icirc;tre que l'aide
fran&ccedil;aise est fort peu lisible. Cela provient en premier
lieu de l'&eacute;clatement des structures administratives concern&eacute;es.
Peu d'efforts sont faits pour tenter de diffuser une information
agr&eacute;g&eacute;e portant sur l'ensemble de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise.
Cela concerne par exemple le descriptif statistique de l'aide.
Reconstituer les donn&eacute;es de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise rel&egrave;ve
bien souvent de la gageure. Il est ainsi extr&ecirc;mement difficile
de reconstituer l'ensemble des transferts au titre de l'aide par
pays destinataire pour une ann&eacute;e donn&eacute;e.
<P>
Le manque de lisibilit&eacute; affecte &eacute;galement la strat&eacute;gie
g&eacute;n&eacute;rale de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise pour la m&ecirc;me
raison de dispersion des actions entre des acteurs qui poursuivent
des objectifs sp&eacute;cifiques et d'absence de r&eacute;flexion
de synth&egrave;se, accessible au public, qui replace l'ensemble
des actions dans un cadre coh&eacute;rent. Cet &eacute;tat de
fait est d'ailleurs reconnu par les autorit&eacute;s fran&ccedil;aises.
<P>
Les analyses portant sur l'&eacute;valuation des programmes et
des projets d'aide sont exclusivement destin&eacute;es &agrave;
l'information interne des structures de coop&eacute;ration et
ne sont pas disponibles pour les requ&ecirc;tes ext&eacute;rieures.
<H3>3.2. Imputabilit&eacute; vis &agrave; vis des instances l&eacute;gislatives
</H3>

<P>
L'influence des instances l&eacute;gislatives, qui se plaignent
parfois du manque de lisibilit&eacute; du dispositif &agrave;
leur niveau, sur les orientations de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
para&icirc;t avoir &eacute;t&eacute; faible dans le pass&eacute;.
Il n'y a pas jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent d'exemples d'initiatives
parlementaires directes ayant notablement influ&eacute; la politique
fran&ccedil;aise d'aide.
<P>
Il est cependant possible que les choses soient en train de changer.
Le rapport Cazenave, &agrave; la suite du rapport Duffaure du
Conseil Economique et Social, est soutenu par les OSI (cf infra)
et ne semble pas mal accueilli par les autorit&eacute;s qui reconnaissent,
notamment dans les r&eacute;ponses aux questions parlementaires,
la n&eacute;cessit&eacute; d'une simplification institutionnelle
et d'un recours accru &agrave; l'ex&eacute;cution priv&eacute;e.
<P>
En 1989, cinq d&eacute;put&eacute;s des principales familles politiques
fran&ccedil;aises (allant du parti communiste &agrave; la droite
parlementaire) ont r&eacute;dig&eacute; un projet de loi (couramment
d&eacute;nomm&eacute;e Loi Survie) visant &agrave; instaurer &quot;une
coop&eacute;ration contractuelle, en faveur des populations les
plus d&eacute;favoris&eacute;es, et anim&eacute;e par la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile&quot;. Ce projet de loi a re&ccedil;u la signature de 72%
du parlement actuel (416 d&eacute;put&eacute;s sur 577) et le
soutien de nombreux repr&eacute;sentants de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile. Elle attend d'&ecirc;tre inscrite &agrave; l'ordre du
jour des travaux de l'Assembl&eacute;e Nationale, pr&eacute;rogative
du gouvernement. Quelle que soit l'issue de cette initiative,
elle montre une volont&eacute; nouvelle du Parlement de jouer
un r&ocirc;le dans le domaine de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement.
<H3>3.3. Imputabilit&eacute; vis &agrave; vis de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile</H3>

<P>
De m&ecirc;me que pour le Parlement, la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile ne semble pas avoir jou&eacute; jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent
de r&ocirc;le significatif dans les orientations de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise
au d&eacute;veloppement, qui ont &eacute;t&eacute; marqu&eacute;es
par une grande continuit&eacute;. Cependant, l&agrave; encore,
les &eacute;volutions r&eacute;centes pourraient montrer un changement
dans ce domaine. Depuis la fin des ann&eacute;es 1980, un certain
nombre d'associations ou d'ONG se font entendre en donnant une
opinion (fortement critique le plus souvent) sur le dispositif
et les politiques d'aide publique fran&ccedil;aise et en &eacute;mettant
parfois des propositions.
<P>
Une quarantaine de repr&eacute;sentants de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile a m&ecirc;me cr&eacute;&eacute; r&eacute;cemment un &quot;Observatoire
permanent de la coop&eacute;ration fran&ccedil;aise&quot;, dont
la fonction consiste &agrave; &eacute;mettre r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement
des avis sur l'aide fran&ccedil;aise et les relations de la France
avec les pays du Sud.
<P>
Ce mouvement de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile se retrouve sur
les grandes lignes de son analyse. Il d&eacute;nonce une aide
trop politique, trop client&eacute;liste, trop &eacute;tatiste
et qui n'atteint pas suffisamment les populations pauvres. Il
propose une aide contractuelle, &agrave; destination essentiellement
des populations les plus d&eacute;favoris&eacute;es, et passant
bien davantage par le canal des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s civiles
au Nord comme au Sud.
<P>
Il est trop t&ocirc;t pour deviner l'influence que pourront exercer
ces mouvements d'opinion dans les orientations &agrave; venir
de l'aide publique. Mais, il est certain, qu'en dehors de positions
tr&egrave;s critiques et tr&egrave;s politiques, les propositions
de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile trouvent de larges &eacute;chos
aupr&egrave;s de l'opinion publique (qui peut &ecirc;tre contre
l'attribution de l'aide aux plus d&eacute;munis ?), du Parlement
(le rapport Cazenave s'en est inspir&eacute;) et du sein m&ecirc;me
du dispositif d'aide et des autorit&eacute;s fran&ccedil;aises.
La France et l'Afrique, ouvrage r&eacute;dig&eacute; essentiellement
par des repr&eacute;sentants du syst&egrave;me d'aide et command&eacute;
par le Ministre de la Coop&eacute;ration, est lui-m&ecirc;me tr&egrave;s
fortement critique et r&eacute;formateur, dans une perspective
voisine des propositions des ONG.
<H3>3.4. Imputabilit&eacute; vis &agrave; vis de l'opinion publique
</H3>

<P>
Plus encore que ses repr&eacute;sentants, du monde politique ou
de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile, l'opinion publique fran&ccedil;aise
a naturellement &eacute;t&eacute; peu inform&eacute;e de l'action
de la France en mati&egrave;re d'aide, et n'a eu que peu d'influence
sur les orientations poursuivies. Les enqu&ecirc;tes d'opinion
r&eacute;alis&eacute;es montrent que les fran&ccedil;ais sont
g&eacute;n&eacute;ralement favorables au maintien du niveau de
l'aide et ne remettent pas en cause la priorit&eacute; africaine,
en d&eacute;pit d'un assentiment qui d&eacute;cro&icirc;t. Mais,
l'image de l'efficacit&eacute; de l'aide dans l'opinion est singuli&egrave;rement
alt&eacute;r&eacute;e. Pourtant, les fran&ccedil;ais semblent
estimer que les enjeux du d&eacute;veloppement rel&egrave;vent
avant tout des institutions publiques du Sud et du Nord, nationales
ou multilat&eacute;rales, et que l'aide priv&eacute;e ne peut
&ecirc;tre qu'un compl&eacute;ment ou la r&eacute;ponse &agrave;
une urgence.
<P>
Cela peut &ecirc;tre rapproch&eacute; de la constatation que les
fran&ccedil;ais donnet peu aux organisations de solidarit&eacute;
internationale.
<P>
Les dons annuels moyens par habitant en 1990 aux organisations
de d&eacute;veloppement ou de secours se montent &agrave; 3.3
$ en France contre 6.9 $ pour l'ensemble du CAD (cela atteint
plus de 30 $ en Norv&egrave;ge).
<P>
<H2><A NAME="AFAI">4. L'aide fran&ccedil;aise et les nouvelles priorit&eacute;s
de l'aide internationale</A></H2>
<P>
Les priorit&eacute;s de l'aide internationale se modifient en
permanence., les ann&eacute;es 1990 ont vu de nouvelles probl&eacute;matiques
d'origines relativement diff&eacute;rentes -humanitaire, d&eacute;mocratique,
environnementale- se placer au sommet des strat&eacute;gies des
agences d'aide : lutte contre la pauvret&eacute; et/ou &eacute;quit&eacute;,
capacit&eacute; institutionnelle et gouvernance, d&eacute;mocratie
et &eacute;tat de droit, d&eacute;centralisation et participation,
&eacute;mergence de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile et de l'entrepreneuriat,
&eacute;galit&eacute; des sexes et d&eacute;veloppement de l'activit&eacute;
f&eacute;minine, d&eacute;veloppement humain et secteurs sociaux,
environnement et d&eacute;veloppement durable.
<P>
En d&eacute;pit de l'engagement parfois important (et souvent
ancien) de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise dans certains de ces domaines
-capacit&eacute; institutionnelle, d&eacute;centralisation, environnement,
secteurs sociaux-, un sentiment r&eacute;pandu dans l'ensemble
du syst&egrave;me d'aide fran&ccedil;ais &agrave; l'&eacute;gard
de ces nouvelles priorit&eacute;s est une certaine prudence, voire
m&eacute;fiance. Il en r&eacute;sulte une certaine distance entre
les priorit&eacute;s de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise et celles d'une
partie de la communaut&eacute; internationale, sans doute explicable
par les caract&eacute;ristiques de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise.
<P>
En premier lieu, l'aide fran&ccedil;aise est peu sensible &agrave;
l'opinion publique, elle m&ecirc;me peu mobilis&eacute;e sur ces
questions. Or, il est certain que les rapports entre l'opinion
publique, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile et les agences d'aide
ont &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;terminants pour la mise en avant
de certains th&egrave;mes tels que l'environnement, la lutte contre
la pauvret&eacute; ou les &quot;gender issues&quot; (expression
d'ailleurs intraduisible en fran&ccedil;ais). La France n'a pas
connu une telle &eacute;volution, et ces nouvelles priorit&eacute;s
sont parfois consid&eacute;r&eacute;es comme des &quot;modes&quot;
appel&eacute;es &agrave; se transformer ou &agrave; dispara&icirc;tre
au rythme de l'apparition d'id&eacute;es nouvelles, et pouvant
nuire &agrave; la continuit&eacute; d'une action dont l'objectif
unique et global doit &ecirc;tre le d&eacute;veloppement. La position
fran&ccedil;aise peut ainsi &ecirc;tre tax&eacute;e de constance
ou de conservatisme, selon la perception des observateurs.
<P>
En second lieu, les relations particuli&egrave;res avec certains
partenaires, la vocation g&eacute;n&eacute;raliste de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise,
son organisation d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e (cf infra) donne
&agrave; l'aide fran&ccedil;aise un caract&egrave;re pragmatique,
peu compatible avec le respect d'un cadre strat&eacute;gique &eacute;troit.
L'aide fran&ccedil;aise tente de se rapprocher d'un concours direct
aux efforts entrepris par les acteurs des pays b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires.
Cela peut m&ecirc;me concerner les domaines r&eacute;galiens des
Etats -s&eacute;curit&eacute;, monnaie, etc... L'implication des
b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaires, l'inclusion dans le contexte du pays
receveur apparaissent d&eacute;terminantes. Il en r&eacute;sulte
en retour un d&eacute;ficit ind&eacute;niable de coh&eacute;rence
qui emp&ecirc;che les actions de l'aide fran&ccedil;aise de s'inscrire
dans un cadre strat&eacute;gique clair.
<P>
Cette situation pourrait devenir pr&eacute;occupante pour l'aide
fran&ccedil;aise : d'abord par ce qu'elle contribue &agrave; un
certain isolement de la France dans le contexte international,
et ensuite car l'int&eacute;r&ecirc;t croissant de l'opinion publique
et de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile ne peut s'accomoder du d&eacute;ficit
start&eacute;gique actuel.

<P>
At the end of 1994, the international donor community (governmental,
inter-governmental and NGO's) decided to make a comprehensive
evaluation of the international intervention in Rwanda before,
during and after the genocide. <I>Eurostep</I> welcomes the findings
of this Joint Evaluation of Emergency Assistance to Rwanda as
an important step towards improving the international response
to emergencies, but warns that they are meaningless unless governments
muster the political will to implement some of the key recommendations.
Especially in the light of the continuing crisis in the Great
Lakes Region, these findings need to be translated into urgent
action.
<P>
This is of particular relevance to the European Union and the
member states who failed to take sufficient preventive action
to stop or mitigate the genocide. Further, its generous humanitarian
relief effort since April '94 contrast sharply with its diplomatic
inaction, largely due to the diverse and often opposing positions
of member states and a lack of coherence in its political approach.
Through a more concerted and coherent foreign policy on the Great
Lakes, the EU could play a major role in the rehabilitation process
in Rwanda, in conflict prevention in Burundi and in promoting
regional solutions to the crisis.
<P>
<B>I. A Critical Evaluation</B>
<P>
According to the study, the international community failed to
recognise and address numerous indications of impending genocide.
By not imposing strict human rights conditionality on aid and
failing to enforce an arms embargo, the international community
reinforced a perception of disinterest  and allowed the militarisation
of the conflict. The narrow scope, inadequate support and slow
deployment of the UNAMIR mission again reinforced this perception
as well as rendered the mission ineffective.
<P>
Regional governments and the OAU were under-utilised, despite
the fact that non-regional actors had proven either incapable
or disinterested in translating early warning to mitigation. The
study criticises the absence of a coordinated effort to analyse
information and translate it into options for action. It also
criticises the inability of the UN to respond effectively to early
warning signals when a partisan interest is not involved.
<P>
With regards to the refugee problem, the study concludes that
the international community's response to the refugee crisis before
April 1994 was weak, but commends the large scale humanitarian
response that ultimately did take place after April. However,
such massive investment in humanitarian assistance would have
been unnecessary had the international community responded more
effectively prior to, or in the days immediately following the
6th of April. The Rwandan case therefore demonstrates the need
for more co-ordinated political strategies and for coherence between
humanitarian and foreign policy.
<P>
The Study further highlights that the slow disbursement of funds
for national reconstruction, the refugees' fear for reprisals
and the government perceptions of the camps as a threat have all
constrained the repatriation of refugees. In order to address
these problems, an effective judicial system must be in place,
the physical security of returnees and survivors must be ensured
and rapid economic growth in agriculture and small business sectors
must be promoted. Because of the historical and cultural context
of the situation, a regional solution to the crisis should be
sought.
<P>
<B>II. Policy Lessons for the EU</B>
<P>
The critical findings and the recommendations that emerge from
the study reports provide very relevant material for the improvement
of the international response to complex emergencies. Faced with
the continuing and deepening crisis in the Great Lakes Region
and the inadequate response by the international community at
large and its own institutions in particular, the EU should take
immediate action to translate the main findings into action.
<P>
<B>II.1. The need for policy coherence</B>
<P>
At the Humanitarian Summit in Madrid on 14 December 1995, the
EU Commissioner responsible for ECHO (the Humanitarian Office),
Emma Bonino, together with the Heads of  UN agencies and USAID
concluded that &quot;humanitarian assistance is neither a solution
nor a panacea for crisis which are essentially man-made... such
as in Rwanda&quot;, yet political inaction has meant that humanitarian
aid has indeed been a substitute for diplomacy.
<P>
The EU failure to take sufficient preventive action is all the
more astonishing given that four EU members - the UK, France,
Belgium and Germany - have been heavily involved in the Great
Lakes region of Central Africa, both historically and in the immediate
run-up to the Arusha Accords. European views also had a crucial
influence on the UN Security Council decision to reduce the size
of UNAMIR, while EU governments, alongside others, failed to commit
the financial and technical resources swiftly enough to enable
the enhanced UNAMIR II to protect tens of thousands of civilians.
<P>
Even today, questions remain about whether the humanitarian strategy
for reintegrating Hutu refugees and internally displaced persons
- in which ECHO is a major actor - is a substitute for political
actions without political solutions, there can be no durable peace
in the region.
<P>
Unless a more holistic approach towards the prevailing emergency
situation is developed, taking into account the political, military
and humanitarian aspects in an integrated manner, and a strategic
planning policy is worked out incorporating conflict prevention,
Europe's contribution to a durable solution to the crisis in the
Great Lakes Region will remain marginal. 
<P>
Central to such a pro-active approach is the capacity of political
analysis in order to focus on the structural root causes of the
conflicts, identify the trouble spots and translate analysis into
timely political action at the level of the Union. While intensified
political and development coordination with the member states
and other international and regional actors (in particular the
UN and the OAU) is a prerequisite for more efficient policy and
action.
<P>
In order to ensure a common direction and coherence in the decision-making
on its Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) on the Great
Lakes, mechanisms have to be established for swift, decisive and
transparent decisions at the Intergovernmental Conference (IGC).
At the same time however, some capacity has to be established
- presumably in the Commission or the Council of Ministers' secretariat
- to plan and monitor policy and make recommendations to the decision-making
structure.
<P>
Since the EU has recently appointed a Special Envoy for the region
to tune in its strategy with the UN and the OAU and which is aimed
at creating conditions necessary for solving the crisis, the establishment
of a planning, monitoring and back-up mechanism is urgently required.

<B>II.2. Early warning and conflict prevention</B>
<P>
The increasing warning signs from NGO's, academics, UNHCR, UNAMIR
and others about the preparation for an organised genocidal attack
were not recognised for what they were, nor were explicit warnings
from human rights organisations and from the UNHCR strategically
analysed to prepare an effective response. States, multilateral
institutions (including the EU) and regional institutions should
therefore coordinate their efforts and support the existing Integrated
Regional Information Network (IRIN) established by DHA which is
providing excellent up-to-date information and yet does not have
medium term funding. In addition however, the EU should establish
a capacity for the strategic analysis of such information to feed
into strategic planning and to ensure timely political action.
<P>
Whereas the OAU and some neighbouring states (especially Tanzania)
played a rigorous and effective role in mediating the Arusha Accords,
these were discouraged from playing a significant role in their
monitoring and implementation. This disjuncture between mediation
and implementation has had disastrous effects since international
interest diminished after the signing of the Accords and therefore
regional peace monitoring could have made a major difference to
the genocidal outcome.
<P>
At the Madrid Summit (16-17 December '95) the Heads of State re-confirmed
the conclusions adopted by the Ministers of Foreign Affairs with
regard to preventive diplomacy, the resolution of conflicts and
peace keeping in Africa which will serve as a basis for the eventual
adoption of a common position under the EU's CFSP. The Council
stated that EU action should support the action of Africans, particularly
the OAU, which must play a leading role. Therefore EU efforts
must be harmonised, including bilateral efforts of the member
states, and must be coupled with those of African countries and
other members of the international community objectives. The EU
will encourage cooperation between the UN and the OAU and reinforce
existing capacity of the OAU in the spheres of early warning,
preventive diplomacy and peace keeping, the latter in cooperation
with the WEU which may also be called upon to contribute to carrying
out EU actions. The member states and the Community also agreed
to exchange information on their bilateral aid in this domain
with a view to reinforcing coordination of their assistance.
<P>
In addition to the policy of African capacity-building, the EU
should provide international leadership, particularly through
the UN, for peace-building in the region. This will include the
coherent application of political-diplomatic, humanitarian, developmental
and human rights efforts to attack the root causes of the region's
conflicts and press for a durable regional settlement. It might
also require the use of military assets under UN direction to
protect civilians from violence.
<P>
Although in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty no explicit mandate for
conflict prevention is given, the objectives of the CFSP implicitly
provide a mandate for peacekeeping and peacemaking and a clear
mandate for peacebuilding activities. A framework thus exists
for engaging in this domain, as does practical experience built
up in recent years in the field of early warning, peacekeeping
and peacemaking (particularly in the case of Yugoslavia) and in
the field of peacebuilding (Central America and Yugoslavia).

</UL>
</td>

</table>
<P>
<B>II.3. Human Rights Policy</B>
<P>
Since conflicts in the region are rooted in a background of widespread
violations of fundamental human rights, human rights issues should
form a basic component of conflict prevention. Policies for the
promotion of human rights have a preventive character.
<P>
In the case of Rwanda there was sufficient information and reporting
on the issue during 1992 and '93, but the many data provided by
both NGO and UN channels were insufficiently analysed and were
not translated into prognoses of an ensuing genocide. Moreover,
governments failed to take action when reports were submitted.
&quot;In principle&quot;, so notes the report, &quot;most bilateral
donors made economic aid, which had become very substantial by
the early nineties (almost 50$ per capita) conditional upon observance
of human rights, but in practice virtually no donor reduced aid
with specific and exclusive reference to human rights violations.
By suspending aid in late 1993 and early 1994 with reference to
book-keeping and project feasibility rather than human rights
criteria, donors sent the message that human rights conditionality
was preached but not practised&quot;. The EU was no exception
to this. Only after the massacre at Kibeho was aid temporarily
suspended. This tended to reinforce opinion inside Rwanda that
different standards were applied to the governments before and
after the genocide.
<P>
There is though a growing understanding within the Commission
that human rights should be integrated in a preventive strategy
and cautious initiatives have been taken in this respect. By way
of example, the Community took part in sending a team of monitors
to Rwanda in order to create an element of impartiality and trust
against a backdrop of serious and persistent human rights violations.
The aim was to calm tensions and speed up the return of refugees.
Similarly, support was provided to the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda to counter impunity which acts as a breeding
ground for more violence. Such one-off initiatives should however
be paralleled by long and medium term measures that seek to create
a climate of trust and democratic security as has for example
been the case with the multi-annual programme for the promotion
of human rights in Central America. In the Great Lakes region,
particular attention should be given to the huge problem of refugees,
whereby the promotion and protection of human rights should be
closely linked to asylum and migration policies in the region.
<P>
Such measures should be paralleled by &quot;a preparedness to
implement consistently a range of measures intended to pressure
a government to halt severe violence and human rights violations&quot;
as recommended in the report. &quot;Between diplomatic representations
at one end of the range and intervention of peacekeeping forces
at the other, are such measures as the implementation of economic
and military assistance conditionality, freezing of foreign bank
accounts and application of selective embargoes. Actual measures
adopted must be tailored to the specific situation, taking into
account their likely impact on human rights and conflict in the
receiving country. Assistance conditionality may be either positive
or negative&quot;.

<B>II.4. Contingency planning and preparedness measures</B>
<P>
While the humanitarian response of official agencies and NGO's
to massive the population displacements, triggered by the Rwanda
genocide, was extra-ordinary, the study makes clear that the way
the system was resourced was sub-optimal, limiting the effectiveness
of the response and substantially increasing eventual costs. &quot;Preparedness
and contingency planning were not encouraged and investments that
would have yielded substantial savings, such as opening road routes
and increasing capacity of low-cost railway routes, were not made&quot;.
While donor organisations did provide some &quot;up-front&quot;
funding, most funding was reactive to events, often related to
media coverage and the concern by donors for &quot;profile&quot;
and &quot;visibility&quot;. A notable exception was the block
funding from ECHO for UNHCR which, according to the report, has
strengthened the effectiveness of the latter's coordinating role
with its NGO implementing  partners.
<P>
As international attention for the region fades away, the commitment
to continue spending huge amounts of money on humanitarian aid
has diminished alarmingly. This is clearly demonstrated by the
lack of response to the UNHCR appeal for emergency assistance
to the region. This threatens the provision of essential services
to the refugee camps (e.g. such as water) and therefore the option
for voluntary return, which is unacceptable and contravening international
agreements on humanitarian standards. Further assistance is also
required for host communities who will continue to feel the impact
of refugee influxes even after the refugees have left.
<P>
Although ECHO's priority has recently shifted from emergency assistance
to the camps towards programmes to facilitate voluntary repatriation
of refugees to Rwanda and their reintegration, the organisation
should apply flexible procedures to re-orientate its support for
the care and maintenance of refugees and make further pledges
towards UNHCR's appeal for 1996 commensurate with its status as
a large donor.

<B>II.5. Emergency response</B>
<P>
The humanitarian response to Rwanda involved an unprecedented
number of NGO's with very varied levels of skills, experience
and ability to guarantee basic standards of welfare for refugees
and displaced peoples. As the study states &quot;The performance
of many NGO's was highly impressive and many cooperated closely
with each other. However there are numerous examples where this
was not the case.&quot;
<P>
<I>Eurostep</I> fully supports the recommendations of the study
that donor governments should restrict their funding to agencies
which have adopted the Code of Conduct and minimum standards developed
by the ICRC/IFRC and NGO's. This will create both accountability
and transparency in the professional performance of NGO's in meeting
the humanitarian needs of victims of future conflicts.
<P>
Another important conclusion from the study of 'Humanitarian Aid
and Effects' is that &quot;the use of military assets in the provision
of relief assistance and in support of relief agencies may be
questioned from several standpoints such as their predictability,
effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and ability to participate collaboratively
in operations generally involving several UN agencies and numerous
NGO's&quot;. <I>Eurostep</I>'s experience is that the military
are often expensive and unreliable as vehicles for humanitarian
response.
<P>
The military culture is also strongly mismatched with civilian
structures, particularly when dealing with a great number of traumatised
and impoverished refugees and displaced people.

<B>II.6. Supporting the rebuilding of society in Rwanda</B>
<P>
The enormous resources needed to provide basic services for up
to two million refugees from Rwanda, has not been matched with
adequate funding for social and economic recovery inside Rwanda.
The gross imbalance which exists fits ill with the scale and urgency
of need inside Rwanda following genocide. The study concludes
that, in order to deal with the most crucial problems, an effective
judicial system based on the rule of law must be put in place,
the physical security of returnees and survivors of the genocide
must be ensured and rapid economic development in agriculture
and small business sectors must be promoted. Given the role of
international finance institutions such as the IMF and the World
Bank in the reconstruction of Rwanda, EU members should act in
 unison at the IMF and the WB.
<P>
<B>Recommendations</B>

<P>
<table border=2>
<tr>
<td>
<I>Eurostep</I> urges the EU and member states to review its policy
on Rwanda along these lines.<P>
In particular the EU and member states should:

assistance to and cooperation with the International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda;
<P>
<LI>help to remove barriers to repatriation, both in the camps as
well as inside the country, in accordance with the recommendations
made in the report (see annex);

<LI>to propose to the IMF and World Bank to place a moratorium on
debt repayments during the peace-building and reconstruction phases

<B>II.7. Immediate and urgent measures in Burundi</B>
<P>
The deteriorating situation in Burundi remains a cause of grave
concern, not only because the internal insecurity and civil war
continues to claim numerous innocent victims, but also because
a further escalation and explosion would destabilise the whole
region even more.
<P>
<B>Recommendations</B>
<P>
<table border=2>
<tr>
<td>
<I>Eurostep</I> therefore urges the EU and member states to give
immediate attention to the following evaluation recommendations
for Burundi:<P>
<UL>
<LI>provide support to further strengthen OAU mediation and peacekeeping
functions (MIOB);
<P>
<LI>support measures to protect the physical security of refugees,
displaced persons and relief workers who are attempting to provide
humanitarian assistance;
<P>
<LI>provide adequate support for the deployment of effective human
rights machinery in the field, with adequate standing procedures
for vigilance over threatened genocide and for prompt investigative action;
<P>
<LI>expand assistance to Burundi for the restoration of an effective
system of justice in order to break the vicious cycle of impunity
(including support for assistance of magistrates from other African
countries as suggested by the Special Rapporteur for Human Rights
in Burundi) and to the International Commission of Inquiry into
the murder of President Ndadaye and the massacres that followed;
<P>
<LI>Identify and be prepared to implement consistently a range of
measures intended to put pressure on those who are inciting and
perpetrating escalating civil violence;
</UL>
</td>
</table><P>
<B>II.8. Formulate a supportable and sustainable development strategy
for the Region</B>
<P>
The fortunes of the Great Lakes Countries are critically interlocked,
both politically and economically. In such a region, the devastating
repercussions of genocide and conflict reach beyond national boundaries.
The region's two million refugees vividly illustrate how national
events have profound regional implications. A sustainable, long
term solution to the cycles of civil and ethnic violence must
involve the people and be a regional one. The countries of the
Great Lakes Region must take the lead in developing this solution.
But strong support from bilateral and multilateral development
agencies and international NGO's is also essential.
<P>
A process of continuing dialogue between regional leaders and
organisations, under the auspices of the OAU, supported by the
UN and the EU, should be envisaged, working to establish structures
to foster regional peace, stability and in the long term, development.
Such a process should be built on existing international and bilateral
initiatives and agreements, such as the Bujumbura, Cairo and Tunis
Conferences. Ensuring adequate follow-up to these is imperative.
Dialogue with civil society will require the strengthening of
grassroots institutions. Without this, government commitments
will lack credibility and substance.
<P>
Such an ambitious process will not be swift. Over the next few
years, the regional governments will need to agree an innovative
programme of meetings and discussions, task forces and working
groups on a range of different issues, complemented at the local,
national and regional levels. There is an important role for international
mediators, observers and resource persons from the OAU, UN and
EU, governments and NGO's. The international community, amongst
which the EU, can help to keep such a process going using the
leverage of moral and diplomatic support for political negotiations
and the channelling of rehabilitation and development assistance
to this impoverished region.
<P>
<B>Recommendations</B>

<P>
<table border=2>
<tr>
<td>
<I>Eurostep</I> urges the EU and member states<P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>to provide full support to the implementation of, among other,
the recommendations of the Bujumbura, Cairo and Tunis Conferences;
<P>
<LI>to actively engage in a regional mediation process and to promote
the participation of the population of the region in discussing
needs, priorities, alternative solutions and resources for a durable
development strategy in the region;
<P>
<LI>to establish, in concert with the OAU, the UN and their member
states, mechanisms to marshall and channel donor support;
<P>
<LI>to provide technical support for efforts towards regional integration,
both economic and political;
</UL>
</td>

<P>

<B>II.9. A European voice in the UN</B>
<P>
Whereas there is a definite need for an increased role of the
EU in the Great Lakes, such as the support to the OAU's growing
activities in conflict prevention, the UN should remain the single
most significant body to help prevent conflict and enhance respect
for basic rights. Given recent disappointments about its performance,
not the least in Rwanda, and the current financial crisis of the
Organisation, it will be in no small part up to the EU and its
members to determine whether the UN can increase its effectiveness
to address the regional crisis.
<P>
EU member states have already been influential in several areas
of policy to improve the UN's performance in response to conflict,
but the EU should increasingly use the UN as one vital means to
realise the humanitarian and human rights aims set out above.
This requires however that a common EU voice is more consistantly
developed and represented at the Security Council and in other
UN fora.
<P>
Given the colonial history of the region, a common EU voice on
the region should not come to mean acquiescence to the lowest
common denominator, or the forces of inaction.
<P>
<B>Recommendations</B>

<P>
<table border=2>

<I>Eurostep</I> urges the EU and member states<P>

by the member states at the Security Council and in other UN fora;

UN initiatives aimed at peace, stability and longer term development
in the region;
</UL>

<P>
<B>III. A Structural Stability Pact</B>
<P>
Foreign policy towards conflict in non-strategic areas such as
the Great Lakes tends to be very much characterised by 'containment'
to avoid a wider war and humanitarian aid. A CFSP for the region
aimed at upholding basic rights, specific commitments to conflict
prevention and resolution and coherence with development cooperation
principles therefore poses an enormous challenge.
<P>
As in the case of the EU's Stability Pact with Eastern European
Countries which has been widely welcomed as a useful initiative
where regional cooperation has been fostered by negotiation and
financial incentives, it is not inconceivable that the EU could
collaborate with the OAU to support a similar process in the Great
Lakes Region where conflict prevention through regional negotiation
and economic assistance for reactivation could play a key role
in guaranteeing structural stability, i.e. the achievement of
a situation involving sustainable economic development, democracy
and respect for human rights, viable political structures, healthy
social and environmental conditions, with the capacity to manage
change without resort to violent conflict.
<H1>Annex</H1>

<H2>Recommendation : Remove Barriers to Repatriation</H2>

<P>
Implementation of Recommendation C-1 on &#171; Refugee Camp Security
&#187; will remove the source of intimidation and repression that
has acted as one important barrier to voluntary repatriation.
<P>
The following measures would both alleviate the concerns of refugees
and improve conditions for people inside the country. The government
of Rwanda must play a very active part in these efforts :
<MENU>
<LI>(i)  Support the government's current efforts to establish
and promulgate degrees of guilt and punishment for participation
in the genocide and other killings, as well as efforts to strengthen
the judicial system in other ways (see Recommendation D-1 &#171;
Expand support for Justice System and Law Enforcement &#187;).
<LI>(ii)  Insist on compliance with the rule of law and observance
of fundamental human rights principles, and monitor closely abuses
by the government.
<LI>(iii) Provide expanded support for strengthening local capacities
to provide basic governmental and related services, such as education,
health and agricultural research and extension, and for income
generating activities (e.g. micro-enterprise, rural works programmes,
etc.).
<LI>(iv) Provide further support, as appropriate, to the government
to develop and implement land tenure and property rights legislation,
especially the right of women to inherit and own land ; and to
develop clear  procedures and identify institutions for dispute
settlement.
<LI>(v)  Provide support for experts under the auspices of the
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights to work with authorities
and local NGO's to design and implement human rights training
and education programmes, in accordance with OAU, UN and Red Cross
Conventions.
<LI>(vi) Facilitate establishment by the government of broadly-based
&#171; peace communities &#187; in communes to monitor security
of returnees ; screening of returnees should be performed in close
proximity to home communes, so as to give them confidence in the
process.

What have Shakespeare, Ice T and Metallica got in common?  Dodgy haircuts? Weird clothes? Erm, yes...but they're all poets too. <p>

Have you ever listened to rap carefully?  It's complicated, emotional, clever, witty.  It's <i>poetry</i>.  And that goes for all other types of music too - it's all poetry in its many disguises.<p>

Poetry's got a rhythm, a soul, a beat, it's inside all of us and around us every day.  It can be shy or in-your-face.  LOUD or quiet.  Soft or ANGRY! You can shout it from the roof tops or keep it inside.  It can take the form of words on a page or sounds from your mouth.  It doesn't need a passport, it doesn't need a degree, it's democratic - it's for everyone.<p>

You see I think we get told what to like far too often. Lots of people are turned off poetry from their experiences in school. Instead of just enjoying the poetry they are told to take it apart, examine it and explain it.  We are told that we should like Blake, Robert Browning or Frost because they are the so called greats, but they're just one type of poetry.  When it comes down to it we all know what we like or dislike.  I happen to like Byron, Shelley and another poet called Mervyn Peake but I don't like them because some teacher or poetry expert told me to.  Find your own style and go with it.  That's what's so great about poetry. <p>
  
I can't remember when I started making up poems but I always liked playing with words. I'd be making up poems, taking words, mixing words, playing word games and before I knew what the word poetry meant I was doing it.<p>

For me it's more than words - it's how I express myself, how I communicate with others.  It's been there for me in the best and worst of times.  If anything helped me through being bullied it was probably poetry - because it was somewhere to put my mind.  It's a friend that has always been with me and I never feel alone.

<pre>


</pre>



By the way, what do you think of Blast?  Seems to me that this is our space to let rip.  To launch these new pages OneWorld have teamed up with Penguin Books (great guys - they even publish some of my poems) and organised a <b><a href="../../blast/competition.html">poetry competition</a></b> with some really great prizes! It's on the theme of 'one world' (like the global  village, or the way everyone's the same underneath even though they may look different on the outside ) and it's open to everyone, absolutely anywhere.<p>

This poetry competition is really just a way to get you guys writing and communicating.  As far as I'm concerned everyone's poems are important and they're all winners, we'll simply pick a few that appeal to us (the judges) and in time we hope to publish all or most of them in Blast.  So take it from me, someone who doesn't like poetry competitions, this is about taking part - let me put it this way, I've never won a poetry competition in my life and I'm still here!<p>

And another thing!  Many people think they're not poets because they can't rhyme, but it's not about that.  A lot of poetry doesn't rhyme at all.  Take a look at <b><a href="poems/luke_bully.html">Luke Welch's</a></b> poem about being bullied.<p>

So! Think there may be a poem itching to get out of you?  Get writing - or tape it and send it to us - some poetry just won't go in a book! You know where to send it, <A HREF="mailto:justice@oneworld.org"> justice@oneworld.org</a>, just don't forget to put "BZ" or "poems" on the subject line so that it gets to me.  And don't be shy either - I get sent poems all the time and I <b>love</b> receiving them.






<td valign=top width=120>
<a name="comp">

<font size=2>It's just occurred to me that you haven't heard any of my poems - and you need to <a href="http://www.oneworld.org/zephaniah/poems.html"><strong>hear</strong></a> them, they're not happy in a book. We've put up loads of shockwave and realaudio versions. No waiting!<p>

There's instructions on how to use Shockwave and RealAudio (and if you can't use them - don't worry).<p>

I first started writing poems when I was a kid and since I've published some children's poetry books I've been sent some really good poems. Here's some of my favourites:<p>

<h2>MAKE MUSIC FOR UNICEF IN 1996 AND TURN NOTES INTO POUNDS</h2>

<br clear=all>



<br clear=all>

<br>

1996 is the 50th anniversary of <b>UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, </b>the world's largest organisation working for children. An exciting  new initiative, <b>Music for UNICEF </b>is running throughout 1996 to celebrate 50 years of progress for children.  Funds raised will help UNICEF reach specific goals in health, nutrition and education which would meet the basic needs of every child by the year 2000.

<p>

<b>How you can join in</b><br>

Music is enjoyed throughout the world so what better way to raise money to help the children of the world.  Joining in <b>Music for UNICEF </b>could not be simpler.  You can organise a special concert or performance to benefit UNICEF or you can add onto the price of each ticket for an existing musical event and donate the extra amount to UNICEF.  From opera to pop, classical to country, Beethoven to Blur, professional or amateur, you can strum, sing, or even karaoke.  Stage a concert at school or work, in clubs or church or even in the bath if a sponsored solo sing-along is your idea of fun.  You can take part at any time of the year or hold more than one event during 1996.  Get your free <a href="mailto:info@unicef.demon.co.uk">Music for UNICEF pack</a> to find out more.

<p>

<p>

<b>How your music will make a difference</b><br>

UNICEF works in over 140 countries around the world working with governments and local people to put children first.  As many as 13 million children die every year from easily preventable causes; many more are malnourished.  The year 2000 goals agreed by leaders at the 1990 World Summit for Children seek to reduce deaths of under fives by at least a third and halve the number of malnourished children.  UNICEF is working to achieve these goals in addition to goals for children's education, literacy, clean water and protection in wars. Simple, cost-effective programmes can help make a difference.  For example &pound;9 could immunise one child against the six leading child-killing and maiming diseases.

<p>

Help UNICEF mark its 50th anniversary and make music for children's futures.

<H3>LETTER FROM JERUSALEM</H3>
<H2>The kitsch of death and peace</H2>
	<BR>
<I>A MONTH after Yitzhak Rabin's assassination on 4 November - and daily
life in Israel is only slowly emerging from living in a CNN news item. For
a long time, every hysterical clich&eacute; seemed to come closer to this
simulation; now the older realities are asserting themselves.<BR>
</I><HR><BR>
	Every day still brings new dramas. More revelations about the tangled web
of right-wing religious organisations in which the assassin was immersed.
More details about the bunglings of the Security Services. More self-flagellation
- some genuine, more sickeningly bogus - from 'moderate' religious and right-wing
figures about where they had gone wrong. And now a meta-debate about their
being enough, or else too much, self-flagellation.<BR>
<BR>
	Images of the initial death kitsch still remain: the memorial candles,
wreaths, songs and poems; the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims flowing
to the three shrines of the grave, Tel-Aviv square where the shooting took
place and the Rabin family's Tel-Aviv apartment; delegations of school children
reciting their poems and showing their paintings of crying doves; teenagers
in Army uniform huddled sobbing in the streets; the endless sanctifying
tributes in the media; the iconography of Lea Rabin as Jackie Kennedy-Evita
Peron.<BR>
<BR>
	With tears in their eyes, people appeared on the TV screen to ask 'what's
become of us?' they said that they were now living in a different country;
nothing would ever be the same. They claimed to feel that they had lost
their father (psychoanalytic allusions to the primal horde became banal).
They expressed guilt: 'We should have supported him when he was alive.'
They anguished about 'Jew killing Jew,' brother being set against brother
(there are no sisters in the public discourse) and the need for national
re-unification, cleansing and soul searching.<BR>
<BR>
	'Spontaneous outpourings of grief.' If ever the journalistic clich&eacute;
applies, then this was it. Not even the most cynical outside observer could
compare these scenes to the mourning for Stalin, Mao or Kim Il Sung. Nothing
was orchestrated or enforced. Indeed, if one meaning of the term 'kitsch'
is that fake sentiments are packaged and demonstrated as if they were real,
then there was nothing kitsch about any of this. There was genuine grief;
people seemed wholly identified with the public spectacle. On Clinton's
lips, the slogan 'Shalom, chaver' (goodbye/peace, friend) - scripted for
his initial press conference and repeated at the graveside - was pure Disney
land. Its instant adoption in Israel however - first in improvised scribbles,
now as mass-produced bumper stickers and T-shirts - expressed a real sense
of loss.<BR>
<BR>
	Unlike the Kennedy assassination, there was no obscurity about the assassin's
aims. Nor was American society in 1963 so obviously divided as Israel today.
Everybody understands the meaning of Rabin's killing - and still does, despite
the current murky theories about moles, agents provocateurs and fake organisations.
This must be one of the purest cases of political assassination in history.
Yigal Amir could not be dismissed as a lone autistic who wanted a moment
of fame. He acted rationally and with organisational subcultural support.
He served in an elite combat unit and was a good final-year law student
(albeit at Bar-Ilan, the oxymoronic 'religious university'). Far from being
on the margins, Amir came from the epicentre of that large segment of a
generation of Israeli youth educated within the confines of fundamentalist
Jewish nationalism.<BR>
<BR>
	Amir and his associates (six more, including his brother have now been
charged with various degrees of collusion) needed no occult indoctrination
in the closed worlds of army yeshivas, or terrorist cells to pick up their
justifications. Every strand in the belief system - deification of the land,
racism, contempt for democracy, the will of God as transcending secular
law - was quite open in the wider political culture. The graffiti ('Rabin
the Traitor') were on the walls; car stickers read 'Rabin and Peres First'
(alluding to 'Gaza and Jericho first'); placards at demonstrations showed
Rabin in SS uniform; the rabbis openly preached and issued their public
fatwas; the ideology was casually recycled on TV. (Instead of Ophra Winfrey
confessions about incest and sexual abuse, popular Israeli TV talk-shows
will host a settler who nonchalantly says that if his own son were among
soldiers sent to evacuate a settlement, he would open fire at him as well.)<BR>
<BR>
	There was, however, one crucial way in which Amir and his friends appeared
to mis-cue their reading of Israeli society. His most chilling reported
words (so far, at least) were: 'Before this, I thought everyone was on my
side.' Living within their self-referential, ideological universe, they
could not have anticipated that the assassination would open up such a sentimental
wave for 'peace' or would allow Rabin - an unlikely such figure in his lifetime
- to be reincarnated as a populist martyr for peace.<BR>
<BR>
	However rationally the event's origins can be explained, it took on mythic
proportions beyond the rational. Every textual allusion to the Bible, Greek
tragedy or Shakespeare was made. The man of war receives the Nobel peace
prize; swords turn into ploughshares. The icons of John Kennedy, Abraham
Lincoln and even Martin Luther King were evoked. Not to mention Moses who
lead his people to the edge of the promised land but did not live long enough
to see the valley beyond. And Isaac (Yitzhak) who is sacrificed on the altar
of peace. Eitan Haber, Rabin's political aide, ended his eulogy at the grave
by reading from the bloodstained paper on which the words of the 'Song of
Peace' were written. As he left the mass peace rally, Rabin had folded this
page and placed it in his pocket, just near the bullet wounds. Not even
Hollywood would have dared to script this.<BR>
<BR>
	But it happened and no amount of ironical textual deconstruction will remove
these events nor erase the sentiments they evoked. Still, we have to take
a deep breath and remind ourselves of three other realities that have not
appeared on CNN.<BR>
<BR>
	The first is that this frenzied reinforcement of primal tribal unity is
a little suspect. The profound divisions within the historical consensus
remain. This is not just a matter of being for or against the Oslo agreements,
nor even religious versus secular. At stake is the contradiction between
ethnic nationalism and democracy. The right has now recovered its poise.
The new found zeal of the police and Attorney-General's office to prosecute
the slightest hints of 'incitement' (a silly over-reaction to their blatant
tolerance of right-wing and settler violence for years) has given the right
the rallying call of 'witchhunt'. They are now projecting themselves as
the victims of secular liberal intolerance.<BR>
<BR>
	And even the defenders of light against the forces of darkness have shown
their unacknowledged ethnic exclusivity. For them too, 'Jew killing Jew',
was the ultimate taboo. But suddenly, the values of tolerance, the rule
of law and democracy became proclaimed as if they always had been the core
identifying features of Israeli society, the moral centre from which this
act was a horrible aberration. This is a remarkable epic of instant historical
revisionism which allows the Labour Party to disavow all responsibility
for its entire past record of violence and injustice. Life before Oslo goes
down the black hole of memory. So too does the capitulation on human rights
issues by Meretz (the liberal doves) during its three years in the coalition.<BR>
<BR>
	The second missing reality is another piece of historical revisionism.
The dominant Clinton-rhetoric avoids the consistencies in Rabin's biography
that are as impressive as any putative ideological conversion he is supposed
to have undergone in the last three years. Far from being the 'traitor'
of the right's denunciation, he remained faithful to Labour Party Zionism.
In 1948, he carried out Ben Gurion's tacit orders to forcibly expel the
Arab population of Lod and Ramle. Forty-five years later, during the 1992
election campaign, the same Rabin would respond to right-wing hecklers demanding
'transfer' (the Israeli version of ethnic-cleansing) : 'Don't talk to me
about transfer, no-one in this hall has transferred more Arabs than I have.'
This was the same Rabin who 'advised' Sharon during the siege of Beirut;
who gave orders during the Intifadeh to break Palestinians' legs and arms;
who sanctioned the army's undercover death squads; who up to the end, showed
utter contempt for the language of human rights.<BR>
<BR>
	We all understand that in terms of pure political power - external consequences
rather than inner conversions - none of this might matter at all. The conventional
wisdom is correct: precisely because of who he was and what he stood for,
only Rabin had the authority to break so irrevocably from the deadly, wasted
decade of Likud governments. He might not exactly have been a de Klerk or
de Gaulle, but looking back - rather than how he looked at the time - these
historical comparisons will be earned. Whether Shimon Peres can capitalise
on the 'give peace a chance' sentiment is unclear. His task, though, would
be easier if Rabin had only shown some of the spirit of reconciliation that
Clinton-kitsch attributes to him.<BR>
<BR>
	This leads to the third and far most important political reality absent
from the month of mourning. The simple fact is that the Oslo agreement -
and even more, its grudging implementation in Stage One and Two - is manifestly
unjust to the Palestinians. They had to accept a very poor deal, an arrangement
which redeploys the Occupation by placing them in administrative control
over only 30 per cent of the West Bank, without territorial integrity or
national sovereignty. On every major issue - land, water, settlements, Jerusalem,
refugee rights - Palestinian aspirations have either been blocked or put
into limbo. Above all, there is the shameless continuation of land expropriation
and settlement construction. Meanwhile Arafat's authoritarian regime tightens
its grip - intolerance of criticism, torture, censorship, a network of security
forces and informers, corruption, a special court system more unjust than
Israeli military courts.<BR>
<BR>
	The Israeli sense that nothing will be the same again is true. Yet it is
also an expression of the profound narcissism of Israeli political culture.
Outside, everything is the same as it was before the assassination: the
road blocks; the crazy map of Areas A, B and C (designating degrees of Palestinian
autonomy); the unrepentant hard core of the settlers; Hamas and Islamic
Jihad terrorism; and the democratic Palestinian opposition.<BR>
<BR>
	The Israeli political leadership faces the same decisions as before the
assassination. The choice is not between reversing or continuing Rabin's
direction; his achievement was that it is too late to go back. The choice
is whether to convert the easy kitsch of peace into the hard concessions
of justice. Anything less would be a cynical manipulation of the genuine
and moving populist sentiments which the first wave of mourning revealed.
These emotions remain: polls now show that nearly 75 per cent of the population
favour continuing negotiations with the Palestinians.<BR>
<BR>
	The willingness of the majority of the public to make some compromises
is real, but volatile. As the Israeli leftist journal, The Other Front,
rightly argued: 'The rise and fall of professed support for compromise is
largely a function of the government determination, or lack of it, to press
forward.' The zeal in creating fake internal reconciliation would be better
spent in confronting the radical - and therefore divisive - concessions
needed for reconciliation with the Palestinians. This, after all, is what
the whole conflict is about.<BR>

If a subscriber tried to use the word, an automatic message wouldcome back telling them their material was 'vulgar'. AOL quickly realisedthey had made a big mistake and reversed the policy. But the case pointedout the essential silliness of much of the debate about who should be policingthe information superhighway and how.<BR><BR>	In the USA, the 'online smut' debate now has less to do with genuine concernfor children innocently logging on to bulletin boards run by paederastsor zoophiles (see p80). Instead it is displaying the tone of moral panicassociated with a sure-fire vote-winner. Congressional discussions on howto deal with some of the Internet's more egregious outgrowths have beenlumbering on month after month and, with elections approaching, it is increasinglydifficult for any decent-minded representative of the people to be seento be on the side of the pornographers. Hence the decision of the House-Senateconference committee in December - after months of lobbying by free speechadvocates, and despite serious doubts about its legality - to return toan earlier, far more restrictive version of the Communications Decency Bill.The latest version, which is now likely to be passed into law, will handdown prison sentences and fines to anyone who transmits indecent materialwithout first making sure that it is not accessible by minors.<BR>	<BR>	The USA is not the only country exercised by the problem of taming thisanarchic domain. In Australia, the Victoria state parliament introduceda remarkably stringent set of regulations in November relating to the transmissionof child pornography and what it termed 'vile sadistic' material. And inChina, where Internet access has grown exponentially (from 400 hosts inMarch 1995 to 12,000 by the end of the year) the State Information Centrehas let it be known that as yet it has no workable ideas on how to controlthe Internet.<BR><BR>	In a toughly worded editorial in December, however, the Communist Partypaper Renmin Ribao said it will not countenance the physical and spiritualwell-being of the country's youth being undermined by the spread of 'pornographicpoison'. Undoubtedly there are a number of legislators in the USA who wouldhappily concur with that formulation of the problem.<BR><BR>	In Indonesia the problem is more explicitly political. Information ministerHarmoko has declared, with commendable frankness, that his dislike of theInternet has less to do with pornography than the threat of spreading politicaldissent. It is ironic, then, that Goenawan Mohamad, who has now won twocourt cases against Harmoko in an attempt to get his magazine Tempo unbanned(Index 4&amp;5/1994, 3/1995), has announced his intention of becoming thefirst dissident to seek asylum in cyberspace. He plans to launch a newsservice on the Internet for Asian journalists who want to avoid censorshipat home.<BR><BR>	Back in China, meanwhile, the Internet's political nuances have certainlynot gone unnoticed. The Chinese government is reported to want to changeTaiwan's Internet domain name from '.tw' to '.tw.cn', thereby achievingthe virtual annexation of its recalcitrant former province. That has tobe one of the subtlest forms ever devised of pursuing a territorial claim.<BR>	<BR><B>Adam Newey is news editor at Index<BR></B><HR>	<a href="../current.html"><img border=1 align=left hspace=10 src="../index_pix/current.gif"></a><H6>Click here to return to other articles<br> from the current issue, Index1/96</H6><BR></BODY></HTML>

The Internet, presented as the democratic vehicle for the free exchange of (primarily academic) information, epitomises the technological achievement of civilised man: the proliferation of pornography in this medium, then, represents a failure of society's sublimating mechanisms to keep the primitive at bay. Is it surprising that its presence should provoke such a hyperbolic response? Cyber-porn has all the subversive impact of an unruly id breaking through the superstructures of the ego, and is as difficult to contain. The paedophile fantasies of one ill-socialised individual, code-name 'Blackwind', in Simon Winchester's 'An electronic sink of depravity', (Spectator, 4 February 1995), come to represent 'an almost exclusively American contagion', symptomatic of 'the barbarisms of the modern mind': without fixed origin, the discourse takes on the character of a collective utterance, emanating from an electronic analogue of the subconscious mind.	<p>The threat posed by cyber-porn seems to lie as much in the medium as in the material itself. It is important to stress that in the case of alt.sex stories, no indecent act has been committed, no obscene photographs are proffered, and the pornographers are not interested in exploiting the money-making potential of cyber-sex: the pedaristic activities depicted have no corollary in the 'real' world. Pornographic fantasies of this sort have always existed: the Internet, however, makes them readily available to anyone with a modem and a mouse, regardless of age or cultural background. Those in favour of regulation argue the need to protect. Yet instead of pressing for realistic constraints - a more selective system of access to the dingier corners of cyberspace, for example (an electronic top-shelf, as it were) - the majority of the anti-cyber-sleaze crusaders advocate an impracticable censorship. It is the presence of pornography on the Net that is threatening regardless of who does or does not read it.	<p>With alt.sex posited as the manifestation of depraved humanity, is censorship still an option? Is it even desirable to do so? The very existence of cyber-porn testifies to the futility of trying to keep technology distinct from human nature. The one reflects the other: in the same way that the dream of technological progress originates in the urge to transcend the 'barbarous' psyche, so extremes of sex and violence can be explored on the Internet precisely because, in this sublimated medium, sex and violence exist only as concepts - the physical is an impossibility. No longer a linear superhighway, the Net is developing into a complex entity that simultaneously abstracts and reflects the structure of human consciousness: surely, in this electronic hall of mirrors, there is a place for fantasy. 	<p><B>Kirsty Gordon is a freelance writer</B><HR><a href="../current.html"><img border=1 align=left hspace=10 src="../index_pix/current.gif"></a><H6>Click here to return to other articles<br> from the current issue, Index1/96</H6><BR></BODY></HTML>

Educational systems in its modern nation-statesseldom relate surviving indigenous peoples to their deeper past, and history,like literature, law and philosophy, is most often said to have begun withColumbus. In 1927, the poet C&eacute;sar Vallejo noted how western imperialismhad robbed China of all but its land and people and wondered whether eventhose minima would survive in his native Peru.<BR><BR>	Despite much triumphalism, the 1992 quincentenary had the advantage ofre-focusing attention on these issues, not least among America's nativepeoples themselves. In July 1990, representatives of over a hundred nationsgathered in Quito (Ecuador) at a continental conference called by the IndigenousAlliance of the Americas, to review the experience of the last five centuries.Agreement was reached on eight points, in a declaration that begins: '[We]have never abandoned our struggle against the oppression, discriminationand exploitation imposed on us as a result of Europe invading our ancestralterritories.' Going deeper than political alliance, their unanimity drewon notions not only of native dispossession, but of human survival. Unlikethe international capitalism that to date has been responsible for suchabuse, Articles Three and Six of the Quito Declaration refer to the communallyheld faith in the earth matrix and to the life-philosophy that explicitlydefends natural resources. Note was also taken of how in American 'ThirdWorld' states, 'national juridical structures...are the result of...neocolonisation'(Article Eight).<BR><BR>	This resurgence has its literary as well as its political edge. Affirminghis identity as an Acoma, Simon Ortiz put it like this: 'At times, in thepast, it was outright armed struggle, like that of the present-day indiansin Central and South America with whom we must identify; urgently, it isoften in the legal arena, and it is in the field of literature.' This coincideswith the Brazilian M&aacute;rcio Souza's view of literary engagement as'counter massacre': here, native language and history themselves serve asa resource in the struggle against the physical and intellectual violenceof neo-colonialism.<BR><BR>	Chile has recently witnessed a Mapuche literary renaissance led by SebastianQueupul, Martin Alonqueo, Elicura Chihuailaf, Victorio Pranao (and otherswho have appeared in the 'K&uuml;me dungu' series of texts published incollaboration with the University of Temuco), and, above all, by LeonelLienlaf, whose collection Nepey &ntilde;i g&uuml;nun piuke (The bird ofmy heart awoke) appeared in 1989. <BR><BR>	For Lienlaf the mountain that saved people from the flood, Threng-threng,still serves as a promise of refuge when seen from a boat out at sea '&Uuml;lpu challwafe' (Song in a boat); and in Temuco, south of Santiago and atthe heart of Mapuche territory, another mountain, &Ntilde;ielol, remembersthe quite recent times when none of the houses there was western:<BR>	<BR><table border=0><tr><td>Kautinleuf&uuml;</td><td>The river Cautin</td></tr><tr><td>ranginmew m&uuml;ley</td><td>through the middle</td></tr><tr><td>ng&uuml;manmew nagk&uuml;ley</td><td>runs crying</td></tr><tr><td>Temukowariap&uuml;le</td><td>through Temuco</td></tr><tr><td>ng&uuml;manmekey	</td><td>crying</td></tr><tr><td>&Ntilde;ielolwinkul</td><td>&Ntilde;ielol mountain</td></tr><tr><td>an&uuml;ley lelitupelu</td><td>sits watching</td></tr><tr><td>f&uuml;chakeruka</td><td>large houses</td></tr><tr><td>mapuchenoruka</td><td>non-Mapuche houses</td></tr><tr><td>rakiduamk&uuml;ley	</td><td>it thinks</td></tr><tr><td>Temuko-waria</td><td>Temuco town</td></tr><tr><td>mi i&ntilde;chemew</td><td>beneath you</td></tr><tr><td>umagtumekey</td><td>are sleeping</td></tr><tr><td>&ntilde;if&uuml;chake cheyem</td><td>my ancestors</td></tr><tr><td>Pewmanmew</td><td>Dreaming their dream</td></tr><tr><td>M&uuml;ley yeng&uuml;n</td><td>they are</td></tr>	<tr><td>ka witrumekey</td><td>in the river</td></tr><tr><td>leuf&uuml;mew	</td><td>runs</td></tr><tr><td>&ntilde;i mollf&uuml;n	</td><td>their blood</td></tr></table>	<BR>	Yet in 'Chol kin munguey' (They tore the skin off his back), the woundsinflicted by the savage invasions of the late-nineteenth century, on bothsides of the Andes, threaten even the idea of native coherence. <BR><BR>	In a further poem 'Rupamum' (Footsteps), the Spanish vocabulary that denotesthe means of oppression (cross, sword) is made to intrude painfully intothe Mapuche text, in images of considerable violence:<BR>	<BR><table border=0><tr><td>mutrungreke trekan</td><td>Through the tree-trunk</td></tr><tr><td>chew &ntilde;i rupamum f&uuml;chake antikuyem</td><td>I walked ahundred 																	generations</td></tr><tr><td>ng&uuml;manmew ayenmew</td><td>suffering laughing </td></tr><tr><td>dakinmew &ntilde;i pewma</td><td>within my soul</td></tr><tr><td>ina pen kine cruz katr&uuml;nmaetew</td><td>then I saw a cross 																severing</td></tr><tr><td>&ntilde;i lonko</td><td>my head</td></tr><tr><td>ka ki&ntilde;e espada bendecipeetew</td><td>a sword blessing me</td></tr><tr><td>petu &ntilde;i lanon</td><td>before my death</td></tr></table>	<BR>	Facing invasion today in Peru, in a civil war brought on by centuries ofracist outrage against them, the Quechua draw on a rich precedent, as poets,musicians and members of theatre groups like Yuyachkani. A preferred poeticform has been the wayno, whose roots go back to the Inca court. The politicalleader Lio Quintanilla chose the wayno to celebrate the taking back of stolenpeasant lands in Andahuaylas in 1972; urging resistance in his hometownHuamanga (Ayacucho) in another piece in the same form, Eusebio Huamani decriesthe sinchi police, whose mottled green uniforms identify them as arrogantparrots that infest home and fields. A wayno of quite devastating poweris 'Viva la patria' by Carlos Falconi, which like Lienlaf's 'Rupamum' usesthe technique of incorporating Spanish words, this time into Quechua, inorder to deconstruct and ultimately revile them, to the extent that the'patria' in question is exposed as vicious hypocrisy, an imposition bothincoherent and insulting on all those who are not Latin or white:<BR>	<BR><table border=0><tr><td>Takichum takisqay wiqichum wiqillay</td><td>Whenthe eyes of 																	children</td></tr><tr><td>warmachakunapa &ntilde;awichallampi</td><td>fill with hate</td></tr>	Chiqnikuy huntaptin				can my song still 																	be sung?</td></tr><tr><td>Takichum takisqay wiqichum	</td><td>Can my lament 																still be</td></tr> <tr><td>y wiqilla</td><td>a lament?</td></tr>	<tr><td>Vinchus viudalla asirillanmanchu</td><td>The widow from 									Vinchos, will she 																	laugh?</td></tr><tr><td>Cangallu viuda kusirikunmanchu</td><td>The widow from 																Cangallo,									will she be happy?</td></tr><tr><td>allqupa churinta unanchallanmanchu</td><td>The son of a dog, will																she love as her own?</td></tr><tr><td>pimanraq kutinqa sapan paloma</td><td>Who will the lone dove 															rely on</td></tr><tr><td>quru sacha hina mana piniyuq</td><td>like a sick tree, with no-															one</td></tr>	<tr><td>Sipillawaptimpas sayarimusaqmi</td><td>Even if they kill me I will															stand</td></tr><tr><td>chakiytawiptimpas sayarimusaqmi	</td><td>even if they break my 															feet I will stand</td></tr><tr><td>makichallaykita haywaykullaway</td><td>Reach me your hand of									solidarity I need to travel 															fast</td></tr><tr><td>utqaymi purinay, qamllama allinlla</td><td>See you soon, be well<tr><td>Huamanga del alma, hatarillasunmi!			Huamanga del alma, 				we will arise</td></tr>	<tr><td>- qawachan -</td><td>- coda -</td></tr>	<tr><td>Vacaytaqa nakankutaq</td><td>Their style is to slaughter 														my cow</td></tr><tr><td>radiuylaqa apankutaq</td><td>steal my radio</td></tr><tr><td>'cholo tu madre' niwankutaq</td><td>say 'your wog mother'</td></tr><tr><td>'viva la patria' niwankutaq</td><td>say 'viva la patria'</td></tr><tr><td>'viva la patria' niwankutaq.</td><td>say 'viva la patria'</td></tr></table>	<BR>	The question of racial conflict and of identity within the nation-staterecurs in Mexico where modern authors still, or again, turn to Nahuatl,the language once spoken at the courts of Tenochtitlana and Texcoco. Thisrecuperation may involve no more than re-stating the aesthetics and philosophyof 'flower-song' (xochi-cuicatl), that is, Nahuatl poetry itself; hence,Natalio Hern&aacute;ndez Hern&aacute;ndez's poem 'Nocolhua cuicate' (Ourancestral singers) delicately revives the binary phrasing of the sixteenthcentury Cantares mexicanos manuscript in invoking the old capacity to 'sayand know', 'say and sing'. Or, as in a poem by Fausto Hern&aacute;ndez Hern&aacute;ndez,a traditional mode like the 'orphan song' (icno-cuicatl) may be employedto express the current predicament of children and families in Nahuatl-speakingVeracruz who have been abandoned by parents obliged to migrate to aliencities: the title 'Tototl' ([migrant] bird) can refer to either gender,women having in fact borne much of this burden, earning money as they canin the hope of eventually helping those they left behind. In his 'Keskinauamaseualme tiistoke?' (How many Nahua are we?), Luis Reyes laconicallyrefers to official census figures for Nahuatl-speakers and the not-so-secretdesire of the coyotes (whites) to see them dwindle:<BR>	<BR><table border=0><tr><td>Kenke, tle ipampa,</td><td>Why, for what reason</td></tr><tr><td>kitemojtokej matipoliuikan?</td><td>do they want us to 																disappear?</td></tr><tr><td>Ax moneki miak tiknemilisej</td><td>Not much thought is 															needed</td></tr><tr><td>se tsontli xiuitl techmachte</td><td>four hundred years have 															taught us</td></tr><tr><td>tlen kineki koyotl.</td><td>what coyote wants.</td></tr><tr><td>Koytl kieleuia totlal	</td><td>Coyote fancies our land</td></tr><tr><td>kieliuia tokuatitla</td><td>fancies our woods</td></tr><tr><td>kieleuia toateno</td><td>fancies our rivers</td></tr><tr><td>kieleuia tosiouilis</td><td>fancies our labour</td></tr><tr><td>kieleuia toitonalis.</td><td>fancies our sweat.</td></tr><tr><td>Koyotl kineki matinemikan</td><td>Coyote wants us to live</td></tr><tr><td>uejueyi altepetl itempan</td><td>in the slums of big cities</td></tr><tr><td>nupeka matixijxipetsncmikan</td><td>there to live naked</td></tr><tr><td>nupeka matiapismikikan	</td><td>there to starve to death</td></tr><tr><td>nupeka matokamokajkayauakan</td><td>there to become objects									of their deceit</td></tr><tr><td>nupeka matokamauiltikan.</td><td>there to become objects 									of their game.</td></tr><tr><td>koyotl kineki matimochiuakan </td><td>Coyote wants us on his 	tiitlakeualuan.												payroll.</td></tr>		<tr><td>Yeka kineki matikauakan</td><td>That's why he wants us 															to give up</td></tr><tr><td>tokomontlal</td><td>our communal lands</td></tr><tr><td>tokomonteki</td><td>our communal labour</td></tr><tr><td>tomaseualteki</td><td>our native tasks</td></tr><tr><td>tomaseualtlajtol</td><td>our native speech</td></tr><tr><td>yeka kineki matikilkauakan</td><td>that's why he wants us to 														forget</td></tr><tr><td>tomaseualtlaken</td><td>our native clothes</td></tr><tr><td>tomaseualnemilis</td><td>our native way of life</td></tr><tr><td>tomaseuallalnamikilis.</td><td>our native way of 																thought.</td></tr><tr><td>Koyotl achto techkoyokuepa</td><td>First coyote turns us into 														coyotes</td></tr><tr><td>uan teipa techtlachtekilia	</td><td>then he steals from us</td></tr><tr><td>nochi tlen touaxka</td><td>all that is ours</td></tr><tr><td>nochi tlen titlaeliltia	</td><td>all that we produce</td></tr><tr><td>nochi tlen mila tlaelli</td><td>all that the milpa produces </td></tr><tr><td>kichteki tosiouilis</td><td>he steals our fatigue</td></tr><tr><td>kichteki totekipanolis.</td><td>he steals our work.</td></tr></table>	<BR>	Works by Dzul Poot, Paulino Yama and other modern Maya authors in Yucatancarry forward a literary tradition which, in celebrating Maya polity, stretchesback unbroken over 1,500 years or more to the hieroglyphic texts of theclassic-period cities. At the hard interface in Chiapas, Petu' Krus writesin Tzotzil Maya about survival as a woman, while in neighbouring Guatemala,Rigoberta Mench&uacute; shows in her autobiography how culture continuesto be sustained by the cosmogony and beliefs recorded in the Popol vuh,the sixteenth-century classic in her language (Quich&eacute;-Maya). At thesame time, besides Nahuatl and Maya, other Mesoamerican languages like Zapotecand Otomi (&Ntilde;ahnu), which belong to the ancient Otomanguan family,are becoming better known through alphabetic texts. One such is ThaayrohyadiBermudez's 'Tsi Mahkitee Lerma', a heartfelt Otomi ode to the 'father-river'Lerma which denounces pollution in political and cosmic terms and passeson its ecological message by honouring the old water gods.<BR><BR>	A decisive factor in these examples - Mapuche, Quechua, Nahuatl, Maya,Otomi - is the principle of continuity, of knowable history whose beginningslong antedate Columbus and which, in the last instance, is inseparable fromthe vaster story of the world ages or 'suns' told in the Popol vuh. NativeAmerican tenacity and resilience in the face of such massive assault, andapparently against all technological odds, argue for belief that is bothpracticable and renewable. As the Quito Declaration tells us, its sourcelies in cosmogony, in ancient yet modern accounts of how the earth was andstill is being formed and how we as a species have come to inhabit it.<BR>	<BR><B>Gordon Brotherston is professor of Spanish and Portuguese at the Universityof Indiana at Bloomington and research professor at the department of literatureat Essex University, UK<BR></B><HR><a href="../current.html"><img border=1 align=left hspace=10 src="../index_pix/current.gif"></a><H6>Click here to return to other articles<br>from the current issue, Index1/96</H6><BR></BODY></HTML>

<HR><H3>IN THE NEWS </H3><H2>Notes from prison</H2>
<I>When they visited me in prison they would always emphasise that the case was in their hands, that the
judges, the prosecution, the whole system was subordinate to them. Nobody can live on a salary, they
said. This is the free market. Everyone has to find other means to survive: bribes, business interests,
protection rackets... They were pretty convincing about their unlimited power. When I asked them about
the practicalities of controlling the judiciary, the two FSS men rocked with laughter. First you have to
'work' on them, they volunteered cheerfully, catch them out when they're not on the level. Then you
take them aside and paint their future in the darkest possible terms - if they're exposed. By then they'll be
sweating and ready to do anything to ensure that the FSS preserve their reputation. Then you sweeten
them up. After that they'll be only too keen to show their gratitude. They'll be under threat of
compromise for life.
	<p>It had taken me a long time to understand why the two FSS men had kept so 'sweetly' persuading
me to give them information about drug-taking among children of politicians, financiers, and the artistic
elite. They laughed, as ever. 'It's dynamite,' they said. 'You can get anyone by the throat if you threaten
to compromise their children. After all,' they said, amazed at my inability to understand these elementary
things, 'the elections are coming.'

<B>Alina Vitukhnovskaya, Notes from Butyrsk Prison, 1995
</B>	<p>
	<hr><p>
THE RUSSIAN parliamentary elections are upon us as Index goes to press, and 22-year-old poet Alina
Vitukhnovskaya is out on bail. It is now more than 15 months since she was imprisoned and charged with
involvement in a drugs racket which, it has been alleged, threatens to undermine the very foundations of
Russian society.

	<p>Evidence to support the charges is flimsy, to say the least. And it comes direct from the Federal
Security Service (FSS), the latest incarnation of the KGB which, a few years ago, engineered the
imprisonment of political dissidents Konstantin Azadovsky and Yuri Edelshtein on similar charges. If
convicted, Vitukhnovskaya could spend up to 15 years in prison. For the time being she is back home
following a hearing on 28 November at which no barrister appeared, and which came to an abrupt end
when someone announced that a bomb had been planted in the courtroom.

	<p>Vitukhnovskaya is reputed to be one of the most talented and distinguished young poets of her
generation. On the night of 16 October 1994, she was arrested by a dozen or so FSS men who were
waiting for her outside her block of flats as she came back from a rock concert. They charged her with
pushing two grams of LSD to two youths at a Moscow metro station. The evidence against her lies in the
money - equivalent to US$20 - which she was apparently carrying when she was arrested, and two vials of
drugs said to have been found in a speedily conducted search of her room. The main prosecution
witnesses are two young men who picked Alina out of a solo identity parade conducted by the police.
They are reported to have been high at the time.

	<p>She was held in Butyrsk prison for a year without trial. Her sight and hearing have deteriorated; she
has frequent fainting fits; she is said to have been close to suicide. Prison conditions in Russia are abject.
'Rats' tails in the soup,' she says impassively. 'Sometimes I wouldn't eat for days.' In June, Russian PEN took
up her case and appointed four prominent writers to follow the proceedings and support her defence. An
extraordinary picture of the Russian judicial and penal system has emerged.

	<p>Court hearings have been erratic and inconsistent, witnesses bewildered and uncertain of their
evidence. Signs of police coaching have been blatant; stories have failed to match. Signatures were
forged, documents back-dated and journalists sent home on the grounds that hearings had been
postponed, minutes before they actually began. The case for the defence has been ignored throughout.

	<p>The FSS began to take an interest in Vitukhnovskaya following publication of an article in the journal
Novoye Vremya, in which she gave an original, personal account of her encounters with Moscow's
alternative youth culture and its perception of drug-taking. Her telephone was tapped, it seems, and later
she was invited - unsuccessfully - to inform on children of prominent political and business figures.

	<p>Vitukhnovskaya's lawyer, Karen Nersisyan, has called her case a gauge of public mood before the
elections. It is also a test of the power wielded by the FSS and the police. 'There are tens of thousands of
cases like this in Russian courts at this moment,' Nersisyan says. 'People are being charged on the basis of
suborned witnesses and a couple of bits of paper.' In police cells, intimidation and torture are rife. In 1995,
900 police officers were dismissed for abuse of power or corruption in Moscow alone; a further 600 face
disciplinary proceedings. Victims are generally unidentified.

	<p>'I suppose I can gain some aesthetic satisfaction from the way things have turned out,'
Vitukhnovskaya says, her voice strangely flat and serene and close down the phone line. 'But it may be
more dangerous now. This isn't freedom. The leadership we have here is bound not by law, duty or
responsibility, but by an exclusive kind of insanity. I feel I'm being dragged down by an invisible slip-stream,
along with everyone else who happens to have been caught up in it with me.'

At these meetingsthere is a special ceremony to present an award acknowledging thework of journalists who have done an outstanding job writing aboutfamily planning.  This type of activity provides opportunities todisseminate information about INPPARES' services through themedia.  In addition, the Institute has organized three Jos&eacute; FaustinoS&aacute;nchez Carri&oacute;n National Journalist Contests, organized with theFamily Planning Congress.  <p>The communication strategy developed by INPPARES has resulted innationwide coverage, leading to a large number of programmes andinterviews on radio and TV with professionals and experts insciences and health issues.  INPPARES' work has also generatedmany printed stories, both in the largest daily newspapers and inpopular magazines.<p><h3>Diffusion</h3>INPPARES has developed a series of interviews and healthprogrammes which are broadcast through radio stations such asRadio Comas, Radio El Sol and Radio Victoria, with a large audience,in the most populated areas of the country.  &quot;Radio interviews havegiven us the chance to disseminate free ads promoting the servicesof INPPARES&quot;, said Marina Aguilar.<p>For two years INPPARES has had an agreement with the weeklymagazine Telecolor, dedicated to popular attractions and Hollywoodstars, which is a favourite with young people.  Published weekly, themagazine includes articles written by professionals of INPPARES anda promotional ad about the services offered in the clinics.  In 199338 articles covering topics such as &quot;Vasectomy in Action&quot;, &quot;TubalLigation&quot;, &quot;The Meaning of Pregnancy in Adolescents&quot;, &quot;Myths andTaboos of Human Sexuality&quot; were published.<p>One of the Peruvian newspapers which has shown a constantinterest in publishing articles on reproductive health and the work ofINPPARES is Ojo.  Generally the paper includes an eight-pagesupplement of easy-to-read stories on the subject.  Last year, Ojopublished 56 of these supplements, with attractive illustrations,including: &quot;A Growing Number of Couples used Vasectomy&quot;, &quot;2,000Women Die Daily Due to Pregnancy-related Causes&quot;, &quot;MaternalMortality: A Ghost of the Third World&quot; and so on.  <p>&quot;Journalistic awards such as the Rosa Cisneros MemorialInformation Award of IPPF/WHR have provoked the interest of manyof our country's journalists in family planning and even some ofthem specialize in this issue,&quot; says Dr Daniel Aspilcueta, Director ofINPPARES.<p>INPPARES itemizes a number of lessons it has learnt through itsexperiences with media:<p><ul><li>  It is imperative to work with a media directory to make sure theappropriate channel is being used.<p><li>  Background material should be developed in order to facilitatethe journalist's task.<p><li>  Arrange constant visits by the media, especially those whopublish interviews, and feed journalists with ideas to focus on ourissues.<p><li>  Develop events for journalists and social communicators, topicsthat attract their attention and help clear doubts and prejudices.<p><li>  Professionals who work at FPAs should be interested in themedia; they are the FPA's principal allies for the development ofinterviews.<p><li> Journalists should be motivated, mainly those who support us. This can be achieved by giving them free consultations to medical oreducational services, inviting them to lunch after a press conferenceand recognizing their support in disseminating family planning issuesthrough awards.<p><li>  Journalism awards for outstanding works on family planning. Awards can be diplomas, plaques, a symbolic amount of cash or anyother compensation which encourages them to cover health issues.</ul><p>Last year INPPARES received the Rosa Cisneros Award in thecategory of Family Planning Associations for its enormous efforts incommunications, as reported here.  The Rosa Cisneros Award,established by IPPF/WHR 14 years ago, includes $5,000 which isdivided between the winners of two categories: Media and FamilyPlanning Associations.<p>&quot;INPPARES not only provides information, but also facilitates theaccess of people with low incomes to family planning&quot;, says theyoung Peruvian journalist Carlos Ch&aacute;vez Toro, who has a column onthe well known daily La Rep&uacute;blica and has also know INPPARES sincehis adolescence when he was referred to the institution through ahealth promoter. <hr><p>©Copyright IPPF<br><hr><img align=left src="../ippf_pix/ippf_logo2.gif"> <a href="index.html">PPC 1996/1 Contents</a><br><a href="../index.html">IPPF Home Page</a><hr></body></html>        

<P>
Contribuer &agrave; consolider la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile
au Sud et faire de l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement une
cause nationale, tels sont aujourd'hui les enjeux du dialogue
instaur&eacute; par la Commission Coop&eacute;ration D&eacute;veloppement,
entre pouvoirs publics et associations.
<P>
Depuis plus de vingt ans, les ONG ont contribu&eacute; &agrave;
inventer l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement de base : elles participent
aujourd'hui &agrave; l'&eacute;laboration d'une nouvelle forme
de coop&eacute;ration qui fait de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; civile
le socle de tout d&eacute;veloppement. Les groupes de travail
et les comit&eacute;s de programme anim&eacute;s par la Commission
permettent des &eacute;changes et d&eacute;bats f&eacute;conds
entre acteurs de terrain, responsables d'associations et repr&eacute;sentants
des minist&egrave;res.
<P>
La Commission, en &eacute;troite relation avec le bureau de la
vie associative, commun au minist&egrave;re des Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res
et au minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration, met en place
ce qu'il convient d'appeler une nouvelle contractualisation entre
pouvoirs publics et organisations de solidarit&eacute; internationale
(OSI). Des programmes prioritaires devraient permettre de construire
des actions coordonn&eacute;es des OSI fran&ccedil;aises dans
un pays donn&eacute;. Les organisations de la soci&eacute;t&eacute;
civile (OSC) de ce pays seront par l&agrave; m&ecirc;me conduites
&agrave; se f&eacute;d&eacute;rer. En cela, la premi&egrave;re
exp&eacute;rience de ce type, en cours &agrave; Madagascar, devrait
&ecirc;tre riche d'enseignements. En effet, le travail des OSI
fran&ccedil;aises a d&eacute;j&agrave; induit sur place une forte
mobilisation des OSC locales. Prenant conscience de leur propre
existence et de leur capacit&eacute; &agrave; se f&eacute;d&eacute;rer
autour d'un projet, les associations malgaches semblent pr&ecirc;tes
&agrave; ces nouveaux partenariats fond&eacute;s sur la parit&eacute;.
<P>
<H3>Vers des assises de la coop&eacute;ration</H3>
<P>
Il s'agit de redynamiser l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement en en
faisant une grande cause nationale. Les r&eacute;seaux associatifs
sont riches d'id&eacute;es, de projets, et les volont&eacute;s
d'agir ne manquent pas. Ce qui fait d&eacute;faut, c'est un grand
courant mobilisateur et f&eacute;d&eacute;rateur. Les partenaires
de la Commission cherchent &agrave; r&eacute;inventer une v&eacute;ritable
p&eacute;dagogie civique de l'aide. Selon Th&eacute;r&egrave;se
Pujolle, secr&eacute;taire g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, &quot;il est
n&eacute;cessaire de trouver de nouveaux mots pour convaincre&quot;.
 La Commission contribue d'ores et d&eacute;j&agrave; &agrave;
un projet d'envergure : l'organisation d'assises de la coop&eacute;ration
et de la solidarit&eacute; internationale, &agrave; l'horizon
du printemps 1997, qui visent &agrave; informer l'opinion publique
et &agrave; la remobiliser autour de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement.
Ces assises, r&eacute;gionales dans un premier temps, r&eacute;uniront
les pouvoirs publics, les collectivit&eacute;s locales et le monde
associatif. Un grand rassemblement final devrait permettre la
mise en commun des travaux pour de nouvelles pratiques de l'aide
au d&eacute;veloppement.

<P>
Currently, &quot;dialogue has taken a back seat to greater conditionality
- in the sense of externally imposed conditions. I consider that
this concept of conditionality has completely failed. At the end
of the day, there are no examples of successful reforms that have
not actually been taken on board by the country itself -- by its
government and by its people. `Ownership' is not intended to be
a new catchword. However, it does accurately reflect the fundamental
prerequisite for successful reform. This is even more relevant
when economic and political reforms - structural adjustment and
democratisation - coincide; this is because conditions in a free
society are even less susceptible to being dictated from outside.
The way ahead should therefore be a return to dialogue, to a negotiation
of mutually acceptable conditions based on partnership. This has
nothing to do with laxity, but a great deal to do with style and
culture.&quot;
<P>
&quot;There will be a need to evaluate more carefully than in
the past who really needs development aid and who deserves it.
The partners have to move away from the `entitlement' way of thinking
that has developed within the framework of Lom&eacute;.&quot;
<P>
&quot;When it comes to allocating aid, it will be necessary to
differentiate clearly (i) according to need (poorer countries
and poorer sections of the population should be given priority),
(ii) in terms of development policy performance (own efforts,
willingness to reform, etc.), and (iii) in terms of political
performance. This last criterion needs an additional note of caution:
the aims of safeguarding fundamental human rights and assuring
the responsible management of resources seem to me to be more
important than the formal shaping of democracy.&quot;

(Depending on where you live, and the ethnicityof your pupils, much of the produce illustrated may be completely unknown.)The picture provides an opportunity to discuss food very broadly - you maywell find that there are some of your pupils who eat virtually no freshfood at all, for many pulses and spices may be completely new. <BR><BR>You may wish to raise questions of the climatic conditions that differentplants need, seasonal produce in our shops, the importing of foods - whobenefits most from this? (Traidcraft can provide information on Tanzaniancash crops - see <a href="nnud_resources.html">Resources</a>.)<BR><BR>You might like to ask someone over 40 years of age to talk about the foodsthey ate as a child in the 1950s. A comparison of our diets today with thatof the 1950s will clearly highlight how our culinary horizons have broadenedalong with increased imports and foreign holidays. The UNICEF resource <B>Weare what we eat</B> provides a full programme of work on eating habits andfood choices. Before doing the work on the Agip Menu you might want to discussthe variety of 'restaurants' and fast food places where food can be boughtand eaten. Pupils could collect menus and look at advertisements for 'restaurants'and compare their main features and costs.<BR><BR><B>Spices and global interdependence</B><BR>Spices provide a perfect opportunity to look at global interdependence sinceso few are grown in the UK. A collection of spice jars and packets can berelated to a world map to show how we depend on other countries for thisfragrant addition to our food. Tanzania is renowned for its spices, particularlycloves which come from Pemba, the second island of Zanzibar.<BR><BR>If you can, purchase a range of foods which come from Tanzania or nearbyAfrican countries. Compare their cost with UK produce and see if the journeythese foods have made can be traced. <BR><BR><B>Using the Agip menu</B><BR>The Agip is an international hotel in Dar es Salaam. It is extremely expensiveand many of those who stay there are foreign visitors. However, besidesits restaurant with starched table cloths and shiny cutlery it has a snack-barrestaurant, which also has a take-away service. This is much used by thoseof the local population who can afford it - it is still far more expensivethan you would pay for a meal in a village restaurant which would only offera variety of four or five dishes.<BR><BR>1.	Look at the menu closely, what do you notice about the food offered?<BR>2.	If you spent a day in the Hotel Agip what food and drink would you choosefor meals at 8 am, 1 pm, 6pm?<BR>3.	Make a bill out for each of these meals and ask two friends to checkyour answers.<BR>4.	List the foods on the menu that you do not recognise.

<html><head><title></title><!!keys: CDC+ODA+Business Development Fund></head><body><img src="oda_pix/oda_logo.gif"><br><i>The material that follows has been provided by </i>   <a href="oda_info.html"> Overseas Development Administration </a><hr><h3>Creating free and fair societies</h3><p>As well as sound public administration, lasting development also needs a healthy and flourishing private sector. Aid in support of the private sector in developing countries seeks to encourage measures to liberalise economies, develop capital markets, and provide more incentives to producers. It also provides for specific technical assistance to strengthen businesses. <p>The Commonwealth Development Corporation (CDC) borrows from ODA in order to provide loans, equity funds and help with management to a broad range of private enterprises in 51 countries. In 1993 it invested £217 million in 100 projects, its largest ever programme. Nearly 90 per cent of new investments were in the private sector. In 1994 Baroness Chalker announced new targets for the next five years under which CDC will concentrate on the poorest countries and promoting the private sector. <p>Aid for privatisation concentrates on the former Soviet Union and central and eastern Europe with 32 projects costing £11.4 million for mass privatisation programmes and privatisation legislation. These include a project to help the Russians take the first steps in the critical area of land privatisation. But technical assistance and aid was also provided in Africa, Asia and Latin America. The aim is to encourage more dynamic management, foreign investment and better service for consumers.<p>When David Allan took up his post as adviser to the Inspector General of Police in Namibia, he was in for a surprise. "Modern methods of policing and democratic accountability were unfamiliar territory to some people in Namibia," says David. He had arrived there, sent by the ODA to help reform the police force after the 20 year guerrilla war. As former deputy commandant of the Scottish Police College, responsible for training all of Scotland's police officers and with 32 years in the force, he had the experience necessary to help introduce 250 separate reforms, covering every aspect of policing from CID and special branch to traffic and personnel. "I visited many police stations around the country. Some of them were particularly grand buildings, some little huts and some just a table under a tree."<p>In 1994, the ODA helped more than 30 countries reform their police services, by upgrading through training the technical and managerial skills of police personnel, for example, and making the police more responsive to the communities they serve. Aid targeted at helping countries build up strong civil police forces in place of military alternatives, is one aspect of the ODA's support for 'good government' in developing countries. Government that is democratic and accountable for its own actions with strong institutions, that weeds out corruption and promotes human rights and has the participation and consent of the people it represents, can make a huge difference to the quality of life.<p>The ODA considers good government aspects in the design of its aid projects generally. But it specifically promotes good government by funding projects that improve the legal sector, civil service and public services. It also helps support elections, combat corruption and enhance the competence of government institutions.<p>The ODA's policy involves both penalties and incentives. In recent years, aid to Malawi, Burma and Sudan was cut because of good government concerns, for example, but, in the case of Malawi, was restored in 1993 after the Government of Malawi held a referendum which led to multi-party elections in 1994. The Programme for Democracy in Russia, part of the Know How Fund, aims to help with the development of parliamentary democracy through a programme of visits, exchanges and courses.<p><b>Reforming for the future</b><br>Through its support for economic reform in developing countries, the ODA works with governments to help them make sure their country is run in a way that supports their citizens and provides the right environment for economic progress and lasting development. This means governments creating and using sound economic policies which provide stability, a competitive environment, freedom from unnecessary controls and cost-effective public services. Sustainable development is impossible without these policies. Aid for reform comes in the form of balance of payments grants, known as programme aid, which provides finance for essential imports that countries would not otherwise be able to afford, and through technical cooperation. Examples of technical cooperation projects designed to assist in the process of reform  have included, in recent years, eight in Africa and four in Asia all focusing on improving tax administration and revenue collection. In 1994, projects in Malawi, Poland, Uganda, Ukraine, Guyana and Colombia provided assistance and training for civil service reform.<p>The ODA also helps finance reforms through international organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Development Association and the European Development Fund and countries receiving aid have to comply with agreements made with the IMF and the World Bank. This work is particularly important in Africa and 48 per cent of the ODA's programme there has economic reform as its principal objective. Much of Britain's programme aid for reform goes to support the World Bank's Special Programme for Assistance to Africa. The initiative covers 31 developing countries and the ODA focuses mainly on Zambia, Uganda, Tanzania and Ghana. <p><b>A boost for business</b><br>Together, small businesses make a substantial contribution to any country's economic growth and long-term development prospects. The ODA uses aid to bolster small businesses by providing incentives in the form of affordable loans and grants, technical help, start-up assistance, guidance on marketing and capital investment. Since 1990, when it set up the Small Business Development Fund to investigate and promote new projects and activities with these aims in mind, the ODA has steadily stepped up its work in this area. In 1993/94 it spent an unprecedented £20 million on these activities.<p><b>Know-how </b><br> Created in 1989, the Know How Fund is Britain's response to the tumultuous changes in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. It aims to support the countries of the region in their transition to pluralist democracy and the market economy. Management training is an important component. Managers in the region were left ill-equipped to cope with new concepts such as supply and demand, consumer choice and energy-efficient or environmentally sound production. To train people to put new systems and policies into action, the ODA has set up a range of projects, including the establishment of four regional management centres in Poland that focus on training and business advice targeted at small and medium enterprises. <p>In 1993/94 the Know How Fund accounted for £59 million. <p>An administrator at the Rakitnoya sugar factory in Ukraine takes a break, sampling some of the sugar produced on site. Specialised support from the Know How Fund has improved the quality and quantity of sugar produced at Rakitnoya. The Fund has also provided training and technical expertise for the farms - both private and state-run - which supply the plant with sugar beet on a daily basis. <p><b>Encouraging enterprise</b><br>Retreading tyres has become good business for Peter MacManu and a success for the ODA-funded Ghana Enterprise Development Project. In 1985 Peter set up MACAL Tyre Retreading Company in Sekondi, in an old factory with two friends. In 1991 a bank loan helped them buy new equipment, but some items were inappropriate and poorly installed. A volunteer from BESO - British Executive Services Overseas which sends senior executives from British industry on short term consultancy assignments - solved the technical problems and trained the staff. Equipment failures are now down 80 per cent to five per cent and the company produces around 100 high quality retreaded truck tyres per week. Peter is typical of thousands of owners of small to medium-sized businesses, probably family-owned and employing a small number of staff, who have benefited from the aid programme.  <p>Bread queues in Moscow used to be familiar scenes to British television viewers. But the Know How Fund's Moscow Bread project has been working hard to change that. After a study by Andersen Consulting in 1991, a training course in basic business skills for bread shop managers was set up. Nearly 600 retailers were trained. Other retailers now come to their shops to see how they have improved their operations, making them more attractive to consumers - by repainting furniture and rearranging equipment for example. <p>Small businesses, often based in people's homes, can create opportunities for them to earn much-needed cash and improve their quality of life.<hr>©Copyright: ODA 1995<hr><a href=index.html"><img src="oda_pix/oda_logo2.gif"> ODA Home Page</a><hr></body></html>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>1. ACP DEFINES ITS POSITION ON FUTURE CO-OPERATION
WITH EU - &quot;OVERALL ACP FRAMEWORK TO BE OBTAINED&quot;<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>As the EC prepares to launch its debate on future
ACP/EU relations with its Green Paper the ACP countries are holding
their own discussions on the framework of co-operation with the
EU. At the end of the ACP Council on Friday 16 November, the Council
under the Chairmanship of Rajkeswur Purryag of Mauritius, came
to the following conclusions: a) To reaffirm its will to intensify
ACP/EU co-operation while retaining the overall ACP framework
without ruling out the possibility to modify different elements
of the current co-operation in response to the particular needs
of certain ACP groups b) to prioritise the fight against poverty,
malnutrition and famine c) emphasise the importance of co-operation
in the promotion of the private sector, rural development, industrialisation
and increase in investment flows.</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>A series of earlier meetings of the Sub-Committee
briefed by the Council of Ambassadors examined the following issues
- regionalisation of ACP-EU co-operation, increase in the number
of adherents to the Convention, the goals and principles of the
new Convention, donor fatigue, conflict management and prevention,
the future of trade regimes, the role of investment in the private
sector and aid flows and aid management. </FONT>
<UL>
<LI>A timetable of forthcoming work and activities leading up
to negotiations with the EU presented at the Council follows
<LI>end of ACP national and regional consultations - at latest
in March 1997
<LI>meeting of ACP Foreign ministers - September 1997
<LI>Summit of ACP heads of State - October 1997 (Libreville Gabon)
<LI>end of work on the assessment of aid to development - within
eighteen months
<LI>examination of the negotiating brief the EU Council is to
give the Commission - end 1997
<LI>beginning of negotiations over the new Convention - September
1998<BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>2. EU SEEKS WEU CONTRIBUTION ON HOW BEST TO ASSIST
REFUGEES IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The European Union Development Council, meeting on
Friday the 23 November in the presence of Mr de Deus Pinheiro
and Ms. Bonino, EC Commissioners for Development and Humanitarian
Assistance respectively, is to adopt a &quot;joint action&quot;
and decision concerning its next move in the Great Lakes Region.
The EU will ask the WEU how it can best contribute &quot;to the
maximum use of available operational means&quot;, required to
implement the &quot;joint action&quot; to assist the refugees
in Eastern Zaire and facilitate their 'freely consented' return
to their countries of origin. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>The Union will also confirm its support for the deployment
of a neutral international force with African participation. Earlier
on at the end of consultations with countries prepared to send
troops to the region, at the UN Headquarters in New York, Gordon
Smith, Canadian Deputy Foreign Minister, said that apart from
Rwanda all countries including Zaire still believe that the deployment
of a military force is still necessary. Canadian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien in agreement said in Ottawa that though the need
for military intervention was not as strong as it was two weeks
ago grave problems remain in providing for the refugees when they
arrive home. <BR>

<B><FONT SIZE=2>3. SOUTH AFRICAN DEPUTY PRESIDENT BRIEFS ACP COUNCIL
ON SOUTH AFRICA'S FREE TRADE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE EU <BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Thabo Mbeki, South African Deputy President,
on Friday 16 November delineated South Africa's position and view
on the proposed free trade agreement with the EU before the ACP
Council. Mr. Mbeki said, &quot;The initial European Position as
outlined in their opening negotiations mandate is not one which
lives up to our expectations nor to the original EU promises.
We are nevertheless, currently busy formulating an opening position
trade in a mandate for ourselves so that trade negotiations can
begin&quot;. He recalled South Africa's request two years ago
to the EU for full membership of the ACP, instead the EU had proposed
qualified membership of the ACP along with a bilateral agreement
with the EU with no &quot;developmentally oriented trade formula&quot;.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Mbeki reaffirmed that South Africa's negotiations
with the EU would have to be in accordance with its link to the
African continent as a whole to which it's democratic stability,
reconstruction and general development are connected. He said
the agreement with South Africa would have to 1) enhance the reconstruction
and development process in South Africa, 2) take account of South
Africa's relations with its SADC partners, 3) avoid creating a
negative precedent for the ACP in its future relationship with
South Africa 4) encourage the trade and investment in the region
and improve regional integration in the region. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>On qualified accession to the Lom&eacute; Convention
the South African Deputy President expressed his hope that the
Convention would enhance South Africa's potential role in the
region and co-operation with ACP countries. He stated that the
successor to the current Lom&eacute; Convention would have to
be less bureaucratic and more effective. <BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<B><FONT SIZE=2>4. HOPE FOR WEST AFRICAN REGION - CONFERENCE ON
WEST AFRICAN MONETARY UNION<BR>
</FONT></B>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>At the Conference on the Future of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union, WAEMU, organised by the Club de Bruxelles
on 21 and 22 November, participants have expressed their optimism
over the countries in the sub-region's ability to carry out a
successful economic and monetary union. Blaise Compaore, the President
of Burkina Faso and Chairman of the Summit of Head of States of
the WAEMU said that the present seven signatories to the Treaty
establishing WAEMU in 1994 all had the advantage of maintaining
a single currency the, CFA, long before embarking on economic
integration. Mr Compaore also pointed to the region's recent impressive
economic growth rates which he said augur well for integration.
Mr. Christian Oquet the Head of the Department for West Africa
in the French Ministry of Co-operation added that the time for
integration was right because countries within the region now
had the political will to set up a Union. </FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>Mr. Soubestre Deputy Director of the EC Directorate
General for Development while praising the signatories' efforts
at maintaining a single currency cautioned that a single currency
is a necessary but insufficient condition for economic integration.
He stated that the EU was supporting WAEMU financially as well
as providing advice gained through its long experience with economic
integration. According to Mr. Soubestre the new Lom&eacute; Convention
made special provision for the support of ACP countries engaging
in integration with direct EDF funding to offset losses incurred
by countries attempting to create unions. Mr. Charles Humphries
of the World Bank also expressed his concern over the significant
structural reform in the legal systems, investment codes and tax
legislation and the capacity building of institutions within the
seven members of WAEMU that will have to be put in place to ensure
successful integration. But he emphasised that a healthy political
and economic climate was a more significant incentive to investors
than mere changes in investment codes, pointing to the declining
interest showed to Africa by investors despite attempts to improve
investment codes in the region. Other participants also warned
of the potential political tensions both within and without the
Union over the exclusive Francophone nature of the signatories.
However, the principal speakers at the Conference stated that
at present there is no other way forward for the sub-region but
economic and monetary integration.<BR>

<h2 align=center>SUMMARY

REPORT</h2>




<h4 align=center>July 1995</h4>
<hr>
<h2>FOCUSING ON QUALITY</h2>

1.	The detailed terms of reference for this Fundamental Expenditure Review (FER or review) are annexed.  The thrust of the task we have been set by Ministers is to improve the effectiveness of the Overseas Development Administration (ODA).  The review has therefore sought to deliver gains in efficiency and effectiveness (rather than a pre-determined reduction in resources) by examining systems and policies so as to improve the quality of our work.  In doing so, it has taken account of the wider policy context and central Government initiatives within which ODA has to operate.  The Senior Management Review has also begun and will take account of the conclusions of the FER.

<h2>STARTING FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH</h2>

2.	The picture revealed by widespread consultation with ODA's customers and staff is of an effective organisation with dedicated and professional staff.  Many of our interlocutors - the British development community, other Government departments with which we interact closely and those who receive our aid - rated ODA highly.  But in any organisation there is always room for improvement in the way things are done - even in one like ODA which has reviewed large areas of its operations over recent years.

<h2>THE BENEFITS OF CONSULTATION</h2>

3.	The approach to the FER has been open and consultative.  Many innovative ideas for improving the ODA were offered by ODA staff and outsiders.  Benchmarking against other donors and taking on board the views of aid recipient countries have been important features of the review.  And we have been greatly helped by the work of 24 project teams, which have produced analyses and recommendations that, by and large, we support and have included in the final report.  This summary report includes only the most important of those recommendations.

<h2>THE FER AGENDA</h2>

4.	The review focused on:
<p>

	<ul><li>	defining ODA's fundamental role;
<p>

	<li>	examining ODA's purpose, aims and objectives;
<p>

	<li>	considering changes to systems and organisation structure which might help ODA to measure more clearly (and improve) its performance against the aims and objectives;  
<p>

	<li>	considering strategic and management choices in bilateral and multilateral aid with a view to enhancing ODA's effectiveness, including through the redeployment of resources within the aid programme;  and
<p>

	<li>	outlining new techniques which could be used to make us more efficient.
</ul><p>

5.	Our conclusions will need to be taken forward and developed in detail before they can be fully implemented.  We saw the essence of our task as defining the agenda for change at the broadest level and outlining a system for tackling it in the coming years.  Some of our conclusions will need to be tested on the ground.

<h2>ODA's ROLE:  SOME PRIOR QUESTIONS</h2>

6.	In examining ODA's fundamental role, we answered a number of prior questions as follows:-

	<ul><li>	The process of development can be defined as meaning a sustainable improvement in the quality of life and reduced poverty.
	<li>	Developed countries support the sustainable development process out of a sense of moral obligation (e.g. to reduce poverty) and in the pursuit of national interests (e.g. by extending liberal trade and financial regimes, by helping to prevent a relapse into the Cold War, and by seeking political or commercial advantage).  There is no intrinsic conflict between the two motivations.  But the balance between them will differ according to the developed country, the historical period, and the region of the world under discussion.
<p>

<li>	The key development challenges are to bring about market-based economic growth, better government, higher quality social and direct poverty reduction programmes, and environmental sustainability.
<p>

	<li>	A number of instruments other than aid are available to tackle these challenges:  progress is primarily dependent on the efforts and policies of the poorer countries themselves, but it is also dependent on private investment flows, greater trade access to developed country markets and debt relief.  The UK Government (HMG) has a good record of advocating freer trade and debt relief for the poorest states, as well as stressing the importance of conflict prevention in creating conditions conducive to development.
<p>

	<li>	Aid - the transfer of finance or know-how at below market terms - has however an important complementary role in relation to the other instruments for supporting development.  Aid used effectively, particularly through its influence on developing countries' policies, can ensure that the non-aid instruments are more powerful in their effect.  In performing this function, aid should be seen as a temporary instrument focused on those poor countries least able to meet their development needs through trade, private flows and domestic resources.
<p>
    
	<li>	Aid is a collective effort.  While there are elements of competition between donor countries (for influence or for commercial advantage), there is general agreement on the key development challenges.  There is much interaction and coordination between members of the donor community and also with recipients.  The major donors seek to influence the policies and approaches of each other, of the aid recipient countries and of the wider development community.
<p>

	<li>	And aid has, by and large, been effective.  There are certainly examples where aid has enabled countries to maintain inappropriate government structures, where adjustment programmes have been poorly designed or where projects have been financed with inadequate attention to social or environmental concerns.  But, taken in aggregate, the evidence strongly suggests that aid is effective provided it does not displace other flows, is planned with social and institutional factors taken into account and involves the intended beneficiaries in project design and implementation, and is - crucially -delivered within a sound policy framework in the recipient country.  The role of the IMF and the World Bank has been central to the process of policy dialogue.
</ul>
<h2>ODA's ROLE:  FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS</h2>

7.	Taking account of the above, we reached the following conclusions on the fundamental questions about ODA's role:-

	<ul><li>	HMG's aid programme is motivated by both a sense of moral obligation and the pursuit of national interests.  The moral case in particular supports emergency aid and assistance to the poorest countries.  The UK national interest case is particularly strong for providing aid to certain middle-income countries and to the larger poor countries with the greatest long-term potential.  

	<p>
<li>	As some of these objectives are not specific to the UK and as aid is a collective effort, it might be argued that HMG should act as a "free rider" and provide no overseas assistance at all.  However, there is a broad political consensus in the UK that the Government should provide aid.  Neither the moral obligation to help nor the need to protect and enhance national interests would be served by HMG pulling out of aid.  Indeed, to the extent that aid is an important lever for HMG in influencing the debate, as a member of the Group of 7 and a Permanent Member of the Security Council, on the wider interests of the developed world, an end to UK assistance would be harmful to British interests.  

<h4>We recommend therefore that HMG should continue to provide concessional aid.</h4>


	<p>
<li>	It is not possible to establish a "right" level for the Aid Budget.  It is, however, questionable whether the present level is high enough to fulfil the Government's wish to maintain the share of aid going through bilateral channels and to continue to be seen to shoulder Britain's share of the global burden.  The inescapable and rising sums of aid passing through the EC budget are putting pressure on the level of bilateral aid to a degree that has no parallel in any other donor country.  

	<p>
<li>	ODA is unlike many other official aid organisations in that the Aid Budget covers funds spent through both bilateral and multilateral channels.  Combining responsibility for both bilateral and multilateral aid, policy formulation and implementation is perceived by HMG, some other donors, the wider UK development community and by the OECD Development Assistance Committee (DAC) as one of the UK aid programme's key strengths.  It avoids the duplication, institutional rivalry and lack of policy focus and consistency which characterises the programmes of some other donors.  It gives UK development assistance a coherence that facilitates ODA's advocacy role, particularly in multilateral fora.  
<h4>We recommend that ODA should retain responsibility for both bilateral and multilateral aid.</h4>


	<li>	In delivering British bilateral aid and through its role in influencing multilateral institutions, ODA has built up expertise on a wide range of development issues, including the use of non-aid instruments.  ODA therefore has the capacity and contacts to be influential on non-aid issues (such as trade, investment, debt relief, and technology transfer) concerning the UK's broader economic and financial relations with developing and transition countries.  But, with the exception of its input into the global environment debate, ODA has rarely engaged pro-actively in the broader issues in recent years.  It also has the knowledge to help enhance the UK effort in the range of international institutions which deal with these broader issues.  HMG's influence on the international economic system as a whole is likely to be much greater if ODA adopts this wider role.

<h4>We recommend that the ODA input in broader development policy debates become more pro-active and substantive (and hence influential) than at present.  Mechanisms to achieve this will require further study, but should include the adoption of this wider agenda as one of ODA's aims (see below).</h4>
</ul>

<h2>ODA's GOAL, PURPOSE AND AIMS</h2>

8.	Central to the FER was the analysis of what ODA should be trying to achieve as enshrined in the purpose and aims of the organisation set out in its mission statement.  We came to the following conclusions:-

	<ul><li>	ODA's remit, as the institution delivering British official aid and (potentially) as a more pro-active influence on broader development issues, forms part of the international development effort.  Therefore, ODA's goal can be defined at the broadest level as the improvement in the quality of life and reduced poverty and suffering (in countries that require concessional finance).  To reach this goal, ODA's purpose must be the promotion of sustainable development.  

	<p>
<li>	ODA's mission statement contains three statements which could be construed as covering both its goal and its purpose.  All of these are consistent with each other and with the definition of goal and purpose above.  But retaining all three in the mission statement and without distinguishing more clearly between them risks making unclear ODA's goal and purpose.  

<h4>We recommend that ODA clarify its goal and purpose as follows:  
<p>

"ODA's goal is to improve the quality of life and reduce poverty and suffering in poorer countries";
<p>

"ODA's purpose is to promote sustainable development".</h4>


This goal and purpose are consistent with the aims of HMG's foreign policy and with those of other Government Departments concerned with international economic affairs.

	<p>
<li>	ODA currently has seven priority objectives.  Each of these has a "monitor" within ODA, responsible for reporting biennially on progress against the priority objectives.  The priority objectives have been valuable in external presentation of the aid programme and have had some effect on the nature of ODA's activities.

	<p>
  <li>	Many of the priority objectives are overlapping and cross-cutting in that any one of ODA's activities will meet a number of them.  They are also open-ended in that they describe goals which can never be finally achieved.  Their very nature means that they are not easily amenable to weighting, to directing the allocation of resources, and to vesting responsibility for them in individuals.  In essence, they are more like "aims" (descriptions of the direction in which ODA wishes to travel) than "objectives" (targets that are capable of being measured and achieved).  Indicators of achievement of these aims can only be defined at a less aggregated level related to the widely varying contexts (e.g. country and institutional) in which we work.

	<p>
<li>	Therefore, the essential purpose of high-level aims should be to define the model of development that Ministers believe should provide the framework for ODA's activities.  Over recent years, HMG has stressed the aid programme's role in tackling the following broad inter-disciplinary issues:

		<ul><li>	the need for appropriate policies, efficient markets, effective institutions and good government to support development;

		<p>
<li>	the quality and quantity of investment in the social sectors and the need for attention to widening choices and opportunities, in particular by enhancing the status of women; and

		<p>
<li>	the need to ensure the gap between existing capacity and the long-term productive potential of poor countries is being closed through investments that are sustainable.

	</ul><p>
<li>	On this basis, it would be plausible for ODA to adopt three high-level aims:

	<ul><li>	one aim to focus on the policy environment for development by linking together the existing economic reform and good government priority objectives as is increasingly the case in the design of ODA activities, e.g. balance of payments support in Africa;

		<p>
<li>	a second aim to cover the development of human resources:  this would encompass the existing human development and status of women priority objectives in recognition of the close connections between education, health and population, and gender issues in much of ODA's work.  It would also be feasible to capture ODA's emergency aid work under this aim; and

		<p>
<li>	a third aim to focus on enhancing productive capacity and conservation of the environment, which would encompass the existing priority objective of the same title, which already includes ODA activities in a wide range of productive sectors, from agriculture to infrastructure, and much of the work under the existing environment objective.
</ul>
Both the existing direct poverty reduction and environment priority objectives are also captured - the latter implicitly - in the proposed statement of goal and purpose.  Direct poverty reduction should also feature as a focus for some of ODA's activities under any one of the revised aims.  

	<p>
<li>	These three aims cover activities directed to helping developing and transition countries achieve sustainable development by way of their internal policies and ODA-funded aid activities.  They do not capture the adoption of a wider role by ODA - recommended earlier - in influencing international economic systems and policies which affect these countries.  Nor do they bring out ODA's role in influencing multilateral institutions (and their member governments) that are relevant to sustainable development.  A fourth aim is required to cover this broader role.   

	<p>
<li>	Figure 1 below sets out the relationship between the recommended goal, purpose and aims.  It spells out the links between ODA's existing priority objectives and three of the four proposed aims.  




<h4>We recommend that ODA formally adopt four "aims":

-	to encourage sound development policies, efficient markets and good government;

-	to help people achieve better education, health and opportunity, particularly for women;

-	to enhance productive capacity and to conserve the environment; and

-	to promote international policies for sustainable development and to enhance the effectiveness of multilateral institutions.</h4>


	<p>
<li>	The existing priority objectives should henceforth be seen as more detailed perspectives on the first three proposed aims.  Financial input information on the existing priority objectives should continue therefore to be collected.  But the term "priority objectives" should be dropped in order to avoid confusion with the aims and lower-level operational objectives.  Financial input information should also be collected in relation to the fourth proposed aim.

<p>
<li>	These conclusions on ODA's goal, purpose and aims will require revision of the mission statement.  To understand how ODA's mission will be carried out, it is important to place it within the context of the organisation's culture and values.  ODA's values need to be agreed across the organisation.  

<h4>We recommend a revised mission statement on the lines of the preliminary draft in the box below be adopted.  There should be wide consultation within ODA on the inclusion of a list of values in the mission statement.  Further consideration should also be given to the best means for disseminating a revised mission statement internally and externally.</h4>

</ul>

<h2>PRELIMINARY DRAFT OF A NEW MISSION STATEMENT FOR ODA
</h2>
ODA's goal is to improve the quality of life and reduce poverty and suffering in poorer countries.
<p>

ODA's purpose is to promote sustainable development.
<p>

To achieve this, ODA's aims are:

<ul><li>to encourage sound development policies, efficient markets and good government;

<li>to help people achieve better education, health and opportunity, particularly for women; 

<li>to enhance productive capacity and to conserve the environment; and

<li>to promote international policies for sustainable development and to enhance the effectiveness of multilateral institutions.

<b>[To be added ... the core values which help make progress towards the aims]</b>

</ul>
<h2>ACHIEVING GREATER FOCUS ON ODA'S AIMS</h2>

9.	An organisation's overall performance should be judged in terms of its aims.  All organisations therefore strive to focus their effort on their aims.  ODA is no different, but we believe it could do more in this regard in terms of its organisation and strategic planning systems as set out below:-

<ul><li>Operational objectives are currently set and performance measured at many different levels.  There are objectives for staff, for departments and divisions.  There are also objectives for discrete aid activities (e.g. projects) and, above these, at the programme strategy level (e.g. for country, sector and research strategies).  Above this are ODA's aims (the term used henceforth to cover the existing priority objectives as well).  Performance is assessed at all these levels but aggregate measures that capture ODA's unique contribution become more difficult to define as one goes up the hierarchy.

	<p>
<li>	An elaborate system exists for measuring and monitoring performance within country programmes as shown in Figure 2 below.  The outcome of this process is used to compile the biennial progress report by the monitors of ODA's aims.  The first progress report was published recently and is recognised by ODA to be short of detail on the measurement of current impact and effectiveness with regard to the aims.  To this end, we endorse the actions ODA have in hand to improve the measurement of inputs, implementation effectiveness and impact.

	<p>
<li>	The progress report is compiled by monitors of the aims.  The monitors report on performance against the aims and may advocate more activity in their particular area;  but they have no clear role in decisions on the allocation of resources.

	<p>
<li>	To improve focus on the aims, a more active role by senior managers tasked to "promote" the aims is required.  This role would be facilitated by a reduction in the number of aims and an increase in the overall seniority of the managers concerned.  The latter would be responsible for stimulating new thinking and inter-disciplinary approaches required to achieve the aims.  This may be advanced more rapidly by a different organisation of ODA's professional advisers around the first three proposed aims.  The proposed fourth aim is covered by existing mechanisms. 
  
	<p>
<li>	Allocating ODA's resources by aim rather than by the current mix of bilateral country and non-country programmes and multilateral channels was also considered but rejected.  ODA's task is to match its aims with the development priorities of the recipients of British aid rather than force the latter into a strait-jacket.  The "top-down" emphasis on the aims and the "bottom-up" approach to planning aid activities should meet at the level of designing strategies for broad areas of ODA's work (e.g. country programmes).  Nevertheless, to achieve a stronger focus on the aims, the senior managers acting as their promoters would need to play a stronger role in the process of resource allocation.

<h4>We recommend that the proposed aims should have "promoters", senior managers who would combine monitoring, advocacy and resource allocation responsibilities.  They would replace the current monitors.  We also recommend that the ODA should consider organising its professional staff around the first three proposed aims.  Mechanisms exist for focusing on the proposed fourth aim, but ODA should consider how to strengthen them.</h4>


<h4>We also recommend ODA should continue to publish a progress report on performance against its aims.  Given the lengthy gestation of aid activity, this should be every three years (rather than two as at present), with the next progress report due in 1998.  </h4>

	
<li>	ODA operates a number of strategic planning cycles.  All the elements of a strategic planning process are in place.  But the elements should be linked more coherently and be designed to help ODA focus more on its aims. 

<h4>We recommend ODA develop a system that unifies its various strategic planning cycles into one which clearly links all the elements from discrete activities through business-level to corporate-level strategy.  The lynchpins of a unified process should be an annual ODA Corporate Strategy Paper and Business Plans.  The Corporate Strategy Paper would be produced by the centre in February on the basis of Business Plans drafted in September and finalised in February.  These documents would report on past performance as well as outlining objectives and resources required for the coming three financial years.</h4>


		Figure 3 below sets out the recommended unified strategic planning cycle.

	<p>
<li>	Business Plans would be drafted either at the divisional command level or, where aggregation of objectives at that level is inappropriate, at departmental level.  They would be based on the Personal Responsibility Plans of Under Secretaries and Chief Advisers, annual staff reports, departmental objectives, and various programme strategy papers, all of which would have to be completed or updated in the period between March and July.  Business Plans would need to cover:

		<ul><li>	performance against existing detailed objectives that are linked to ODA's aims;

		<p>
<li>	the detailed objectives and performance measures (linked to the aims) for the next three financial years;  and

		<p>
<li>	the programme and running costs budgets available and required to deliver the forward objectives.
</ul><p>

<li>	Business Plans would replace bids for programme resources.  The "Resource Allocation Round" (combining programme and running cost resources) would involve negotiations around Business Plans.  Over time, the use of Business Plans which link operational-level objectives to ODA's aims should provide useful information on whether a particular planned resource allocation pattern is more likely than another to maximise the organisation's contribution to the promotion of sustainable development.

	<p>
<li>	Once the Resource Allocation Round has been completed, Business Plans would need to be finalised alongside an ODA Corporate Strategy Paper which would be based on them.  The latter would replace a number of existing aid and management strategy papers (e.g. Aid Strategy Paper and Strategic Management Plan), but include the Efficiency Plan and the planned allocation of resources as annexes.  It would thereby aim to bring together the consideration of policies, programmes and management resources.  The Corporate Strategy Paper would cover:

		<ul><li>	reports of performance against objectives in the Business Plans;
		<li>	the priorities for the next three financial years (detailed for year 1, less so for the outer years);

		<li>	details of the objectives set out in Business Plans for the year ahead, including performance measures;  and

		<li>	the volume of programme and running cost resources to be deployed to deliver the forward objectives.

</ul><p>
The Corporate Strategy Paper would then be reflected in the Departmental Report published in March and feed back into the strategy papers, departmental objectives and PRPs for the following year.

	<p>
 <li>	The Corporate Strategy Paper would also provide much of the material for the progress report on performance against the aims.  It would therefore allow ODA to assess - either annually or at a minimum of every three years - whether ODA's purpose and aims remain appropriate.

	 <p>
<li>	Such a system needs to be tested to ensure that it is robust across all of ODA's commands and departments.  Among the primary requirements will be the development of a better central management information system related to Business Plan objectives and performance indicators.   ODA's Evaluation Department, with the help of the "promoters" of the aims, should become the experts on performance measurement for the organisation as a whole.

<h4>We therefore recommend piloting Business Plans in International Division and in a geographical, an advisory and a central command between now and February 1997.  The centre should attempt a mock-up of a Corporate Strategy Paper in February 1996.  Full implementation of the unified strategic planning system should be considered in early 1997 on the basis of the pilot.</h4>


	<li>	The pilot exercise will help generally to define a single purpose, objectives and performance measures for each Business Plan.  It will be important to include the senior managers promoting the aims, and Evaluation Department, in this exercise, and to ensure clear linkage between the aims and the Business Plans.  Responsibility for performance against the purpose and objectives in each Business Plan should also be made clear.  

<h4>We recommend each Business Plan should define a single purpose and a number of supporting objectives linked to the aims.  Given that the Business Plan would be the property of the highest management level at which aggregation in objective-setting and performance measurement is feasible, the sum of their purposes would equate to ODA's contribution to its purpose of promoting sustainable development.  Named senior managers should be responsible for the objectives of Business Plans.</h4>
</ul>

<h2>STRATEGIC CHOICES AND IMPROVING QUALITY IN COUNTRY PROGRAMMES</h2>

10.	We also considered other ways of enhancing ODA's performance.  In terms of country programmes, we reached the following conclusions:-

	<ul><li>	Compared with a few years ago, ODA is working in more countries  and undertaking more complex activities, while the resources available for such programmes have been shrinking and are expected to continue to decline.  Given this picture, it is hard to believe that ODA is, or can remain, a serious player in so many countries in terms of achieving developmental impact and enhancing UK influence.  A private firm in a similar position would react by focusing its efforts even more rapidly on its most profitable programmes.

<p>
<li>	Some progress has been made in increasing concentration.  The largest 20 recipients accounted for 69% of planned country programme expenditure in 1994/95, compared with 62% in 1989/90.  Under current plans, they will account for 73% of country programme expenditure in 1997/98.  This has been achieved in part by increasing the number of country programmes limited to small "British Partnership Schemes" (BPS) run by Heads of Mission, which maintain a visible UK aid relationship at low cost.

	<p>
<li>	The key decision criteria for achieving further concentration should be the relative need for aid, ODA's effectiveness (sufficient UK capacity to deliver development impact and influence others in the development community), and British national interest.  These criteria are reflected in the Resource Allocation Round.

	<p>
<li>	In terms of need, the development indicators are worst for sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.  These regions have lower life expectancy, higher infant mortality, lower access to primary education and higher adult illiteracy rates than others.

<p>	<li>
	As for implementation effectiveness, analyses completed in the 18 months to November 1994 suggest that 78% of projects in value terms are being satisfactorily or very satisfactorily implemented.  This compares to a figure of 63% as reported in the 1994 Departmental Report for projects completed in the previous period.  While differences between regions are not vast, the evidence suggests - not surprisingly - that project implementation is easier in higher-income regions.  

	 <p>
<li>	ODA's evaluation studies give some indication of development impact but this evidence needs to be approached with considerable caution:  it is based on a very small, non-random and time-bound sample and cannot therefore be taken as truly representative of the long-term effectiveness of country programmes as a whole.  Nevertheless, both in terms of the number of projects and their value, success ratings from these studies suggest a decline in the development impact of country programmes.  This is explained by ODA attempting to undertake more difficult projects in recent years, e.g. focused on institutional strengthening, most particularly in Africa.  (There are comparable indicators for other major aid donors to Africa, e.g. the World Bank, over this period.)  This apparent decline in portfolio quality should be corrected over time provided African governments adhere to strong economic reform programmes.

	<p>
<li>	In terms of wielding influence through the country programmes, ODA is relatively stronger in Africa and South Asia.  In Africa, in particular, ODA is perceived by recipient governments, other donors and the NGOs as a key player.  The best example of this influence is probably the Special Programme of Assistance for sub-Saharan Africa (SPA), under which the ODA has succeeded in pushing the donor agenda forward on foreign exchange liberalisation, the social dimensions of adjustment, public expenditure management and the concept of budgetary support.

	<p>
<li>	The analysis of need and effectiveness suggest that ODA's country programmes should focus in future even more on sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia.  And, given the historical significance of the changes in central and eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union (CEE/FSU), there are arguments for ODA's continued involvement in the region, albeit for a limited period and with the balance of effort shifting away from the relatively advanced Visegrad 4.  

<h4>We therefore recommend ODA should evolve graduation strategies for its bilateral country programme spending in south-east Asia, Latin America, the Caribbean (including Dependent Territories), the Pacific and the more advanced CEE/FSU countries with a view to achieving a target concentration ratio (e.g. 85% of planned country programme spending in 20 countries).  A worthwhile aid relationship with countries in these regions should be maintained through deployment of the British Partnership Scheme and through UK contributions channelled via multilateral organisations.  The savings that would be achieved by reducing the country programme effort in these regions should be redeployed in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where aid needs are greater.  This should be taken forward in future Resource Allocation Rounds.</h4>


	<li>	Concentrating country programmes on fewer recipients (by extending British Partnership Scheme-only status to many more) should help to raise the quality of bilateral aid by focusing the efforts of ODA staff.  But the quality of their inputs can be further enhanced by removing other constraints on ODA's effectiveness.

	 <p>
<li>	In this respect, we took a particularly close look at the country programming process which is, after all, the part of ODA's activities most directly under its control.  The heart of this is the Country Strategy Paper (CSP) for ODA's larger programmes.  The existing CSP process appears deficient in helping programme managers to reach considered judgements about ODA's niche.  CSPs would be more convincing in this respect if they analysed the environment in which ODA will operate, the resources and capabilities available to ODA, the choice of objectives linked to ODA's aims and appropriate performance measures, and the implementation process.  CSPs would be further strengthened if they took more account of non-ODA perspectives.

<h4>We recommend ODA should redesign the approach to CSPs so as to ensure that they identify ODA's niche more clearly, in particular in terms of its aims, the country requirements and activities of other donors (including multilateral agencies).  Programme managers should also be urged to adopt a strategy formulation process which includes the involvement of non-ODA expertise, including from the recipient country.  To allow for the extra time and effort required to develop CSPs, they should be produced every three years (instead of two as now).</h4>

</ul>
<h2>STRATEGIC CHOICES AND MANAGEMENT OF BILATERAL NON-COUNTRY PROGRAMMES</h2>

11.	The bilateral non-country programmes are very different from each other.  There is no single thread of issues common to them all as there is with the country programmes.  Therefore we analysed each in turn to see if there are ways in which ODA could enhance its effectiveness and reached the following conclusions:-

	<ul><li>	As with ODA's country programmes, the contribution of each non-country programme to the achievement of ODA's aims needs to be clear.

<h4>We therefore recommend that ODA should, for each non-country programme that it finances, produce a triennial Strategy Paper drawn up on the same lines as CSPs and subject to the same senior management and Ministerial scrutiny.  This should set out how ODA will use that channel to contribute to ODA's aims.</h4>


<li>	This should help to sharpen the focus of existing programmes on ODA's aims, and improve monitoring and evaluation against them.  Even quick-responding programmes like emergency aid, or collaborative schemes like the Joint Financing Scheme, can thus increase the effectiveness of their contribution.

 <p>
<li>	ODA provides a share of the British Council's Grant-in-Aid (the last survivor of this form of core funding).  The Grant-in-Aid covers Council standing capacity (offices and staff) and a number of small-scale activities in countries eligible for aid.  The Council receives from ODA as a contractor under country programmes more than twice as much as through the ODA Grant-in-Aid.  ODA's shareholder relationship with the Council through the Grant-in-Aid distorts the customer/contractor relationship under the country programmes.  We examined a range of options that might separate standing capacity from accountable activity, create a level playing field, and yet not lose the contribution which the Council can make to development.

<h4>We recommend that management responsibility for that part of the ODA's share of the British Council Grant-in-Aid which funds standing capacity be transferred to the DW.  The remaining element of ODA's share of the British Council Grant-in-Aid should be retained and converted into an accountable grant for agreed activities, with objectives related to ODA's aims.</h4>


	<li>	ODA funds three scholarship programmes through central allocations.  The British Chevening Scholarships - a jointly funded scheme with the Diplomatic Wing - are administered by the DW.  The Commonwealth Scholarship & Fellowship Programme (CSFP), enshrined in the 1980 Overseas Development and Co-operation Act, is managed by the Association of Commonwealth Universities on behalf of the Commonwealth Scholarship Commission:  ODA fund the UK awards to developing countries, and Britain provides more than half the awards in the scheme (Canada is the next largest donor).  The much smaller ODA Shared Scholarships Scheme is co-financed with British Universities.

	< p>
 <li>      	The amount of money spent on each scholarship scheme is determined centrally.  If these funds were to be distributed to country programmes, they would be put to the highest priority use in each country, in a country strategy that reflects ODA's aims.  This could include financing scholarships, for example through the Chevening and CSFP schemes.  The mechanisms of these two schemes would remain available, provided that there is a transition period to allow them to adjust to the different source of funding.  This would also take care of existing awards made under the central allocation.

<h4>We recommend that the central allocations for British Chevening Scholarships, the Commonwealth Scholarships and Fellowships Programme, and the Shared Scholarships Scheme be dissolved, and the funds allocated to country programmes.  For a transition period, some of these funds should be earmarked for the first two schemes.</h4>


<li>	Leading British Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) are development organisations with their own fields of comparative advantage.  ODA works with NGOs through country programmes, emergency aid, and the Joint Funding Scheme (JFS).  Most activities funded from country programmes follow from ODA's initiatives, in which NGOs are one of a range of possible contractors.   JFS co-finances projects proposed by NGOs.  Emergency aid falls somewhere between these two poles.

<p>
<li>	We concluded that ODA should regard its support for NGOs under the JFS as a contribution to a shared agenda, and wherever possible minimise ODA's interference in those aspects of development in which they are expert.  However, ODA needs to retain sufficient confidence in the key management systems of such organisations, together with agreements on the use of ODA funds and close enough audit involvement, to allow it to "certify" them as partners and thus take a more "hand-off" role.  In other cases, such as smaller NGOs, ODA can help to improve their activities through close co-operation in project assessment and financing.

<p>
<li>	While NGOs can often reach the poor more directly than government agencies, they are an inappropriate vehicle for policy dialogue and many recipient governments are sensitive about the extent of their role in official aid programmes.  This, together with the need for transparency in the choice of executing agents for country programme activities, means that aid through NGOs cannot substitute for government-to-government dialogue and openly tendered  projects.

<p>
<li>	Given the myriad and growing relationships between ODA and the NGO community, it would be helpful to take stock of the current position and the way it should evolve.
  
<h4>We recommend that more of ODA's co-financing of NGOs through the JFS should be on the basis of "certification" of NGOs' systems.  ODA should also examine, and if necessary update, its policy on working with NGOs.</h4>


	<li>	ODA's Technology Development and Research (TDR) programmes contribute both to the development of techniques relevant to the needs of people in developing countries and to the maintenance of British know-how in fields important to the aid programme as a whole.  They have substantial strategy documents, but their management systems vary widely.  They have until now been based on professional (essentially sectoral) allocations rather than on ODA's aims.  ODA would benefit from still closer co-ordination of research programmes to draw together the common threads (such as intellectual property rights) and to guide professionals (who will define TDR strategies and consider thematic choices for research) on best practice in the management of their research programmes.

<h4>We recommend that ODA's TDR programmes be reallocated to the promoters of the aims.  This will help to give greater emphasis to ODA's aims in the TDR programmes.  Consideration should also be given to new approaches to co-ordinating the management of TDR programmes.</h4>



	<li>	Since its guidelines were revised in 1993, Aid & Trade Provision (ATP) projects have been of similar quality to other bilateral aid.  The effectiveness of ATP would be further enhanced if it were more closely integrated into country programmes, allowing more efficient project selection and greater coherence.  This should not be at the expense of speed of response.  ATP also needs updated guidelines for companies applying for support.

<h4>We recommend that ATP be fully integrated into country programmes from 1996/97.  A joint DTI/ODA team should develop new guidelines for applicants, and market them to British industry.</h4>

</ul>
<h2>STRATEGIC CHOICES IN MULTILATERAL AID</h2>

12.	ODA's systems are very much geared to delivering an effective bilateral aid programme.  As multilateral aid will soon overtake bilateral aid under any assumptions about the total size of the Aid Budget, ODA recognises that a shift in its focus is required.  ODA will need to put more of its effort into improving the quality of multilateral aid, and exploiting opportunities (e.g. as provided through synergies with the bilateral aid programme) to use it to support UK priorities.  The task of the FER team was to gauge whether the changes in train go far enough and whether there is scope for the UK, acting with others, to make multilateral aid more effective.  We reached the following conclusions:-

	<ul><li>	The 1994 Multilateral Aid Review (MAR) sought to adapt ODA's operations and the deployment of its staff resources in response to the trend increase in multilateral aid.  As part of this shift, ODA has sought to give greater prominence to operational objectives which capture its managerial/stewardship role with regard to multilateral aid (e.g. by setting these out in the 1995 Departmental Report).  To achieve these objectives will require ODA to persuade other contributors and the multilateral institutions themselves to pursue the same ends.  It will also require a culture change within ODA that the MAR sought to promote, e.g. bilateral country programme managers will need to give greater attention to forging links with their EC counterparts and achieving some of our objectives through the EC.  

	<p>
<li>	We endorse the thrust of the MAR in this respect but believe ODA should take it further.  Three fundamental changes are required.  First, ODA should adopt a high-level aim which relates directly to its multilateral aid work.  The existing priority objectives are more clearly linked to bilateral aid.  The fourth aim recommended earlier will capture ODA's activities with regard to the multilateral development institutions.  Second, the relationships between ODA staff dealing with bilateral aid and those responsible for multilateral aid need to be strengthened at the strategic level in order to maximise the organisation's effectiveness in both parts of the aid programme.  And third, multilateral aid should be more explicitly subject to the same strategic disciplines as bilateral aid.

<h4>To help bring about the latter two changes, we recommend: 

-	International Division be formally involved in the formulation of ODA's bilateral CSPs;  and 

-	International Division should consult ODA geographical divisions, Treasury, Diplomatic Wing and - as recommended for CSPs - others outside Whitehall with relevant expertise as required in preparing strategies for the three main areas of multilateral aid (EC, the banks and funds, and the UN) for consideration every three years (one area per year).  These Multilateral Strategy Papers should be considered by the same senior management team that vets CSPs before submission to the ODA Minister.   </h4>


	<li>	EC aid programmes charged to ODA's budget can be split into the European Development Fund (EDF) and "budgetised" programmes.  ODA has some control over the size of its contributions to the EDF; it has very little over the budgetised programmes which are the fastest growing component of EC aid.  In terms of development impact, the EDF is broadly equivalent to the performance of an average bilateral donor but below that of UK bilateral aid.  The EC budgetised programmes are less effective.

	<p>
<li>	ODA's operational objectives for EC aid are:  to contribute to making EC aid as effective as possible;  to ensure maximum complementarity between EC aid and UK bilateral aid;  and to ensure that expenditure remains within agreed ceilings and addresses agreed priority areas.  ODA has generally succeeded in ensuring that the EC's formal statements of development policy are in line with the UK's own aid strategy.  But the ability of ODA (and other like-minded member states) to influence the management and operations of the Community is generally much weaker.  And ODA has been relatively unsuccessful in holding down and prioritising expenditures under the EC budget.  Nevertheless, the operational objectives remain appropriate and ODA should continue to seek new means for achieving them.

	<p>
<li>	The World Bank Group of institutions is at the centre of the global development effort.  ODA's main contribution to the Group covers replenishments of the International Development Association (IDA), the body that provides concessional credits to the poorest countries.  ODA also contributes the UK's share of capital subscribed by member governments to back the borrowings of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), which lends at market rates to creditworthy member governments, and the International Finance Corporation (IFC), which lends directly to the private sector.  ODA also contributes to the interest subsidy account for the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) from which the poorest countries may borrow on concessional terms.

	<p>
<li>	There is a high degree of congruence between Bank and Fund objectives and ODA's aims.  This, and professional links developed through the bilateral programme, allows ODA to wield considerable influence in the Bank, e.g. through the SPA mechanism.  ODA wields much less influence on the IMF although there is increasing direct contact on countries where the UK is perceived to be a leading player.  ODA's operational objectives for the Bank Group are:  to promote UK interests as a shareholder effectively;  and working closely with like-minded shareholders, to help maintain the Bank as an efficient and effective institution contributing to international economic development.

	<p>
<li>	Given the relative effectiveness of the Bank Group, these do not include the search for reductions in ODA's financial contributions. Whether the UK maintains the same share of IDA XI (which is currently being negotiated) as for IDA X will depend essentially on the total size of the new replenishment, which in turn will depend on the position taken by the USA.  But ODA should certainly question the need for future IBRD general capital increases given the flow of private capital to creditworthy developing countries, although this issue is unlikely to feature on the international agenda for the foreseeable future.

	<p>
<li>	ODA also covers HMG's capital subscriptions and soft fund contributions to the regional development banks.  The objectives of these institutions are in line with ODA's aims but their effectiveness varies greatly.  The influence that ODA can exert in the regional banks is limited by the level of our shareholdings.  But ODA should question, with other like-minded members, whether the efforts of the World Bank and the regional banks should be rationalised and focused more on the poorer countries and - for a period - the countries in transition.  With this in mind, ODA should question the need for general capital increases for the regional banks.  Similarly, it would be right for ODA to uphold the key role of IDA in channelling soft multilateral funds to the poorest countries and take a restrictive line in future replenishments of other concessional funds.  If successful, this approach might put off or minimise general capital increases and replenishments of the soft funds of the regional banks and push them towards focusing, in particular in middle-income Latin America and Asia, on providing technical assistance rather than capital to their members.

	<p>
<li>	UN development organisations to which ODA contributes financially can be divided into two categories:  those to which the UK makes a voluntary payment and those to which the contribution is assessed as a consequence of membership.  In general, the objectives of the UN agencies match ODA's aims, but with a greater focus on human resource development concerns.  The agencies are of widely varying quality in terms of developmental effectiveness and managerial efficiency.  Moreover, there is a considerable degree of overlap in their activities and some perform tasks similar to those handled by the World Bank Group and the regional banks.

	<p>
<li>	In this light, ODA's broad operational objective for the UN agencies - "to improve the effectiveness of UN agencies in meeting their development objectives through management reform" - is clearly appropriate.  But ODA's influence and hence its ability to meet this objective is constrained - as it is for other OECD states - by the combined voice of the developing countries, which do not always share the same objectives.  Nevertheless, ODA has, together with some other OECD countries, made headway in promoting reform in a number of the UN agencies.  ODA plans to review in late 1996 the case for further actions.

	<p>
<li>	In the meantime, ODA should continue to pursue the reform agenda.  It should also consider as part of the 1996 review whether the UN development system would not be more effective through consolidation of UN technical assistance functions, rationalisation of the work on emergencies, and whether some organisations could be either slimmed down or abolished.  ODA should also seek, together with other countries, to have the Secretary General require tighter coordination of all UN agencies.

<h4>Our suggestions above for ODA actions in each of the main areas of multilateral aid are broadly in line with existing policy.  They also endorse the recommendations on international institutions emanating from the recent G7 Summit at Halifax, an opportunity which ODA should vigorously exploit.  Some savings may result over time and, if so, should be redeployed to higher priority uses in the aid programme.</h4>

</ul>
<h2>IMPROVING MANAGEMENT</h2>

13.	We also considered ways in which the management of the aid programme could be improved to enhance ODA's effectiveness.  We reached the following conclusions:-

	<ul><li>	ODA's management style has evolved pragmatically.  It has responded to a variety of circumstances around the world;  fashioned different approaches for its various types of business;  and found ways of collaborating successfully with the Diplomatic Wing of the Foreign Office in both traditional and novel areas.  

	<p >
<li>	This has bred a diversity of systems.  Best practice has been encouraged to fit particular circumstances.  There has been a trend towards stationing more staff and their work overseas, nearer to the processes they are attempting to influence;  research strategies have been honed gradually to a sharper focus on impact;  and new and more effective ways of influencing multilateral institutions have been employed, for example by sharing our reform objectives openly with their management and by seconding experts on aid management to work within their organisations. 

	<p>
<li>	ODA has been diligent in assessing the evidence for new management structures, but objective evidence on effectiveness is often unavailable.  It would be desirable to supplement intuitive judgements with more concrete information where this is possible.

<h4>We recommend ODA should find ways of measuring the relative effectiveness and efficiency of its different models of country aid management.  The current study of the relative costs of managing know-how and technical co-operation, drawing on the experience of the Know-How Fund, should be extended to all forms of aid.  The costs to be measured should not be restricted to the running costs of ODA but should include the costs to the aid programme of managing aid transactions in recipient countries.</h4>


	<li>	As patterns of aid change, ODA should be alert to the need to adjust management arrangements.  This will be the case, for example, where country programmes evolve, albeit slowly, through their graduation strategies.  And incremental changes should be supplemented by an overview from time to time.  A number of commentators inside and outside ODA have pointed to some areas requiring attention now.

<h4>We recommend that the future of the Development Division in the Caribbean (BDDC) should be reviewed within two years, as the unit cost of administering its small programmes is high and is likely to increase with declining aid volumes.  Decisions about new management arrangements in Asia should take account of the earlier recommendation on graduation of much of South-East Asia from ODA's country programmes.</h4>


	<li>	A willingness to tolerate diversity has been associated with a willingness to delegate.  The approval of aid commitments is delegated on a graduated basis, relating the amount to staff grades.  Running cost budgets are delegated to divisions and departments.  Posts are advertised and line managers select staff. 

	<p>
 <li>	Delegation has been accompanied by decentralisation from headquarters to overseas offices.  Rigorous reviews have been conducted to ensure that there is no duplication between headquarters and overseas.  This has been implemented fully except where it created problems of coordination for the Diplomatic Wing.  Decentralisation has been restricted largely to country aid.  We have looked at the scope for delegating more to our offices in multilateral organisations.  In most cases, it is not practical because they are shared offices.  However, there is scope for doing so with our office in the World Bank.  

<h4>We recommend delegating greater authority to the Executive Director and his ODA staff in the UK Delegation to the World Bank in Washington in order to increase effectiveness and efficiency.  This depends, however, on agreement on  the nature of that delegation, full accountability and adequate reporting lines.</h4>


	<li>	ODA guides decision-making processes by rules and advice but allows a fair measure of discretion in implementation.  A current Efficiency Scrutiny suggests that this discretion is exercised with an unexpected degree of variation.  In these circumstances, rules are not a good way of ensuring adequate management standards. At the same time, some line managers feel that the rules do not give adequate recognition of their need to tailor their approach to their specific circumstances.

<h4>We recommend that the Efficiency Scrutiny on delegated authority should examine whether written agreements with managers on tasks and procedures could be an effective alternative to codes of rules. </h4>


<li>	Those who work for ODA need to enhance their skills if they are to respond to the increasing complexity of aid and the demands for more accountability.  To this end, we recommend career anchors for administrators and targeted action for contract staff.  ODA is revising its training strategy to match key competences.  Its Personnel Policy Statement identified the need to create a staff 'margin' to accommodate more training and more effective hand-overs of posts.

<h4>We recommend that ODA finds the resources to enhance the skills of those who work on the aid programme.</h4>


	<li>	ODA has a number of formal and ad hoc management consultancy services addressing its own organisational needs.  The effectiveness of these services varies considerably.  There are also overlaps between audit functions and these services.

<h4>We recommend the re-organisation of ODA's internal management consultancy services into a single unit and a rationalisation of their role in relation to audit.</h4>
</ul>

<h2>IMPROVING EFFICIENCY</h2>

14.	We have considered the techniques which ODA has used to achieve value for money and the scope for further economies.  We have reached the following conclusions:-
	<ul><li>	ODA has been successful in improving its efficiency.  One measure is the movement in staff numbers.  These have declined by 30% since 1979 in both ODA headquarters and in its agency, the Natural Resources Institute.  This compares with a reduction of 4.5% in the real value of total aid.  At the same time, the number of aid recipients has increased and our widening knowledge of development processes has made aid management more complex: there is more emphasis on policy dialogue, support with small packages of know-how and working on an inter-disciplinary basis.

	<p>
<li>	Economies have been achieved by the process of delegation and by rigorous reviews to avoid duplication.  In recent years, ODA has run the most extensive market testing programme in Whitehall.  50% of ODA posts will be covered; average cash-releasing savings have been 20%, with 30% savings in posts. 

	 <p>
 <li>	NRI has conducted its own FER, which was reported in 'NRI 2000'.  This will yield substantial running cost savings, but add some tasks in ODA headquarters if NRI is privatised.

	 <p>
 <li>	In future, economies will be more difficult to achieve. Even so, ODA must live within a running cost budget which will have been frozen for four years by 1997/98. 

<h4>In order to achieve the 17% efficiency gains over four years implied by our running cost ceilings, ODA will need to adopt a variety of techniques in future.  New approaches should include benchmarking, process re-engineering, and the application of private financing.</h4>


	<li>	Substantial savings should be achievable from accommodation when our 94 Victoria Street office lease expires in 2000.  At current market rates, this should be in excess of £4 million if we move to new premises in London.

	<p>
<li>	We have also looked at how ODA could save 10% on its running costs as a special case.  To achieve this over and above present plans would require a sharp reduction in the number of aid recipients (as recommended earlier) and a narrowing in the range of activities, such as education and population, which ODA supports.  It may also require a reversion to fewer, larger infrastructure projects.  
</ul>
<h2>IMPROVING INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h2>

15.	The development of information systems (IS) is a vital enabling mechanism for implementing the improvements in effectiveness and efficiency recommended in this review.  We have therefore examined the management of the IS function in depth.  Our conclusions are:-

<ul><li>	ODA IS has been unusually successful in Whitehall and has made important contributions on telecommunications and management information.   In future, changes in hardware and software, such as the switch to "open systems" and Windows software for personal computers, will make it possible to respond more quickly and cheaply to user requirements while also making it easier for users to present data in ways they find most useful.  This will help reduce the backlog of user requests and so improve efficiency. 

<li>	A fundamental look was last taken in 1989 at the underlying information requirements which IS should be serving. Those created by resource accounting are already being considered.  But there may be other new requirements yet to be taken into account.

<h4>We recommend a full examination of information requirements and flows to which IS might be relevant. </h4>


<li>	Best practice elsewhere places a strong emphasis on user involvement and responsibility. At present, IS development and operations tends to be highly centralized. This is in part because most users are ill-equipped to play the intelligent client or owner role.  It is important to break what can become a vicious circle.

<h4>We recommend a four-step process to ensure user involvement:

<ul><li>	a programme of user training with a particular focus on senior managers; 

<li>	the creation of a user service brigaded to user divisions; 

<li>	delegating budgets and responsibility for systems to users;  and

<li>	new management systems for approving strategies and spending. 
</ul>
We also recommend that, as information systems development is not part of ODA's core business, large projects should be contracted out or staff contracted in.  </h4>

</ul>
<h2>ANNEX</h2>

<h3 align=center>ODA FUNDAMENTAL EXPENDITURE
AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT REVIEWS
<p>

TERMS OF REFERENCE</h3>


The Foreign Secretary and the Chief Secretary have agreed that ODA will undertake a Fundamental Expenditure Review and a Senior Management Review.  These will take account of the policy framework established by Ministers in January 1995, and are being conducted as part of the action covering areas considered in the Civil Service White Paper Continuity and Change.


<h3 align=center>FUNDAMENTAL EXPENDITURE REVIEW</h3>

1.	The ODA Fundamental Expenditure Review (FER) will examine:

	<ul><li>the role of aid and what this means for ODA's objectives;

	<li>the resources required and available to carry out that purpose, and ODA's inescapable commitments;

	<li>the effectiveness of the channels, forms and systems for achieving that purpose and the scope for the redeployment of resources within the aid programme;  and

	<li>the efficiency and economy with which the ODA manages its activities.
</ul>

<h4>A)	The Purpose of ODA's activities</h4>


2.	The FER will, under this heading, consider the broad rationale for ODA's activities.  It will go on to examine ODA's mission statement and the objectives of the aid programme and form judgements as to their appropriateness.  


<h4>B)	Programme Resources</h4>


3.	The FER will focus on the Aid Budget sub-programme and, within that, on programme resources (as running costs are covered in Section E).  The FER will examine the demand for grant aid resources and trends in resource transfers by other donors as well as the UK.  It will also take account of the overall foreign policy framework set by Ministers and internationally-agreed targets on aid levels.  In this context and on the basis of a projection of possible aid levels over the next ten years, the FER will consider the case for continuing British official aid, including the balance between bilateral and multilateral aid.


<h4>C)	Channels, Forms, and Effectiveness</h4>


4.	In the light of the Government's objectives for using the aid programme and the prospective resources position, the FER will consider:

<ul><li>	the effectiveness in terms of developmental impact of the main bilateral and multilateral channels, including linkages between them, for UK aid delivery (drawing on the views of recipients, of suppliers, and of other Whitehall Departments, as well as interviews with ODA staff);

<li>	the forms of aid available within those channels;

	<li>	the role and effectiveness of the ODA in advocating Government policies in bilateral and multilateral aid fora;

	<li>	how constraints to greater effectiveness - in terms of developmental impact and the ODA's advocacy role - might be addressed.
</ul>
The FER will go on to assess the case for changes in channels and forms of aid or in their relative weight;  and whether policies should be adjusted in ways which might help better to achieve the objectives of the aid programme.


<h4>D)	Aid Management Systems and Organisational Culture</h4>


5.	In the light of the conclusions of Sections A to C, the FER will examine existing ODA management systems and culture.  This will define the tasks involved in aid management and administration, including the advocacy of ODA's objectives, bilaterally and multilaterally.  It will include examination of:

<ul><li>	central service/policy and programme spending functions;

<li>	perceptions of ODA's organisational culture, including the results of a sample survey;

	<li>	the effectiveness of the systems in place in ODA for achieving the Government's objectives for the aid programme, including value for money; and

<li>	whether ODA's systems should be redesigned in ways which might help better to achieve the objectives of the aid programme.
</ul>

<h4>E)	Running Cost Resources </h4>


6.	In the light of Sections A to D, the FER will consider:

<ul><li>	the running costs available to ODA, prospects for the future, and ODA's continuing ability to deliver a high-quality aid programme; 

	<li>	the relative administrative/management costs of the various channels and forms of aid available to ODA; and

<li>	the relationship between the deployment of administrative costs and of programme resources.

</ul>
7.	The FER will also examine the deployment, development and training of staff and the use of other resources to meet changing requirements.  The recommendations of the FER will inform the ODA Senior Management Review.


<h3>SENIOR MANAGEMENT REVIEW</h3>

<h4>A)	Objectives</h4>


8.	To ensure that the senior management of the ODA is organised in such a way that the Minister for Overseas Development and the Secretary of State receive the best possible advice on policy development; on the handling of international negotiations; and on their Parliamentary and other domestic responsibilities.

 <p>

9.	To ensure that ODA policies can be effectively implemented in the light of the Fundamental Expenditure Review; and that the services for which ODA is responsible can be effectively and efficiently delivered.

<p>

10.	To match the needs of the work with the most effective and efficient management structure, with clear lines of responsibility and accountability, taking account of the requirements and priorities of Ministers, and the performance of statutory duties and the demand for services from Parliament and the public.

<p>

11.	To consider whether it would be practicable to reduce layers of management and increase management spans where appropriate, based on a clear understanding of the added value of each level of management.





<h4>B)	Scope</h4>


12.	The Review will cover all posts at Head of Department level and above, including those currently graded at G6 level.  It will include posts based overseas as well as in the UK.  It will also cover the professional and advisory cadres as well as administrative posts.  The reviewers should take account of the Fundamental Expenditure Review and previous reviews which have affected ODA's senior management structure - in particular the 1992 Review of Aid Management Overseas and the 1994 reviews of Africa Division and the proposed AidÊManagement Office in Delhi.  They should also take account of the 1993 reviews of Bilateral Aid and Multilateral Aid.  They should look forward to, but not anticipate the results of, the work on delegated pay and grading to be undertaken over 1995-96.


<h3>FER AND SMR ORGANISATION, CONSULTATION AND TIMETABLE</h3>

13.	The FER and SMR will be conducted sequentially, but with some overlap, with the FER coming first.  Maximum use will be made of existing work, including recent reviews, but their conclusions will be examined to see whether they stand up in the context of the FER and SMR.  The main source of new data will be extensive interviews, in the UK (London and East Kilbride) and with overseas-based staff, as well as meetings with staff to encourage them to contribute their views, and interviews to gain the views of outsiders, including other Government Departments who have an interest in ODA's work. 

<p>

14.	The FER will be carried out by MrÊChakrabarti, Mr Wilson and Dr Rundell.  The SMR will be carried out by Mr Wilson, who will be assisted by a senior member of the Management Review Staff (MRS) in assessing job structure and weights, including through the use of JESP, and who will also have a budget to draw in outside consultancy advice as required.  Mr Manning (PFO) and Mr Freeman (PEO) will be responsible for day-to-day management of the FER.  And Mr Freeman (PEO) will have the day-to-day management responsibility for the SMR.

<p>

15.	A Steering Committee, chaired by MrÊVereker, will guide the work of both the FER and the SMR.  This will comprise MrÊAinscow, the PEO, the PFO, an ODA geographical Under Secretary, a Chief Adviser, a representative of HM Treasury and OPSS and a private sector representative.  It will consider emerging conclusions and approve a draft report.  The Steering Committee will keep the Secretary of State and Lady Chalker informed of progress, and the Chairman will report on progress to Lady Chalker regularly.  Mr Vereker will submit a final draft report to Ministers.
<p>


16.	The Aid Policy and Management Group will be consulted at intervals throughout the process, as will a Focus Group established in connection with the Strategic Management Plan.  The ToRs will be communicated to the Departmental Trade Union Side (DTUS) and to staff.  The DTUS will be kept informed of progress.

<p>

17.	The intention is that the broad timetable will be as set out below; the Steering Committee will keep this under review as the work proceeds:

<ul>	<h4>January-February 1995</h4>

Agreement on TORs, membership of the SteeringÊGroup and appointment of reviewers.  

<h4>By mid-July 1995</h4>

Completion of FER.

<h4>By end-July 1995</h4>

Completion of SMR.

Revision of proposals, submission to Ministers and decisions on outcome of Reviews.

<HR>
<BR>
<P>
A la demande du pr&eacute;sident de la R&eacute;publique fran&ccedil;aise,
le prochain sommet des sept pays les plus industrialis&eacute;s
(G7) abordera la question de l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement,
&agrave; l'issue de ses travaux. A la veille de cette rencontre,
comment notre pays se situe-t-il par rapport &agrave; ses partenaires
occidentaux ? Comment s'articule notre dispositif de coop&eacute;ration
?
<P>
<H3>Une aide en augmentation</H3>
<P>
En 1994, la France a consacr&eacute; 47 milliards de francs &agrave;
l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement, soit 0,64% de son produit
int&eacute;rieur brut, se situant ainsi -pour ce qui est du rapport
APD/PIB- en t&ecirc;te des sept pays du G7, et au cinqui&egrave;me
rang des Etats membres du Comit&eacute; d'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
(CAD) de l'OCDE. En augmentation depuis cinq ans, cette aide se
rapproche de l'objectif fix&eacute; il y a plus de dix ans par
les Nations unies, qui &eacute;tait de consacrer au moins 0,7%
du PIB &agrave; l'APD.
<P>
Parmi les principaux pays industrialis&eacute;s, le Japon, la
France et le Royaume-Uni sont les seuls &agrave; avoir accru leur
APD en 1994, les Etats-Unis, le Canada, l'Allemagne et l'Italie
l'ayant sensiblement r&eacute;duite. Les ressources sont r&eacute;parties
ainsi : 78% des versements de l'APD fran&ccedil;aise sont all&eacute;s
&agrave; la coop&eacute;ration  bilat&eacute;rale, l'Afrique sub-saharienne
restant la premi&egrave;re b&eacute;n&eacute;ficiaire (plus de
47% de l'aide bilat&eacute;rale), loin devant l'Am&eacute;rique,
l'Asie et l'Afrique du Nord. Le reste des versements transite
par des organismes internationaux, essentiellement le Fonds europ&eacute;en
de d&eacute;veloppement (pr&egrave;s de la moiti&eacute; de l'aide
multilat&eacute;rale) et la Banque mondiale.
<P>
<H3>D'o&ugrave; viennent les fonds ?</H3>
<P>
Le minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration g&egrave;re environ
12% de l'APD (ce ratio est en baisse depuis plusieurs ann&eacute;es).
Pr&egrave;s de 49% de l'aide publique transite par le minist&egrave;re
de l'Economie et des Finances, qui intervient sous forme de contribution
aux institutions multilat&eacute;rales, de pr&ecirc;ts et dons
du Tr&eacute;sor, de consolidation ou d'annulation de dettes,
de soutien aux ajustements structurels. 
<P>
La Caisse fran&ccedil;aise de d&eacute;veloppement (CFD), institution
financi&egrave;re sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e, est plac&eacute;e
sous la double tutelle du minist&egrave;re de la Coop&eacute;ration
et du minist&egrave;re de l'Economie et des Finances. Elle intervient
&eacute;galement dans le dispositif d'aide en accordant notamment
des subventions et des pr&ecirc;ts &agrave; long terme pour des
projets d'investissement productif.
<P>
Les autres apports publics fran&ccedil;ais proviennent de minist&egrave;res
conduisant des programmes de coop&eacute;ration technique (Affaires
&eacute;trang&egrave;res, DOM-TOM, Sant&eacute;, Education nationale,
Agriculture, Recherche...).
<P>
<H3>Un mot-cl&eacute; : la coordination</H3>
<P>
La r&eacute;forme de l'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement intervenue
au premier trimestre 1996 avait pour objectif de rendre l'aide
plus transparente, de la simplifier et de mieux coordonner l'action
des diff&eacute;rentes instances gouvernementales. Le renforcement
de la coordination interminist&eacute;rielle en mati&egrave;re
d'aide publique au d&eacute;veloppement, sur les aspects bi et
multilat&eacute;raux, passera par la r&eacute;union r&eacute;guli&egrave;re
d'un Comit&eacute; interminist&eacute;riel de l'aide au d&eacute;veloppement
(CIAD). La direction en sera assur&eacute;e par le Premier ministre
et le secr&eacute;tariat g&eacute;n&eacute;ral par le ministre
des Affaires &eacute;trang&egrave;res et le ministre d&eacute;l&eacute;gu&eacute;
&agrave; la Coop&eacute;ration.
<P>
Cette r&eacute;forme du syst&egrave;me fran&ccedil;ais de coop&eacute;ration
s'inscrit elle-m&ecirc;me dans un effort de coordination et de
compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; des politiques d'aide au niveau
europ&eacute;en et au sein des instances internationales.

<p>
<h3>Food Security -- A Regional Issue</h3>
<p>
Ensuring that all people have access at all times to enough food for a healthy and active life is a
preoccupation of governments, international organisations, non-government organisations, and
researchers in West Africa. Notwithstanding all this effort, analysis in West Africa shows that the
underlying trends in permanent local food availability and access are deteriorating, or at best
stagnating, in most countries. Decisive action over time by practitioners and policy makers is needed
to improve the situation.
<p>
In the short term, day-to-day management of the food system requires production, storage, and
market information, effective instruments for food procurement and distribution, and ways to deal
with shortages and surpluses when and if they occur. In the medium term, structural adjustment,
the changing role of government, the involvement of the civil society, and issues of sustainable food
production and income generation are central policy issues. None of these issues can be dealt with
adequately by individual countries -- food security in West Africa is a regional issue that needs
cooperation and coordination among countries to be effective (Egg and Igu&#233;, 1993). In other
words, it is a national problem that is best dealt with in a regional context.
<p>
A review of the lessons from past work on food policy management shows that issues of
institutional capacity have often been overlooked (ECDPM, 1989). At the national and sub-national
levels for example, the nature of food security policy management requires inter-ministerial and inter-
sectoral coordination mechanisms to resolve potential institutional conflicts and differences in
approaches and priorities. However, these mechanisms hardly exist, and if they do, they have
limited capacity to become effective (World Bank, 1986).
<p>
Coordination within a country is not the only institutional problem. Regular communication and
consultation at the regional and sub-regional levels are also needed to formulate regional policies,
and to prepare the decisions at the national level that are necessary to implement them.
Communication among policy makers and between them and members of civil society and the
private sector can be a problem; the apparent gap in understanding between researchers and policy
makers further hampers the formulation of policies based on the best available data and expertise.
<p>
Consultation, coordination, and communication are important policy management tasks for which
enhanced capacity is required if institutions are to operate effectively. However, in the present
environment of structural adjustment in which institutional reforms are taking place, and in which
a new role for government is emerging, increasing pressures are being placed on the management
capacity of these institutions. Faced with these pressures, institutional developments that make
better use of existing capacities are needed to help reverse the decline in food security.
<p>
Critical in this process are mechanisms for policy makers and researchers to collaborate and
communicate on food security problems that require both of their efforts. The mechanisms are
necessary both at the national level where dialogue and complementarity is most needed, and
between countries in a region where synergy is attainable.
<p>

<h3>Linking Policy Makers and Researchers</h3>
<p>
In the past, there have been many attempts to disseminate research results to national and regional
policy makers, largely through mixed meetings of inter-governmental organisations, policy makers,
donor representatives, and researchers. However, few changes in policies seem to have been the
result of these meetings. There still remaines a wide gap between the researchers and the
bureaucrats, largely as a the result of the poor communication between them, and differences in
organisational culture. Attempts at dialogue often tend to become confrontations in which neither
side achieves its aims.
<p>
Given this problem, ECDPM and its partners in West Africa are looking for effective ways to bring
policy makers and researchers together to discuss common food security concerns. Their response
has been to create a regional network on food security in West Africa -- the SADAOC network.
ECDPM manages, administers, and facilitates the overall SADAOC programme and, as part of the
programme, it also manages a programme on food policy management in the central sub-region of
West Africa that involves mainly policy makers from Burkina Faso, C&#244;te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Mali,
and Togo.
<p>

<h3><center>The SADAOC Network</center></h3>
<p>
The SADAOC network (S&#233;curit&#233; Alimentaire Durable en Afrique de l'Ouest Centrale)
is a multidisciplinary alliance of research institutes, universities and government institutions working
on food security issues in West Africa. The aim of the network is to bring researchers and policy
makers together to jointly address food security issues. Its objectives are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>to enhance national capacity for policy-relevant research on food security issues;
<li>to involve researchers and policy makers in a dialogue that improves food security policy formulation;
<li>to enhance regional cooperation through collaborative research on food security policy, and by regular mutual consultation;
<li>to produce high-quality research results that can be used in policy making.
</ul>
<p>
<h3>A Sub-Regional Network on Food Policy Management</h3>
<p>
Contrary to other purely research programmes of SADAOC, the Food Policy Management (FPM)
programme is not research based. It works with policy makers to bridge the gap between
researchers and policy makers. It enhances national policy consultation processes in each of the
countries; it initiates institutional development for policy management at the sub-regional level; it
promotes sub-regional consultation among policy makers, and between policy makers and
researchers; and it aims to focus greater attention to institutional provisions at national and regional
levels.
<p>
The FPM programme envisaged two main activities. The first was to enhance the process of
consultation between policy makers and the different research networks in the countries of the
central sub-region of West Africa. The second was to develop a small network of government
officials interested in food security in each of the five countries of the central sub-region. The
approach used to achieve these objectives is process and institution oriented, focusing more on the
process of policy formulation and implementation, than on policy content.
<p>
This paper builds on the experience of this network to illustrate how a bottom-up approach can be
effective in strengthening regional cooperation in the field of food security. In this case, the bottom-
up approach is based on networks at the national level that have linkages with other national
networks in the sub-region; and joint participation by national researchers and policy makers in
regional research activities and discussions. Regional cooperation in this programme is seen by the
participants as a way to reinforce national efforts aimed at solving local problems. The following
section outlines the process used by network participants to determine national and sub-regional
food security priorities, without at the same time investing in costly and often top-heavy supra-
national institutions or structures.
<p>

<h3>Setting Sub-regional Priorities for Research on Food Security</h3>
<p>
The activities and processes used in the central countries drew on past experience of ECDPM, the
Club du Sahel, and national collaborators in the western countries of the region (ECDPM, 1991). 
<p>
The first activity of the programme concerned the participants in the five national networks. These
are high-level civil servants; a typical FPM team has members drawn from several institutions and
ministries (such as agriculture, trade, or finance) that are involved in food policy management. Since
the participants are normally designated by their ministers, the teams form what are in effect inter-
ministerial delegations that represent institutional viewpoints as well as their own personal
experiences. The CILSS was invited to designate a representative as an associate member to each
of the national teams, thus providing a link to a major regional organisation involved in agriculture
in the Sahel.
<p>
The first task of each team was to prepare a preliminary "baseline" paper on the food security
situation, associated policies, and institutional provisions for food security in each country. The
papers covered the institutional framework for food policy management at the different levels
(central and local government, private sector, civil society, universities, and research) and reviewed
policy questions that needed to be discussed with neighbouring countries. Two major issues
addressed by each team were the impact of customs regulations on cereal trade in the region, and
the basic information that was required in the formulation of national food policies that take into
account the influence of external factors from neighbouring countries. The teams also presented
their views on food security policy priorities at the national and regional levels.
<p>
These preliminary national papers were reviewed at a sub-regional workshop held in Ghana in
October 1992. They were used to identify an agenda for discussion and future action by the
national teams in the sub-region. On the basis of these priorities, the national teams returned to their
countries to take a more in-depth look at some of the problems discussed in the Ghana meeting.
Revised versions of the baseline papers were produced by each team, and they, together with a
synthesis report, formed the basis for discussion at a second sub-regional workshop held in Burkina
Faso in September 1993. The second workshop aimed to have more detailed discussions on the
priority issues and once more to refine the action programme for the national level. There were four
main outputs from this meeting.
<p>
First, the networks began a process of decentralisation and devolution in which the national
networks became more independent in their administration and management, and they took
responsibility for chairing the overall network.
<p>
Second, the participants identified access to information and data as a crucial input to their
activities. They could hardly decide on priorities and evaluate specific activities in the absence of
reliable information about the situation in each country, and for the region as a whole. They decided
that they themselves were often the people best placed to locate and share this information and,
as a result, the national networks are now working to define the categories of information that they
need, and how they can best get access to it. As part of this process, they are testing a matrix
approach in which common data is collected in each of the five countries for maize production,
consumption, and use. The methodology will be reviewed and adapted if necessary at a meeting
in C&#244;te d'Ivoire in March 1994.
<p>
Third, and this follows from the need to exchange information, participants agreed to investigate
the possibility that individuals could undertake study missions to other networks in an effort to
benefit more directly from their experience.
<p>
Fourth, since the conclusions reached at the meeting would affect policies in the participating
countries, a series of national workshops were to be organised in each country. By consulting more
widely with national colleagues, and especially with representatives of the private sector, the
national teams aimed to generate support and consensus for their activities among the wider
national communities. So far, these national consultations have been held in Burkina Faso,
C&#244;te d'Ivoire, Ghana, and Mali.
<p>
The process outlined above is based on a series of discussions and consultations that have involved
a relatively small number of policy makers in each of the five participating countries. The aim has
been to achieve consensus on food security policy options and directions (through review and
debate), and then to identify practical sub-regional or regional measures to improve the situation,
at both the national and regional levels.
<p>
To ensure that regional and national priorities were compatible, the country teams had extensive
discussions at sub-regional workshops, and they used this experience to re-evaluate and re-assess
national policy priorities. In this iterative process, national priorities first determined the scope of
regional programmes; the preliminary regional priorities in turn were used to re-define national
activities; and in the final step, the re-defined national priorities are to be fed back into another
round of regional priority-setting. The end result will be:
<p>
<ul>
<li>regional priorities that have been developed from practical national needs;
<p>
<li>national priorities that reflect national needs as well as what is happening in neighbouring
countries;
<p>
<li>an established consultation process used by policy makers and researchers to review and
define their activities.
</ul>
<p>

<h3>Is Bottom-up Regional Cooperation Feasible?</h3>
<p>
What has the programme achieved so far? At the national level, progress has been made in
enhancing the policy consultation process. Inter-ministerial teams have been formed and through
regular meetings national coordination has been strengthened. In each country, a small network of
government officials involved in food security has been formed. These networks are the basis for
national information-exchange on short-term policies and plans. As participants become more
familiar with each other and discover common areas of interest, the contacts are becoming more
institutionalised; perhaps this is the most interesting achievement of the programme.
<p>
At the regional level, the programme has had some success in promoting regional consultation
among policy makers, and between policy makers and researchers from the different countries.
There have been several meetings of the national teams to set the agendas for consultation, policy
preparation, and action at the regional level.
<p>
So far (the programme has not yet reached its mid point), most progress can be seen at the national
level. However, this could be expected from a programme in which regional cooperation activities
were designed to be built on solid national foundations. As time progresses, and as the national
teams get more experience in working with one another, the regional elements of the various
programmes will become more concrete.
<p>

<h3>Key Elements in the Bottom-Up Approach</h3>
<p>
Progress and achievements in the programme can be attributed to several key factors or conditions:
the commitment and motivation of participants; the degree to which they own the process and the
outputs; the emphasis on developing clear and focused agendas with implementable activities; and,
especially for the regional dimension, a common awareness and perception among countries of the
problems to be addressed, and how to tackle them.
<p>
<ol>
<li><i>Incentives and Commitment</i>. Regional cooperation depends on the levels of
involvement and interest shown by participating countries, institutions, and individuals in specific
activities. The motivations of participants are closely linked to the incentives, material or other, that
can be realised by participating in the programme. Participants in national activities are often
motivated by the availability of opportunities for regional consultation and travel.
<p>
<li><i>Ownership and Responsibility</i>. Of course, the sustainability of a cooperative venture
is threatened when motivation to participate depends on the availability of rewards. It is therefore
essential that participants come to 'own' the programme and its activities, and that they invest time
and energy in it. Ownership has been developed through devolved responsibilities; it has also grown
out from the emerging informal networks themselves. Shared purpose, as well as the increasingly
strong (although informal) relationships between members of the network have helped to keep the
levels of involvement high.
<p>
Moving from participation to ownership is not easy, even where, as in this programme, the process
of consultation was designed to facilitate the transition. From the start, participants were
encouraged to establish their own contacts, to identify their own problems, to set their own
priorities, to join in regional negotiations, and to identify feasible projects that they themselves could
implement. All this took place with minimal involvement of outside experts from development and
bilateral agencies (although of course, finance was provided from a bilateral agency). Giving
responsibility for programme content and priorities to local teams has been an effective way to
ensure that the 'recipients' own the results and outputs of the programme.
<p>
<li><i>Focused and Implementable Agendas</i>. One characteristic of the programme has been
its adoption of a step by step approach in which small teams deal with a relatively limited agenda.
Starting small and unambitious and concentrating on reachable targets allowed the teams to make
progress while gradually expanding their activities in line with their capacities and confidence.
<p>
The process of getting to focused regional agendas also played an important part. Initial wide-
ranging agendas for research developed by national teams were reduced by participants in regional
meetings to national portfolios of activities that were implementable with the resources available.
Perhaps as important, the regional priority-setting process was sufficiently clear and transparent,
so that country representatives could understand the reasoning and arguments behind decision that
were taken.
<p>
<li><i>Awareness and Common Purpose</i>. The three conditions noted above relate as much
to national cooperation as regional cooperation. One feature of the programme that was especially
important at the regional level was the remarkable commonality of purpose shared by the
participating countries and policy makers. In this case, research over many years showed that cross-
border trade in food grains and cereals was the single most significant factor contributing to food
security deficiencies in the region. This common starting point provided the necessary focus for
consultation and negotiation, and, once the solutions to the problem were recognised to require
trans-national cooperation, the door was open for regional and sub-regional initiatives. The role of
donor-sponsored research over a long period in raising awareness also needs to be emphasised --
widespread awareness was necessary to ensure that policy makers in each country knew the scale
of the problem, its causes, and what they could do about it.

More importantly, the global reductions in tariff and non- tariff barriers as a result of the recent GATT agreements, together with the (eventual) dismantling of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement, will increase the need for South Africa to compete internationally in terms of price and quality.

<h3>National Sustainable Development Strategies<p>EC Aid and Sustainable Development Briefing Paper, No. 3, 1995</h3>



<I>It is now widely accepted that environmental, social and economic factors need to be integrated fully into strategic planning if there is to be significant progress towards the goal of sustainable development. The importance of this theme was reinforced during the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED), especially in Agenda 21 - the global action plan for sustainable development. Throughout Agenda 21, National Strategies for Sustainable Development (NSDSs) are promoted as mechanisms for translating the words and commitments of UNCED into concrete policies and actions that help individual nations to define and implement sustainable development priorities. This paper discusses the concept of NSDSs, considers some of the lessons of past experiences, and sets out ideas to meet the challenge of developing strategies. Ways in which donors, such as the EC, can best support developing countries in this process are suggested</I>. 
<p>
Over the last decade, there have been many different approaches to strategies and plans in the area of environment and development policy. Some of the most noted ones are national conservation strategies (NCSs) and national environmental action plans (NEAPs) promoted, respectively, by the World Conservation Union (IUCN) and the World Bank. But there is a range of others including, for example, green plans, national forestry action plans, and plans to combat desertification. Recently-agreed international conventions on biodiversity, climate change and desertification include requirements for yet more national action plans. 
<p>
Over 100 countries around the world are now engaged in preparing and implementing some form of strategic planning approach dealing with environment and development, although they may go by a variety of names. Many of those in developing countries and newly industrialising countries have been assisted by bilateral donors, multilateral development banks (particularly the World Bank) and UN agencies (notably UNDP through its Capacity 21 initiative). From this growing body of experience concerning strategies, there is an emerging consensus on the elements of the process which appear to work best. 

<H3>The lessons of past experience</H3>

Experience shows that there is no one type of approach and no single formula by which an NSDS can or should be undertaken. Every country will need to determine, for itself, how best to approach preparation and implementation. To a great extent, the process decided upon will be fashioned by prevailing political, bureaucratic and cultural circumstances. Furthermore, economic, environmental and social conditions will differ in each country. 
<p>
As a consequence, a "blueprint" approach is neither possible nor desirable. Nevertheless, a recent IIED/IUCN review of a wide range of past strategies from around the world suggested a number of key lessons and guiding principles (see Box 1). It also revealed a number of steps which appear to be common to the more successful strategies:
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>Box 1: Lessons and Principles</h4></center>
<p>
Experience shows that, for an NSDS to be successful and effective, it:<li>should be a cyclical processes of planning and action in which the emphasis is on managing progress towards sustainability goals rather than producing a plan or end product (see Figure 1);<li>should be genuinely multi-sectoral and integrative, aimed at engaging relevant interests and overcoming institutional and policy fragmentation;<li>is crucial to focus on priority issues, and identify key objectives, targets and means of dealing with them;<li>needs to involve the "widest possible participation"; this means sharing responsibility and building partnerships among all concerned - business, community and interest groups, as well as governments - but only where the partners feel it is appropriate;<li>must take an adaptive and flexible approach, recognising that problems are characterised by complexity and uncertainty, and policy responses and technological capability change over time;<li>is vital to set up mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation and learning from experience as an integral part of the process; and<li>is necessary to recognise that preparing an NSDS is an exercise in capacity-building, and should  be organised to enhance institutional arrangements, sharpen concepts and tools, foster professional skills and competence, and improve public awareness.

<p>
<I>Determine if conditions are appropriate</I> - e.g. a conducive political and social climate, high-level political support, and adequate funds.
<p>
<I>Decide on an entry point</I>. An NSDS should be a cyclical process (see Figure 1). Some elements follow one from the other; others (e.g. information analysis, monitoring and evaluation, and some implementation) proceed throughout the cycle. A new strategy should take account of what has gone on before, perhaps starting at whatever stage a significant ongoing or past strategy has reached.
<p>
<I>Establish an engine to drive the process</I>. Often, a Secretariat is formed, comprising committed staff with good management skills, both from inside and outside the government. The Secretariat may be responsible to a Steering Committee with broad representation, and is frequently independently chaired. Neither body should have vested sectoral interests or be located in a sector or interest group.
<p>
<I>Decide the process design</I>. The Steering Committee and Secretariat will need to determine the scope of the strategy, the main stakeholders to be involved, the issues to address, the approach, and how to manage the individual elements which comprise the strategy cycle (shown in Figure 1). 
<p>
<A NAME="fig"><center><A HREF="fig3.html">Figure 1: The Strategy Cycle</A></center></A>
<p>
<I>Determine the participants</I>. Participation implies full involvement of relevant groups (both government and non-government) in appropriate tasks including strategy design, exchanging information, decision-making, implementation etc. It is necessary to decide how much participation is possible and necessary, and to develop mechanisms for participation, e.g. core groups, round tables, workshops, community-based techniques, etc.
<p>
<I>Information assembly and analysis</I>. This can be undertaken through background studies and workshops, and by government agencies, universities, research and policy institutions and independent professionals. 
<p>
<I>Policy formulation and priority-setting</I>. Establish principles, goals and objectives of the strategy, and targets for achieving objectives, through appropriate fora, e.g. policy dialogues and round tables.
<p>
<I>Address the hard questions of sustainable development</I> - the major issues, obstacles and risks will be subject to differing opinions and attitudes. There are likely to be winners and losers and trade-offs will be necessary. Policy dialogues should first focus on potential win-win situations, later moving to the more intractable issues. 
Action planning and budgetting. An NSDS is a macro approach that needs on-the-ground micro actions. These can include: policy, legislative, institutional and organisational changes; capacity-building for government, NGOs and local communities; and a range of programmes and projects. 
<p>
<I>Implementation and capacity-building</I> - embracing the corporate sector, NGOs and communities, as well as government. Government can create an enabling environment for development action by all sections of society, and NGOs can play a key role in catalysing participation and local action.
<P>
<I>Communications</I> - keeping participants informed of progress, expressing consensus, generating wider understanding of sustainable development, and encouraging participation - through briefings, newsletters, media coverage, etc. 
<P>
<I>Monitoring and evaluation</I> - of both the process and products. It may be internal or external, or collaborative (involving strategy staff/participants and external evaluators). Indicators are required that reflect the status and trends of a particular process element or product.

<H3>Benefits of a strategy</H3>

A strategy can help decision-makers in a wide variety of ways. Some examples include: 
<ul>
<li>to define choices, goals, targets and policies for sustainable development, and the underlying values;
<li>to analyse economic, ecological and social issues in a comprehensive and integrated way; 
<li>to identify and evaluate options (legal reforms, institutional development, etc.) for addressing priority issues;
<li>to choose priorities, identify development plans and programmes, and guide their implementation;
<li>to allocate limited resources; and
<li>to help build capacities to handle complex development issues.
</ul><p>
Developing an NSDS should realise a number of benefits: both directly (from the process itself) and indirectly (as a result of sustainable development). Direct benefits include:
<ul>
<li>helping the development of government policies on sustainable development and building consensus around them;
<li>making such policies and actions more effective;
<li>mobilising and releasing a nations energies and human, financial and other resources, both internally (national) and externally (international), in support of sustainable development;
<li>helping developing countries to coordinate donor support - e.g. through donor round tables to consider support for an integrated suite of inititatives prioritised through a strategy;
<li>helping to meet reporting requirements under international conventions; and
<li>helping to integrate differing objectives concerning development and to resolve conflicts concerning different values and perspectives.
</ul>
<p>
Only some indirect benefits will be quantifiable (e.g. income and employment generation). Others will be less tangible and less measurable (the provision and maintenance of life-support services, such as the absorption of solid wastes and industrial emissions, erosion control, etc.).  Box 2 lists some examples of strategy outputs.
<p>
<center>
<table border=1 cellpadding=8>
<tr><td><center><h4>Box 2. Some Examples of Strategy Outputs</h4></center>
<p>
Botswana (National Conservation Strategy):  The importance attached to environmental issues in the preparation and implementation of the National Economic Development Plan has grown significantly. Institutions have been established with specific responsibility for sustainable development and for ensuring that EIA procedures are applied. The latter has resulted in significant cost savings, associated with the selection of dam sites; and the reversal of a decision to implement the Southern Okovango Integrated Water Development Project, whose impacts were suspect - financially, economically and socially.<p>
Costa Rica (National Conservation Strategy for Sustainable Development): The strategy has closely influenced the establishment of the innovative National Biodiversity Institute.<p>
Netherlands (National Environmental Policy Plan - NEPP, NEPP Plus and NEPP 2): These provide a strategy with the ambitious aim of attaining sustainable development within a single generation, and for specific stakeholders to achieve significant environmental improvement targets and measurable actions. 17 covenants have been signed between governments and industrial sectors and others have been negotiated. Once completed, the process of reducing 80% of the countrys industrial pollution will be managed through this mechanism.
<p>
Pakistan (National Conservation Strategy): Much praised as a leading example of an exemplary process. The NCS was the first major example of national-level consultation on both development and environment issues in Pakistan, with a particularly successful involvement of NGOs and the private sector. The NCS has paved the way for provincial strategies, now under way; it is in these provincial strategies, where a more intensive consultation with resource user groups is taking place, that targets will be set. The World Bank accepted the NCS as a NEAP equivalent.

<H3>Challenges</H3>

Many developing country governments are considering how best to draw up an NSDS in order to respond to Agenda 21. A key challenge is to develop capabilities to think and operate strategically about sustainable development. Those responsible for initiating an NSDS (usually likely to be senior members of government) will need to be convinced by the argument that a strategy should be a continuous, cyclical process, integrated into and able to improve conventional development planning. They will also need to promote the building of strategies at sub-national levels (e.g. provincial, district, city, local community) and to provide for effective working linkages amongst strategies at different levels. In this way, in future, the detail of policies and action plans will be generated by the institutions and communities responsible for implementing them.  Strategies cannot be plans written by and for governments alone.
<p>
The EC and other donors need to consider how best they can provide help to developing countries. A number of factors must be borne in mind. Donors should:
<ul>
<li>be supportive of country-driven inititiatives that result in government commitment, as opposed to donor-led processes that result in donor processes; 
<p>
<li>refrain from imposing any particular strategic model, or unduly influencing its principles, particularly as an instrument of aid conditionality - there has been much criticism, and much resentment in developing countries, of the World Bank using the completion of an "acceptable NEAP" as a condition for receipt of IDA funds.
<p>
<li>recognise that strategy development will be a long-term commitment; and avoid supplying expatriate teams to run the process; and
<p>
<li>recognise that a good strategy will enable them to optimise the value of aid by targetting it to priority needs negotiated and agreed by a country.
</ul><p>
Today, moving towards sustainable development is arguably the most difficult challenge facing decision-makers at all levels and the people of all nations. Without an effective mechanism and process to harness the skills, values and vision of each nation, the challenge is likely to remain unmet. Developing a nationally-driven sustainable development strategy offers one way forward.

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Since independence, African leaders have seen regional integration and cooperation (RIC)
as a way to replace links with former colonial countries. RIC was considered to be crucial
in attaining economic development, promoting regional stability and guaranteeing African
influence in international negotiations. The 1960s and the 1970s saw the birth of many
regional organisations in Africa, but sadly, few have produced tangible results. In recent
years we have seen a renewed interest in RIC in Africa as a tool for promoting sustainable
development and economic growth.
<p>
Few inhabitants of Maastricht know of the important role played by their city in re-opening
the debate on RIC in Africa. It was during the first Africa Conference of the Global Coalition
for Africa held in Maastricht in July 1990 -- at the invitation of the Netherlands Minister for
Development Cooperation -- that RIC was placed firmly on the agenda for African leaders
and development organisations alike. The conference aimed to change the negative overall
image of Africa as a continent of famine, dictatorship, civil war and economic disaster.
Attended by African leaders and representatives of the international community, the meeting
showed the world that important economic and political reforms were taking place in Africa.
<p>
Since then, there have been many initiatives to assess what form RIC can take, and how it
can be implemented. ECDPM has made three modest contributions to the debate. First, the
Centre works with African partners in managing sub-regional food security in West Africa.
Second, in December 1992 the Centre organised a meeting for several key specialists in RIC.
With mostly African participants, the meeting focused on the institutional requirements for
effective RIC in countries of Africa, the Caribbean, and the Pacific (ACP). Finally, in March
1993, ECDPM and the European Institute for Public Administration organised a training
seminar for high-level African officials on "European Experiences in Regional Cooperation
and Integration."
<p>
This paper reviews the arguments behind the current revival of interest in RIC and discusses
why progress in African RIC has been slow. Then, some preconditions for RIC are
introduced and lessons from initiatives in other parts of the world are related to the African
situation. Finally, we suggest some pragmatic steps to move us from words to deeds. The
paper does not attempt to provide an overview of the many different regional organisations
in Africa and their functioning -- there are now more than 200, and they have been described
elsewhere in sufficient detail (Onitiri, 1992; Anyang'Nyong'o, 1990).
<p>


<h3>Is Regional Cooperation and Integration in Africa a Priority, or Just Wishful
Thinking?</h3>
<p>
Three main views on RIC in Africa can be distinguished. The first is optimistic and suggests
that most African countries are emerging from crisis and are going through a period of
transformation in which regional cooperation has much to offer (CIDA, 1991).
<p>
A second view suggests that, irrespective of the economic situation and whether or not the
preconditions for effective RIC are present, cooperation is essential for longer-term
sustainable development. This conviction goes beyond Africa and is most clearly seen in the
growth of trading blocs such as the EEC, NAFTA, and MERCOSUR. In this scenario, the
argument is that Africa must accelerate its cooperation and integration processes if it wants
to compete with other parts of the world. The Abuja Treaty of June 1991 that established the
African Economic Community is the most recent attempt by African leaders to fight the
growing marginalisation of Africa on the international scene (OAU, 1991). 
<p>
The third, and most sceptical view, is that RIC, although desirable, is unlikely to have much
effect in the near future until African economies are stronger. The argument is that periods
of economic weakness are not the best time to formulate plans to promote intra-regional
trade, liberalise national markets, establish multinational sectoral linkages, and to harmonise
macroeconomic policies on a regional or sub-regional basis (Bax Nomvete, 1992).
Governments in these situations are under pressure to sort out their domestic crises before
addressing regional issues.
<p>

<h3>Why Progress in Africa has been Slow</h3>
<p>
Commentators agree that, despite continuing verbal commitments to regional cooperation and
integration in Africa, the results have been disappointing (Bach, 1993; Barad, 1990). The
reasons suggested for this poor record are historic, political, economic, and institutional.
<p>
History. The colonial heritage that left many African countries dependent on their former
metropolitan countries tends to work against viable regional groupings. Commercial and
political links with Europe for example, continue to be more important than links within
Africa, and communication and transport networks oriented towards former colonial centres
do not facilitate intra-regional trade.
<p>
Politics. Regional cooperation is an intensely political process and, when most African states
are still defining their national identities, it is difficult to agree on cooperation that requires
sovereignty in certain areas to be handed to a regional organisation. No matter what the
rhetoric, political leaders jealously guard their sovereignty and are unwilling to reduce the
power and authority of the state (Senghor, 1990). When governments and politicians do not
benefit from cooperation, they will not pursue it seriously.
<p>
Another problem for many African countries is the lack of participation by the general public
in discussion on regional initiatives. Instead, cooperation agreements are often considered to
be the 'private property' of politicians and civil servants. The general population tends to see
cooperation as bloated and expensive bureaucracies attending meetings, rather than
opportunities for growth and development.
<p>
Economics. Zero growth rates, balance of payments difficulties, lack of complementarities,
weak industrial structures, low productivity, heavy debt burdens, poor infrastructural and
transport facilities, and non-convertible currencies all work against regional cooperation
initiatives. It is questionable how useful market integration is where the gross domestic
product of sub-Saharan Africa is roughly equal to Mexico or The Netherlands, and where
almost half originates in five countries.
<p>
Institutions. The list of institutional weaknesses is impressive and can only be summarised
here. It includes the existence of too many regional organisations; a tendency towards top-
heavy structures with many political appointments; many failures by governments to meet
their financial obligations to regional organisations; a reluctance by countries to hand over
power and resources to regional executives; poor preparation before meetings, often
participation by the wrong people, and little internal consultation between officials and
ministers on decisions taken at regional meetings; and lack of follow up by sectoral ministries
on decisions taken at regional meetings by Heads of State (Bax Nomvete, 1992).
<p>
The consequences are evident. At the regional level, institutions compete, and duplicate their
activities, often holding rounds of increasingly costly meetings; and at the national level,
regional agreements are rarely integrated into either national or sectoral policies and plans.
<p>

<h3>What Can be Learned from Europe?</h3>
<p>
If the prospects for Africa do not seem very bright, what can we learn from experiences
elsewhere in the world? In Europe, economic growth, good governance, political stability,
and strong institutions have all been necessary for effective regional cooperation. Looking at
these same factors in Africa, these preconditions are either not present, or are not well-
developed.
<p>
Africa indeed, has neither favourable international or domestic economic environments, and
much work is required to reform domestic economic policies and to build confidence that will
revitalise economic activity. In particular, local private-sector entrepreneurs and businessmen
could give an important stimulus to RIC through their demands for better market
opportunities.
<p>
Regarding good governance, most African countries face unstable political environments as
well as regional tensions and instability. Effective implementation of regional cooperation
frameworks will only take root in healthy and democratic environments where economic
management is both transparent and accountable (Bax Nomvete, 1992). Building this kind of
political security requires leaders with vision and the will to implement change.
<p>
Apart from political and economic prerequisites, the availability of indigenous institutional
capacity is essential. A strong institutional set-up at the regional and the national levels is
fundamental, and links between national and regional institutions (the interface level) are
required to integrate regional agreements into national policy. While all three levels are
important, it is striking that the literature on RIC in Africa focuses on the roles, functions,
and strengthening of regional organisations. Far less attention has been paid to the
institutional frameworks for RIC at the national and interface levels.
<p>
Concluding this brief review, two lessons can be drawn. First, there can be no effective RIC
without national integration and participation. The European experience shows that national-
level arrangements such as inter-ministerial coordination committees, or consultation
mechanisms with chambers of commerce, trade unions, and pressure groups are essential for
effective participation in regional initiatives. Efforts at the regional level can only be
sustained if African countries can first put their own domestic houses in order. 
<p>
Second, there are no simple recipes or models. Success or failure hinges on the specific
context and environment in which the cooperation is to operate, and care must be taken not
to transplant or copy models from different contexts and circumstances. They must be
adapted to local needs and realities. Some of the approaches and mechanisms from Europe
that may be useful in Africa are the principle of subsidiarity; targeted policies to reduce
welfare disparities between regions; the role of small countries; and gradual implementation
of RIC at different speeds (variable geometry).
<p>

<h3>The Need for Action at the National Level</h3>
<p>
By the end of the 1980s, almost none of the targets set out by the Organisation of African
Unity's (OAU) Lagos Plan of Action for a gradual establishment of an African Common
Market were achieved. The Treaty of Abuja, signed in June 1991, set 2025 as a new date for
attaining a pan-African Economic Community comprising 52 States and more than 600
million people (Bach, 1993). The institutional implications are impressive. The politico-
administrative machinery to be created is almost a copy of the institutional framework of the
European Community with a Council of Ministers, Economic and Social Committee, Court
of Justice, and a pan-African Parliament.
<p>
The biggest challenge arising from the Abuja treaty is to move from talk and prescription to
action and to change the assumption that once goals for regional cooperation have been set,
implementation will automatically follow. Conviction and recommendations must be matched
by commitment to implementation. One of the most crucial and urgent questions now is how
the new community's machinery will be gradually established. This machinery is needed to
take the important decisions and, when taken, to implement them without delay or dilution.
The Treaty provides little operational guidance on how the declarations of intent can be
implemented, and what is required to make them effective.
<p>
How can Africa bridge the implementation gap and move from words to deeds? Without
neglecting important decisions to be taken regionally, policies and institutional requirements
for cooperation must, first and foremost, be addressed at the national level.
<p>
A national agenda for action could include:
<ul>
<li>building strong and sustained political commitment for cooperation<br>
<li>building institutional capacities to manage cooperation<br>
<li>involving economic actors and civil society in discussion and decisions<br>
<li>opting for flexible types of cooperation arrangements<br>
<li>ensuring support for cooperation from the international donor community<br>
</ul><p>

      <h4>Building political commitment</h4>

The real starting point for regional cooperation is political will to support cooperation or
integration, despite obstacles that are faced (Johnson, 1991). The history of regional efforts
in Africa shows that political considerations have often slowed the implementation of regional
decisions and this makes African political leaders key figures in the process; their
commitment to RIC will be largely determined by the perceived personal and national
advantages and disadvantages of integration by the political leadership and populations. If it
is not likely that these leaders will benefit from RIC, cooperation attempts will not be
seriously pursued and mutually-agreed policy decisions will not be implemented.
<p>
      <h4>Building institutional and managerial capacities</h4>

As was indicated earlier, most analyses of regional cooperation schemes in Africa have
concentrated on the functioning of institutions at the regional level. Proliferation, duplication
of functions, conflicts over mandates, and arrears in contributions have meant that the many
regional institutions in Africa find it difficult to implement the tasks assigned to them. A
genuine rationalization of the numerous regional organisations in Africa, is highly needed.
Strategies to reinforce and rationalise the existing regional institutional framework have been
discussed in various fora. The most visible initiatives in Africa are those taken by pan-African
organisations, such as the OAU, ADB and ECA whose evaluations of some regional
organisations has resulted in recommendations for their restructuring, merging, or abolition.
<p>
Apart from the regional institutions, strong institutions at the national level are indispensable
for implementing the large and increasingly diverse number of conclusions and
recommendations formulated in regional cooperation or integration schemes. Institutions for
national development should be considered before further addressing the strengthening of
regional organisations. Only few - if any - African countries seem to have a well-structured
national apparatus that is able to coordinate their involvement in different regional
organisations. "Establishing national integration structures in each country will make for a
better coordination among member states and would facilitate implementation of decisions;
it will, also, make for quicker decisions. Arguably this will lead to easier consultation and
harmonization at the sub-regional level" (ECA, 1992: 8).
<p>
Most EC member countries, for example, have very clear coordinating procedures that work
out compromises at the country level. The Netherlands has inter-ministerial coordination on
an almost permanent basis at both the Cabinet level (standing Cabinet Committee) and at the
level of the civil servants who are involved in European Affairs (Inter-departmental
Coordinating Committee). In Africa, ministries for regional cooperation or integration might
constitute a first step in the direction of more coordination; but in the rare cases where they
exist, these tend to have no real coordinating power nor appropriate staffing.
<p>
Regional cooperation also requires coordinated interactions between the national and regional
levels to bring greater convergence between national development policies and the objectives
of integration groupings. One important theme that underpins efforts to strengthen intra-
African economic integration and cooperation is to strengthen the links between national and
regional development policies.
<p>

Capacity building has been diagnosed as one of the most critical areas for economic
development and RIC processes. The World Bank puts it bluntly: "More access to
information on other African countries, more exposure to them, and more education about
them are vital parts of the process." (World Bank, 1989: 161).
<p>
Human resource development and administrative, technical and research capacities are indeed
fundamental in any strategy to promote regional cooperation. Training of government officials
and technocrats charged with implementing regional policies, and finding ways to motivate
them are key elements that may help to achieve the objective of RIC. A critical mass of
dedicated people within the administration is needed to ensure continuity. Exchange
programmes and increased contacts at the personal level also play a major role in building
support for regional cooperation initiatives and in creating a common language between the
actors and stakeholders - both public and private - in the countries concerned.
<p>
Among the capacities required is also information management. There is an acute lack of
awareness of what other African countries can offer to substitute the products presently being
imported from developed countries. Institutionalised access to and quick transmission of
information on rules and regulations implemented in partner countries and on bureaucratic
procedures, publications of standardised statistical data and so on are needed to lay the
groundwork for effective RIC (Langhammer and Hiemenz, 1990). Finally, institutional
provisions are needed to ensure that where a decision is taken, by Heads of Government for
example, member states provide the necessary legal effect to the decision.
<p>
      <h4>Involving a broad range of economic actors and civil society</h4>

RIC is not just a matter for national governments and international organisations. It cannot
be imposed from above, but must be a need felt by, and supported by the general public.
<p>
A factor in the success of RIC is been the emergence of a so-called integration culture.
"Beyond actions on policy, infrastructure, and institutions lies a more fundamental need: to
mobilise the media and educational and cultural institutions to promote the concept that
cooperation within Africa is likely to enhance the progress of all African societies (World
Bank, 1989: 161). Strong non-governmental participation is a key factor in achieving the
goals of RIC. Successful regional cooperation or integration schemes in Europe and elsewhere
have not been the work of governments alone. They have all benefitted from active
participation by a wide variety of groups such as trade unions, employers' organisations, and
private entrepreneurs, and these groups ensured that RIC issues remained at the top of the
political and economic agendas. The degree of participation by civil society can therefore be
seen as a barometer to gauge the real effects of RIC measures.
<p>
      <h4>Flexible cooperation arrangements</h4>

Full market integration (involving a surrender of national sovereignty) is one of several
possible approaches to regional integration and cooperation. However, this does not seem to
be the right time for this type of integration in Africa and it may be better to aim at
arrangements that involve shared sovereignty.
<p>
Thus, rather than striving at once for strong and independent supra-national institutions with
considerable powers and resources, African countries could be less ambitious, and aim to
create more flexible institutions that can be linked more closely to national priorities and
interests. This implies arrangements that are less-binding, more project-oriented, and involve
action on certain themes or in certain sectors that offer some immediate benefits. 
<p>
With these types of pragmatic institutional arrangements based on realistic and well-defined
objectives, the emphasis shifts towards policy coordination rather than integration, and
countries can keep their autonomy, while at the same time, cooperating in areas where they
perceive a need to do so (Ravenhill, 1990). Experience shows that the chances of success is
higher where loss of sovereignty is low and potential benefits are high. Concentrating efforts
on more modest activities in which the benefits to all participants are clear and appropriable
was the kind of strategy followed by the European Community when it began as a series of
cooperation agreements on iron and steel.
<p>
      <h4>Ensuring donor support</h4>

The primary responsibility for effective RIC rests with the governments and populations of
the countries concerned. However, given the magnitude of the problems and the very limited
resources of most African countries, substantial international support is needed to supplement
national efforts (Mutharika, 1990). External financial and technical cooperation can play a
catalytic role, but only if they are derived from the priorities of the African countries and do
not try to formulate 'solutions' from outside. Care is needed to ensure that RIC in the same
way as governance, does not become another donor-imposed condition, or that international
donors display a greater enthusiasm for RIC than African countries do themselves.

</H3>
This article reviews a recent comprehensive evaluation of the Netherlands bilateral development cooperation with a number of developing countries (in particular India, Mali and Tanzania). Terms of reference of the evaluation report were policy relevance, efficiency and effectiveness of Dutch bilateral aid. The author concludes that this study stresses procedures rather than content (i.c. sectors). She favours a focus on opportunities rather than problems and favours a clear distinction between the aims of economic emancipation and of poverty alleviation.

<B>Onlangs werd door de Inspectie Ontwikkelingssamenwerking te Velde
(IOV) een evaluatie gepubliceerd over de Nederlandse ontwikkelingssamenwerking
met India, Mali en Tanzania.
Het hoofddoel van de evaluatie was de beoordeling van de beleidsrelevantie,
de doeltreffendheid en de doelmatigheid van de bilaterale hulp.</B>
<P>
<a name=inleiding></a><B>Inleiding</B>
<P>
Belangrijke redenen om een dergelijke studie uit te voeren waren:
het zeer omvangrijke deel van de ontwikkelingsgelden dat via landenprogramma's
wordt gekanaliseerd; de mogelijkheid inzicht te krijgen in de
inzet van een breed scala van beleidsinstrumenten; en het geschikte
kader dat dit type studies biedt om de organisatie en het beheer
van de hulp te beoordelen.
<P>
De vijf centrale vragen waarop het onderzoek zich heeft geconcentreerd
zijn:
<P>
In hoeverre sloot het hulpprogramma aan bij de beleidsprioriteiten
van Nederland en het ontvangende land;
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Hoe was dit hulpprogramma tussen Nederland en het ontwikkelingsland
georganiseerd en hoe werd het beheerd (doelmatigheid van de organisatie
en het beheer);
<P>
<LI>In welke mate droeg de Nederlandse hulp bij aan de economische
verzelfstandiging;
<P>
<LI>In welke mate droeg de Nederlandse hulp bij aan de armoedebestrijding;
en
<P>
<LI>Hoe duurzaam zijn de resultaten van de Nederlandse hulp gebleken?
</UL>
<P>
De hoofdbevindingen van de landenevaluatie zijn gepubliceerd in
drie landenstudies en een samenvattend rapport. Het samenvattende
deel begint met een korte schets van de drie landen als achtergrond
voor de bevindingen over de Nederlandse hulp. Daarin wordt in
het bijzonder aandacht gegeven aan de sociaaleconomische situatie
en het overheidsbeleid. Vervolgens worden de hoofdbevindingen
gepresenteerd; deze hebben achtereenvolgens betrekking op beleidsori&euml;ntatie,
organisatie en beheer van de hulp, de bijdrage van het hulpprogramma
aan economische verzelfstandiging en armoedebestrijding in de
drie landen, en de duurzaamheid van de projectresultaten. Het
geheel wordt afgesloten met conclusies over de beleidsmatigheid,
doeltreffendheid en doelmatigheid van de hulp, en met aanbevelingen
over het landenallocatiesysteem, de hulpaanpak en het hulpbeheer.
<P>
De IOVlandenstudies zullen worden gebruikt voor de formulering
van het nieuwe ontwikkelingsbeleid. Volgens het regeerakkoord
van de `paarse coalitie' (zomer 1994) zal wat betreft Ontwikkelingssamenwerking
`de herbezinning mede plaatsvinden naar aanleiding van het recente
rapport van de Inspectie Ontwikkelingssamenwerking te Velde'.
In dit artikel zal &#190; op basis van de hoofdbevindingen van
het rapport &#190; worden getracht een bijdrage te leveren aan
de discussie over de toekomst van ontwikkelingssamenwerking.
<P>
<a name=samenvatting></a><B>Samenvatting van de resultaten</B> 
<P>
Hoewel de IOVstudie benadrukt dat op basis van de uitgevoerde
evaluaties moeilijk algemene aanbevelingen kunnen worden geformuleerd,
worden ten aanzien van toekomstig beleid de volgende richtlijnen
gepresenteerd:
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Een meer doorzichtig allocatiebeleid</I>. Om voor de ontvangende
landen de doorzichtigheid en voorspelbaarheid van het Nederlandse
allocatiebeleid te vergroten, is het wenselijk de voornaamste
criteria bij het bepalen van de omvang van de hulp aan de belangrijkste
programmalanden zoveel mogelijk te concretiseren. Men denkt aan
een programmering voor een periode van vier &agrave; vijf jaar
(meerjarenallocatie), waarbij zowel de totale hoogte van de allocatie
als de verdeling naar hulpvormen en hulpinstrumenten is vastgesteld.
Dit bevordert ook een goede integratie van de hulp in de lokale
planning.
</UL>
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Meer aandacht voor de resultaten</I>. Tot nu toe speelde
de mate waarin programma's succesvol bleken te zijn slechts een
marginale rol bij de bepaling van de omvang van de hulp. De aandacht
voor de resultaten van projecten was relatief gering. De meeste
projecten kenden ook geen deugdelijk systeem van monitoring. Aanbevolen
wordt de aandacht te verschuiven van een te veel op middelen naar
een meer op resultaten gerichte organisatiestructuur. Het totale
hulpvolume dient derhalve vooral te worden bepaald door de <I>output</I>
(de mate waarin het programma succesvol was) en niet zo zeer door
<I>input</I>factoren (de beschikbaarheid van middelen).</ul>
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Meer programmasteun en minder projecten</I>. In landen met
een goed macroeconomisch beleid is <I>programmahulp</I> (importsteun,
schuldverlichting, structurele of sectorale aanpassingsleningen
en begrotingssteun) de geschiktste hulpvorm. Uit overwegingen
van effectiviteit en beheersbaarheid wordt aanbevolen voorrang
te geven aan sectorgeori&euml;nteerde en procesmatig uitgevoerde
programma's, waarbij diverse hulpvormen worden gecombineerd. Programmahulp
kan &#190; meer dan projecthulp - een belangrijke rol spelen bij
de ondersteuning van economische hervormingsprogramma's. Programmahulp
leidt bovendien tot eenvoudige procedures en tot snelle besteding
van hulpgelden. Gegeven de voordelen van programmasteun wordt
aanbevolen de omvang van de <I>projecthulp</I> en het aantal projecten
te beperken. Er dient te worden gestreefd naar een <I>clustering</I>
van activiteiten, d.w.z. verkleining van de sectorale en geografische
spreiding.</ul>
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Vergroting van de lokale betrokkenheid</I>. De kans op duurzaamheid
van projecten wordt vergroot indien het ontvangende land en de
lokale uitvoerders het project vanaf het begin als eigen activiteit
beschouwen en zich daarvoor verantwoordelijk voelen. De lokale
betrokkenheid bij de planning en uitvoering van het hulpprogramma
moet dus worden vergroot. Om de zeggenschap van het ontwikkelingsland
(<I>ownership</I>) in de hulpuitvoering te vergroten, dient het
ontwikkelingsland vanaf het eerste begin te worden betrokken bij
de identificatie van projecten. Hiervoor is het nodig dat hulpprocedures
worden vereenvoudigd en geharmoniseerd, terwijl ondersteuning
dient te worden gegeven aan de lokale <I>management</I>capaciteit
en lokale beheerssystemen; de belangrijkste oorzaak van het gebrek
aan `kennisoverdracht' door deskundigen aan lokale <I>counterparts</I>
vormen het zeer lage salaris en het lage kennisniveau ter plaatse.</ul>
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Meer joint-co-financing</I>. Volgens de studie moet de toepassing
van <I>joint-co-financing</I> als gunstige ontwikkeling worden beschouwd:
door gezamenlijke financiering wordt de <I>impact</I> van hulp
vergroot, vooral met betrekking tot macroeconomische hervormingsprogramma's;
deze hulp is voor ontwikkelingslanden beter te hanteren, omdat
ze maar met &eacute;&eacute;n uitvoeringsprocedure en &eacute;&eacute;n
controlemechanisme te maken hebben. Bovendien vermindert hierdoor
de werkbelasting voor het DGIS.</ul>
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Grotere delegering van bevoegdheden naar ambassades</I>.
De verdere delegering van bevoegdheden naar de ambassades is gebaseerd
op het idee dat kennis van de lokale omstandigheden vooral in
het land zelf moet worden gezocht. Daarom verdient het &#190;
volgens de evaluatie &#190; aanbeveling de verantwoordelijkheid
voor identificatie, formulering en beoordeling van de programma's
en de <I>monitoring</I> van de uitvoering aan de ambassades over
te laten. Een dergelijke delegering sluit niet uit dat bij de
voorbereiding en uitvoering specifieke buitenlandse expertise
wordt ingeschakeld. De ambassade dient dan wel te beschikken over
medewerkers die voor de gedecentraliseerde taken zijn gekwalificeerd.
Daarbij is ook deskundigheid op macroeconomisch terrein een vereiste,
zodat de ambassades effectief kunnen deelnemen aan de discussie
over macroeconomische en sectorale vraagstukken met andere donoren
en met het ontvangende land.</ul>
<P>
<ul>
<li><I>Inschakeling van (lokale) NGO's</I>. Particuliere organisaties
vormen het kanaal bij uitstek voor activiteiten en initiatieven
die zich niet of moeilijk lenen voor samenwerking tussen overheden.
Deze NGO's beschikken over goede contacten met de bevolking in
de ontvangende landen, waardoor zij een goed inzicht hebben in
de mogelijkheden van duurzame armoedebestrijding.</ul>
<P>
Volgens de conclusies van de IOV-studies moet het Nederlandse ontwikkelingsbeleid
dus beter en eenvoudiger. `Doe minder en beter. Doe wat je doet
zorgvuldig en passend binnen de mogelijkheden van het ontwikkelingsland.<a href="#1">(1)</a>
De vraag is echter of met een beter en eenvoudiger ontwikkelingsbeleid
voldoende voorwaarden zijn geschapen voor het behalen van positievere
en duurzamere resultaten. Er kunnen bij de IOVstudie - als discussiebron
voor de toekomstige vorm van ontwikkelingssamenwerking &#190;
immers verscheidene kanttekeningen worden geplaatst.
<P>
<a name=kanttekeningen></a><B>Kanttekeningen</B> 
<P>
In de <I>eerste plaats</I> is het opvallend dat &#190; ondanks
de in de praktijk geconstateerde spanning tussen `economische
verzelfstandiging' en `armoedebestrijding' &#190; in de evaluatie
geen discussie wordt gevoerd over de vraag of beide doelstellingen
in het vervolg niet beter kunnen worden gescheiden. Nergens wordt
aan de orde gesteld of doorgegaan moet worden met dit `ge&iuml;ntegreerde
beleid', of dat beter overgestapt kan worden op een `tweesporen'beleid.
In het pleidooi voor `programmasteun' (in plaats van projecten)
en `jointcofinancing' wordt vooral gewezen op de mogelijke voordelen
in de uitvoering van economische hervormingsprogramma's. Het is
niet duidelijk in hoeverre via deze kanalen ook een bijdrage geleverd
kan worden aan armoedebestrijding. In de praktijk blijken `economische
verzelfstandiging' en `armoedebestrijding' slechts zelden samen
te gaan.
<P>
Een <I>tweede thema</I> waaraan in de evaluatie weinig aandacht
wordt besteed, vormt de tegenstelling in ontwikkelingslanden tussen
`nationale' en `lokale' belangen. In de IOVstudie wordt er stilzwijgend
van uitgegaan dat `wat goed is voor de overheid' ook in het belang
is van de bevolking. De praktijk laat echter zien dat overheden
&#190; ondanks het voeren van een gunstig sociaaleconomisch beleid
&#190; vaak andere prioriteiten hebben dan lokale bevolkingsgroepen.
Voor zover in de IOVstudie wordt ingegaan op de noodzaak te komen
tot `vergroting van de lokale betrokkenheid', wordt slechts gerefereerd
aan betere participatie van de overheid in de planning en uitvoering
van het hulpprogramma en `ownership' van het programma. In de
beoordeling van de doeltreffendheid en doelmatigheid van Nederlandse
hulp is nergens een poging gedaan inzicht te krijgen in het gezichtspunt
van de bevolking.
<P>
Behalve deze tekortkomingen in de <I>analyse</I> kunnen ook bij
de <I>conclusies</I> kritische kanttekeningen worden geplaatst.
Het is niet altijd duidelijk waarom met de voorgestelde wijzigingen
een directe bijdrage zou kunnen worden geleverd aan een doeltreffender
en doelmatiger ontwikkelingsbeleid.
<P>
<ul>
<li>Met programmasteun (in plaats van projecthulp) lijkt weliswaar
een bijdrage te kunnen worden geleverd aan een grotere `doorzichtigheid',
maar daarmee is nog niet duidelijk waarom hiermee per definitie
gunstiger resultaten zijn te behalen. De lokale uitvoeringscapaciteit
is vaak klein, en er zullen zich &#190; vooral in de meest marginale
gebieden &#190; hoe dan ook problemen voordoen in de uitvoering.
De voorkeur voor programmasteun of projectmatige aanpak hangt
trouwens in hoge mate af van de beoogde doelstelling: waar het
gaat om `ge&iuml;ntegreerde streekontwikkeling' (met gebiedspecifieke
doelstellingen) lijkt projecthulp een doelmatiger en doeltreffender
instrument dan programmahulp. Overigens wordt in het pleidooi
voor programmasteun nergens verwezen naar de negatieve ervaringen
die in voorgaande perioden zijn opgedaan met betalingsbalans en
importsteun.<a href="#2">(2)</a></ul>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Het is opvallend dat in de IOV-studie blindelings de voorkeur
wordt gegeven aan hulp `in eigen beheer', zonder duidelijke conclusies
te trekken uit de ervaringen met <I>uitbesteding</I>. Oorspronkelijk
was de voorkeur voor uitbesteding vooral gebaseerd op drie te
verwachten voordelen: kwaliteitsverbetering, vermaatschappelijking
en werklastvermindering. De praktijk laat zien dat veel van de
uitbestede projecten tot goede resultaten hebben geleid. Toch
wordt `eigen beheer' in de IOVstudie weer gezien als de meest
geschikte modaliteit voor de uitvoering van projecten. Het is
niet duidelijk waarop deze mening is gestoeld en waarom projecten
`in eigen beheer' tot betere resultaten zouden leiden.</ul>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Het lijkt niet terecht dat in de IOVstudie wordt gepleit voor
een `delegatie van bevoegdheden naar de ambassades' en een `toename
van het aantal lokale sectorspecialisten', zonder dat wordt ingegaan
op hierdoor toenemende financi&euml;le lasten. Terwijl de permanente
stationering van buitenlandse deskundigen in projecten op financi&euml;le
gronden als ongewenst van de hand wordt gewezen, volgt in het
pleidooi voor `decentralisatie van DGIS' geen afweging van kosten
en baten. Weliswaar kan door gespecialiseerd personeel op ambassades
een positieve rol worden vervuld in de uitvoering van projecten,
maar het is niet duidelijk hoe kwaliteit en continu&iuml;teit
kunnen worden gegarandeerd. Regelmatige roulatie van taken en
overplaatsing is op ambassades een normaal patroon; zolang het
vertrek van (sommige) sectorspecialisten niet als `verlies', maar
veeleer als `opluchting' wordt ervaren, lijkt een discussie over
verdere decentralisatie voorbarig. Voorlopig lijkt het van groter
belang dat op ambassades prioriteit wordt gegeven aan de opbouw
van een `institutioneel geheugen'.</ul>
<P>
Behalve genoemde bezwaren is het opvallend dat de IOV-studie geen
aanzet geeft voor beleidswijzigingen die inspelen op recente tendensen;
ondanks de groeiende rol van de particuliere sector wordt in de
IOVstudie eenzijdig gesproken over hulpverlening via overheden
en NGO's; nergens wordt ingegaan op een mogelijke kanalisering
van middelen via het <I>particuliere bedrijfsleven</I>. Bovendien
wordt weinig aandacht besteed aan de vraag op welke wijze in de
toekomst ondersteuning kan worden verleend aan de groeiende sector
van <I>informele</I> (handels en produktie)activiteiten. Vooralsnog
lijkt programmahulp niet het meest geschikte kanaal voor het stimuleren
van particulier initiatief, vooral niet in landen waar het grootste
deel van de beroepsbevolking is geconcentreerd in de informele
sector.
<P>
<a name=evaluatie></a><B>Evaluatie van evaluatie</B> 
<P>
De IOV-studie geeft weliswaar inzicht in de voor- en nadelen van
het gebruik van verschillende hulpkanalen, maar voor het richting
geven aan toekomstig ontwikkelingsbeleid worden weinig nieuwe
aanzetten gegeven. In de studie wordt nadruk gelegd op de <I>vorm</I>
waarin ontwikkelingshulp moet worden gegeven, terwijl weinig aandacht
wordt besteed aan de <I>inhoud</I> van projecten. Vooral waar
het gaat over de duurzaamheid van projecten wordt slechts ingegaan
op de organisatorische en logistieke kant van projectuitvoering,
terwijl het succes &#190; in de praktijk &#190; in hoge mate wordt
bepaald door inhoudelijke zaken.
<P>
Terwijl in de IOVstudie tegenvallende resultaten worden verklaard
door `bestuurskundig falen', had evengoed de conclusie kunnen
zijn dat het DGIS heeft gegokt op de verkeerde sectoren. In Tanzania,
Mali en India was het beleid vooral gericht op de rehabilitatie
van de meer `traditionele' sectoren (voedsellandbouw; agroindustrie;
infrastructuur; drinkwater en sanitatie), waarbij de bestaande
situatie (d.w.z. de lokale problemen) zoveel mogelijk als uitgangspunt
wordt gehanteerd. De Nederlandse middelen zijn dus vooral ge&iuml;nvesteerd
in de economisch minder aantrekkelijke sectoren, waarbij bovendien
veel nadruk werd gelegd op agroecologische en technische factoren.
<P>
Een belangrijke reden waarom veel ontwikkelingsprojecten niet
tot duurzame ontwikkeling hebben geleid, komt dus niet zozeer
door de gebrekkige projectuitvoering en de problemen daarbij,
maar veeleer doordat in de keuze van sectoren onvoldoende rekening
is gehouden met toekomstig potentieel en te verwachten groeimogelijkheden.
In Tanzania, Mali en India waren vrijwel alle ontwikkelingsprojecten
gericht op stagnerende sectoren, met `gebrek aan dynamiek'. Terwijl
de doeltreffendheid, doelmatigheid en duurzaamheid van ontwikkelingshulp
voor een deel afhankelijk zullen zijn van de uitvoeringsmodaliteit,
wordt het uiteindelijk succes sterk bepaald door sectorkeuze en
programmainhoud.
<P>
In de ontwikkelingssamenwerking- `nieuwe stijl' zou &#190; op
basis van de IOVstudie en andere evaluaties gezocht dienen te
worden naar nieuwe uitgangspunten voor beleid, waarbij de doelstellingen
`economische verzelfstandiging' en `armoedebestrijding' het best
kunnen worden gescheiden. In het kader van `economische verzelfstandiging'
zou &#190; in plaats van ondersteuning van stagnerende sectoren
&#190; juist aansluiting gezocht moeten worden bij de sterkste
&#190; meest dynamische &#190; sectoren van de economie, waarbij
het streven o.a. zou kunnen worden gericht op maximalisatie van
het ontwikkelingseffect (o.a. door vergroting van het aantal begunstigden).
Nieuwe <I>mogelijkheden</I> &#190; en <I>niet</I> problemen &#190;
zouden uitgangspunt moeten vormen van beleid, waarbij niet langer
gezocht wordt naar `aanpassing', maar juist afdwinging van veranderingen.
Voorbeelden van sectoren waaraan door ontwikkelingssamenwerking
tot nu toe weinig aandacht is besteed, zijn de niettraditionele
agroexport, dienstverlening (inclusief toerisme) en handelsactiviteiten.
Ter versterking van de groeisectoren zou (o.a. via programmahulp)
ondersteuning kunnen worden verleend op een aantal voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking
nieuwe terreinen, zoals management &amp; organisatie, bedrijfsadministratie,
personeelsbeleid, marketing, informatica, logistiek en communicatie.
<P>
Gelijktijdig zou via een andere &#190; minder pretentieuze &#190;
lijn doorgegaan kunnen worden met <I>armoedebestrijding</I> 'oude
stijl', waarbij hoogstwaarschijnlijk gebruik gemaakt moet worden
van andere criteria en hulpkanalen. Gegeven de ruimtelijke concentratie
van de armoedeproblematiek (marginale, slecht ontsloten landbouwgebieden,
grote steden) en het gebrekkig kader lijkt in deze gebieden projecthulp
meer voor de hand te liggen dan programmasteun.
<P>
Voor `economische verzelfstandiging' en `armoedebestrijding' zou
afzonderlijk moeten worden bezien in welke vorm de hulp het beste
kan worden gegoten. De IOVstudie toont duidelijk dat het optimale
hulpkanaal niet bestaat, maar dat de juiste uitvoeringsmodaliteit
(eigen beheer, <I>joint cofinancing</I>, uitbesteding) en de rol
van de ambassade sterk afhankelijk zullen zijn van lokale en macroinstitutionele
omstandigheden.
<P>
Het zou jammer zijn als &#190; naar aanleiding van de IOVstudie
&#190; de discussie over toekomstig ontwikkelingsbeleid voornamelijk
zou worden toegespitst op uitvoeringsmodaliteiten (<I>hoe</I>
moet hulp worden geboden?), zonder dat voldoende aandacht wordt
besteed aan de inhoudelijke kant (<I>wat</I> moet worden gedaan?).
Het doel van ontwikkelingssamenwerking is niet het optimaliseren
van programma en projectadministratie, maar het afdwingen van
sociaaleconomische verbetering voor marginale groepen. De doeltreffendheid,
doelmatigheid en duurzaamheid worden slechts in beperkte mate
bepaald door `vormaspecten' en beheer; het succes van ontwikkelingsprogramma's
en projecten wordt uiteindelijk vooral bepaald door de <I>inhoud
van beleid</I> en de <I>keuze van sectoren</I>.

Donoren en democratiseringsprocessen in Afrika:<br>Het voorbeeld van Tsjaad<br>
</h2><H4><i>R. Buijtenhuijs</i></H4>
<h4>Volledige tekst van een artikel uit<i>  Internationale Spectator</i><br>jaargang 51, nummer 1, januari 1997: blz. 26 - 29.<P>Uitgave van Van Gorcum & Comp. b.v. (Assen) namens het Nederlands Instituut voor Internationale Betrekkingen "Clingendael" (Den Haag).

<H3>Abstract:<P>
</H3>
This article takes a close look at the implementation of the policy of good governance in Africa. Since about 1989, foreign donor countries as well as international organizations have translated this policy in the promotion of democracy and assistance to democratization. In particular in states that heavily depend on foreign aid one would expect donors to play a dominant role in democratization processes. The case of Chad since 1990 and the reluctant attitudes of its donors, however, illustrate the complexity of the problems (including the prevention of violence and the involvement of neighbouring states) and the difficulty of imposing strict guidelines.
<P>
<hr>
<P>
<B>Sinds omstreeks 1989 hebben de buitenlandse donoren die in
Afrika actief zijn (o.a. Frankrijk, de Verenigde Staten, Nederland,
de Scandinavische landen, de Wereldbank en het IMF) het begrip
"good governance" hoog in het vaandel geschreven. Volgens de heersende
opvattingen kan dit principe niet anders dan via democratisering
van de Afrikaanse politieke gemeenschappen worden verwezenlijkt.
Het ligt voor de hand dat de donoren er dus alles aan moeten doen
in de lopende democratiseringsprocessen een positieve rol te spelen.
Toch blijkt vaak dat de Afrikaanse praktijk veel gecompliceerder
is dan ze op het eerste gezicht lijkt. Het is voor de donoren
dan ook geenszins gemakkelijk duidelijke richtlijnen te formuleren
en die ook tot uitvoering te brengen. Ik zal dit trachten te illustreren
aan het voorbeeld van Tsjaad.</B>
<P>
In het kader van de hier behandelde problematiek is Tsjaad
juist een interessant geval, omdat het sterk afhankelijk is van
de economische hulp. Tsjaad is in alle opzichten een van de armste
landen ter wereld; de staatsinvesteringen vinden al jarenlang
met behulp van uitsluitend buitenlandse fondsen plaats. Zelfs
het lopende staatsbudget wordt voor een deel door donoren gedragen.
Als die donoren dus een duidelijke politiek zouden hebben op het
gebied van democratisering, zou het niet echt moeilijk zijn om
een dergelijke politiek ook dwingend op te leggen. Het aarzelend
optreden van de geldgevers in Tsjaad is daarom een des te duidelijker
bewijs van de complexiteit van de problemen waarmee men op het
terrein van democratisering te maken heeft.
<P>
<B>Een niet echt fatsoenlijk bewind</B>
<P>
Eind 1990 werd president Hissein Habr&#233; door Idriss
D&#233;by
verdreven. Hij was op dat moment wat men in Tsjaad een "seigneur
de la guerre" noemt en hij kwam absoluut niet op een democratische
manier aan het bewind. Ook nu, eind 1996, is er nog wel het een
en ander op zijn regime aan te merken. Zeker, onmiddellijk nadat
hij de Tsjaadse hoofdstad N'Djam&#233;na had ingenomen,
kondigde
D&#233;by aan dat hij Tsjaad zou gaan democratiseren, en
daar
is inderdaad ook een begin mee gemaakt <a href="#1">(1)</a>. Eind 1990 werd er al
een onafhankelijke pers toegestaan, die zich soms bijzonder fel
tegen het regime keert, maar toch getolereerd wordt. Sinds begin
1992 zijn politieke partijen weer legaal geworden (er zijn er
inmiddels al over de zestig), en ook die partijen kunnen min of
meer ongehinderd hun activiteiten ontplooien. Ten slotte is er
begin 1993 een<I> Conf&#233;rence Nationale Souveraine</I>
(CNS)
bijeengekomen, die het juridisch kader en de instellingen heeft
geschapen voor een overgangsperiode die zou moeten uitmonden in
vrije en eerlijke verkiezingen <a href="#2">(2)</a>.
<P>
Tot zover leken de zaken redelijk goed te gaan, al klaagden de
Tsjaadse oppositiepartijen dat het proces te langzaam verliep,
waar ze niet helemaal ongelijk in hadden. Vooral na de CNS kwam
er echter duidelijk de klad in het democratiseringsproces <a href="#3">(3)</a>. De
overgangsperiode, die oorspronkelijk bedoeld was hooguit twee
jaar te duren, is uiteindelijk uitgelopen tot een periode van
meer dan drie jaar. Dat kwam tot eind 1995 voornamelijk doordat
D&#233;by <I>c.s. </I>de zaak traineerden, daarmee
de indruk
wekkend dat ze niet zomaar, en liefst zo laat mogelijk, de macht
wilden afstaan. Meermalen nam de zittende regering inderdaad beslissingen
die ingingen tegen de geest van het democratiseringsproces, en
vooral tegen de door de CNS geformuleerde richtlijnen. Zo werd
het opstellen van de kiesregisters in eerste instantie toevertrouwd
aan het ministerie van binnenlandse zaken, wat weinig garantie
gaf voor een eerlijke registratie. Pas na veel protesten van oppositiegroeperingen
(en ook van het Franse ministerie van ontwikkelingssamenwerking)
keerde de regering op haar schreden terug en werd er een onafhankelijke
kiescommissie ingesteld. Dit had echter wel maanden vertraging
tot gevolg, terwijl het niet de indruk wekte dat het regime erop
uit was de zaken eerlijk te spelen.
<P>
Ook op een ander - nog belangrijker - punt,
namelijk
dat van de mensenrechten, kwam D&#233;by's bewind de eind
1990
gedane beloften niet na. Als gevolg van een dertig jaar durende
burgeroorlogstoestand zijn er in sommige delen van Tsjaad nog
steeds gewapende opstandige bewegingen actief. De regering bestrijdt
die, wat haar goed recht is, maar helaas gaat het regeringsleger,
in het bijzonder de direct onder de controle van D&#233;by
staande
<I>Forces d'intervention rapide</I> (FIR), daarbij
zonder aanziens
des persoons te werk en oefent het vaak een regelrecht terreurbewind
tegenover de burgerbevolking uit. Dit vooral in bepaalde delen
in het zuiden van het land, maar soms ook elders. Zo komen in
de hoofdstad herhaaldelijk personen die tot de politieke oppositie
behoren op verdachte wijze om het leven. Eind 1995 becijferde
de<I> Ligue Tchadienne des Droits de l'Homme</I> (LTDH)
dat er
in Tsjaad dagelijks gemiddeld drie mensen de dood vinden ten gevolge
van onwettig regeringsgeweld, dus meer dan duizend per jaar <a href="#4">(4)</a>.
Nog daargelaten de gewonden, waarvan sommigen voor het leven gehandicapt
blijven, en de verkrachte vrouwen, want ook daarover bestaan huiveringwekkende
maar helaas geloofwaardige berichten <a href="#5">(5)</a>. Al met al is D&#233;by's
bewind dus niet echt fatsoenlijk en "fr&#233;quentable"
te noemen.
<P>
<B>Niet geheel eerlijke verkiezingen</B>
<P>
Wat doe je als donor nu in zo'n geval? Op het eerste gezicht
lijkt dat nogal eenvoudig: proberen zoveel mogelijk druk uit te
oefenen op de zittende regering om zo snel mogelijk verkiezingen
te houden en trachten erop toe te zien dat die verkiezingen vrij
en eerlijk verlopen.
<P>
 Vreemd genoeg is de Tsjaadse praktijk niet precies volgens dit
schema verlopen. Weliswaar hebben de voornaamste donoren, in het
bijzonder Frankrijk, er vanaf het midden van 1995 voor geijverd
dat er inderdaad zo snel mogelijk verkiezingen kwamen, maar voor
een correct verloop ervan hebben ze zich niet echt ingezet. Bij
de presidentsverkiezingen van juni/juli 1996 is duidelijk gefraudeerd:
waarschijnlijk zou de winnaar, D&#233;by, ook zonder "trucjes"
als eerste uit de bus zijn gekomen, maar met een veel lagere score
dan hij volgens de offici&#235;le resultaten kan claimen <a href="#6">(6)</a>.
Het
gevolg is dat zijn legitimiteit bij een deel van de Tsjaadse bevolking
niet hoog is: een behoorlijke handicap voor zijn tweede, vijfjarige
ambtsperiode.
<P>
Met uitzondering van de Verenigde Staten, die (discreet, via
een persbericht van de plaatselijke ambassade) hun ongenoegen
over deze gang van zaken hebben uitgesproken, hebben de donoren
nauwelijks tegen de oneerlijk tot stand gekomen verkiezingsresultaten
geprotesteerd. Uitlatingen van plaatselijke vertegenwoordigers
van Frankrijk en de Verenigde Naties suggereerden zelfs dat zij
eigenlijk best tevreden waren met de uitslag en dat D&#233;by
in hun ogen zeker niet "de slechtste kandidaat" was, zoals door
&#233;&#233;n van hen werd geuit <a href="#7">(7)</a>.
<P>
Ook uit de wijze waarop de internationale waarneming geregeld
was kon men opmaken dat voor deze donoren het vrij en eerlijk
karakter van de verkiezingen slechts een bijzaak was. Er waren
weliswaar internationale waarnemers aanwezig - in totaal
bijna 150, afkomstig uit voornamelijk Frankrijk, Canada en een
aantal franssprekende Afrikaanse landen, maar zij kwamen slechts
vier dagen voor de verkiezingen in het land aan, maakten twee
dagen na de stemming - nog voordat zelfs maar de voorlopige
uitslag openbaar was gemaakt - hun eindrapport bekend
en
vlogen de volgende dag weer naar huis. Hun waarneming beperkte
zich dus uitsluitend tot wat er op de verkiezingsdag in de stemlokalen
gebeurde. Aan andere aspecten - het tot stand komen van
de
kiesregisters, de verkiezingscampagne in de media, het "fabriceren"
van de uiteindelijke uitslag - werd totaal geen aandacht
besteed. En juist d&#225;&#225;r nam de zittende regering
een loopje met de beginselen van eerlijkheid en vrijheid.
<P>
 De internationale waarnemers kwamen zodoende tot een lovende
evaluatie van de presidentsverkiezingen (op de dag van het stemmen
was alles inderdaad vrij netjes verlopen, althans daar waar de
waarnemers aanwezig waren geweest), een evaluatie die later door
Tsjaadse ambtsdragers is gebruikt om meer kritische commentatoren
de mond te snoeren <a href="#8">(8)</a>. Deze internationale waarneming vond plaats
onder auspici&#235;n van de Verenigde Naties en met materi&#235;le
steun van Frankrijk: het feit dat deze twee donoren genoegen namen
met waarnemers die door vele Tsjaders als "toeristen" werden aangeduid,
is een duidelijk bewijs van hun welwillendheid ten opzichte van
president D&#233;by. De waarneming was in wezen niet meer
dan
een routinekwestie. In de huidige opvattingen horen bij verkiezingen
in de "nieuwe" democratie&#235;n nu eenmaal waarnemers, en
daaraan
heeft men zich in Tsjaad dan ook - formeel -
gehouden,
maar meer dan een teken bestemd voor de buitenwereld was het niet.
<P>
<B>Het Burundi-syndroom</B>
<P>
 Hoe is deze, in eerste instantie vreemd aandoende, welwillendheid
te verklaren? De voornaamste reden is dat er in Tsjaad vrij heftige
spanningen zijn tussen het Noorden en het Zuiden van het land <a href="#9">(9)</a>,
waarbij in de context van de presidentsverkiezingen twee gegevens
van belang zijn.
<P>
 In de eerste plaats ging men er tot voor kort van uit dat het
Zuiden over een kleine demografische meerderheid beschikt en dat
het dus zou kunnen gebeuren dat eerlijke verkiezingen een uit
het Zuiden afkomstige president zouden opleveren <a href="#10">(10)</a>. Militair gezien
heeft echter het Noorden (of althans bepaalde groepen uit het
Noorden) de macht. Vooral D&#233;by's <I>Forces d'intervention
rapide</I>, die het monopolie hebben over alle zware wapens
in
het land, bestaan uit Noorderlingen, en meer in het bijzonder
uit Zaghawa en Bideyat, twee etnische groepen waarmee D&#233;by
nauwe banden heeft. Deze vertegenwoordigen in Tsjaad slechts een
zeer kleine minderheid, en zij hebben in de strijd tegen Hissein
Habr&#233; een beroep gedaan op de veel talrijker Zaghawa-bevolking
in het buurland Soedan. Een deel van de FIR bestaat dus uit militairen
wier nationaliteit hoogst twijfelachtig is, en die geheel afhankelijk
zijn van het regime-D&#233;by. In wezen geldt dit ook in
grote
mate voor de FIR-strijders die w&#233;l over de Tsjaadse
nationaliteit
beschikken. Bij de presidentsverkiezingen was dus de grote vraag:
zullen deze zwaarbewapende soldaten een voor hen ongunstige verkiezingsuitslag
als ware democraten aanvaarden of zullen ze zich verzetten en,
waar vooral de Fransen bang voor waren, aan het moorden slaan,
zodat uiteindelijk een ware genocide zal plaatsvinden, <I>&#224;
la</I> Rwanda en Burundi?
<P>
 In het kader van een dergelijke problematiek staat men dus in
zekere zin voor een <I>devil's alternative</I>: ofwel
men steunt
min of meer ondershands een bewind waarvan jaarlijks zo'n duizend
burgers het slachtoffer worden, ofwel men probeert dat bewind
weg te werken, met de kans dat er een situatie ontstaat waarbij
tienduizenden in &#233;&#233;n klap het leven verliezen.
Hoe
groot en re&#235;el die laatste kans was kan moeilijk worden
uitgemaakt,
maar het was niet uitsluitend een hersenschim. Volgens geruchten
die gedurende het voorjaar en de zomer van 1996 in N'Djam&#233;na
de ronde deden, lieten sommige legerofficieren inderdaad onder
vier ogen doorschemeren dat ze ieder middel zouden gebruiken om
te voorkomen dat een ander dan Idriss D&#233;by het presidenti&amp;euml;le
paleis zou betrekken <a href="#11">(11)</a> D&#233;by zelf heeft er trouwens
tijdens
zijn verkiezingscampagne zwaar op gehamerd dat hij de enige kandidaat
was die het Tsjaadse leger onder controle zou kunnen houden, en
dit <I>argument s&#233;curitaire</I> heeft hem
zeker stemmen
opgeleverd. Ten slotte kan men erop wijzen dat het scenario dat
vooral de Fransen in Tsjaad vreesden zich in Burundi letterlijk
heeft voltrokken, nl.:
<P>
<ol>
<li>Westerse donoren dringen sterk aan op verkiezingen;
<P>
<li>De heersende Tutsi-minderheid geeft aan
deze eisen toe;
<P>
<li>Een Hutu-kandidaat wint de presidentsverkiezingen;
<P>
<li>Het Tutsi-leger reageert en vermoordt de
nieuwe president;
met als gevolg
<P>
<li>een chaotische situatie, die al duizenden
mensenlevens
heeft ge&#235;ist en waarvan het eind nog niet in zicht is.</ol>
<P>
 In sommige Franse kringen vreesde men trouwens nog een ander
probleem dat samenhangt met Tsjaads verhouding met sommige buurlanden <a href="#12">(12)</a>.
Ook weer uitgaande van de onjuiste veronderstelling dat vrije
verkiezingen een uit het Zuiden afkomstige president zouden opleveren,
vroeg men zich af: hoe zullen Soedan, en vooral Libi&#235;,
hierop
reageren? Libi&#235; heeft jarenlang aanspraak gemaakt op
delen
van Noord-Tsjaad (de Aozou-strook, maar soms ook het gehele Tsjaadse
grondgebied boven de 16de breedtegraad) en het heeft deze gebieden
ook, dank zij ingrijpen in de Tsjaadse burgeroorlog, tijdelijk
militair weten te bezetten: in 1980 en opnieuw in de periode 1983-1987.
In 1987 werden de Libische bezettingstroepen door het Tsjaadse
leger verpletterend verslagen, waarop kolonel Kadhafi instemde
met het voorstel het grensgeschil aan het Internationale Gerechtshof
in Den Haag voor te leggen. De uitspraak van het Hof, in februari
1994, viel geheel in het voordeel van Tsjaad uit, en Libi&#235;
heeft zich - althans tot nog toe -  bij dit vonnis
neergelegd,
voor een deel uit respect voor de - uit het Noorden afkomstige
- Tsjaadse elitetroepen, voor een deel waarschijnlijk
ook
omdat president D&#233;by minder anti-Libisch is dan zijn
voorgangers
en redelijke betrekkingen met Kadhafi weet te onderhouden.
<P>
 Maar, zo luidde de vraag in sommige Franse kringen, wat zal er
gebeuren indien er in Tsjaad een Zuidelijke president aan de macht
komt? Zal Libi&#235; dan niet opnieuw zijn territoriale aanspraken
laten gelden, eventueel gesteund door ontevreden militaire groeperingen
uit Noord-Tsjaad? Zullen de Zuidelijke militairen binnen het Tsjaadse
leger in het geval van een gewapend conflict opgewassen zijn tegen
de met tanks uitgeruste Libische troepen? Ook van het fundamentalistisch
Soedan van Hassan Al Turabi vreesden dezelfde kringen negatieve
reacties, die de Franse belangen in Tsjaad en in de rest van Afrika
ernstig zouden kunnen schaden, zodat ook in deze context D&#233;by
uiteindelijk als het minste kwaad kon worden gezien.
<P>
<B>Militaire interventie?</B>
<P>
 Hadden de donoren er iets aan kunnen doen om deze eventuele negatieve
gevolgen te voorkomen en tegelijkertijd toch vrije en eerlijke
verkiezingen te laten houden? Ja, waarschijnlijk wel, maar het
enig mogelijk alternatief zou veel geld hebben gekost en zou ook
niet geheel zonder risico zijn geweest. Ik doel hier op het sturen
van een militaire vredesmacht die toezicht had moeten houden op
de verkiezingen, met als &#233;&#233;n van haar opdrachten 
de potentieel gevaarlijke Tsjaadse legereenheden te ontwapenen
of althans te neutraliseren, alsmede op te treden tegen eventuele
acties vanuit de buurlanden Libi&#235; en Soedan. Verscheidene
groeperingen in Tsjaad, zoals de <I>Ligue Tchadienne des
Droits
de l'Homme</I>, bepaalde politieke partijen, alsook de voornaamste
vakbond, de UST, hebben uitdrukkelijk voor een dergelijke oplossing
gepleit, en hebben zich zowel tot Frankrijk als de Verenigde Naties
gewend. Geen van de donoren is echter op deze suggesties ingegaan,
want, zoals gezegd, het zou handen vol geld gekost hebben, en
de Franse of VN-militairen hadden in gewapende conflicten verwikkeld
kunnen raken, waarbij ook onder hun gelederen slachtoffers hadden
kunnen vallen.
<P>
 Zoals elders (ex-Joegoslavi&#235;) is bewezen, is dit soort
risico's
moeilijk aan het thuisfront te verkopen. Bovendien zou een dergelijke
oplossing in wezen neerkomen op een soort "her-kolonisatie", iets
waar sommige Franse kringen die in Tsjaad actief zijn op zich
zelf niets tegen zouden hebben, maar dat toch ook onder de huidige
omstandigheden als "politiek niet correct" zou worden beschouwd.
Vandaar dat de voornaamste donoren in Tsjaad Idriss D&#233;by
<I>c.s</I>. tijdens de presidentsverkiezingen hun
gang hebben
laten gaan, "om erger te voorkomen". Men kan dit op grond van
abstracte democratiseringsprincipes betreuren (hetgeen schrijver
dezes ook diep in zijn hart doet), maar men moet toegeven dat
een situatie zoals die zich in Tsjaad voordeed, de donoren voor
een re&#235;el dilemma stelde, waarvoor geen eenvoudige oplossingen
bestaan. Ongetwijfeld is Tsjaad in deze ook geen uitzonderingsgeval.
Recente gebeurtenissen in Angola, Mozambique, Somali&#235;,
Liberia
en Niger, om er maar een paar te noemen, vallen eveneens in de
categorie van problemen die donoren, hoe oprecht ze ook zouden
zijn in hun streven naar democratisering, niet met pasklare antwoorden
tot een oplossing kunnen brengen.
<P>
<B>Voetnoten</B>
<P>
<a name=1></a>1. Onder Hissein Habr&#233;(1982-1990) had zich een bijzonder
autoritair regime ontwikkeld, dat de mensenrechten met voeten
trad. Frankrijk heeft daar uiteindelijk geen genoegen mee genomen
en hoewel het Idriss D&#233;by niet officieel geholpen heeft
in zijn gewapende strijd, zijn er aan de opstandige beweging toch
net voldoende steuntjes in de rug gegeven om hem in staat te stellen
de macht te veroveren. D&#233;by's belofte tot democratisering
moet o.a. gezien worden als een "tegenprestatie" voor discrete
steun van de zijde van Frankrijk.

<P>
<a name=10></a>10.  In werkelijkheid gaat het hier om een mythe. Demografisch gezien
houden Noord en Zuid elkaar, volgens de resultaten van de volkstelling
van april 1993, min of meer in evenwicht, terwijl bovendien, tijdens
de kiezersregistratie van 1995-1996, zich meer Noordelijke dan
Zuidelijke kiezers hebben ingeschreven. Niemand in Tsjaad, met
inbegrip van de donoren, heeft zich de moeite gegeven om van deze
gegevens kennis te nemen. De heersende mythe be&#239;nvloedde
dus de percepties en het gedrag van de donoren.

A l'heure actuelle, &quot;le dialogue c&egrave;de le pas &agrave;
la conditionnalit&eacute;, per&ccedil;ue comme des conditions
impos&eacute;es de l'ext&eacute;rieur. C'est &agrave; mon avis
un concept vou&eacute; &agrave; l'&eacute;chec. En effet, aucune
r&eacute;forme n'a r&eacute;ussi, qui n'ait pas &eacute;t&eacute;
assum&eacute;e et soutenue activement par le pays m&ecirc;me,
par son gouvernement et par sa population. &quot;Appropriation&quot;
ne doit pas devenir un nouveau slogan, mais le mot refl&egrave;te
exactement l'exigence essentielle &agrave; toute r&eacute;forme
r&eacute;ussie. Cela est vrai &agrave; plus forte raison &agrave;
une &eacute;poque o&ugrave; les r&eacute;formes &eacute;conomiques
et politiques - ajustement structurel et d&eacute;mocratisation
- ont tendance &agrave; co&iuml;ncider, car &agrave; mesure qu'une
soci&eacute;t&eacute; devient plus libre, elle accepte plus difficilement
des conditions impos&eacute;es de l'ext&eacute;rieur. La voie
&agrave; emprunter doit donc &ecirc;tre le retour au dialogue,
aux n&eacute;gociations entre partenaires pour arriver &agrave;
des conditions mutuellement accept&eacute;es. Ce n'est pas une
question de laxisme, mais de style et de culture.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Il faudra examiner, plus soigneusement que par le pass&eacute;,
qui a vraiment besoin d'une aide au d&eacute;veloppement et qui
la m&eacute;rite. Les partenaires doivent abandonner l'id&eacute;e
selon laquelle ils auraient droit &agrave; l'aide, comme c'est
devenu l'attitude dans le cadre de Lom&eacute;.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Il faudra nettement diff&eacute;rencier l'octroi des fonds
selon 1) les besoins (les pays les plus pauvres et les couches
de la population les plus pauvres doivent &ecirc;tre servis prioritairement),
2) les performances en mati&egrave;re de d&eacute;veloppement
(efforts propres, acceptation de r&eacute;formes, etc.) et 3)
les performances politiques. Il convient d'&ecirc;tre tout particuli&egrave;rement
prudent &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de ce dernier crit&egrave;re.
La protection des droits fondamentaux de l'homme et une bonne
gestion des ressources (&quot;good governance&quot;) me semblent
plus importantes que les aspects formels de la d&eacute;mocratie.&quot;

Images of humanitarian crises: ethical implications</h3>
<H5>by G. Holleuffer, CICR, Geneva</H5>.</center>
<hr>
          With  the  long-heralded  advent  of  the  information  age, 
 the
          upheaval  caused by the proliferation of visual technologies 
in a
          society  dominated by the media is forcing the entire spectru
m of
          what  used  to  be  called  "the  press"  to  redefine itself
, to
          reassess  its  professional  code  of  ethics  and  to devise
 new
          working  methods.  Only by examining the role played by image
s in
          the global flow of information - especially their relationshi
p to
          the written word - can we fully grasp what is at stake. Our w
orld
          view is increasingly shaped by the images, televised or in pr
int,
          to  which  the  public is constantly exposed. Indeed, so grea
t is
          their power that one can say, along with many analysts, that 
they
          are   beginning   to   replace   reality:   only  what  has  
been
          authenticated,  certified  and validated by being photographe
d or
          filmed  and  shown  on  television really exists. As these im
ages
          bombard  us  from  all  sides,  everything that has not been 
seen
          captured  on film is reduced to oblivion. What makes the powe
r of
          images so irresistible?
<P>
          Images  impart  values. They attract or repel. They appeal to
 our
          imagination,   play  on  our  feelings  and  rouse  us  from 
 our
          complacency:  in  other words, images stir our conscience bec
ause
          they  purport to show us, in the raw, the unadorned, indisput
able
          reality  of  things  as  they  are.  That  is  television's g
reat
          ambition,  that  is  its purpose; and that is what prompted R
_gis
          Debray  to  say  that "television is fond of humanitarian sto
ries
          since they are both human interest stories and moral tales". 
Over
          the  years,  images of humanitarian action have invaded the m
edia
          and fired people's imagination. They are standard fare on TV 
news
          programmes  and  have pride of place in newspapers and magazi
nes.
          Humanitarian  work  is  probably  the  field  most  rife with
 the
          contrasts  that  make  for powerful images: stark reality and
 the
          moral  cause  to  which it gives rise; tragedy and the charit
able
          response  to  it;  evil and the good deeds accomplished to co
mbat
          it.
<P>
          The  presentation of facts and the moral response to them are
 now
          so  closely  interrelated  that  all  those who provide image
s of
          humanitarian action - whether media professionals or humanita
rian
          organizations    themselves   -   share   a   heavy   burden 
  of
          responsibility.  For  what  moral  justification can be found
 for
          broadcasting,  night  after  night,  all  too summary newsfla
shes
          showing   throngs  of  starving  people,  piles  of  corpses 
 and
          seemingly endless scenes of horror? And what justification ca
n be
          found  for showing certain scenes rather than others? Finally
, is
          any  serious attempt made to explain what is shown? It would 
seem
          that  the  legitimate  moral  questions  which  pictures of h
uman
          tragedy raise for television viewers or readers too often rec
eive
          unsatisfactory answers. The media increasingly confine themse
lves
          to  covering  -  the  word,  with  its  sense  of covering up
, is
          appropriate   -  humanitarian  crises  and  situations  of  a
rmed
          conflict in all too superficial a way: by concentrating on vi
sual
          shock  effects,  they  only  scratch  the surface of the prob
lems
          raised.  As for humanitarian organizations, the competition w
hich
          they  face  on  the "humanitarian market" encourages a deplor
able
          tendency  to  appeal  to  people's  emotions and to publicize
 and
          promote  their  own  activities. Visual portrayals of victims
 and
          acts  of  atrocity are thus seen as a means of boosting the i
mage
          of  humanitarian  organizations.  Eventually,  distracted  by
 the
          goals  they pursue, the purveyors of such images forget that 
they
          depict  real  human beings and that respect must be shown for
 the
          dignity of the "subject" which is offered up for public scrut
iny.
<P>
          Three  disturbing  tendencies,  ranging  from  the general to
 the
          specific,  reflect  the  ethical  challenge  posed by the med
ia's
          exploitation of images showing human suffering:<BR>
<UL>
          <LI> The  selectiveness  of news coverage. What gives the med
ia the
          right to focus attention on one situation rather than on anot
her?
          Why  is  the  conflict  in  Bosnia-Herzegovina  constantly in
 the
          limelight,  and not the conflicts which are ravaging Afghanis
tan,
          Angola  and  Cambodia?  Why did the news agencies, which comp
lain
          that  their  budgets  do not allow them to cover the whole wo
rld,
          devote  huge  sums,  and in some cases their entire resources
, to
          reporting  on  the Gulf War? This is where the harmful effect
s of
          competition  between news agencies can be felt; where the cho
ices
          made  by the most powerful can be seen to determine the direc
tion
          taken by all the others.<P>

          <LI>Ever-faster  reporting.  The  tyranny  of  real  time  a
nd the
          technical  feats of live broadcasting have an accelerating ef
fect
          that  leads  to  an  "information  overload": so many live im
ages
          flood the television screens that our minds are saturated by 
them
          and  we  end up by not caring. Real time reporting has a perv
erse
          effect,  too,  in  that it precludes any in-depth interpretat
ion:
          events  are  shown  either  too soon or too late, but in any 
case
          there  is no room for analysis, no time to gain perspective. 
How,
          then,  can  things  be rationally understood? How can politic
ians
          make decisions when everything happening everywhere is consta
ntly
          - and instantly - before their eyes? Under this avalanche of 
live
          images, there is no time for analysing events, or for the typ
e of
          investigative journalism for which the Watergate reporters be
came
          famous.  What  benefit  did CNN's millions of viewers derive 
from
          the  live  ruminations of Peter Arnett as he filmed and comme
nted
          on what he saw from the window of his hotel in Baghdad during
 the
          Gulf War? We are inundated with live images! But what informa
tion
          do  they convey? Is it really all too complicated for the gen
eral
          public,  as  is  sometimes  claimed? The most important thing
, it
          seems,  is  to  offer people images to help them visualize ra
ther
          than understand. The means have become the end. Such a failur
e to
          provide  any  form  of  interpretation  or insight will end u
p by
          making  an  appalling  stereotype  seem natural, that of huma
nity
          divided  into  two  groups  treated unequally by fate: on the
 one
          hand  all  those who are suffering, and are inevitably victim
ized
          by  "savages",  and  on the other hand all those who are not.
 The
          more  fortunate  among  us  derive a sense of security from b
eing
          shown an evil that only affects others, and to which humanita
rian
          assistance,  which  soothes  our  conscience, is the providen
tial
          solution.  Such  a  fatalistic  world  view, combined with su
ch a
          stereotypical  conception  of  humanitarian  action,  leads  
to a
          general  abdication  of  responsibility:  how  many times hav
e we
          heard  people  say, speaking of Somalia or the former Yugosla
via,
          that  those  who  live there "have constantly been fighting a
mong
          themselves and always will"?
<P>
          <LI>News  voyeurism.  Should  every  image  be  shown  -  an
d  can
          everything  be  visually conveyed? The use of shocking images
 has
          long been criticized, and the unease about showing them has g
rown
          as  never  before since 1985, when, as everyone recalls, the 
slow
          death  of  Omayra  Sanchez, a little girl trapped in the mud,
 was
          broadcast minute by agonizing minute on television. Reporters
 and
          photographers,  spurred  on  by  the  logic  of real time and
 the
          pursuit  of  sensational  stories,  too  easily  give  in  to
 the
          temptation  to  outdo one another in portraying scenes of hor
ror.
          What  respect  is  shown  for  human  dignity  when  sufferin
g is
          depicted  without  its  cause being explained? Or when people
 who
          are  valiantly  struggling  for  survival in the midst of com
plex
          crises are presented as dazed shadows of themselves, condemne
d to
          live  in  filth,  irretrievably  lost  and  entirely dependen
t on
          humanitarian   aid?   In  portraying  these  people's  suffer
ing,
          photographers  use all their skills of composition to enhance
 it,
          to  make  it  more  "artistic".  Recently,  a  New York publi
sher
          expressed  admiration for a photographer whose pictures, take
n in
          Rwanda,   achieved   their   aesthetic  effect  by  suggestin
g  a
          relationship  between  death,  suffering  and filth. Underpin
ning
these  clich&#233;se  clich&#233;s,  this cult of visibility in and for itself,

is an
          obscenity that tramples on human dignity. This leads, in the 
end,
          to the deliberately provocative advertising "ethics" of Benet
ton,
          which at least makes no secret of the fact that its campaigns
 are
          based  on  the  appeal of obscenity (see, for example, the la
test
          issue  of  its  magazine: Colors - War, Shopping, Fashion, Tr
avel
          and Genocide).
</UL>
<P>
          The  huge  challenge  posed  by  these  three  very  question
able
          tendencies calls for a concerted, ethical response:

          News  selectiveness must be countered with a moral code of vi
sual
          portrayal,  in  other  words an attitude which, based on a gl
obal
          analysis  of  humanitarian  needs  in  the  world,  would mak
e it
          possible to establish priorities according to other criteria 
than
          audience  ratings  and  traditional  political  and  other ve
sted
          interests;   an   attitude   which,   in   this   age  of  gl
obal
          communications, would prompt the media to redefine their task
 and
          to  report  on  events  in  all  parts  of  the world (in Bos
nia-
          Herzegovina,  of  course,  but  also  in Kurdistan, Sudan, Si
erra
          Leone,  Afghanistan  and  Angola), thereby maintaining an ove
rall
          balance  instead  of  simply  showing  disconnected  fragment
s of
          reality.
<P>
          The  tyranny  of real time must be countered with a moral cod
e of
          slower-paced  reporting  that is conducive to reflection. Ins
tead
          of  dispatching images as fast as possible, time must be take
n to
          explain,  to  give a balanced picture by showing different po
ints
          of  view, so that images are no longer used to cut costs but 
once
          again serve their ultimate purpose of providing information.

          Finally,  the  alarming  drift towards obscenity in depicting
 the
          victims  of  humanitarian  crises  must be countered with a m
oral
          code  to uphold human dignity. Trapped as they are in complex
 and
          cruel  situations, these people nevertheless remain human bei
ngs:
          their  suffering  must  certainly be shown, but with decency,
 and
          with  respect for their privacy. These men and women are not 
mute
          symbols of suffering: they are thinking, sentient individuals
 who
          have  their  own  lives, their own hopes, and are often the f
irst
          and  foremost  partners  of  humanitarian  agencies. They mus
t be
          allowed to speak up; the often formidable efforts which they 
have
          made  to  help  themselves must be shown, along with the joy 
they
          take  in life whenever they manage to find a moment's respite
; so
          must  the  courage  and  dignity  with  which  they  accept t
heir
          suffering and face the dangers that threaten them.

          This  is  a  tall  order, and one that calls for intense dial
ogue
          between  media professionals and humanitarian organizations. 
More
          and  more  often  it  is these organizations, whose experienc
e is
          essential  for meeting the ethical challenge just described, 
that
          draw  up  guidelines  stating  how  images  should  be  used 
 and
          information conveyed.
<P>
          When wanton acts of violence are committed, nothing is worse 
than
          the failure to investigate and report on what has happened an
d to
          obtain  images that can be used to alert public opinion. Even
 so,
          it  is  questionable whether any image is better than no imag
e at
          all.  It  is  high  time  to  revive the noble tradition of p
hoto
          journalism as it was practised in the past - a tradition in w
hich
          the  use  of  images  is  well-nigh  inseparable  from the ar
t of
          commentary, analysis and narrative discourse. Images, used al
one,
          blindfold  our  intelligence;  and  when we attempt to dissoc
iate
          images  and speech, imagination and reasoning, we are playing
 the

<title>ODI - Briefing Paper 4/94</title>
</head>
<body>
<h3>THREE KEY POLICY AREAS</h3>
<hr>
<b>Land</b><br>
 Both the NP and the ANC recognise the importance of rural development and expanding access to land, but priorities and approaches differ. The ANC argues that a national land reform programme is central to future rural development. In contrast to the NP which places major emphasis on market-based initiatives, the ANC's approach would comprise a redistribution of residential and productive land to those who need it (but cannot afford it), and restitution for those who lost land because of the apartheid laws. All major groupings, including the farmers' union, have now accepted the need for some sort of reform, including restitution, but the precise way forward has not been agreed. 
<p>
Yet the problems of executing a significant land and wider agricultural reform programme are immense, not least because of differing views about the relative importance to be given to this issue. While the rural areas contain some 35% of the population (40% of the black population), the combined effect of decades of neglect of small-scale black agriculture, high differentials between rural and urban incomes and the higher level of urbanisation has been to down-play the importance of rural reform. Equally, studies by the World Bank suggest that a reform programme which transferred 30% of white land to blacks, with the latter providing 20% of the costs from their own resources and borrowing a further 30%, would cost about Rand 13bn (some US$3.5bn) at 1993 prices (a transfer of about 3% of national income), but would only lead to some 600,000 people being resettled.
<p>
Given the scale and complexity of the problems, it is unlikely that a comprehensive new land and rural development programme will start for some time.
<p>
<b>Industrial and trade reform</b><br>
 Industrial and international trade reform are closely related policy issues. All sides of the policy debate want to lower rates of external protection, reduce across-the-board subsidies to inefficient industries, and diversify exports. All sides, too, argue that the necessary industrial restructuring needs to be sensitive to potential employment losses. 
<p>
Thereafter, at one extreme, the NEM approach would aim to increase the influence of the market by working to reduce subsidies and trade protectionism as rapidly as possible. It acknowledges that 'temporary adjustment assistance' will be needed 'during the transition' but argues that 'no selective discretion ... should take forms which contradict the basic principles of the general adjustment programme'.
<p>
In contrast, an ANC/MERG approach would aim to change structures through improving industrial performance and expanding production by deliberate policy. Specific initiatives would include promoting competition both by stimulating small and medium-sized enterprise and by pursuing a vigorous anti-trust policy, consistent with recent reports and recommendations from South Africa's Competition Board. Major emphasis would also be placed on a series of policy measures aimed at raising productivity levels, and at expanding industrial output and exports, boosted initially by direct incentives.
<p>
<b>Mining</b><br>
Neither major party questions that the new government should encourage continued expansion of the mining sector, including further foreign investment, and that, as a result, no new mining taxes should be introduced for the foreseeable future. What remains unclear is the extent to which a future ANC-led government would act to take reserves into state ownership and precisely how it would encourage the industry to increase the degree of mineral processing prior to export. The ANC has argued that its wish to pass mineral rights to the state is intended only to bring South Africa in line with public ownership in other countries, while sweeping suggestions to institute a national marketing body to oversee the export of certain specified minerals now appear to have been dropped. 
<p>
In the immediate post-election period, a 'mining forum' is likely to be set up quickly. This would comprise representatives of the new government, the (non-foreign) mining companies and the unions; it would be given the task of first continuing the debate, and then thrashing out the details of a new mining policy for the country.

<H3>Abstract:<P>
</H3>
This article contributes to the debate on the re-evaluation of Dutch foreign policy on the basis of five items considered essential for this debate: 1. the concepts used in the debate should be more clarified; 2. the limited impact of political science; 3. the expansion of the concept of "security"; 4. the often misleading use of the "national interest" concept; and 5. bureaucratic/organizational contradictions and lack of coherence.

<P>
<B>In 1991 (drie jaar na het wonderjaar 1989) onderbraken wij met
de werkgroep `Buitenlands Beleid van Nederland' (B4) ons normale
onderzoekprogramma en publiceerden wij een bundel essayachtige
stukken over de rol van Nederland in de sinds 1989 zo veranderende
wereld. Wij bepleitten toen het houden van een `grand debate'
over de vraag welke gevolgen de veranderingen in de wereld zouden
moeten hebben voor het Nederlands beleid.<a href="#1">(1)</a> Weliswaar niet op onze
wenken, want pas vier jaar later worden we nu bediend, althans
zouden we bediend kunnen worden, wanneer het debat over de `herijking'
zich niet beperkt tot de vraag wie hoeveel waaraan moet betalen.</B>
<P>
<a name=inleiding></a><B>Inleiding</B>
<P>
Over zowel de noodzaak als de wenselijkheid van een groot debat
is al het nodige gezegd. De wereld van nu is immers in tal van
opzichten een andere dan die waar we tot voor kort mee vertrouwd
en aan gehecht waren. Dat de wereld er na 1989 eerder meer dan
minder ingewikkeld uitziet, is even duidelijk. Ook over de onduidelijke
term `herijking' en de al even ongelukkige suggestie dat men de
wereld even zou kunnen stilzetten, terwijl Nederland nadenkt en
pas op de plaats maakt, is al het nodige gezegd.
<P>
De term suggereert misschien ook te veel dat `beleid' een soort
meesterplan is van samenhangende doeleinden, instrumenten en strategie&euml;n.
Zo is het niet, of maar zeer ten dele. Wat voor `beleid' doorgaat,
is in de praktijk vaak helemaal geen grootse conceptie vooraf,
maar eerder de resultante van vele tientallen kleine beslissingen
en van doormodderen, waar men achteraf enige lijn in ontdekt.
Het woord `herijking' suggereert ook een vorm van eenmalige evaluatie
die de zaken voor langere tijd vastlegt. Zo is het echter niet,
al zullen bijvoorbeeld eventuele wijzigingen in de departementale
en bureaucratische structuur niet weer van de ene dag op de andere
ongedaan kunnen worden gemaakt.<a href="#2">(2)</a> Ook zijn de beperkingen, internationaal
en nationaal, waaronder beleidsvorming plaatsheeft zodanig, dat
radicale beleidswendingen zelden mogelijk zijn. Evaluatie is echter
niet iets dat eenmalig moet gebeuren, maar continu plaatsvindt,
of zou moeten vinden, in de vorm van kritische reflectie over
doelstellingen en prioriteiten enerzijds, en over werkwijze en
behaalde of uitgebleven resultaten anderzijds.
<P>
Dat wil natuurlijk niet zeggen dat het geen zin heeft van tijd
tot tijd een stapje achteruit te doen en van enige afstand naar
eigen doen en laten te kijken. Uit de nood van partijpolitieke
onenigheid over budgettaire prioriteiten zou nog best een deugd
kunnen worden gemaakt in de vorm van een systematisch debat over
doelstellingen, middelen en organisatie van het buitenlands beleid,
en dan bij voorkeur in de meest brede zin. Zover is het nog niet
en of het ooit zover zal komen, mag worden betwijfeld.
<P>
Het grote debat is in ieder geval nog niet echt op gang gekomen.
Dat ligt goeddeels aan het kabinet en in het bijzonder aan de
nauwst betrokkenen, die ons, afgezien van de aangekondigde intenties,
nog geheel in het duister laten tasten over de vraag of het alleen
maar om het geld zal gaan (de verdeling van de &#166;400 miljoen
die voor nieuw beleid beschikbaar is of ook een herverdeling van
bestaande middelen), dan wel of ook de substantie van het beleid,
de doelstellingen en prioriteiten enerzijds en de instrumenten
en organisatie anderzijds, aandacht zal krijgen. Er is geen regeringsstandpunt
waar men op kan steunen of schieten. Wat we zien is een minister
Van Mierlo die honderd bloemen laat bloeien, terwijl zijn beide
collega's Pronk en Voorhoeve elkaar de hand boven het hoofd houden
en andere bewindslieden hun claims indienen. Het echte debat wordt
niet afgesloten met een positiebepaling van de regering, maar
zal dan pas beginnen.
<P>
Wat we tot dusverre wel hebben, zijn &#190; min of meer overwogen
-bijdragen en losse flodders van partijen en organisaties en van
individuele politici. De ontwikkelingslobby is bezig te mobiliseren,
de werkgeversorganisatie VNO liet van zich horen en de vredesbeweging
zint ook op nieuwe kansen het beleid in de door haar gewenste
richting te sturen. Voor zover er een debat is, heeft het nog
weinig samenhang, richting en structuur. Dat is jammer, want de
zaken die op het spel staan zijn er belangrijk genoeg voor.
<P>
Ik wil mij in deze bijdrage aan het debat concentreren op vijf
punten die bij de herijking aan de orde zijn of zouden moeten
komen. Zij vertonen natuurlijk wel verwantschap, maar staan toch
min of meer op zichzelf. Ik sluit af met enige suggesties in welke
richting het beleid gewijzigd en verbeterd zou kunnen worden.
<P>
<a name=begrippenapparaat></a><B>Het begrippenapparaat</B> 
<P>
Zonder duidelijke begrippen heeft geen enkel debat kans op succes,
wanneer dat debat tenminste niet is gericht op punten scoren,
maar op het verkrijgen van beter inzicht. Daarin onderscheidt
zich de wetenschap van de politiek.
<P>
`Herijking' en het ook wel gebruikte `ontschotting' zijn beide
onduidelijke begrippen. Misbruik of oneigenlijk gebruik van de
termen ligt daarom op de loer. Aangezien ze nu toch gebruikt worden,
een enkele opmerking. Onder `herijking' versta ik een stelselmatige
beoordeling van het beleid. Dat kan en zal, als het goed en grondig
gaat, in verschillende termen en langs verschillende dimensies
plaatsvinden. Allereerst gaat het om de doelstellingen, richting
en intensiteit (prioriteiten) van beleid. Wat wil men bereiken?
Wat heeft de voorrang? En wat moet wijken als niet alles tegelijk
of ineens kan?
<P>
Vervolgens komt de vraag naar de daartoe nodige en beschikbare
middelen en instrumenten (financieel/militair/hulp en handel/diplomatie),
alsmede de organisatie van beleidsvoorbereiding, -vorming en -uitvoering.
Samen vormen ze de <U>input</U>-kant van het beleid. Ze kunnen
afzonderlijk, maar ook in hun onderlinge samenhang worden geanalyseerd.
<P>
Aan de andere kant staan de resultaten (de <U>output</U>-kant).
Wat heeft al die <U>input</U> aan geld, tijd en energie opgeleverd?
Kan het beter, effectiever, effici&euml;nter? Het gaat daarbij
niet alleen om de gewilde effecten; ook moet men rekening houden
met niet-beoogde en niet-verwachte, positieve en negatieve, effecten.
Resultaten kunnen worden gemeten naar hun effectiviteit (doelbereiking),
bijvoorbeeld de invloed van Nederland op een bepaald besluit,
en naar hun <U>efficiency</U> (het rendement van ingezette middelen).
Effectiviteit en <U>efficiency</U> zijn niet hetzelfde. Ideaal
is wellicht dat beide hoog zijn, maar ook zijn nog aanvaardbare
combinaties hoog-laag denkbaar, terwijl beide natuurlijk ook laag
kunnen zijn (volgens het door F. Bolkestein en anderen geschetste
beeld van het resultaat van ontwikkelingshulp).
<P>
Goed beleid betekent de optimale inzet van schaarse middelen.
Idealiter zou het marginale rendement van iedere ingezette gulden/ambtenaar
op het brede terrein van de buitenlandse politiek gelijk en, voor
zover nog niet gerealiseerd, de maatstaf bij reallocatie van middelen
moeten zijn. Maar dat rendement (bijvoorbeeld, in onderlinge vergelijking,
van militaire uitgaven, ontwikkelingshulp of assistentie aan de
herstructurering in Midden- en Oost-Europa) is vaak slechts bij
benadering, en meestal in het geheel niet, te meten. Daartoe ontbreekt
het instrumentarium ten enen male en zijn de doelstellingen meestal
te vaag.<a href="#3">(3)</a> Bovendien zijn de doelstellingen vaak zeer uiteenlopend
en onderling onvergelijkbaar en zijn daardoor de criteria voor
succes of falen te verschillend. Hulp kan bijvoorbeeld worden
gegeven aan land A, en niet aan land B, omdat het verwachte rendement
daar het hoogst of de behoefte het grootst is, dan wel om redenen
van direct economisch belang of van veiligheidspolitieke aard.
De aard van het doel en het perspectief van waaruit daarnaar gekeken
wordt, zullen het oordeel over de effectiviteit kleuren of zelfs
geheel bepalen.
<P>
Zonder de dobbelsteen als belangrijkste hulpmiddel bij de beleidsvorming
te hanteren, moet worden erkend dat we natuurlijk wel politieke
voorkeuren kunnen uitspreken en verschuivingen in prioriteiten
kunnen bepleiten, maar dat de bepaling van effectiviteit goeddeels
natte-vingerwerk blijft. Wie iets anders beweert, maakt zich schuldig
aan misleiding. Toch lijkt het voor de hand te liggen het debat
meer dan tot dusver het geval is te richten op het te verwachten
rendement van onze inspanningen en minder op het formuleren van
nieuwe, mooie doelstellingen.
<P>
In het debat wordt gesproken over `herijking' en over `ontschotting'.
Voor zover die begrippen iets betekenen, is dat niet hetzelfde.
Het eerste is algemeen, het tweede kan een specifiek gevolg zijn
van het eerste, niet andersom. Ontschotting zie ik als het in
hun onderling verband analyseren van deelproblemen enerzijds en
het wegnemen van daarbij horende organisatorische en bureaucratische
scheidslijnen anderzijds. Het verwachte resultaat daarvan is gemeenlijk
de vergroting van de samenhang en daarmee van de effectiviteit
van het beleid. Bij sommigen bestaat vooral de, al dan niet heimelijke,
verwachting dat ontschotting ook tot andere beleidsprioriteiten
zal leiden. Ontschotting kan dus leiden tot meer inhoudelijke
en tot grotere organisatorische samenhang.
<P>
Bij pleidooien voor ontschotting wordt vaak gesproken over `integratie'
en `co&ouml;rdinatie' van beleid. Het beleid zou te versnipperd
zijn om effectief te zijn. Departementen zouden tegen elkaar in
werken, terwijl dat best te vermijden zou zijn. Het zijn echter
vaak niet meer dan toverwoorden, die weinig inhoudelijks betekenen.
Als men niets anders weet te verzinnen, is dat altijd nog goed.
Het lijkt vervelend dat de linkerhand niet weet wat de rechter
doet, maar er is evenwel weinig aan de hand, zolang ze niet precies
hetzelfde doen of elkaar niet manifest in de weg zitten.
<P>
Ernstiger is de situatie waarbij ze elkaar wel tegenwerken. In
het eerste geval is het probleem nogal triviaal. Het gaat er dan
om door eliminatie van dubbelwerk tot <U>efficiency-</U>verbetering
te komen. Die kan het gevolg zijn van ontschotting. Dat kan overigens
ook het gevolg zijn van andere maatregelen die niet of slechts
oneigenlijk als ontschotting kunnen worden aangemerkt, bijvoorbeeld
veranderingen in de relaties tussen de krijgsmachtdelen en eliminatie
van dubbel werk (departementale structuur, opleidingen, transportcapaciteit).
Daartoe is echter geen inhoudelijke herijkingsoperatie, maar slechts
het aandraaien van de budgettaire duimschroef nodig.
<P>
Het tweede geval, waarbij delen van de overheid tegenstrijdige
belangen nastreven, is problematischer.
<P>
<a name=beperkte></a><B>Beperkte rol van de wetenschap</B> 
<P>
Vanwege alle onzekerheden en vanwege het feit dat persoonlijke
taxaties en waardeoordelen een zeer grote rol spelen, kan de wetenschap
slechts van beperkt nut zijn in het herijkingsdebat. Politieke
oordelen zullen doorslaggevend zijn, en dat kan niet anders. Over
de vraag wat hoofddoelstellingen en prioriteiten in beleid behoren
te zijn (wat mede inhoudt hoeveel geld waarvoor wordt uitgetrokken),
is en blijft steeds legitiem verschil van mening mogelijk. Dat
zijn en blijven in essentie politieke vragen, waarvoor dan ook
niet het waarheidsgehalte van de wetenschap geclaimd kan worden.
Wel kan deze op twee manieren hulp bieden: <U>a</U> door een bijdrage
te leveren aan (meer) analytische duidelijkheid en aan de zuivering
van het gehanteerde begrippenapparaat; en <U>b</U> doordat zij
op grond van meer dan willekeurig gekozen voorbeelden uitspraken
kan doen over bijvoorbeeld het te verwachten rendement van bepaalde
inspanningen. Systematische beleidsevaluatie is tot op zekere
hoogte mogelijk (zoals dat bijvoorbeeld ook gebeurt door de Inspectie
Ontwikkelingssamenwerking). Problematisch blijft echter de onzekerheid
over de vraag of bepaalde uitkomsten aan Nederlandse inspanningen
kunnen worden toegeschreven, terwijl de onkwantificeerbaarheid
van bepaalde uitkomsten het opmaken van een balans steeds zal
bemoeilijken. Men denke bijvoorbeeld aan de recente discussie
over de kosten en baten van ons lidmaatschap van de Europese Unie.<a href="#4">(4)</a>
<P>
Ik richt mij hieronder vooral op het eerste type bijdrage aan
het debat en wel in het bijzonder op twee benaderingen van het
probleem van de herijking/ontschotting, die zeker <U>niet</U>
zinvol zijn en zelfs averechts kunnen uitwerken: <U>1</U> het
zoeken van een oplossing in een voortdurende uitdijing van begrippen;en
<U>2</U> het forceren van keuzen met een beroep op `het nationaal
belang'.
<P>
<a name=uitdijend></a><B>Het uitdijend heelal van het veiligheidsbegrip</B> 
<P>
Het is karakteristiek voor het debat over de internationale politiek
dat op gezette tijden grote ontvankelijkheid bestaat voor pleidooien
om begrippen een veel ruimere inhoud te geven dan voorheen gebruikelijk
was. Zo kwam in de polemologie rond 1970 een discussie op gang
waarin naast <U>vrede</U> als afwezigheid van direct, fysiek geweld
een veel ruimer begrip vrede werd onderscheiden, dat als `positieve
vrede' duidde op de afwezigheid van wat als `structureel geweld'
werd omschreven. Vrede werd een container waarmee al het goede
kon worden omvat. Iets dergelijks zien we een aantal jaren later
gebeuren met het begrip <U>mensenrechten</U>, dat dan beter in
de markt ligt dan het in diskrediet gebrachte begrip vrede. Zo
leerden we naast de politieke en sociaal-economische mensenrechten
een derde en wellicht volgende generatie van `mensenrechten' kennen,
tot en met een `recht op vrede' en een `recht op geluk'. Opnieuw
moet &eacute;&eacute;n begrip dienen als label voor alles wat
goed, mooi en nastrevenswaardig is.
<P>
De laatste jaren is er, op dezelfde wijze, een uitdijend heelal
te zien rond het begrip <U>veiligheid</U>.<a href="#5">(5)</a> Behalve over militaire
veiligheid spreken we nu over economische, sociale, ecologische
veiligheid en zelfs over `human security' als alles overkoepelende
doelstelling.
<P>
Van deze neiging tot imperialistisch woordgebruik zijn in elk
geval drie dingen te zeggen:
<P>
<OL>
<LI> Op zich zelf verdient het streven de aandacht te vestigen
of gevestigd te houden op de volle breedte van het scala aan armoede,
onrecht, onderdrukking en levensbedreiging ieders steun. Aandacht
voor die problemen wordt door de ernst ervan ten volle gewettigd.
<P>
<LI> Dat doel wordt echter niet gediend door alle problemen
met hetzelfde begrip aan te duiden. Integendeel, ons inzicht in
de oorzaken en onderlinge samenhang en daardoor in de oplossing
van die problemen wordt er waarschijnlijk door geschaad, en derhalve:
<P>
<LI> heeft de verruiming van het woordgebruik alleen politieke
en ideologische functies, die in het vlak van de `politieke correctheid'
liggen.
</OL>
<P>
Het komt er in feite op neer dat men met gebruikmaking van begrippen
die goed in de markt liggen en met het stijlmiddel van de analogie
en de metafoor verschuivingen in beleidsprioriteiten probeert
te bewerkstelligen en/of te legitimeren. Door onrecht of milieuvervuiling
onveiligheid te noemen kan men bepleiten niet alleen geld aan
militaire macht maar ook, of meer, aan hulp of milieubescherming
uit te geven (het gaat immers in beide gevallen om `veiligheid').
Onder het motto `veiligheid' kan de NAVO zich nu ook met het moslimfundamentalisme
gaan bezighouden. Je kunt dan ook bepleiten militaire operaties
uit het budget voor de ontwikkelingssamenwerking te betalen. Veiligheid
is immers het nieuwe woord voor ontwikkeling. Maar evengoed laat
zich een pleidooi voeren dat budget te laten groeien ten koste
van de defensieuitgaven. Voorkomen is immers beter dan genezen.
Kortom, wat vroeger vrede of, nog ouderwetser, gerechtigheid heette,
heet nu veiligheid.<a href="#6">(6)</a>
<P>
Over de vraag waar de problemen vandaan komen, hoe ze samenhangen
en wat we er eventueel aan kunnen doen, weten we ondanks alle
begripsverruiming echter nog even weinig als daarvoor, laat staan
dat de wereld op zich zelf er anders of beter door geworden is.
<P>
Hebben die verschuivingen in woordgebruik dan helemaal geen gevolgen?
Dat is niet het geval. Het gaat de voorstanders van de begripsverruiming,
zoals gezegd, primair om het bereiken van een verschuiving in
politieke prioriteiten in doelen en middelen in de richting van
het eigen belang en perspectief. Het woordgebruik is immers een
deel van de definitie van de situatie, die onder meer bepaalt
waar het probleem om draait en wie er aan tafel mogen zitten bij
het nemen van de beslissingen.<a href="#7">(7)</a> In de literatuur wordt het aangeduid
als `framing'.<a href="#8">(8)</a> Het is het probleem dat Alice ontmoet in het wonderlijke
land achter de spiegel, waar alles op zijn kop lijkt te staan
en anders heet: `The question is', zei Alice, `whether you c&aacute;n
make words mean so many different things'. `The question is',
zei Humpty Dumpty, `which is to be master'.<a href="#9">(9)</a>
<P>
Ze mogen dan hun politieke functie hebben, vanuit wetenschappelijk
oogpunt zijn die uitdijende begrippen echter eerder verwarrend
dan verhelderend of vernieuwend. Gebruikt als pleidooi voor ontschotting
suggereren ze een eenheid en samenhang in de analyse van problemen
die nu juist eerst voorwerp van onderzoek moet zijn. Ze suggereren
causale samenhangen en analytische analogie&euml;n, maar bewijzen
die niet. Wat het oplevert zijn oppervlakkige metaforen met slecht
doordachte conclusies, zoals het toekennen van nieuwe taken aan
de marine bij de `oorlog tegen de drugs' of bij het verzekeren
van `milieuveiligheid', of het promoveren van soldaten tot de
nieuwe ontwikkelingswerkers.
<P>
Natuurlijk is het nodig na te gaan of het beleid verbeterd kan
worden door de problemen in hun samenhang te bestuderen. Een zogenaamd
holistische benadering waarin alles met alles samenhangt, is echter
slechts op het eerste gezicht diepzinnig. Essentieel is het juist
te onderkennen dat wetenschap precies het omgekeerde moet doen,
namelijk laten zien dat sommige dingen meer en andere juist niet
samenhangen, kortom reductie van de complexiteit. Dat is erg lastig
en verschaft helaas geen warm gevoel van binnen.
<P>
Essentieel voor het herijkingsdebat is ook te onderkennen dat
juist niet alles hetzelfde is en dat beleidsdoelstellingen niet
per definitie in elkaars verlengde liggen en integendeel elkaar
juist vaak in de weg zitten (groei versus milieu, mensenrechten
versus plezierige relaties, interventie versus zelfbeschikking,
vrede door kernwapens versus proliferatieproblemen versus civiele
kernenergie versus milieu, enz.). Natuurlijk moet iedere regering
in haar buitenlands beleid proberen deelbelangen en deelperspectieven
te verzoenen, maar dat is maar beperkt mogelijk en dan zijn, soms
pijnlijke, keuzen onvermijdelijk. Die kun je niet ontlopen door
te suggereren dat eigenlijk alles hetzelfde is en alles met alles
samenhangt. Als dat zo zou zijn, zou het tot de conclusie moeten
leiden dat het er niets toe doet of je het een of het ander doet
of waar je begint. Containerbegrippen helpen niet om de onmacht
bij het begrijpen van ingewikkelde samenhangen te overwinnen en
tegen elkaar in werkende processen precies te beschrijven en te
verklaren. Ze verhullen alleen.
<P>
<a name=nationaal></a><B>Het 'nationaal' belang als richtlijn?</B> 
<P>
Een tweede methode om de herijkingsdiscussie in te gaan en in
een bepaalde richting te sturen, is het gebruik van en beroep
op het begrip `nationaal' belang. Ik beweer niet dat nationale
belangen in het geheel niet bestaan, noch dat ze geen leidraad
moeten vormen bij de beleidsbepaling, wel dat de manier waarop
dat gebeurt meestal, al dan niet bewust, misleidend is.
<P>
Het is natuurlijk goed dat wordt erkend dat ook Nederland niet
uit louter idealisme handelt, maar &#190; net als andere staten
-belangen probeert te beschermen of te verwezenlijken. Zonder
geheel in subjectivisme te vervallen is het echter allereerst
evident dat vaak absoluut niet duidelijk is wat de nationale belangen
<U>in concreto</U> zijn. Daarover wordt in de overheidsdepartementen
en onder de client&egrave;les die zij vertegenwoordigen vaak fundamenteel
verschillend gedacht. Ook niet-materi&euml;le belangen kunnen
een nationaal belang vormen. Wat men als belang ziet, varieert
naar tijd en plaats, en naar de groep waartoe men hoort. Dat geldt
ook voor economische belangen (bijvoorbeeld vrijhandel versus
protectie). Pleiten voor het eigenbelang (of het belang van bepaalde
groepen) mag natuurlijk, maar de identificatie van particulier
en publiek belang die in het gebruik van het begrip `nationaal
belang' besloten ligt, is niet vanzelfsprekend. Spreken over nationaal
belang mag niet dienen om de vraag wie de baten opstrijkt en wie
daarvan de kosten dragen, te ontlopen.
<P>
Belangrijker echter is het feit dat rond een begrip als `het Nederlands
nationaal belang' drie sterk verschillende discussies worden gevoerd,
die vaak, zo niet constant, worden verward, zodat debatten over
dat nationaal belang meestal meer hitte dan licht verspreiden
en waardoor het begrip iedere functie als richtsnoer voor het
beleid verliest.
<P>
In de eerste plaats kunnen we belangen (dan vooral verstaan als
materi&euml;le belangen en ook wel aangeduid als `eigenbelang')
als motief voor een bepaald beleid onderscheiden van andere motieven,
zoals idealisme en altru&iuml;sme (voorbeeld: belangeloze humanitaire
noodhulp). Over de mate waarin het een dan wel het ander moet
prevaleren is een, politiek-ethisch, debat mogelijk dat op zich
zelf zinvol kan zijn.
<P>
Dat debat moet echter niet worden verward met een tweede discussie,
waarin het niet gaat om belangen tegenover andere waarden, maar
om belangen van Nederland tegenover die van andere landen (bijvoorbeeld
de benoeming van Nederlanders op hoge internationale posten).
In deze betekenis is het begrip nationaal belang wellicht nog
het minst onduidelijk, al kan <U>in concreto</U> nog verschil
van mening bestaan over wat precies in het Nederlands belang is.
Dat kan hier echter gevoeglijk buiten beschouwing blijven.
<P>
Een derde dimensie van de discussie over het begrip nationaal
belang is die waarbij het gaat om het `Nederlands' belang tegenover
het `internationaal' belang. Dat is de moeilijkste van de drie
discussies. Soms is een internationaal/wereldbelang ook een direct
Nederlands belang in engere zin, terwijl men natuurlijk kan betogen
&#190; al is dat een beetje een truc om moeilijke vragen te ontlopen
&#190; dat ieder internationaal belang indirect ook een Nederlands
belang is. Soms liggen beide niet in elkaars verlengde of zijn
ze zelfs tegenstrijdig. De vraag of nationale en internationale
belangen tegenstrijdig, dan wel verenigbaar of zelfs identiek
zijn en hoe ze moeten worden afgewogen, is vooral moeilijk te
beantwoorden naarmate we meer met collectieve goederen te doen
hebben. Nederland heeft uiteraard deel aan het collectief belang
bij vrede en stabiliteit in Europa, maar ligt veilig achter de
Duitse rug en zou wat dat betreft, zo laat zich betogen, ook best
zonder leger kunnen. Die besparing is dan een direct Nederlands
belang. Hoe moeilijk de discussie is, toont het debat over de
voor- en nadelen van het Nederlandse EU-lidmaatschap (nog daargelaten
of en hoe kosten en baten daarbij kunnen en moeten worden berekend).
<P>
Essentieel bij collectieve goederen is dat de consumptie door
de een consumptie door de ander niet in de weg staat. Daarom doet
zich steeds het `free rider'-dilemma voor, voor ieder afzonderlijk.
Voor iedereen is het van belang dat het goed wordt geproduceerd
(bijvoorbeeld een einde aan oorlogen en conflicten op de Balkan),
maar voor ieder afzonderlijk is het nog aantrekkelijker dat anderen
de kastanjes uit het vuur halen. In een klimaat waarin pleidooien
voor het opkomen voor nationale belangen op zich zelf in goede
aarde vallen, is het moeilijk weerstand te bieden aan de verleiding
op de treeplank mee te rijden. De vraag zal steeds zijn wat een
redelijke Nederlandse bijdrage is aan de verwezenlijking van collectieve
goederen. De 0,7%-norm voor ontwikkelingshulp bewijst hier haar
nut. Dergelijke afspraken over nieuwe vormen van `burdensharing'
zijn ook nodig waar het gaat om militaire inspanningen ten behoeve
van collectieve verdediging en optreden ten behoeve van collectieve
veiligheid en vredeshandhaving, maar ook wat betreft het opvangen
van asielzoekers en migranten, zeker voor het instandhouden van
een binnenlands politiek draagvlak. Een beroep op `nationale ambities',
zoals ten grondslag ligt aan de norm in de Prioriteitennota waarin
de Nederlandse militaire bijdrage is gedefinieerd, is onvoldoende
overtuigend om op den duur de vraag van het `Mourir pour Danzig?'
te ontwijken en een dam in stand te houden tegen begerige andere
departementen.
<P>
Het begrip `nationaal belang' is dus eerder versluierend dan verhelderend
en kan in het herijkingsdebat dus worden gemist. Dat betekent
uiteraard niet dat er wat betreft elk van de drie dimensies niet
kan en moet worden gedebatteerd over de vraag wat redelijk en
wenselijk is, hoe deelbelangen moeten worden afgewogen en wat
het relatief gewicht van doelstellingen en prioriteiten moet zijn.
Een centrale plaats moet daarbij de vraag innemen wat een redelijke
Nederlandse bijdrage is aan de verwezenlijking van internationale
belangen en collectieve waarden en goederen. Vooral dit laatste
is bij de herijkingsdiscussie van groot belang. We willen hopelijk
geen <U>free rider</U> zijn, maar al te goed is buurmans gek.
Dat is zo, zowel om morele redenen als uit oogpunt van effectiviteit:
wat wij zouden doen hoeft een ander immers minder te doen. Die
discussies zijn niet eenvoudig. Wat echter alleen bij het punten
scoren helpt, is het dooreen halen van de dimensies van het debat.
<P>
<a name=linkerhand></a><B>De linkerhand en de rechter</B> 
<P>
Hierboven noemde ik al het gegeven dat binnen de overheid de linkerhand
vaak niet weet wat de rechter doet, of zelfs weet dat de rechter
hetzelfde of iets anders doet, maar niet bij machte is dat te
verhinderen. Ik wees er ook op dat hierbij vaak de toverwoorden
`integratie' en `co&ouml;rdinatie' worden gebruikt als hulpmiddel
tegen de waargenomen kwaal. Discussie is mogelijk over de vraag
hoe dat het beste kan. Er laten zich verschillende modellen denken,
die ieder hun evidente voor- en nadelen hebben. Ik noem slechts
enige mogelijkheden:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Een centrale en sterkere rol voor de minister-president
en het ministerie van Algemene Zaken, vooral vanwege diens rol
in de Europese Raad;
<P>
<LI>Een herstel en versterking van de traditionele co&ouml;rdinerende
rol van het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken en het voor de beleidsvoorbereiding
en -uitvoering onmisbare apparaat van de diplomatieke dienst (vooral
in multilateraal verband), met de `vakdepartementen' in een secundaire
rol;
<P>
<LI>Horizontale co&ouml;rdinatie tussen de betrokken ministers
en de belangrijkste departementen: in elk geval Buitenlandse Zaken,
Economische Zaken en Defensie;
<P>
<LI>Het instellen van een `superministerie' voor alle internationale
aangelegenheden, met uitvoerende rijksdiensten voor ontwikkelingssamenwerking
en eventueel militaire zaken onder staatssecretarissen.
</OL>
<P>
Maar ook andere formules zijn denkbaar. Doel is vooral het verminderen
van dubbel werk en de verhoging van de effectiviteit en <U>efficiency</U>
van het beleid. Co&ouml;rdinatie wordt uiteraard meer nodig naarmate
ten gevolge van internationalisering meer departementen intensiever
bij internationaal beleid en Brusselse besluitvorming betrokken
raken.
<P>
Problematischer is daarentegen de situatie, zowel vanwege de oorzaken
als vanwege het feit dat oplossingen minder makkelijk te bedenken
zijn, wanneer delen van de overheid tegenstrijdige en onderling
onverenigbare doelstellingen nastreven. Het is de vraag of `integratie'
en `c&ouml;ordinatie' dan veel soelaas kunnen bieden. Sommige
beleidsdoelstellingen zijn intrinsiek tegenstrijdig in die zin
dat ze elkaar in de weg zitten. Men kan bijvoorbeeld denken aan
de wens de NAVO in Oosteuropese richting uit te breiden en tegelijk
Rusland te vriend te houden; verdieping van de Europese integratie
onder gelijktijdige verbreding. Andere tegenstrijdigheden bestaan
wel, maar zouden wellicht door compromissen of door andere vormen
van beleid kunnen worden opgeheven. Zo kan men denken aan het
leveren van wapens aan landen die tegen ons gebruikt kunnen worden
in militaire VN-operaties waar Nederland bij betrokken is of geraakt;
het onder druk zetten van landen vanwege hun mensenrechtenbeleid,
terwijl men tegelijkertijd de politieke steun van de betrokken
landen zoekt; en het willen bevorderen van economische ontwikkeling
in Midden-Europa, terwijl men de grenzen gesloten houdt voor hun
produkten.
<P>
Sommige van die tegenstrijdigheden zijn eenvoudigweg het gevolg
van de verschillen in belangen, doelstellingen en perspectieven
van de departementen en hun client&egrave;les. Zij zijn daarom
maar in beperkte mate vatbaar voor een oplossing langs de weg
van integratie en co&ouml;rdinatie. Dat hangt immers samen met
de aard van de dilemma's. Die kunnen intrinsiek en extrinsiek
zijn.
<P>
<a name=dilemma's></a><B>Dilemma's: belemmering of <U>blessing in disguise</U>?</B>

<P>
Soms kan analytisch inzicht in de aard van samenhangen en tegenstrijdigheden
helpen bij het oplossen van tegenstrijdigheden en dilemma's, maar
veelal vereist dat oplossen simpelweg het doorhakken van politieke
knopen.
<P>
Dat de linkerhand niet weet wat de rechter doet of zelfs weet
dat die iets anders doet, is soms het gevolg van organisatorisch
of beleidsmatig onvermogen en zou dan in principe kunnen worden
verbeterd. Het is echter na&iuml;ef te denken dat analyse en reflectie
(het `grand debate') daar steeds uitkomst kunnen bieden bij alle
dilemma's. Natuurlijk is het beleid verkokerd en gecompartimentaliseerd
en daarmee suboptimaal in termen van effecitiviteit, maar dat
kan ook een <U>blessing in disguise</U> zijn, die ons lastige
politieke keuzen bespaart, vooral bij de allocatie van middelen.
<P>
Regeringen worden voortdurend geconfronteerd met de noodzaak te
kiezen. Soms gaat het louter om keuzen die worden afgedwongen
door schaarste aan middelen (geld, tijd, energie). Je kunt het
geld maar &eacute;&eacute;n keer uitgeven. In dergelijke gevallen
zijn compromissen vaak wel mogelijk. Interessanter en moeilijker
is het wanneer er sprake is van echte dilemma's en een keuze voor
de ene optie het bereiken van een ander doel belemmert en alle
keuzen (ook) negatieve effecten hebben. De keuze voor een nieuwe
helikopter voor het Nederlandse leger is een voorbeeld van zo'n
dilemma. Soms gaat het nog verder en gaat het om het kiezen tussen
twee kwaden.
<P>
Hoe doen regeringen dat? Het huidig onderzoek van de interuniversitaire
werkgroep `Buitenlands beleid van Nederland' (B4) is gewijd aan
een studie van de manier waarop regeringen met echte dilemma's
omgaan. Een groot aantal `strategie&euml;n' of methoden hoe in
beginsel met dilemma's kan worden omgegaan, is ge&iuml;dentificeerd
en aan de hand van vergelijkende <U>case studies</U> wordt onderzocht
onder welke omstandigheden welke strategie&euml;n worden gebruikt.
Ik noem er daarvan een paar: uitstel van de beslissing (`komt
tijd komt raad'), compartimentalisering van de besluitvorming
(de linker- en de rechterhand), van ondeelbare beslissingen deelbare
maken (toelating van Middeneuropese landen tot de NAVO, maar extra
hulp geven aan Rusland), misleiding (men zegt thuis iets anders
dan in het buitenland), enz. Ten slotte komt de vraag aan de orde
of dilemma's echt kunnen worden opgelost en wat daar voor gevolgen
aan vastzitten voor de richting van het beleid en inrichting van
de besluitvorming. Dit alles kan licht werpen op de vraag of `herijking'
en `ontschotting' van het beleid kunnen bijdragen aan het oplossen
van de (vele) dilemma's waarmee beleidmakers worden geconfronteerd.
<P>
<a name=concentratie></a><B>Concentratie van inspanningen gewenst</B> 
<P>
Ik sluit af met een paar conclusies, die overigens geen wetenschappelijke
status claimen. Eerder dan op de doelstellingen van beleid zou
ik &#190; ook al is het onderwerp wat minder `sexy' &#190; het
(herijkings)debat willen concentreren op de Nederlandse mogelijkheden
en op wat kan worden gedaan om de effectiviteit en <U>efficiency</U>
van de inzet van onze middelen (geld, energie, tijd, talent, mankracht)
te vergroten. Dat is nodig en relevant omdat die middelen niet
alleen eindig, maar ook beperkt zijn. Dat alles zal snel concrete
gevolgen hebben. Het debat over de doelstellingen kan daarentegen
in hoge mate vrijblijvend blijven, vooral als de vraag naar de
prioritering en de vraag wat voorrang verdient als doelstellingen
botsen, wordt ontlopen.
<P>
Bij dit alles bedenke men dat de buitenlands-politieke agenda
van Nederland voor het grootste deel door het buitenland wordt
bepaald, door de gebeurtenissen in de wereld en door de organisaties
waar wij lid van zijn. Onze autonomie is derhalve beperkt. Wat
voor beleid doorgaat, is grotendeels reactief van aard en dan
beperkt autonomie zich tot de keuze van de mate waarin men tijd,
geld en energie investeert in een bepaalde kwestie.
<P>
Er is echter ten dele ook, in ieder geval n&oacute;g, sprake van
echte autonomie. Afgezien van min of meer vastliggende verplichtingen
(de verplichte EU-bijdrage, NAVO-verplichtingen, de 0,7%-norm
op het gebied van ontwikkelingssamenwerking), is Nederland betrekkelijk
vrij in de prioriteit die het aan zijn internationale inspanningen
stelt. Bij het vaststellen van de noodzakelijke militaire capaciteit
gaat het eensdeels om NAVO-normen maar anderzijds, aldus de Prioriteitennota,
om een nationaal vastgestelde norm van deelname aan vier vredesoperaties,
als een kwestie van `nationale ambitie'. De ene norm is exogeen
bepaald, de andere endogeen. De afweging tussen `idealistische'
en `nationale' belangen is een ander terrein waarop de nationale
autonomie redelijk groot is.
<P>
Gegeven die beslissingsvrijheid bepleit ik concentratie van onze
inspanningen op een beperkt aantal zaken, vooral die waar Nederland
goed in is (qua expertise, middelen, nationaal draagvlak, consensus).
Die beperking en concentratie kan op vele terreinen worden gezocht:
op dat van de geografische grenzen (bijvoorbeeld wel militairen
naar Joegoslavi&euml;, maar waarom mariniers naar Cambodja of
Haiti?), of op het aantal landen dat ontwikkelingshulp ontvangt,
op specifieke delen van het mensenrechten- en milieu-terrein.
Eerder onderzoek toonde aan dat bij geconcentreerde aandacht,
met inzet van veel energie en wanneer een aantal voorwaarden is
vervuld (zoals persoonlijke betrokkenheid van de bewindsman, consensus
binnenslands en steun van een of meer grote bondgenoten [de samenwerking
met Duitsland springt hier in het oog]) de Nederlandse invloed
wel degelijk mogelijk en soms zelfs aanzienlijk kan zijn.<a href="#10">(10)</a> Dat
betekent dat het herijkingsdebat geen irrelevante exercitie hoeft
te blijven.
<P>
Buitenlandse politiek betekent voortdurend kiezen tussen vaak
hoogst onzekere alternatieven binnen nauwe marges. Een helder
analytisch kader kan daarbij helpen om tegenstrijdigheden in doelstellingen
en werkwijze te identificeren en om optimaal gebruik te maken
van de beschikbare hulpbronnen. Oplossing van de echte dilemma's,
voor zover ooit mogelijk, vergt echter meer. Meestal kan noch
een beroep op het nationaal belang, noch het spelen met woorden
daarbij de oplossing brengen. Het probleem zit hem minder in de
doelstellingen dan in de optimale organisatie en aanwending van
middelen en instrumenten.

<h2 align=center> WELCOME TO THE SAVVIEST PLACE IN HYPERSPACE</h2>

<h4>12 February 1997</h4>

     
     It is challenging. It might make you angry; it might change your mind. 
     You may
     even take action. Welcome to Hot Savvy 
     (http://www.oneworld.org/scf/youth),
     Save the Children's new website for young people, which is launched on 
     Monday
     16 December.<p>
     
     Are you aged between 11 and 20 and concerned about children's rights; 
     racism;
     famine; poverty; homelessness; pollution? If so, this internet site is 
     made for you.
     Hot Savvy is fully interactive, with plenty of ideas of how to put 
     your thoughts into
     action. You can also take part in surveys (the results are regularly 
     posted up), a
     voting page, and The Questionifier, aided by guides Savvy Sal and the 
     Duke of
     URL.<p>
     
     As well as being fun, the idea behind Hot Savvy is to encourage young 
     people to
     think about issues important to them - personal concerns as well as 
     their opinions
     on global issues. For example, the Voting Page asks browsers about 
     their top
     gripes: exams, boredom; jobs; Noel and Liam; money (or lack of); 
     family,
     relationships; school; drugs; appearance; police/law; place to live.<p>
     
     The pages can be used by individual surfers but are also ideal for 
     sparking
     discussions in youth groups and the classroom. Says Peter White, 
     author of the
     pages: <p>
     <blockquote>
          "Hot Savvy invites young people to think, it gives them ideas and 
     things to
          do - without ever taking itself too seriously. Hot Savvy is also 
     a great way
          to find out about the lifestyles of people in your own age group 
     who live
          thousands of miles away."                         </blockquote><p>
                                        
     <h4>NOTES FOR EDITORS:</h4>
     
     1. Save the Children's main website can be found on One World On-Line: 
     http://www.oneworld.org/scf, which gives information on current 
     projects, live
     issues, publications and ways to support Save the Children's work in 
     the UK and
     overseas.<p>
     
     2. Hot Savvy is the latest initiative from Save the Children's Youth 
     Education
     Programme. Its aim is to make children's rights a reality through 
     global education.
     The Programme also produces a range of publications for youth groups 
     including
     Right Angle (available from Save the Children's Education Unit, 0171 
     703 5400)
     and Spotlight which appears in the youth work magazine Young People 
     Now).<p>

<b>D&#233;but octobre 1993, l'avis du Conseil Consultatif National pour la Coop&#233;ration au
D&#233;veloppement sur la relation entre la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement et le
probl&#232;me des r&#233;fugi&#233;s a &#233;t&#233; pr&#233;sent&#233; au ministre de la
coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, M. J.P. Pronk.</b>
<p>
<h3>La question des r&#233;fugi&#233;s. Probl&#232;mes mis en &#233;vidence par le Conseil</h3>

Comment la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement peut-elle contribuer &#224; emp&ecirc;cher
l'apparition de flux massifs de r&#233;fugi&#233;s et &#224; combattre et/ou &#224; pr&#233;venir leurs
effets n&#233;gatifs? Comment soutenir les pays b&#233;n&#233;ficiaires (en particulier les pays en
d&#233;veloppement) dans l'accueil de r&#233;fugi&#233;s et de personnes d&#233;plac&#233;es, a
demand&#233; le ministre lorsqu'il a sollicit&#233; un avis sur la question des r&#233;fugi&#233;s. Et
comment soutenir des solutions durables - outre l'accueil dans la r&#233;gion - au probl&#232;me des
r&#233;fugi&#233;s? En effet, le nombre de gens qui fuient leur pays est aujourd'hui plus grand que
jamais. D'apr&#232;s les estimations, vingt millions de personnes ont aujourd'hui quitt&#233; leur patrie.
Plus encore, un nombre &#233;quivalent de personnes ont &#233;t&#233; chass&#233;es de leur foyer
&#224; l'int&#233;rieur m&ecirc;me de leur pays. Il s'agit pour la majeure partie de femmes et d'enfants
de pays en d&#233;veloppement, fuyant vers d'autres pays en d&#233;veloppement. Une grande partie
d'entre eux attend, parfois depuis des dizaines d'ann&#233;es, dans des camps sordides. Le pr&#233;sent
avis porte en particulier sur l'aide &#224; apporter &#224; ces personnes - il ne s'agit nullement ici des
personnes venant chercher un travail en Europe - tout en &#233;voquant les mutations qu'a subies la notion
de r&#233;fugi&#233; au cours des derni&#232;res d&#233;cennies. Le Conseil se situe dans le droit fil de
la politique d&#233;velopp&#233;e par le HCNUR, l'organisation de l'ONU pour les r&#233;fugi&#233;s.
<p>
En ce qui concerne les possibilit&#233;s de contribution de la Coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement
&#224; la solution du probl&#232;me des r&#233;fugi&#233;s, nous ne pouvons qu'&#233;mettre des
r&#233;serves. En effet, il est presque impossible de r&#233;pondre &#224; la question de savoir dans
quelle mesure le sous-d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique  a contribu&#233; &#224; l'apparition de
flux de r&#233;fugi&#233;s. Le lien entre l'in&#233;galit&#233; &#233;conomique et les bouleversements
sociaux violents est tr&#232;s complexe. N&#233;anmoins, la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement
est de plus en plus consid&#233;r&#233;e comme un instrument pr&#233;ventif et l'on sp&#233;cule sur la
r&#233;duction du nombre de demandeurs d'asile par le "d&#233;veloppement" des r&#233;gions pauvres.
Du fait qu'une telle politique serait une prime &#224; la mauvaise gestion, il s'agit d'une formule qui ne
tient compte en aucune fa&#231;on de l'impr&#233;visibilit&#233; de la question des r&#233;fugi&#233;s.
Selon le Conseil, le sous-d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique n'est pas en lui-m&ecirc;me la cause
principale de l'&#233;mergence de flux de r&#233;fugi&#233;s.
<p>
On peut m&ecirc;me se demander si les conflits ne sont pas inh&#233;rents au processus de
d&#233;veloppement lui-m&ecirc;me. Le d&#233;veloppement implique en effet une mutation sociale,
l'apparition d'une nouvelle situation pour les groupes de population et pour les relations entre les gens et
leur environnement. Cela va rarement sans coup f&#233;rir. Certains critiques estiment que la crise
&#233;conomique, et la violence qui lui est inh&#233;rente (comme la progression de la criminalit&#233;
(inter)nationale, les conflits violents, les guerres civiles, le trafic de drogue et la d&#233;t&#233;rioration
de l'environnement) sont une cons&#233;quence du mod&#232;le de d&#233;veloppement dominant, qui
est fond&#233; sur des normes occidentales.
<p>
D'autre part, la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement est &#233;galement consid&#233;r&#233;e
comme un moyen possible de pr&#233;vention de conflits entra&icirc;nant des flux de
r&#233;fugi&#233;s. De meilleures conditions de vie pourraient emp&ecirc;cher l'apparition de conflits
caus&#233;s par le d&#233;nuement, la d&#233;gradation de l'environnement ou l'in&#233;galit&#233;
&#233;conomique. Mais, comme il a d&#233;j&#224; &#233;t&#233; dit, les causes des flux de
r&#233;fugi&#233;s sont multiples: constitution d'&Eacute;tats ou de nations, d&#233;colonisation -
 compliqu&#233;s ou non par des facteurs &#233;conomiques -, &#233;volution des institutions ('soft
state', &Eacute;tat faible) sans oublier la d&#233;t&#233;rioration de l'environnement. Dans ces
conditions, la violation des droits de l'homme, la violence meurtri&#232;re et les catastrophes naturelles et
&#233;cologiques incitent les gens &#224; fuir en masse, que ce soit devant la r&#233;alit&#233;
collective des "pers&#233;cutions", ou pour le motif plus personnel de la peur. Cela est en rapport
&#233;troit avec le changement d'identit&#233; des habitants de pays en d&#233;veloppement,
g&#233;n&#233;r&#233; entre autres par l'&#233;ducation et le d&#233;veloppement, et avec
l'&#233;mergence d'une nouvelle individualit&#233;. Des valeurs telles que l'autonomie, la libert&#233;
individuelle, la responsabilit&#233; propre, le respect mutuel et surtout la garantie de l'int&#233;grit&#233;
physique acqui&#232;rent ainsi - certainement pour les jeunes - une signification plus grande. Cela implique
que la violence sociale est plus souvent jug&#233;e comme injuste et inadmissible, ce qui peut aboutir
&#224; une radicalisation politique et donc &#224; une fuite forc&#233;e. Dans le m&ecirc;me temps, la
participation &#224; des processus politiques scl&#233;ros&#233;s se r&#233;duit de plus en plus et
l'action collective ne constitue plus &#224; vrai dire une option. Il ne reste donc plus aux jeunes des pays
du Sud, conscients de tout cela, qu'&#224; quitter leur pays. Les motifs &#233;conomiques ne sont
certainement pas la raison principale de leur d&#233;part. La plupart d'entre eux resteraient s'ils se savaient
&#224; l'abri de la violence ou des caprices d'une tyrannie impr&#233;visible.
<p>
<h3>Conclusions et recommandations</h3>

En cons&#233;quence, le Conseil estime que la politique de d&#233;veloppement doit &ecirc;tre davantage
fond&#233;e sur la notion de diversit&#233; sociale, &#233;conomique et culturelle comme base d'un
d&#233;veloppement librement choisi et mis en oeuvre &#224; partir de la base. &Agrave; long terme, une
telle politique peut avoir un effet pr&#233;ventif ou du moins mod&#233;rateur quant &#224; la
polarisation et les expressions violentes de l'individualit&#233; fondamentale (fondamentaliste). En outre,
comme le constatait l'avis n&#186; 100 du NAR, de nombreux pays en d&#233;veloppement connaissent
une situation de croissance d&#233;viante, o&ugrave; la construction de la soci&#233;t&#233;
pr&#233;sente un caract&#232;re unilat&#233;ral et est domin&#233;e par les institutions
&#233;conomiques ou par un appareil &#233;tatique d&#233;mesur&#233;. Cela provoque souvent des
tensions sociales, qui donnent parfois lieu &#224; une opposition violente, et constitue un obstacle &#224;
la recherche d'un d&#233;veloppement durable.
<p>
Dans ce cadre, le Conseil estime qu'il est essentiel de promouvoir les droits de l'homme. Des mesures telles
que le syst&#232;me d'alerte rapide  (early warnings), la pr&#233;sence physique d'organisations
internationales et la promotion d'une bonne administration peuvent avoir un effet pr&#233;ventif direct. Le
Conseil recommande de soutenir les organisations de d&#233;fense des droits de l'homme,
pr&#233;cis&#233;ment lorsque les violations de ces droits augmentent. Dans le prolongement de ce
soutien, il importe &#233;galement de coop&#233;rer avec les organisations sensibles aux droits de
l'homme, comme les syndicats et les mouvements f&#233;ministes. Il est aussi souhaitable de faire
tr&#232;s t&ocirc;t des rapports sur les d&#233;veloppements en mati&#232;re de violations de droits de
l'homme. Les ambassades devraient &#233;galement rendre compte de l'application des lois, des
d&#233;buts d'incidents tels que les disparitions, incarc&#233;rations et ex&#233;cutions. Rendre
fid&#232;lement compte des violations des droits de l'homme et de l'apparition des flux de
r&#233;fugi&#233;s, envoyer des journalistes en reportage ou en inviter et faire r&#233;aliser des
documentaires en coop&#233;ration avec les journalistes des pays concern&#233;s, pourrait contribuer
&#224; faire prendre conscience de ce probl&#232;me. En raison du renforcement de la
conditionnalit&#233;, tous les pays industrialis&#233;s devraient se d&#233;clarer pr&ecirc;ts &#224;
accepter une surveillance internationale du respect des droits de l'homme dans leur propre r&#233;gion,
comme la plupart des &Eacute;tats europ&#233;ens l'ont fait en signant la Convention de Strasbourg.
<p>
Le Conseil veut attirer une nouvelle fois l'attention sur le fait que 80% des r&#233;fugi&#233;s au niveau
mondial sont des femmes et des enfants. Il serait utile de faire remarquer cette donn&#233;e dans un
contexte bilat&#233;ral et multilat&#233;ral et d'harmoniser la politique sur ce point.
<p>
En ce qui concerne les d&#233;penses des Pays-Bas en mati&#232;re d'aide aux r&#233;fugi&#233;s (y
compris l'accueil de demandeurs d'asile), le Conseil constate avec grande inqui&#233;tude que les
r&#233;fugi&#233;s des pays en d&#233;veloppement n'ont b&#233;n&#233;fici&#233; que de 35% du
montant total qui y a &#233;t&#233; consacr&#233; en 1992 dans le cadre de l'aide au
d&#233;veloppement. Dans les ann&#233;es &#224; venir, ce pourcentage risque de diminuer encore plus.
Le Conseil insiste pour que l'on inverse cette tendance et pour que l'accueil des demandeurs d'asile aux
Pays-Bas ne soit plus imput&#233; au budget de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement.
<p>
Il convient &#233;galement de soutenir l'accueil dans la r&#233;gion sans toutefois perdre de vue que pour
certains r&#233;fugi&#233;s, la r&#233;gion "culturelle" se situe plut&ocirc;t en Occident que dans les
pays voisins de leur patrie. Il e&ucirc;t &#233;t&#233; inad&#233;quat de renvoyer dans un des camps du
subcontinent les partisans pakistanais de Bhutto venus chercher asile &#224; Londres. Le Conseil juge
souhaitable qu'il y ait s&#233;paration, au niveau de la politique, entre le probl&#232;me de l'admission et
de l'accueil des r&#233;fugi&#233;s aux Pays-Bas d'une part, et le soutien aux r&#233;fugi&#233;s dans
les pays en d&#233;veloppement d'autre part. Ne serait-ce qu'en raison des divergences d'optique en
mati&#232;re de d&#233;lai, il n'est pas dans l'int&#233;r&ecirc;t des r&#233;fugi&#233;s et des
demandeurs d'asile, ni dans celui de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement de les lier sans plus
politiquement.
<p>
Le Conseil consid&#232;re que la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement a une t&#226;che en ce qui
concerne les projets de retour volontaire des r&#233;fugi&#233;s dans leur pays d'origine. Des efforts tant
bilat&#233;raux que multilat&#233;raux peuvent &ecirc;tre efficaces, certainement lorsqu'il s'agit de la
construction et de la reconstruction d'un pays. Il convient &#233;galement de promouvoir activement le
r&#233;tablissement des droits de l'homme tant politiques que socio-&#233;conomiques. Si l'on veut que le
rapatriement volontaire soit de nature durable, la situation du pays d'origine devra &ecirc;tre telle que les
int&#233;ress&#233;s ne soient pas une nouvelle fois oblig&#233;s de trouver leur salut ailleurs.
<p>
Au sein m&ecirc;me de la coop&#233;ration au d&#233;veloppement, il conviendrait d'accorder une plus
grande attention aux relations sociales dans une situation post-conflictuelle. Cela implique
concr&#232;tement qu'il faudrait oeuvrer davantage &#224; une r&#233;conciliation active entre les
groupes de population. On peut suivre en cela une politique internationale, qui prend forme tout doucement,
d'organisation de la paix par le d&#233;veloppement. Le Conseil estime &#233;galement souhaitable de
s'int&#233;resser de plus pr&#232;s au probl&#232;me des "r&#233;fugi&#233;s militants". Il s'agit de
millions de personnes qui vivent en exil depuis de nombreuses ann&#233;es au sein d'une
communaut&#233; de r&#233;fugi&#233;s dot&#233;e d'une structure politique et de sections
arm&#233;es, et qui m&#232;nent une guerre &#224; des fins politiques. Leur existence ne suscite pas
seulement des probl&#232;mes au niveau de la cr&#233;ation de fonds, mais elle provoque aussi des
dilemmes en droit international puisque le statut de r&#233;fugi&#233; d'une part et l'activisme politico-
militaire d'autre part ne sont pas compatibles.
<p>
Les r&#233;fugi&#233;s et leurs organisations en Occident devraient &ecirc;tre associ&#233;s
&#233;troitement aussi bien aux projets de retour au pays qu'aux processus de r&#233;conciliation. Leurs
connaissances, leur exp&#233;rience et leur engagement dans les projets de coop&#233;ration mis en
oeuvre dans leur patrie seraient doublement efficaces. D'une part, la fuite de cerveaux serait un peu moindre
dans le pays en d&#233;veloppement, puisque les personnes poss&#233;dant une bonne formation
pourraient jouer un r&ocirc;le dans la construction de leur pays et que, d'autre part, les donateurs
occidentaux pourraient profiter de l'expertise des r&#233;fugi&#233;s.
<p>
Selon le Conseil, des approches r&#233;gionales int&#233;gr&#233;es qui abordent les aspects politiques,
&#233;conomiques et de d&#233;veloppement de la question des r&#233;fugi&#233;s ou du retour au pays
m&#233;ritent d'&ecirc;tre soutenues. Ce type d'approche demande de la coordination en particulier entre
(et au sein de) l'ONU et la CE et entre les diff&#233;rentes organisations (d'aide) internationales, pour
harmoniser les diff&#233;rentes t&#226;ches. Le HCNUR tente d'&#233;tendre ses programmes et de
renforcer ses actions. Le Conseil estime qu'il importe de soutenir largement le HCNUR sur ce point comme
dans les activit&#233;s plus ou moins classiques, &#224; savoir: l'augmentation et l'am&#233;lioration de
l'aide d'urgence en coop&#233;ration avec d'autres organisations internationales, les donateurs nationaux et
les organisations non gouvernementales, l'accroissement des possibilit&#233;s du retour volontaire des
r&#233;fugi&#233;s dans le pays d'origine, entre autres par l'introduction de projets de
d&#233;veloppement &#224; r&#233;sultats rapides, le d&#233;placement des r&#233;fugi&#233;s dont la
vie ou la satisfaction des besoins fondamentaux sont menac&#233;s et l'am&#233;lioration de la protection
des r&#233;fugi&#233;s.

The African Village: France's backyard</h2>

Full text of an article from <i>Vice Versa (a quarterly magazine on
development work published by SNV)</i><br>Vol 29, No. 5, 1995:

<hr>
<b>
La France still considers Africa as a domaine r&#233;serv&#233; offering the
previous coloniser the grandeur of a medium-sized world power.
Despite all the eloquent speeches on the necessity of democracy in
Africa, the French still like to work with the dictators. "The
crueler the regime, the more certain it is of French support."</b>
<p>
"Tonight we will watch the results on television with a whole
group," said a West African friend who had no other alternative a
few years ago but to go into exile in the Netherlands in order to
save his own life. It was May 7 last, the day of the presidential
elections in France. "Whoever wins, this result is important for
our future" he added. His country's dictatorial regime has been
supported by the French Republic for years. The military who
ordered the people to be tortured were educated in French military
schools. French officials advise the army leaders. And while the
IMF strictly restricts funds, the budget is helped by rich uncle
France. In exchange, France has a loyal ally and it profits from
the raw materials which the government friend sells cheaply.
<p>
Each change of presidents in France stirs the hope that there will
be a change in the French African policy. Not only for the African
democrats and the opposition, but also for concerned Frenchmen.
"Monstrous" is how Fran&#231;ois-Xavier Verschave describes the French
interference in the African continent. Verschave is president of
the French organisation  "Survie", which campaigned for a healthy
and democratic African policy in the months prior to the
presidential elections together with a few other Non Governmental
Organisations (NGOs).
<p>
"Ever since we started researching these relations, we have been
stunned a few times by the reality. Each time we discovered
something aggravating, it appeared later on that the reality was
even worse than we could have expected" says Verschave.
<p>
According to Verschave, Franco-African relations are determined by
a mafia-like old-boy network in which tyranny, geo-political,
strategic and economic interests are important.
<p>
France, convinced of its superior culture during the colonial era
and with its enormous urge to civilise, never let go of Africa.
During World War II, General De Gaulle promised the African
colonies "a kind of emancipation" as a reward for their
contribution in fighting off naziism. But after the War, the highly
weakened France had trouble with the prospect of continuing without
the colonies. Besides, Paris feared the competitive influence of
the Communists and the Americans in French-speaking Africa. After
all, they reasoned, this area belongs to France anyway, considering
its geographic proximity and the historical ties. When
decolonisation was to take place, Paris and the colonies made a few
cooperation agreements for defence, foreign policy, and economic
and monetary affairs. The interests of both parties were
safeguarded through the coop&#233;ration. For example, in 1960, when the
Cameroon government was pressured due to an uprising in the south,
Elys&#233;e was quick to respond. French troops dealt quickly with the
uprising. Many villages were burned down and wiped off the map.
When the revolt's leader was later poisoned in Geneva by the French
secret service, the revolt again broke out. President Ahidjo,
supported by French advisers, ordered the attack. In two years,
between 300,000 and 400,000 people were slaughtered. Throughout all
of it, France supported the Cameroon government which carried out
a reign of terror.
<p>
Le gendarme often interfered in order to control African  history.
At will, African leaders are installed or removed. There have been
thirty French military interferences since 1963. Even today there
are more than fifty thousand French military on the continent. 
<p>
The French government has a remarkable preference for dictatorial
regimes in its choice of allies (Zaire, Gabon, Togo, Rwanda, Chad,
the Ivory Coast, Equatorial Guinea, Central African Republic etc.).
<p>
"In general, the French are convinced that Africa can only function
if a strong government has the power. Africa is supposed to have
strong regimes, and as a rule this signifies dictatorial regimesþ
is how Sorel Keita puts it, a journalist and secretary of the
African Journalist Association in France. Verschave shares this
opinion: "The crueler the regime, the more certain it is of French
support."
<p>
French presidents attach great interest to their domaine r&#233;serv&#233;
which offers them the prestige of being the leader of an empire.
General De Gaulle was permanently informed by Jacques Foccart, who
was specially responsible for the African policy. After the
general's departure, the central decision-making was dispersed and
various groups of interests had free play. "Under Giscard d'Estaing
the clientelism developed into a family-like network in which
cousins and friends of Giscard became involved in various trade
transactions with Africa" according to Verschave. Giscard d'Estaing
also wanted his friendship with African leaders to be proved with
gifts such as diamonds.
<p>
The Franco-African family extended itself even more in the
socialist government of president Fran&#231;ois Mitterand. His son Jean
Christophe nicknamed, "Papamadi" (father told me) favoured the
African continent. One year after his father's election, Mitterand
started working for the cellule africaine, the Department of
African Affairs which is directly under the president's
responsibility, and he soon climbed to the top. "There is not one
African dictator's son with which Jean-Christophe is not
permanently in contact with", says Verschave. Some of his intimates
include Ali Bongo (Gabon), Jean-Pierre Habyarimana (Rwanda), Manda
Mobutu (Zaire). In 1992 Jean-Christophe, who became head of the
cellule after the forced departure of Guy Penne, had to leave it
due to a number of affairs, including the disappearance of 195
million francs which were intended as a guarantee for the storage
of cacao in the Ivory Coast.
<p>
According to Verschave, Jean-Christophe Mitterand is not the only
one with a preference for the continent. He estimates that there
are about 15 active networks surrounding people such as Charles
Pasqua (ex-Minister of the Interior) and Jacques Foccart (adviser
to De Gaulle and now once more for Jacques Chirac). Next to that
there are lobbies of companies such as oil multinational Elf, the
army and three secret services. "These networks all are securing
their own interests varying from geo-strategic and simply
commercial interests to trade in precious stones, drugs or weapons
and laundering black money" says Verschave. "Franco-African
relations are showing more and more mafia-like characteristics."
<p>
One of the most recent scandals is the French action in Rwanda.
"The Rwandese president, Juvenal Habyarimana", says Verschave, "was
a great seducer. He knew how to take Mitterand in completely." And
while Rwanda more and more became a fascist state in the past few
years, France decided to reward Habyarimana for his loyalty.
Starting in 1990, France sent airplanes, light tanks, helicopters,
munition, missiles. French instructors trained the army and Hutu
militia. And France also offered to finance the military purchases
in South Africa and Egypt.
<p>
When the Front Patriotique Rwandais (FPR), the Tutsi liberation
front, started a large offensive in the north of Rwanda in October
1990, president Habyarimana directly called Jean-Christophe
Mitterand requesting he send military. Mitterand directly
responded. In a little while, French military were helping the
Rwandese army in beating off the attack of the Khmers noirs, as the
Tutsi rebels are called. And France kept on sending military. In
1991 a judicial inspection mission discovered that French officials
participated in questioning FPR prisoners and that their barracks
were at Kigali prison, where torturing took place.
<p>
When Rwanda became a hell after president Habyarimana's death due
to Hutu extremists massive slaughter of Tutsis and moderate Hutus,
France befriended members of the Hutu power. On April 9,
Habyarimana's widow, one of the founders of the infamous radio
Mille Collines, was evacuated. She was received with flowers and
200,000 francs developmental funds upon her arrival in order to be
able to settle down. Other Hutu extremists also were able to come
to France. The French ambassador in Rwanda decided to burn his
archives. Then president Mitterand announced the "Op&#233;ration
Turquoise" under the guise of a humanitarian operation. The "safe
zone" in the southwest of Rwanda which was created by the French,
was an escape route for those guilty of genocide. And France also
was able to prevent that the new FPR regime received international
aid from the European Union and the World Bank until 25 November.
<p>
The question remains why France was so interested in the
poverty-stricken Rwanda. "Mitterand's son was involved in various
affairs in Rwanda, such as probably drugs trade and perhaps other
things. There was a considerable weapon trade in the region" says
Verschave. Gustave Massiah 1, of the Centre d'Etudes et
d'Initiatives de Solidarit&#233; Internationale, suggests that the
Habyarimana regime was covering the provision of nuclear technology
to South Africa in the time that there was an embargo against
Pretoria.
<p>
It is a fact that France's paranoia of the Anglo-Saxon block in the
region was an important factor for supporting Habyarimana. "The
Americans showed interest in (the Ugandan president) Museveni, who
in turn, supported FPR. As of then Museveni is an enemy who should
be resisted and therefore the Francophone Habyarimana is turned toþ
according to Verschave.
<p>
The same fear caused Paris (with the Minister of the Interior of
that time Charles Pasqua) to tighten the bonds with the Sudanese
regime. In Sudan a civil war between Arabic-islamic Khartoum and
the black liberation front in the south had been going on for years
which was supported by the United States. "France is prepared to
support the massacres in Sudan, arguing that the Americans are
helping the other party" explains Verschave.
<p>
In 1993-1994 the Sudanese secret service was invited to France four
times for a working visit. The espionage service was given
communication instruments and bugging devices. "France helped
reorganise the Sudan gestapo. Satellite photographs were handed out
so that the Sudan population in the south could be bombarded.
Genocide is taking place in the south of Sudan and France is
quietly taking part", says an outraged Verschave. In exchange for
France's service, Charles Pasqua was able to arrange Sudan's
extradition of the terrorist Carlos in August 1994. And with this,
Pasqua was able to boost his badly damaged image in France.
<p>
France's interference in Africa is not only
psychologically-strategically motivated. "Africa has been and still
is an economic partner for France as supplier of raw materials, as
a market for its products and capital investments and as support of
its monetary unit" writes Guy Martin 2, professor at Clark Atlanta
University of Georgia. To a large extent, France depends on the
minerals in Africa. In this sense, France depends 100 per cent on Gabon and
Niger for uranium. Ninety per cent of its bauxite is from Guinea.
Fifty-seven per cent of France's copper comes from Zaire and Zambia. And
about 31 per cent of the iron ore comes from Liberia and Mauritania. "It is
remarkable that the French balance of trade, which shows a chronic
shortage with the rest of the world, always has been positive with
Africa" declares Martin. After a regression, the French export to
Africa has stabilised or even increased to 82 million francs since
1988. After Europe and North America, Africa is the third export
market for France.
<p>
The French Connection also has another lubricant: developmental
funds. French president Mitterand's warning in 1990 during the
Franco-African summit in La Baule that development aid would become
independent of the democratisation process had little effect.
According to Martin, the developmental aid to countries in
transition, such as Benin, Mali and Niger, diminished while aid to
authoritarian regimes such as Cameroon, Togo and Zaire increased.
<p>
Pascal Krop 3 explains where the development funds are directed to.
He estimates that for each 100 francs of development aid, 25 to 30 per cent
goes directly to the African leaders. They then channel part of the
funds to the French political parties. About 12 per cent of French aid is
spent as salaries of French development employees. Between 55 and
60 per cent is regulated aid and must be spent in France. Krop concludes
that in the end merely 3 per cent is spent on the population's well-being.
Besides, 80 per cent of the aid is never evaluated.
<p>
Verschave also has facts on the "development mafia." He explains
that part of the developmental aid is hors projet, intended to
support the structural adjustment programmes. "That money is
intended to gloss over the embezzlement of state funds" according
to Verschave. "Take Cameroon, for example. The income from the oil
exploitation goes directly to president Biya. The state treasury
has a systematic deficit because the countries riches go directly
to private bank accounts. For years France has helped fill the gaps
in the Cameroon budget.
<p>
Besides that, there is l'aide aux projets. These projects can be
almost anything, says Verschave. "It can be a presidential palace,
an ultra modern hospital which never will be used, an inaccessible
university or a motorway which can only by used by the presidential
palace. This money is the biggest possible donation for governments
who owe no one anything."
<p>
Verschave claims that the position of the NGO's is extremely
limited. Merely 0.7 per cent of France's development aid is done through
NGOs. "We have campaigned for allowing NGOs to deal with
one-seventh of the development aid. In 1989 72 per cent of Parliament
signed a bill to achieve this. But the initiative never followed
through", says Verschave.
<p>
Despite the growing criticism of the French policy, nothing is done
within government circles. "I am very pessimistic about the
opportunities for France with Chirac," says Sorel Keita. A change
will most probably be an African initiative. Verschave points out
that in countries such as Zaire and Cameroon, an increasing
"Francophobia" is taking place. Keita indicates that in cities such
as Abidjan, young people are openly protesting against the wrongs. 
"It is a spontaneous revolt of young people who have nothing to
lose due to the economic crisis" he says.  For many youngsters,
people like Burkina ex-president Thomas Sankara, who paid with his
life for resisting the former mafia system, have become heroes.
