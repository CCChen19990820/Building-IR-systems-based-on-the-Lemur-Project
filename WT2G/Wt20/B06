&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 30, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A priest encouraged a dying man to falsely accuse Cardinal Joseph Bernardin</B> of sexual abuse in 1993, the Chicago cardinal wrote in a posthumously published memoir.  Steven Cook recanted the allegations against Bernardin in February 1994, and the two men reconciled the next December.  In <I>The Gift of Peace, Personal Reflections</I>, Bernardin said Cook told him a right-leaning priest suggested Cook sue the cardinal.  Bernardin, who died of cancer Nov. 14, did not identify the priest except to say he was the same one who said on a Chicago radio talk show that he believed the cardinal was guilty. <P> <B>Hundreds of Muslims in Indonesia, shouting &quot;God is great,&quot; rampaged through churches</B> and a Chinese temple Jan. 30 after reports that a Christian had insulted them, Reuters news service reported.  Witnesses said five churches were damaged by a mob at Rengasdengklok, 30 miles east of Jakarta.  There were no reports of casualties; two arrests were made. <BR><B>...Rioters smashed windows and musical instruments, and destroyed Bibles</B>, a witness told Reuters.  The rampage apparently began after a report that a Christian businessman complained that Muslims performing their evening prayer were too noisy.  The mob destroyed the businessman's house and shop. <BR><B>...Last month, four people died after a mob in Western Java</B> set fire to shops, buildings, and churches. <P> <B>Sparks from a welder's torch started a fire</B> that destroyed the Sight and Sound Entertainment Center, a religiously oriented theater near Strasburg, in central Pennsylvania's Amish country.  The fire Tuesday caused $15 million damage to the center, which housed the 1,400-seat theater, which drew 700,000 visitors last year.  Preparations were being made for the next show, the story of Noah, scheduled to open in April. <P> <B>A Roman Catholic bishop in England banned participation in the Neo-Catechumenal</B> <B>Way, </B>a movement causing disunity in parishes, the<I> London Times</I> reported.  Mervyn Alexander, Bishop of Clifton, banned the movement, also know as The Way, after priests in three parishes became involved in it.  A report said parishioners in those parishes were publicly questioned about their personal lives and that there was an  &quot;obsession with sexual sin.&quot;  The movement was founded by an artist in Madrid in 1964 and has the Pope's backing, the newspaper said.   <P> <B>Evangelist Luis Palau will hold a small crusade in mostly Buddhist Thailand</B> this weekend.  He was invited by the Northern Thailand Mission, a group of local pastors and Christian leaders who want to evangelize their city, Chaingmai.  Palau will speak in a stadium that holds 3,000 people. <P> <B>A New York publisher ordered a female author to remain chaste </B>until her book is published in five months.  Warner Books insisted on the &quot;no sex&quot; clause when it signed 26-year-old Tara McCarthy, a Roman Catholic who wrote <I>Been There, Haven't Done That: A Virgin's Memoirs</I>, the <I>London Times</I> reported.  The book aims to show readers that it is possible to remain a virgin and have fun.  Warner said news of a sexual indiscretion by McCarthy could make the book difficult to sell. <P> <B>The Vatican today confirmed that the Pope will visit Sarajevo April 13</B>.  The purpose of the trip is to encourage understanding and cooperation among the various faiths. <P> <B>China is extending its authoritarian campaign to stamp out ideas that differ</B> from Communist Party ideology.  It has ordered publishers to issue more good books, no bad books, and fewer mediocre books.  China describes the campaign as a drive to promote spirituality and civic responsibility.  &quot;Good books are books about science, books that you can learn from,&quot; one publisher told Reuter news service.  &quot;Bad books are books that violate policy on religion, are subversive or pornographic, or depict violence,&quot; the official said.  Pornographic and violent novels have flooded book stands in recent years among Chinese, who have been allowed very little entertainment since the 1966-1976 Cultural Revolution. <P> <B>The New York State Senate rejected a constitutional amendment to legalize casino gambling</B>, killing the proposal until at least 1999.  Gambling proponents had envisioned casinos as a potential source of profits and tax dollars.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 20, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Bringing clergy into public school classrooms in Beaumont, Texas</B>, is constitutional, a federal judge ruled. District Judge Joe Fisher denied a request by three Beaumont parents who wanted to stop the Clergy in Schools program. None of the students whose parents filed the lawsuit have attended the program, which is voluntary for students, news reports said. <BR><B>...Clergy began visiting Beaumont schools in September to meet with groups of students</B>. School Superintendent Carrol Thomas said the program is meant to allow ministers and rabbis to teach communication and listening skills. Other professional people also are welcome to volunteer, she said. <P> <B>Smuggling Bibles into China reportedly is on the increase</B>. More than 300,000 Bibles were smuggled into the country by 100 Bible couriers this year, according to Dennis Balcombe, pastor or Revival Christian Church in Hong Kong. Many of the smugglers are tourists who want to evangelize China, he said. <P> <B>A senior Iranian cleric called for restricting Internet access</B> because it feeds &quot;poison&quot; to the masses. Ayatollah Ahmad Jannati said in a sermon at Tehran University that the global computer network should be restricted to scientific research. Iran's telecommunications department says it has 10,000 Internet subscribers. They must sign a statement pledging not to read or look at any information deemed &quot;un-Islamic,&quot; such as pornography. <P> <B>Astronomer Carl Sagan, who popularized discussion of the universe</B> in lectures, books, and television, died of pneumonia after a battle with bone marrow disease; he was 62. Sagan won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 1978 for <I>The Dragons of Eden: Speculations on the Evolution of Human Intelligence</I>. In 1980, his Public Broadcasting Service series <I>Cosmos</I> became the most-watched limited series in American public television. <BR><B>...Sagan believed in the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence</B>, since organic molecules necessary for life appear to exist almost everywhere in the solar system. He said that proving whether mankind is alone or not is one of the world's most important puzzles. <P> <B>An Egyptian professor will not be forced to divorce his wife</B>, a Cairo court ruled. The ruling clears the way for Nasr Abu Zeid, an Arabic literature professor, and his wife, Ibtihal Younis, to return to Egypt. They fled to the Netherlands after a ruling that his writings insulted Islam, and both are teaching at Leiden University. The charge against Abu Zeid was that his writings made him an apostate, so he could not remain married to a Muslim woman. <BR><B>...The case has come to exemplify the struggle between fundamentalists,</B> who want to install Islamic law in Egypt, and secularists, who fear such a move would infringe on intellectual and religions freedom. Abu Zeid says his writings are a scholarly analysis of the language of the Koran. <P> <B>Several top Hollywood film stars have been placed on a blacklist</B> of 50 people barred from visiting Tibet. The blacklist comes a few weeks after Beijing clashed with the Walt Disney Co. over its film on the life of the Dalai Lama, Tibet's exiled god-king. The Dalai Lama fled Tibet to India in 1959 after an unsuccessful uprising against Chinese rule. He has since waged a non-violent campaign for the autonomy of his homeland. Names on the blacklist include Harrison Ford and his wife Melissa Mathison Ford, Brad Pitt, and directors Martin Scorsese and Jean-Jaques Annaud. <BR><B>...Pitt stars in S<I>even Years in Tibet, </I>a film directed by Annaud about the young Dalai Lama</B>. China has reportedly tried to halt production by Disney of <I>Kundun, </I>a film about the Dalai Lama that is directed by Scorsese. Mathison Ford is a scriptwriter for the movie. <P> <B>Former film star Brigitte Bardot, an animal rights activist,</B> is on trial in France on charges of racial bias for an opinion piece she wrote in a conservative newspaper criticizing the Muslim ritual of slaughtering animals. She faces up to a year in prison and a $60,000 fine. <BR><B>...Many of France's 3 million Muslims sacrifice a lamb on Eid al-Adha,</B> the springtime celebration after the fast of  Ramadan. Bardot compared the practice to torture. She also has referred to &quot;foreign overpopulation&quot; in France. Bardot, who is married to a member of the far-right National Front, says she is not &quot;a flag-carrier for any party but for the defense of animals.&quot;    </font></p>

The movement began in 1994 when 102 United Methodists met to discuss what they consider the UMC's &quot;abandonment of the truth of the gospel of Jesus Christ as revealed in Scripture and asserted in the classic Christian tradition and historic ecumenical creeds.&quot; More than 500 people attended the group's Sept. 27-28 conference in Cincinnati. <P> <B>The radical Taleban militia that has conquered Afghanistan continues to enforce a purist brand of Islam</B> on the people, Reuters news service said. On Tuesday, a broadcast by the Taleban-controlled Kabul Radio quoted a religious official as ordering people to offer Islamic prayers five times a day. Local prayer leaders were asked to bring violators to Taleban offices. &quot;Those who do not perform the prayer in fact are committing a grave sin and those who reject it are infidels,&quot; the announcement said. <BR><B>...The Taleban, which began as a movement of  theology students</B> and now controls three quarters of the country, has many people in fear. Women have been barred from leaving their homes without the Islamic veil and from working in offices. But after an outcry abroad about the denial of women's rights, the Taleban issued a decree promising women laid off from their jobs would be paid their salaries without working. The salaries will be sent to their homes, a Kabul Radio broadcast said<B>.</B> <BR><B>...A Taleban official said 85 &quot;thieves and plunderers&quot; had been caught in three days</B> and were &quot;undergoing legal and Sharia investigation.&quot; Also, 90 cars and 500 weapons have been confiscated, Reuters said. The Taleban has decreed death by stoning for adultery and amputation of hands for theft. <P> <B>In Jerusalem, tourists who came to visit the holy sites have found themselves</B> in the middle of an armed struggle, their tour blocked by Israeli checkpoints, the Associated Press said. Israeli soldiers have stopped many tour buses from entering the city. Last week, Israel opened a new exit to a Jerusalem tunnel that runs near sites sacred to Jews, Christians and Muslims. <BR><B>...Hotels across Israel and the West Bank have had numerous cancellations</B>, news reports said. The Israel Ministry of Tourism is attempting to deal with an estimated $200 million loss in tourist renevue since the tunnel opening, a newspaper said. <BR><B>...Jews observing a religious holiday Tuesday made heavy use of the tunnel</B> to reach their destinations, CNN said. While polls show most Israelis believe their prime minister was wrong to open the tunnel, there was no sign of that opinion among its visitors, the network said. <P> <B>Congress has cracked down on child pornographers</B>.  A new law that took effect Tuesday makes it illegal to use computer technology to depict children in sexual situations -- whether in films, computer images or photographs. Such depictions, which use computer simulations rather than real children, had been outside the scope of federal law. Lawmakers said computer-generated pornography poses many of the same dangers to children as does pornography made from unretouched photographs. <BR><B>...The new law sets mandatory prison sentences of 15 years for production of child pornography</B>, five years for possession of the materials, and life in prison for repeat offenders convicted of sexual abuse of a minor. The American Civil Liberties Union criticized the law as unconstitutional, saying  it was so broad that adults portraying children in films could risk prosecution. <P> <B>B'nai B'rith began a campaign against the Southern Baptist Convention's resolution</B> on Jewish evangelism. The Jewish organization, which has members in 56 countries, mailed a fundraising letter to about 100,000 people describing the SBC<B> </B>resolution, which advocates an active program of converting Jews to Christianity, as &quot;condescending and contemptuous. This profoundly disrespectful action  demonstrates a basic lack of respect for Judaism as a sister religion.&quot; <P> <B>Lesbian and gay activists  are protesting a proposal by California Gov. Pete Wilson to restrict adoption</B> to legally married couples, CNN said. Gay-rights supporters say the proposed change to the state's adoption regulations are an attack on the concept of homosexual marriage<B>. </B>Eighteen<B> s</B>tates allow both members of a homosexual couple to adopt a child. Florida and New Hampshire specifically outlaw homosexual adoptions.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 5, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A U.S. immigration judge granted asylum to a Togo, Africa, man who is HIV-positive</B> because the man fears he would be shamed in his homeland, news reports said. In court, the man said he could not get work in Togo, that drugs to treat him were scarce, and that HIV-positive people are ostracized. The case may be the first U.S. court ruling stemming from the White House's policy this year that gives preferential treatment to immigrants who have AIDS or are HIV-positive, <I>The Washington Times</I> reported. <P> <B>The controversial Halloween Hell House will be back this year in Arvada, Colo</B>. The display is sponsored by Abundant Life Christian Center, a Pentecostal church. It is modeled after a traditional haunted house, but contains scenes depicting a woman who has just undergone an abortion, a funeral for an AIDS sufferer, a drunken driver who kills his family in a car accident, and a teen-age suicide victim. The gruesome scenes depict what happens when people reject the Bible, the pastor told the Associated Press. There also will be a Heaven House exhibit for children. Abundant Life is selling how-to kits to other churches that want to set up their own Hell Houses. <P> <B>Lutherans and Catholics opened an elementary school together in Youngstown, Ohio, this fall</B>. New Hope Academy -- known since 1914 as St. Patrick School -- is sponsored by the Northeastern Ohio Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, the Catholic Dioceses of Youngstown, and run by Ursaline Sisters. There are two Lutheran teachers on staff, and students who are interested can learn about Lutheranism, the ELCA news service reported. <P> <I><B>Money</B></I><B> magazine named five schools that are members of the Coalition for Christian Colleges</B> and Universities in its rankings of best college buys. Last year, <I>Money</I> had a policy that excluded most religious schools. The magazine reversed its stance after appeals from a number of groups, the CCCU said. The CCCU schools listed in the magazine are: Gordon College, Wenham, Mass; Goshen College, Goshen, Ind.; Tabor College, Hillsboro, Kan.; Trinity Christian College, Palos Heights, Ill.; and Wheaton College, Wheaton, Ill. <BR><B>...Although not included in the ranking because it does not charge tuition</B>, College of the Ozarks, in Missouri, was cited by <I>Money </I>as a &quot;great deal.&quot;  Students pay for their tuition by working on campus 15 hours a week, plus two 40-hour weeks each semester, CCCU said. <P> <B>Pope John Paul II is being hospitalized to remove his appendix. The Vatican denied a report</B> by the Italian news agency <I>ASCA</I> that the pope, 76, may be suffering from a new tumor. The pope had a colon tumor removed in 1992. <P> <B>Ethnic killings among the Tutsi and Hutu in the central African country of Burundi threaten to escalate into genocide</B> like that experienced by its neighbor to the north, Rwanda, in 1994, Christian relief workers say. Since a coup in July, Burundi has been ruled outside of its multi-party, democratic constitution. A comprehensive, international peace plan is necessary to prevent genocide, relief workers told Ecumenical News Service. The peace plan should include a cease-fire, material aid, an embargo on arms shipments to the region, monitoring of human rights, and security assistance from neighboring states, relief workers said. <P> <B>Poland's upper chamber of parliament voted Thursday to reject liberalization of the country's strict, church-sponsored anti-abortion law</B>. However, Poland's lower chamber, which voted Aug. 30 to liberalize the law, still may overrule the upper chamber. President Aleksander Kwasniewski said he would sign the bill, which allows abortions up until the 12th week of pregnancy. Thousands of  protesters pushed baby carriages and prayed outside the Warsaw parliament building during the vote, news reports said. <P> <B>Canada's Supreme court agreed to hear an appeal by a homosexual</B> who was fired by The King's University College in Edmonton, Alberta, which has strong religious views against homosexuality, Reuter news service reported. The court's ruling could set policy for how far Canadian courts can force an end to discrimination. <BR><B>...The appellant, Delwin Vriend, was dismissed in 1991 as a laboratory coordinator</B>. At issue is whether Alberta's human rights act violates the federal constitution's Charter of Rights since it does not ban discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Vriend was successful in a trial court, but that ruling was overturned before he appealed to the Supreme Court. <P> <B>Pat Robertson's daily hour-long talk show, the <I>700 Club</I>, is broadcasting on New York superstation</B> WWOR. This gives the Virginia Beach, Va., evangelist a potential audience of 92% of U.S. television households, since WWOR is picked up by  cable systems and other stations across the country. <P> <B>A woman in China walked 200 miles to mail a letter</B> to Trans World Radio's Chinese Ministry International. The letter told about the woman's conversion to faith in Christ. &quot;Such is the impact that the gospel is having on this nation, still gripped by atheism and other religious beliefs,&quot; TWR said. <P>      </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 27, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Changes in the American family have leveled off</B>, according to a new Census Bureau study. Since the 1970s, families have become smaller, more have only one parent, and more have mothers who work outside the home. Those trends are entrenched in society, but have slowed. From 1970 to 1990, the number of married couples with children under 18 shrank from 40% of all households to 25%, the Census Bureau said. The number of single-person households climbed from 17% of all households to 25%. Those rates now have stabilized, and were the same in 1995. The divorce rate also has stabilized since 1990 at about 4.6 divorces per 1,000 people, after doubling from 1960 to 1990.  <BR><B>...A little-noticed fact in the study is that more than half of all households are headed by a married couple,</B> some of whom have yet to have children while others have already raised children, according to William Mattox of the Family Research Council. Much of the growth of one-person households is due to the increase in elderly people living alone after the death of their spouse, he noted. The rise in single-parent households and unmarried households continues to be a cause for concern, he said. <P> <B>The Episcopal Church announced it has recovered all but about $100,000</B> from the $2.2 million embezzled by former treasurer Ellen Cooke. After deducting $320,000 in costs associated with the case, the net loss to the church is $422,094, the church treasurer's office reported. It's report did not include interest that would have been earned on the lost funds. Cooke is serving five years in a West Virginia prison after pleading guilty to income tax evasion and transporting stolen money across state lines.  <P> <B>Biblical scholars who belong to the iconoclastic Jesus Seminar</B> plan to consider whether the New Testament should be revised to include other ancient Christian texts, <I>The New York Times </I>reported. The scholars also say they will review the church's early creeds, develop books of biblical criticism for lay people, and have members draw up their own profiles of Jesus. Seminar founder Robert W. Funk called for &quot;a new reformation&quot; of Christianity, even drawing up a list of theses to challenge current doctrines. <BR><B>...Seminar theologians claim that a minority of Jesus' sayings were His actual words</B>. They describe the rest of Christ's words in the New Testament as probably composed by early Christians after the crucifixion. Next year, the seminar will publish an analysis of  Jesus' deeds that presents Him as a charismatic, but not necessarily divine, religious figure. <P> <B>Some 1,000 Christian leaders from across Canada spent three days listening, learning, and networking</B> at World Shapers '96 Oct. 28-21 in Toronto. Speakers included Charles Colson of Prison Fellowship, who decried North America's lapse into moral relativism, the newspaper <I>Christian Week</I> said. Connie denBok, a church planter with the Pentecostal Assemblies of Canada, warned of complacency in the church. Christians should not become the establishment -- &quot;more couth, more polished, and look better&quot; -- but be &quot;practitioners of frontier Christianity,&quot; she said.  <P>    <P> <B>Hitler adopted anti-Semitism only as a stepping stone to power</B>, according to an Austrian historian. The young Hitler respected and later protected the Jewish family doctor who treated his mother's cancer. He had Jewish friends and even admired Jewish actors and composers, according to Brigitte Hamann, a Viennese academic. Hitler later developed his anti-Semitic attitude because it reflected the mood of the times and allowed him to build a movement, her study of Austrian and German archives shows. The findings have set off a new controversy about Hitler's personal responsibility for the Holocaust,<I> The London Times</I> reported. <P> <B>An Oct. 20 <I>Parade Magazine</I> article on Billy Graham needs clarification</B>, according to A. Larry Ross, director of media and public relations for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. In a letter to <I>Parade</I>'s editor, Ross said Graham's message &quot;hasn't changed.&quot; Graham &quot;believes there is only one path to God -- through repentance and faith in the atoning death of Jesus Christ, who provides redemption from sin and the promise of eternal life.&quot; The <I>Parade</I> writer, Colin Greer, quoted Graham as stating: &quot;I fully adhere to the fundamental tenets of Christian faith for myself and my ministry. But, as an American, I respect other paths to God -- and, as a Christian, I am called on to love them.&quot; Graham's statement recognizes that there are many religions in society, and that Christians are to love every individual, regardless of their beliefs, Ross said. <P> <B>The body of Ron Farris, a Nazarene medical missionary to West Africa</B>, has been positively identified by State Department officials. Farris is officially listed as a casualty of Saturday's hijacking and subsequent crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961, according to Jack Stone, general secretary for the Church of the Nazarene. Survivors include his wife, four children, and his parents. <P> <B>The release of Carl Hunziker in North Korea could improve relations between Pyongyang and Washington, </B>analysts said. North Korea on Wednesday freed Hunziker, who had been detained on spy charges for three months. He arrived in Tokyo with U.S. Congressman Bill Richardson, who negotiated his release. The U.S. paid a $5,000 hotel bill but no fine, Richardson said. Hunziker, whose family says he is a missionary, was detained by North Korea near the border with China when he crossed the Yalu River separating the two countries. <BR><B>...Hunziker, 26, looked weary and seemed embarrassed by the ranks of journalists and camera crews</B> when he stepped from a U.S. Air Force plane onto Yokota U.S. airbase, near Tokyo. He raised his hands with Richardson as U.S. military personnel applauded. Hunziker is expected to be home in Parkland, Wash., for Thanksgiving. <P> <B>The Walt Disney Co. said it won't be intimidated by China. </B>The filmmaker announced it will stick with plans to distribute <I>Kundun</I>, a new film about the Dalai Lama, despite objections from the Chinese government. Beijing regards the Dalai Lama, the exiled religious leader of Tibet, as a threat to its rule over the Himalayan region. <BR><B>...China's objections raised concerns that Disney will be prevented</B> from doing business in the Asian nation, one of  the filmmaker's largest untapped markets. The movie will be distributed only in the United States. <P> <B>President Clinton urged clergy to remind young people in their congregations about the dangers of AIDS and drugs</B>. In a written appeal to 300 individuals and clergy organizations, Clinton said World AIDS Day on Sunday is a chance to &quot;reflect on the tremendous impact that HIV and AIDS have had on our nation's families, our communities, our country and our planet.&quot;    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 4, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Churches in China are overflowing</B>, according to Marj Carpenter, moderator of the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.). This fall, Carpenter preached to 2,000 people at Mo Chou Church in Nanjing. An increasing number of young people, university students, and inquirers are attending church, she said. In a rural area in northern Jiangsu Province, Carpenter met with 350 Christians who worshipped and sang outdoors in their village. <BR><B>...Expelled from China nearly 50 years ago, the Roman Catholic Church </B>is pushing for full diplomatic relations with Beijing. Talks between the Vatican and Beijing continue, but are stalemated over the issue of government control. Presently, officially recognized religions must report to a government agency whose mission is to promote atheism. <P> <B>China has promised not to make Hong Kong communist, </B>but Christians there are skeptical. Under the Basic Law -- the constitution China prepared for Hong Kong -- the territory will keep the freedoms it enjoyed under British rule, including religious autonomy. But Hong Kong's 500,000 Christians -- about 8% of the population -- are divided about whether to believe those promises. <BR><B>...A crackdown on dissent in Beijing has worried inhabitants of Hong Kong.</B> An estimated 3,000 people protested in the streets there Sunday, demanding that China release democracy activist Wang Dan and other dissidents. Protesters chanted slogans while others walked with hands chained and mouths taped shut to symbolize the silencing of dissent in China. Others rode in flatbed trucks decorated to resemble Chinese prison cells. Wang was sentenced to 11 years in prison on charges of conspiring to subvert the government. <BR><B>...An evangelical pastor in Hong Kong says no matter what happens,</B> house churches will continue. The core of the church will be in such house groups, said Dennis Balcombe, head of the Revival Christian Church.  <P> <B>Hindus cut off the electric supply when Indian evangelist Sadhu Chellappa held a crusade</B> in the town of Kandarvakkottai in Tamil Nadu, according to DAWN FridayFax. But the Christians had brought a diesel generator to power the lights and 32 loudspeakers. Hundreds of people accepted the gospel that evening, resulting in a newly-planted church attended by 150, Chellappa said. <P> <B>Stressed-out nuns from across Britain are taking courses to learn how to relax</B>. The nuns, who work with drug addicts and the homeless, go to a retreat in Berkshire for training in exercise, nutrition, and massage. People think nuns are always serene, but they are like everyone else, an instructor said. Nuns take difficult jobs where they are needed most, acting as counselors and therapists for people dealing with drugs, alcohol abuse, crime, and violence. <P> <B>Habitat for Humanity International took a team of 500 people </B>for a five-and-a-half day &quot;blitz&quot; build in Hungary. The workers, from 23 countries, constructed houses and talked to residents about God, Mission News Network said. Since volunteerism is unusual in Hungary, local residents and the media noticed the effort.  <P> <B>Representatives of three evangelical groups</B> are looking for ways to cooperate. Representatives of AD 2000 and Beyond, Lausanne Committee for World Evangelization, and World Evangelical Fellowship met Oct. 15-16 in Carol Stream, Ill., to explore closer ties for promoting world evangelism. <BR><B>...The aim is to avoid unnecessary duplication of efforts</B>, the leaders said, adding that they want to increase cooperation and trust among the groups without losing the distinctive ministry of any of them. <BR><B>...The leaders are planning another meeting that will include representatives of additional key ministries</B>. An interim group will meet during the National Assembly of Evangelicals in Bournemouth, England, Nov. 10-13. <P> <B>International Bible Society began publishing a bimonthly magazine</B> called <I>Native Wind</I>. The premier issue contains profiles of  Native American Christians who &quot;do not relinquish their cultural heritage&quot; for the sake of religion, the IBS said. <P> <B>Some 69% of Roman Catholics in England and Wales want priests to have the right to marry</B>, according to a poll taken by a weekly newspaper the <I>Catholic Herald</I>. <P> <B>The Anglican Church in Japan made a formal statement of apology for its complicity in World War II</B>, Anglican News Service said. &quot;While it may seem to have taken a long time for this statement of apology to appear, it has finally come to the surface after much prayer, reflection, discussion, and heartfelt concern,&quot; wrote Primate James Takiro Yashiro in a letter to the head of the New Zealand Anglican Church. The three-page statement said the Nippon Sei Ko Kai church did not oppose militarism or support oppressed groups, but became too inward-looking. <P> <B>Pope John Paul II will make a historic first visit to Cuba,</B> a Vatican official confirmed. Arrangements for the visit are being made, news reports said. A trip by a Vatican foreign minister to the island recently signaled improved relations between the Communist government and the Roman Catholic Church.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 23, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Sudan has ordered separation of the sexes in public</B>, news reports said. In conformity with strict Muslim law, barriers must be present between men and women at weddings, parties, and picnics. The law bans men and women from sitting facing each other, buses must display a verse from the Koran asking Muslims to not look at members of the opposite sex, and streets must be well-lighted so couples can't go into the darkness. Similar laws were enacted in Iran after the 1979 revolution. <BR><B>...Khartoum's new law does not require women to wear a veil</B>, but women working in restaurants cannot wear jewelry or perfume. Women cannot sit near the driver on buses, and must be accompanied by a male relative while shopping at night. Female athletes and women performing folk dances cannot wear tight-fitting clothes. Men also must cover their bodies, and males must be separated from females in private schools, as they are in public schools. <BR><B>...Christians in the southern part of the country are exempt</B> from the new laws. The government is considering extending the exemption to Christians in the Muslim-majority north. <P> <B>A play about the 1956 deaths of Jim Elliot and four other missionaries</B> -- and the subsequent opening of the gospel to the tribe responsible for their murders -- is being performed in 20 U.S. cities. <I>Dayuma</I>, which opened Sept. 19-21 in Tulsa, Okla., is being staged through cooperation among Wycliffe Bible Translators, Youth With a Mission, and Impact Productions. <P> <B>Some 10,000 North American youngsters in 39 states and Canada collected a ton of school supplies</B> for children in Ukraine. The supplies were gathered at Vacation Bible School programs this summer through a project organized by Slavic Gospel Association. Local pastors in Ukraine will distribute the supplies to public school children. SGA also is giving away 12 tons of shoes and clothing in Ukraine, the Loves Park-Ill.-based group said.  <P> <B>For the first time, Britain's Anglican, Roman Catholic, and Jewish leaders joined to speak out</B> for a more caring and moral society. Anglican leader George Carey called for parenting classes and more emphasis on the teaching of right and wrong in schools. Jonathan Sacks, Britain's chief rabbi, called for establishment of a royal commission on the question of teaching citizenship. <BR><B>...At least a million children are abused in Britain each year</B>, a commission said in a report published today. The National Commission of Inquiry into the Prevention of Child Abuse said abuse was preventable but a &quot;culture change&quot; was needed. <P> <B>An interracial and interdenominational mixture of 2,000 Australian Christians</B> prayed and worshipped in shifts for 72 hours Oct. 10-13 in the Great Hall of  the Parliament House Canberra. Every denomination and many tribal groups were represented at the Praise Corroboree, according to Worldwide Photos. At the event, aboriginal elders and pastors stood with arms outstretched as they laid hands on and blessed Prime Minister John Howard. <P> <B>A Baptist church in a poor section of  Los Angeles has planted or helped support 62 churches</B>, Baptist Press said. El Camino Truth and Life Baptist Church, a congregation of fewer than 200 people, has a modest budget, staff, and facilities. But its pastor, Aquiles Acosta, has a &quot;deep calling of God&quot; to spread the gospel as widely as possible, he says. Many leaders of churches planted by El Camino are congregants Acosta trained in a three-year Bible course he developed. The Bible Institute covers two years of theology and one year of homiletics and hermeneutics. Hour-long tests are given weekly. <BR><B>...In addition to churches planted in Los Angeles,</B> El Camino assists congregations in Mexico, Argentina and Greece. The church holds worship on Friday nights in lieu of Sunday evening services so members can preach and lead worship at fledgling churches. <P> <B>The United Methodist Church is planning a weekly 30-minute cable television show</B> offering a religious perspective on the news. <I>News Odyssey</I> is scheduled to begin on the Odyssey Channel, formerly Faith and Values Network, next year. <P> <B>Churches could jeopardize their tax-exempt status by handing out Christian Coalition voter guides,</B> according to Americans United for Separation of Church and State. The group said the guides imply support for Republican candidates and distort the positions of  Democrats. Some 45 million guides are scheduled to be distributed to 120,000 churches in the next two weeks. <BR><B>...&quot;If a church distributes a partisan voter guide, it will constitute improper political activity by the church</B>,&quot; according to a memo prepared for Americans United by tax lawyers Milton Cerny and Albert Lauber, Jr. The tax-exempt Christian Coalition is being sued by the Federal Election Commission for allegedly making illegal contributions to former President George Bush and other Republicans through the voter guides and for conducting voter drives for certain candidates. <BR><B>...Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed dismissed charges</B> that distribution of the guide is political activity not permitted of tax-exempt organizations. Reed also told the National Press Club that the coalition has asked the Federal Election Commission to investigate a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser held at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles last April that was attended by Vice President Al Gore. The event raised $140,000.    </font></p>

According to <I>The Chronicle of Philanthropy</I>, the bankruptcy trustee in the case wrote checks for $16.8 million on Dec. 31. Each organization that was owed money under a group settlement received 21.55% of the amount it lost. <BR><B>...In all, trustees hope to return 80% of the $77 million lost</B> by the charities that participated in the settlement. Before more money can be returned, charities that came out ahead must give back $16 million, either voluntarily or by court order. <P> <B>Some 2,000 African-American students</B> gathered in Atlanta Dec. 27-Jan. 1 to initiate  what they hope will become a student movement that changes urban America. Organizers of the <A HREF= http://www.forimpact.com/>Impact</A> conference said they expect their network to touch 50,000 people this year by addressing crime, poverty, and hopelessness. At the conference, students discussed the perception among some blacks that Christianity is a white person's religion, conference director Charles Gilmer said. Christian rap musicians met to discuss the influence of their music. <P> <B>New York State can't compel prisoners to undergo 12-step programs</B> for alcohol or substance abuse, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Monday. The 12-step program, developed by Alcoholics Anonymous, relies on submission to God or a higher power. The court let stand a lower court's ruling that New York's use of the program amounts to state support of religion. The case involved prisoner David Griffin, who wanted to participate in a program involving reconciliation with his family. Because Griffin had admitted to long-term heroin use, he also was required to participate in a 12-step program for substance abuse. He sued, saying that he is not religious and that the requirement violates his First Amendment rights. <P> <B>The excommunication of a Sri Lankan priest for challenging Catholic doctrine</B> has become a hot topic among Third World theologians. Tissa Balasuriya, 72, one of Asia's best-known theologians, gained the unanimous support of 80 members of the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians during its meeting in the Philippines last month, according to the <I>National Catholic Reporter</I>. <BR><B>...Balasuriya said he rethinks Catholic dogmas to make them understandable</B> to Hindus and Buddhists. His views have been labeled &quot;religious relativism,&quot; meaning no faith has a unique claim to the truth and no spiritual figure can claim to be the only savior. The Vatican said Balasuriya's teachings deny fundamental doctrines such as redemption through Christ and original sin. <P> <B>Witchdoctors trying to convince Marxist guerrillas to end Peru's hostage crisis </B>performed rituals outside the Japanese ambassador's residence in Lima Monday. A dozen witchdoctors dressed in cloaks, ponchos, and feathers chanted &quot;We want peace,&quot; spat potions into the air, danced over machetes, held animal skulls aloft, burned incense, and freed doves, Reuter news service reported. Their efforts prompted no response inside the residence. <P> <B>Four prison inmates are suing in order to practice Satanism.</B> The prisoners, who live at the Dutchman Correctional Institute in Enoree, S.C., say they are being denied access to a Satanic Bible and other items they need. Each is seeking $500,000 in damages and $25 million in punitive damages from the state, United Press International reported. The South Carolina Corrections Department does not recognize Satanism as a religion. <P> <B>Orthodox Christians were celebrating Christmas today. </B>Millions of people attended Orthodox services in Russia, where the Orthodox faith is flourishing after seven decades of  Soviet repression. Up to half of Russia's 150 million people are active Orthodox believers.  <BR><B>...Patriarch Alexiy II, head of the Russian Orthodox Church,</B> was to say Mass at the massive, newly rebuilt Christ the Savior cathedral in Moscow. The cathedral was constructed in only two years on the site of a 19th century church that Joseph Stalin ordered destroyed in 1931. <BR><B>...Alexiy appealed to the Kremlin to remember Russia's poor</B> and solve the problem of unpaid wages and pensions. He criticized the gap between the wealthy who benefited from economic reforms and the majority that have seen a decline in their living standards.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 10, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Two hundred fifty cities have joined an anti-drug crusade</B> <B>called Turn Around America</B>.  Participants, many of whom are clergy or members of Christian churches, confront drug dealers by staging marches and vigils at crack houses and places in neighborhoods where dealers do business.   <BR><B>...The largest such group is in Cincinnati, </B>where Charlie Winburn, pastor of the nondenominational Ridge Acres Christian Center, leads residents into drug markets in their neighborhoods.  <BR><B>...Every week, 50-300 members wearing yellow shirts and white hard hats</B> march into three of the city's most notorious drug corners or crack houses chanting &quot;Up with hope, down with dope!&quot; Most marchers are members of churches or students from God's Bible School in nearby Mount Auburn, Ohio.  About 60% of the marchers are black, and the rest are white or members of ethnic minorities.  <BR><B>...&quot;We get in the drug dealers' faces and chant until they leave,&quot;</B> marcher David Collier told <I>Religion News Today</I>.   He is the legislative assistant for Winburn, who also is a city councilman.   When confronted, drug dealers either leave or &quot;do something stupid&quot; such as throw eggs, and are then arrested, Collier said.  <BR><B>...Cincinnati marchers have endured bad weather, being pelted with eggs</B> and bottles, slashed tires, death threats, and a lawsuit by the owner of a business targeted as the hub of drug activity.  But no marcher has been injured, said Collier, who has been on 44 such marches.  The result has been 47 arrests, which have put Cincinnati's formerly entrenched drug markets into disarray. <P> <B>Average tuition at schools </B>that belong to the <A HREF=http://www.cccu.org>Coalition for Christian Colleges and Universities </A> rose 7.1% to $10,293 this year.  According to a study, average tuition at the 90 CCCU schools is $2,530 below the average of  four-year private schools.  <P> <B>Five thousand Christians in Katmandu, Nepal, participated in a March for Jesus</B> recently.  They walked along main roads singing choruses and hymns, clapping, and dancing, according to Graham Kendrick, founder of the global March for Jesus.  They preached the gospel and distributed tracts and small booklets to people.  After the march, participants went to a stadium and worshipped. <P> <B>Asking teen-agers to help less fortunate people is the key to attracting them to church,</B> a survey shows.  Serving others appeals to 80% of teenagers polled by the Gallup organization's Princeton Religion Research Center.  In the survey, 20% of teenagers said they were already involved in church-sponsored activities to help less fortunate people; 60% said they would like to be involved. <P> <B>A three-time murderer who sought clemency after becoming a Christian was executed</B> in Alabama Jan. 10.  Billy Wayne Waldrop, 44, was pronounced dead at Holman Prison near Mobile.  &quot;He said he had God in his life, that he was ready to go,&quot; a prison officer told Reuter news service.  Members of an evangelical prison group had asked Gov. Fob James to grant a reprieve. <P> <B>Two of the three youths charged with painting racist messages on a black church</B> have asked for and received the congregation's forgiveness.  The teen-agers attended a service at Piney Grove AME Zion Church in Concord, N.C., to apologize. <BR><B>...&quot;It was stupidity,&quot;</B> said Michael McHone, 18, according to the Associated Press.  &quot;I feel so bad for what I've done to all of you nice people.&quot; The youths received embraces and greetings from the members and their pastor. <P> <B>Mormon leaders agreed to scale back their design for a temple</B> after residents of Belmont, Mass., complained about its impact on the neighborhood.  The decision came less than a month after the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints won approval from the town to build the $30-million temple with spires 76 to 139 feet high.  The decision to reduce the size of the building was made to create goodwill in the community, a church official said. <P> <B>Gaylord Entertainment Company completed its purchase of Word records and music</B> from Thomas Nelson.  Word is a contemporary Christian music company that has nine record labels, with performers such as Sandi Patty and Amy Grant.  Gaylord owns cable TV networks, the Grand Old Opry, radio stations, and television stations.  The purchase price was $100 million. <P>   <P> <B>The Catholic Church in England and Wales</B> is considering providing money  to women who have had affairs with priests, Reuter news service said.  The Catholic Bishops Conference set up a team of bishops and lay members to meet some of the women and consider ways to help them and their children.  The action follows a scandal over a bishop who ran off with a mother of three. <P> <B>Some 55% of female clergy</B> <B>say other clergywomen compete as well as cooperate</B> with one another, Hartford Seminary researchers found.  A reported 31% of the clergywomen said female clergy were cooperative but not competitive with one another, and 10% said the clergy were more competitive with one another than mutually supportive.  The survey did not examine competition among male clergy. <P> <B>A man tried to attack the patriarch of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church</B> with a sword Thursday but was shot dead, news reports said.   Police arrested the man who killed the would-be assassin of Patriarch Abune Paulso.  The attempted attack was carried out during prayers in St. Stephan's Church Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 29, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Christian landlords who refuse to rent to unmarried couples</B> are protected by the First Amendment, a federal judge in Alaska ruled.  U.S. District Judge H. Russel Holland said Anchorage and Alaskan laws that forbid rental discrimination do not outweigh the right to religious expression.  Courts elsewhere have sided with tenants in similar cases.  A nearly identical California case awaits the U.S. Supreme Court's decision on whether to consider the case. <P> <B>Gospel music is increasingly popular in Europe</B>.  Gospel groups, some from the United States, are hired to perform at community centers, theaters, weddings, birthday parties, radio programs, workshops, and festivals, the Associated Press reported.  A Paris restaurant, Chesterfield's, offers a Sunday gospel brunch. <BR><B>...Listeners are often surprised to learn</B> that in the United States, gospel music is usually performed only in churches and on television.  Gospel groups say that although Europeans tend to appreciate gospel primarily as music, they also listen to the words. <P> <B>A former flight attendant lost a religious discrimination lawsuit </B>against Southwest Airlines Co.  A federal jury in Dallas ruled that Southwest did not discriminate against Vanessa McCauley, a professed Christian.  She quit in 1994 after 12 years because her supervisors would not allow her to read the Bible or wear a cross on a long gold chain outside her uniform.  Airline officials also told McCauley not to discuss religion while working on a flight.  Southwest said it merely was enforcing its regulation that necklaces should be worn against the skin rather than over the uniform. <P>   <P> <B>A German archbishop might be sued for slander and defamation</B> for saying homosexuals are unsuitable for the priesthood, United Press International reported.  In an encyclical, the archbishop of Trier, Johannes Dyba, wrote that only men who have &quot;the right stuff to be good, healthy family men,&quot; are suitable for the priesthood.  The prosecutor's office is investigating a complaint from a man who says he is a homosexual and a Catholic.  <P> <B>Pressure from pro-life groups</B> has kept the U.S. government from supporting international family-planning and population programs, a Rockefeller Foundation report said.  Two years ago, the United States contributed $546 million to such programs, but Congress last year cut funding by 35%, and no money will be spent until July 1 unless Congress approves a resolution in February, the report said. <P> <B>Alabama wants to stop college and university groups that promote homosexuality</B> from obtaining state funds.  The state told the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday that it should uphold a 1992 Alabama law banning public funds for any campus group &quot;that fosters or promotes a lifestyle or actions prohibited by the (state's) sodomy and sexual misconduct laws.&quot; A judge ruled last year the law is unconstitutional because it limits discussion of sexuality. <P> <B>Churches in Wales are considering appointing the world's first &quot;ecumenical bishop.&quot;</B> The five churches would remain separate, and the bishop would belong to each of the denominations.  Among the five churches, only the Anglican Church in Wales has an episcopal tradition; the other four are non-episcopal.  They include: the Presbyterian Church of Wales, the Methodist Church, the United Reformed Church, and the Covenanted Baptist Churches.   <BR><B>...The ecumenical bishop could be appointed from any of the five churches</B>.  He would be consecrated at an ecumenical service and serve in the Cardiff area of Wales, where there is already considerable inter-church cooperation.  The bishop's authority would be carefully defined in each church.   <P> <B><A HREF=http://www.promisekeepers.org>Promise Keepers</A> is being targeted by atheists</B>.  <A HREF=http://www.atheists.org>American Atheists</A> announced it would hold two days of  &quot;public street action&quot; during the men's group's mass rally Oct. 4 in Washington, D.C.  Atheists will &quot;demonstrate for state-church separation, individual rights, an end to sexist-gender oppression of women and gays, and civil liberties,&quot; according to AANews.  A symposium on freedom from religion also is being planned. <P> <B>A remote group of people in Argentina will have a Bible</B> in their own language next year for the first time.  The New Testament will be published for the Chorote people, whose 2,000 members live near the Pilcomayo River on the Paraguayan border.  Chorotes began converting to Christianity in 1949 as the result of work by Anglican and Assemblies of God missionaries; about 70% now professes Christianity.  An Anglican missionary spent 20 years on the translation. <P> <B>Mikel Koliqi, a Roman Catholic cardinal who spent 38 years in Albanian prisons</B> and labor camps while religion was outlawed in the eastern European nation, died Tuesday at age 95.  In 1967, Stalinist dictator Enver Hoxha declared Albania an atheist state.  He banned religious activity, killed or arrested priests and nuns, and turned churches and mosques into sports halls, warehouses and movie theaters. <P> <B>A spiritual &quot;medium&quot; who settled a heavenly debt </B>now has a debt to settle with the law.  Police in Germany arrested a 23-year-old man who was paid $10,000 by an 85-year-old woman to settle gambling debts he said her dead husband had contracted in heaven.  The medium demanded the money from the woman for the purchase of a plot of land &quot;in heaven,&quot; news reports said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 18, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Tens of thousands of Romanians knelt and recited the Lord's Prayer in Bucharest</B> today at the request of the country's new, non-communist president. Challenger Emil Constantinescu defeated President Ion Iliescu Sunday in a runoff that gave the eastern European nation its first non-communist government. &quot;I'm here to tell you I will never betray you,&quot; Constantinescu told the crowd from a balcony, then appealed to them to pray with him. The vote completed a democratic and peaceful revolution in the country. <P> <B>The Salvation Army holds Sunday school classes for children in a supermarket</B> in Maidstone, England. Classes, which started Sept. 29 in a Tesco store, were packed, according to DAWN FridayFax. Meetings are held in a training room with space for 30 children. They feature an hour of songs, drawings, videos, and biblical stories. The Salvation Army advertises the class with the slogan, &quot;If you won't come to church, we'll bring the church to you!&quot; <P> <B>Four hundred teen-agers attended a sexual abstinence conference in Alzey, Germany</B>, Oct. 20. The True Love Waits meeting included testimonies and discussions, DAWN FridayFax said. Michael Muller, German coordinator for the movement, said people are amazed that teen-agers would avoid sex before marriage and make vows of abstinence. Muller has been flooded with interviews on radio and television. True Love Waits began several years ago in the Southern Baptist Convention and has spread to many countries. <P> <B>President Clinton spoke about his faith </B>in the December issue of <I>George</I>, a new magazine published by John Kennedy, Jr. Interviewed aboard Air Force One during the campaign, Clinton said he prays for guidance and considers biblical teachings. <BR><B>...&quot;First, if I have a really difficult decision and am not sure</B> what the right thing to do is, I pray for guidance, wisdom, some sense of insight that goes beyond my ability to think it through,&quot; Clinton said. &quot;Secondly, I've learned over time that one of the consequences of trying to live by a religious faith is that you have a conscience, and I try not to do anything that I don't believe in -- even if it seemed like the thing to do at the time.&quot; <BR><B>...Clear biblical teaching often is available on specific issues</B>, Clinton said. &quot;If you take the welfare reform example, there are hundreds of references in the Bible about our obligations to minister to the poor, to treat the poor with dignity and respect, not to hurt the poor.&quot; <BR><B>...Clinton said he believes abortion is &quot;unacceptable except in cases where the mother's life or health</B> is in danger or there's some severe problem that would prevent the child from even being a functioning person or there's an incest problem or something like that.&quot;   <BR><B>...&quot;The Bible does condemn homosexual conduct</B>, particularly in the Old Testament,&quot; he said. &quot;But in the New Testament, Christ always made a big distinction between the sin and the sinner. Christ condemned divorce far more harshly. There are explicit condemnations of divorce, and [references to] remarriage as adultery, that are unambiguous -- far more unambiguous than the reference made about abortion or homosexuality. But we don't deny divorced people the right to have jobs or enter into public service.&quot; Clinton said that &quot;just because people have committed sins, if they're good citizens, if they obey the law, if they show up every day and behave themselves, they should not be subject to unfair discrimination.&quot; <P> <B>The owner of a nude nightclub in conservative San Diego County has won a $200,000 court award</B> after charging police and bureaucrats with trying to run his business out of town. Elbert Poppell, 62, had been criticized by ministers and homeowners who said he tried to corrupt their community. In his lawsuit, Poppell charged that officials ran a campaign to harass and intimidate him and his customers. <BR><B>...Police repeatedly parked in front of Poppell's business with their car lights flashing</B> in an attempt to discourage potential customers, news reports said. Poppell said police wrote a large number of parking tickets around the nightclub and questioned customers. Police prevented Poppell from opening a nude church and closed down his other nude clubs because of prostitution, news reports said. <P>     <P> <B>A church service to commemorate 20 years of the Lesbian and Gay Christian movement in England </B>drew 2,000 people in Southwark Cathedral in London<B> </B>Saturday. It was the first Anglican cathedral service in Britain specifically for homosexuals. <BR><B>...The service provoked protests from conservative churchgoers</B> across Britain. Protesters outside the cathedral waved banners saying &quot;Sodomy and lesbianism -- a perversion to be repented, not an orientation to be celebrated&quot; and &quot;The wages of sin is death,&quot; news reports said. <P> <B>A Christian man who was scheduled to be flogged for marrying a Muslim woman</B> has converted to Islam, Reuter news service said. Elie Dib Ghalib, 30, who is Lebanese, had been sentenced to 39 lashes and a year in prison by the United Arab Emirates. An Islamic court there ruled his marriage was invalid and the relationship immoral. Amnesty International said it was concerned by reports of the impending lashing, that Ghalib was being held because of his Christianity, and that he allegedly has been tortured. Whether Ghalib now will escape punishment is uncertain, news reports said. <P> <B>A Springfield, Mo., woman won a $1 million lawsuit against a church and a Christian counselor. </B>Beth Rutherford, 23, of Tulsa, Okla., sued Donna Strand, the counselor at Park Crest Village Assembly of God church, and her husband, pastor Robert Strand. <BR><B>...During counseling sessions, Strand reportedly taught Rutherford how to enter a trance-like state</B> through self-hypnosis. Under the counselor's guidance, Rutherford recalled that her minister father supposedly raped her, got her pregnant, then performed a painful coat-hanger abortion, the Associated Press said. But Beth was still a virgin, according to medical tests, and her father had a vasectomy many years before. <BR><B>...Rutherford's parents had no knowledge of their daughter's allegations </B>until after the Strands informed the General Council of the Assemblies of God, where Tom Rutherford worked, news reports said. Tom Rutherford said he was confronted with the allegations, forced to resign, and lost many friends before doctors proved the allegations were false. <BR><B>...Beth Rutherford said she does not know where the thoughts came from</B>, but, &quot;I can tell you one thing for sure, they did not come from my mind. There are times in my therapy sessions that I have no memory of what happened.&quot; The Rutherfords said they will use the award to travel around the country warning people of the dangers of  &quot;recovered memory therapy.&quot;    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 8, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Sports betting is &quot;an epidemic&quot; among college students across the country</B>, Arnie Wexler, a compulsive-gambling counselor, told<I> The Christian Science Monitor</I>. Thirteen football players at Boston College, a Roman Catholic school, were suspended from competition recently for gambling on college and professional sports. Two face charges of betting against their own team. Even before the revelations at B.C., other colleges already had begun to curb sports betting, <I>The Monitor</I> said. <P> <B>The Anglican Church is preparing to replace its 900-year-old open-court system for clergy discipline</B> with secret tribunals. A report said clergy are upset at the &quot;washing of the church's dirty linen in public,&quot; <I>The London Times</I> said. The courts, which date back to William the Conqueror, would be replaced with tribunals that publish their decisions but withhold detailed evidence. <P> <B>Christians who once stayed away from a festival they considered to be pagan, now are working to transform it.</B> For the second year, Christians in Campbelltown, southwest of  Sydney, Australia, marched in the annual Fisher's Ghost parade. The Festival of  Fisher's Ghost began with a local story about a murder, an execution, and a returning ghost. The 300 Christians from 20 churches marched under the banner of the Christian Churches of Campbelltown, carrying balloons as a symbol of hope and life. At the end of the parade, they held a Family Fun Festival for everyone in the community. <P> <B>The Anglican Church will replace Rwandan bishops who remain in exile, afraid to return</B> to their homeland because they fear reprisals. Some clergy have been accused of complicity in massacres that occurred in Rwanda. Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey said he has been unable to persuade the bishops to return. Anglicans say they wonder how a church without leaders can minister effectively. <P> <B>Billy Graham will present a television special about peace this Christmas</B>. <I>A Season For Peace</I> will be aired in North America Dec. 3 and in 150 countries and territories in 33 languages during the rest of December. &quot;All over our world, people are beginning to realize that in their quest for peace, what they are really searching for is God,&quot; Graham said. <P> <B>Episcopal parishes in the United States are helping resettle 417 Iraqi Kurdish refugees</B> who are fleeing from Saddam Hussein. The refugees are part of a group of 2,200 Kurds airlifted out of Iraq by the U.S. military after missile strikes in Iraq. The 20 million Kurds living in Iran, Iraq, Turkey, and Syria are considered the world's largest minority group without a country of their own. <P>   <P> <B>Two Baylor University administrators have been demoted</B> for derogatory remarks about the school's president, Robert Sloan. Michael Bishop, chairman of the Journalism Department, and Henry Walbesser, graduate school dean, were removed from their administrative posts Oct. 30 by Sloan, Associated Baptist Press reported. Both remain on the faculty of the Baptist school in Waco, Texas. Sloan also recently fired Baylor's chaplain, Bill Austin, after a dispute with administrators. <BR><B>...Several newspapers have dealt with controversy over Sloan's actions</B>. Since becoming Baylor president 18 months ago, Sloan, a Baptist minister, has made church participation a top priority in hiring faculty, leading critics to predict he will turn the nation's largest Baptist university into a Bible college. Sloan was criticized by conservatives early in his administration for allowing dancing on campus. <P> <B>Christian Path, an evangelical political party in Nicaragua, will play a role</B> as power-broker after winning six seats in the national assembly during elections Oct. 20. One of the two major parties -- the Liberal Alliance and the Sandinista Front -- will need the support of the Christian Path to form a government. Christian Path, or Camino Cristiano, is led by Guillermo Osorno, a former Assemblies of God pastor and former director of Nicaragua's most popular evangelical radio station. <P> <B>Some evangelical pastors in Malawi, Africa, are accepting bribes</B> from the Muslim-led government to stop evangelizing, Mission Network News said. Because poverty is so severe, they are selling out the Gospel for financial gain. <P> <B>Ultra-Orthodox Jews have asked airlines to provide flights to and from Israel that would not compromise &quot;modesty and holiness,&quot;</B> Evangelical Press said. The flights would not have movies, and male flight attendants would serve male passengers. El Al airline already provides kosher meals and bans flights on Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath. <P> <B>Churches and synagogues in Massachusetts are experiencing a large increase in religious school enrollment,</B> the Associated Press said. Religious leaders attribute the jump in attendance to an increase in the birth rate in the 1990s and the desire of parents to give children a moral foundation.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 9, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court was skeptical</B> on Wednesday about proposals to create a new constitutional right for doctor-assisted suicide.  During arguments, several justices expressed reservations about overturning existing state bans on doctor-assisted suicide.  The justices seemed likely to leave the issue with the states. <BR><B>...Justice David Souter asked the attorney general of Washington state</B> how a right to kill could be controlled.  The attorney general replied that the examples of the Netherlands and Germany demonstrate that the killing could not be contained.   <BR><B>...Justice Stephen Breyer noted that good pain control is available</B> and that almost all of the 25% of people who die in pain do so needlessly.  The justice asked whether it was correct to assume that a right to assisted suicide would be a disincentive to improve pain care.  Justice Breyer discussed the cost of health care, noting that it would be cheaper to administer a lethal dose than to give aggressive treatment. <BR><B>...Justice Antonin Scalia noted that proponents of physician-assisted death</B> say it would be confined to the terminally ill who are in insufferable pain and who competently request death.  But if pain gives a person the right to die, why should the line be drawn with the terminally ill, Scalia asked.  Why should those who will be in pain for a 10-year illness be denied, he asked. <P> <B>Having an abortion does not increase a woman's chances of developing breast cancer</B>, according to a study of nearly 1.5 million Danish women.  The study, published in today's <I>New England Journal of Medicine, </I>shows that even women who had two or more abortions were no more likely than those who never had an abortion to develop breast cancer. <BR><B>...A debate on the issue has raged since 1980.  </B>At that time, researchers began wondering whether interrupting a pregnancy could leave the immature breast cells of early pregnancy vulnerable to cancer.  Dozens of studies had produced inconsistent results.  About 10 states considered legislation requiring that women who seek an abortion be informed that the procedure could increase the risk of developing breast cancer. Montana passed such a law.  <P> <B>Pope John Paul will meet with Taiwan's Vice President Lien Chan</B> next week in the Vatican, a move that could anger China.   The Vatican is one of only 30 states that recognize Taiwan.  It has no diplomatic ties with Beijing, which insists the Holy See first break its links with Taiwan if it wants improved ties.  Beijing regards Taiwan as a renegade province. <BR><B>...China does not allow its Catholics to recognize the Pope's authority</B>.  A month ago Beijing said it wanted better relations with the Vatican but would permit no interference in its internal affairs. <P> <B>Twenty-six American entertainers published a letter to German Chancellor</B> Helmut Kohl today accusing Germany of persecution of Scientologists.  The letter, printed as a full-page advertisement in the Paris-based <I>International Herald Tribune, </I>was signed by notables including Dustin Hoffman, Goldie Hawn, Oliver Stone, Mario Puzo, and Gore Vidal. <BR><B>...Signers of the letter said they were not members of the Church of Scientology</B> but were concerned that Germany had organized boycotts of entertainers such as Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and Chick Corea because of their religious beliefs.  &quot;In the 1930s it was the Jews.  Today it is the Scientologists,&quot; the letter said. <BR><B>...Kohl reacted by saying he had no intention of replying to the letter, </B>commenting that it was signed by people displaying their ignorance of Germany. <P> <B>Five men received between seven and 10 months in jail for burning a church</B> near the town of Situbondo, East Java, a court official said.  It was the first trial of rioters who burned 25 churches last October.  Five people were burned to death in a church during the riots, which began after a Muslim crowd became unhappy with the progress of a court case involving alleged blasphemy by a Muslim.  The crowd destroyed Situbondo's courthouse, then attacked 25 churches and a temple.  The man was later jailed as a heretic.  An additional 48 people are scheduled to stand trial in the incidents. <P> <B>Budget cuts have forced Presbyterians to withdraw their support for <I>The Protestant Hour</I></B> radio program.  The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) is one of four charter denominations that have sponsored the weekly broadcast for more than 50 years.  The PCUSA portion of the current support is $40,000 annually, <I>PCUSA News</I> reported.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 25, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Sun Myung Moon has started a new Spanish-language newspaper</B>, <I>Tiempos del Mundo</I>, for all of Latin America. The South Korean religious leader received the backing of George Bush, who praised Moon's respect for editorial independence. The former U.S. president, speaking at a banquet launching the publication in Buenos Aires Nov. 23, praised Moon's U.S. publication, <I>The Washington Times</I>, and referred to Moon as &quot;the man with the vision.&quot; <I>The Washington Post</I> reported Bush was paid $100,000 for his speech. Moon said his new paper would &quot;provide the most edifying reports in every aspect...promoting harmony and reverting the tendency towards disbelief.&quot; <BR><B>...Bush traveled to Uruguay Nov. 24 to help Moon inaugurate a Unification Church seminary</B> in Montevideo, news reports said. Moon owns a newspaper, bank, and hotel in Uruguay and is buying land in the Argentine province of Corrientes, where he plans to construct what his followers call &quot;ideal cities.&quot; <BR><B>...Moon portrays himself as an incarnation of God, fulfilling the mission of Christ.</B> Critics say he brainwashes the vulnerable. Some countries, such as Germany, consider Moon a threat and refuse him an entry visa. <P> <B>A reporting flaw inflated Episcopal Church membership figures for the last five years.</B> Denominational staff who took over from the office of former treasurer Ellen Cooke discovered the inaccuracy, news reports said. <BR><B>...Up to 37% of parishes did not accurately report increases and decreases, </B>starting with a count every year that was different from the one they ended with in the previous year, said Raymond Duncan of the General Convention office. The treasurer's office used the higher figure and adjusted it with the reported increases or decreases of the current year. The practice of  &quot;rolling over&quot; year-end numbers artificially inflated the statistics, Duncan told Ecumenical News International. <BR><B>...Baptized membership between 1991 and 1994 dropped 25,569</B> -- from 2,428,085 to 2,402,516 -- rather than increasing 90,267 over that time, the General Convention office said. <P> <B>The Christian Economic Coalition, a group of business and professional people,</B> helps start businesses in inner-city Boston. Located in impoverished Roxbury, Mass., the coalition has helped found 14 small businesses by offering training, advice, and start-up funding. The coalition has a partnership with one of the largest banks in Boston. It may buy a site to build a $3.5 million roller skating rink, <I>Reconcilers</I> magazine reported. <P> <B>Christian leaders are frequently subject to violent attacks in Colombia</B>, according to the Latin American and Caribbean Communication Agency. On Nov. 18, Presbyterian Church lay pastor and community-development leader Pedro Alzate Varela was murdered. <BR><B>...Alzate was riding a bus in Uraba Province when armed men boarded</B> and demanded that passengers present their identity documents. He was separated from the group and shot in front of other passengers, news reports said. <P> <B>Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, one of the world's most powerful Roman Catholics, condemned rock music</B> as an &quot;instrument of the devil&quot; and urged young people not to listen to it, <I>The London Times</I> reported. Ratzinger, who is Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, is considered the highest moral authority in the Vatican after the Pope. <BR><B>...There are &quot;diabolical and satanic messages&quot; in much of today's rock music</B>, the cardinal said. He warned against subliminal satanic influence in songs by the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd, Queen, Led Zeppelin and the Eagles. Ratzinger said there are many positive aspects of popular music but a great deal that &quot;endangers the human soul.&quot; <P> <B>Adam and Eve may have been &quot;some other form&quot; than human</B>, Cardinal John O'Connor told worshipers at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York Sunday. It is possible that the first living creature was a &quot;lower animal,&quot; the head of the New York archdiocese said. His comments came a month after Pope John Paul II said the theory of evolution was &quot;more than just a hypothesis.&quot; <P> <B>Cuba will allow 40 foreign Roman Catholic priests and nuns to work on the island</B>, church sources said. It is the largest number of foreign priests and nuns permitted to come to the island in thirty years. The authorizations follow a meeting between President Fidel Castro and Pope John Paul II in the Vatican last week. The action indicates a willingness by Cuba to make concessions in return for improved relations with local churches and the Vatican, observers said. <P> <B>The fire and brimstone was realistic at a South African church service Sunday</B>. Theologian Dominee Ferdi Gouws accidentally set off a canister of tear gas while preaching about the seriousness of sin, Reuter news service reported. Gouws, speaking during the children's service at Nederduitse Gereformeerde Kerk near Port Elizabeth, was using aerosol sprays as props when he released the tear gas. It spread quickly as the congregation rushed out of the pews coughing and sneezing. The minister apologized, and congregants coughed through the rest of the service. <P> <B>Mother Teresa suffered heart failure for the second time</B> in three days Sunday in Calcutta, India. News reports said she would not be released from the hospital soon.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 14, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Hundreds of Indians from Hindu, Muslim, and Christian backgrounds</B> responded to preaching by American evangelist Sammy Tippit during evangelistic meetings in Hyderabad, India, Dec. 11-15.  The local newspaper <I>Wartha</I> carried the text of Tippit's message on the second coming of Christ.  Tippit also addressed 400 pastors at a conference. <BR><B>...Tippit also held evangelistic meetings at Makerere University in Kampala, Uganda, Dec. 1-8</B>.  Numerous students committed their lives to Christ during the meetings, which Christian Union leaders described as the &quot;greatest evangelistic harvest in many years.&quot; Seventy-five students made professions of faith in Christ when Christian students went to each dorm prior to the meetings, sharing the gospel and performing an evangelistic drama. <BR><B>...Makerere University is known as the Harvard of East Africa.  </B>Peter Kasirivu, president of African Renewal Ministries, said, &quot;We have impacted the future leaders of Uganda for Christ.  Almost all of Uganda's leaders go through Makerere University.&quot; <P> <B>Christians in Detroit are helping Russian immigrants learn English</B>.  Members of the evangelistic group Friends of Israel give informal English lessons, often sharing the gospel during the course of conversations, Mission Network News reported.  Christian literature given to the immigrants is often read avidly and passed along to others, organizers say. <P> <B>A dying AIDS patient missed closing arguments in his assisted suicide lawsuit</B> in Florida on Monday, Reuter news service reported.  Charles Hall, 35, was in too much pain to remain in court, said the physician who would help Hall kill himself if the court approves his request.  Hall testified on the opening day of the trial, then returned to his home to await a decision, which is expected in two weeks. <P> <B>Jersey City, N.J., violated the Constitution </B>by sponsoring a display featuring a Christian creche and Jewish menorah, according to the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, meeting in Philadelphia.  The court said the display gave the impression of state sponsorship of religion and the addition of Santa Claus did little to secularize it. <P> <B>Algerian rebels fighting to establish a fundamentalist Islamic state </B>kidnapped and cut the throats of five girls and killed 14 other people in recent attacks on two villages near the capital.  Algerian newspapers reported that the killings followed the fifth anniversary of the incident that began Algeria's  war: cancellation of a general election in which radical Islamists had taken a large lead.  About 60,000 people, many of them civilians, have died since then.  Reuter news service reported that the rebels appear to be carrying out gruesome killings to try to prevent the authorities from suppressing news of the conflict. <P> <B>China warned the Vatican not to meddle in its religious affairs</B>, news reports said.  Beijing said missionary work and appointments of bishops were its prerogative.  The Communist Party is nervous that unauthorized religious gatherings could lead to local instability and threaten its rule, Reuter news service reported.  China also appeared annoyed by Pope John Paul's statement Monday that the Vatican would closely watch how Catholics in Hong Kong were treated after the British colony is handed over to Beijing in July. <P> <B>A former manager in the Catholic diocese of Brooklyn, N.Y., who admitted she stole $1.2 million</B> from a pension fund was given five years of probation Monday.  Vincenza Bologna, 53, agreed in a plea bargain to work 1,000 hours of community service and repay $239,724; the balance of the stolen funds was covered by insurance.  Prosecutors said Bologna used the money to buy boats, pay for vacations in Las Vegas, and finance college for her sons.  Her boss, Bishop Thomas Daily, asked authorities to go easy on her.  She had worked for the diocese for 32 years. <P> <B>Billy Graham will offer the invocation at President Clinton's inauguration</B> Jan. 20.  Graham has participated in seven inaugurations in the past four decades, including those of Presidents Eisenhower, Johnson, Nixon, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 14, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, one of the most influential Roman Catholic figures in modern history</B>, died early today at 68. Bernardin, leader of the Chicago archdiocese, died 11 weeks after announcing that the pancreatic cancer he had been diagnosed with a year earlier had returned. On Wednesday, he had spoken on the phone to the pope and the president while family and friends sat at his bedside. <BR><B>...Bernardin led the nation's second-largest Catholic diocese during difficult changes</B> after the Second Vatican Council. Taking over the diocese from authoritarian Cardinal John Cody, Bernardin earned a reputation as a strong voice for social justice and a conciliator, <I>The Chicago Tribune</I> said. <BR><B>...He was involved in controversy, forcing the closure of some Catholic schools</B> and disagreeing with conservative priests over women's rights within the church. In 1993, Bernardin was accused of sexually abusing a pre-seminary student 16 years earlier. His accuser later recanted, and Bernardin publicly reconciled with him. <BR><B>...When it became clear that surgery could not stop Bernardin's cancer,</B> he followed Pope John Paul's advice to &quot;offer your suffering for the world.&quot; Bernardin described his impending death as a friend that should be greeted, not an enemy. This week Bernardin sent a letter to the U.S. Supreme Court asking the justices not to find that terminally ill people have a constitutional right to doctor-assisted suicide. <P> <B>Christian marriage-and-family seminars are becoming popular in Cuba</B>. Churches have received good responses when inviting people, who are eager for solutions to the communist nation's domestic problems, World Team's Paul Shattock told Mission Network News. Things people have trusted in such as education, the Communist Party, and the economy &quot;have fallen flat on their face,&quot; he said. &quot;You only have two options now in Cuba, despair or Christ.&quot; <BR><B>...The evangelical church is getting encouragement </B>from the government, which wants pastors to deal with increasingly prevalent family problems, MNN said.  <P> <B>England lifted some restrictions on gambling</B>, allowing casinos to open in 20 new cities and resort towns. Casinos can operate slot machines with unlimited stakes and payouts, <I>The London Times</I> said. Up to 100 machines would be allowed in the largest casino in London. Casino operators also will be allowed for the first time to advertise in non-national publications. <P> <B>Some supporters of same-sex marriage in the state of Hawaii were voted out of office</B> in last week's election, Intercessors For America said.  This improves the possibility of the Hawaii House and Senate passing an amendment protecting traditional marriage. The new legislative session begins in January. <P> <B>The Episcopal Diocese of Long Island began an independent investigation</B> into allegations of sexual misconduct, Episcopal News Service said. Two Brazilian men have alleged that William Lloyd Andries, rector of St. Gabriel's Church in Brooklyn, brought them to the United States to be sexual partners for a group of  homosexual and bisexual clergy. According to <I>Penthouse</I> magazine, the Brazilian men say the priests used drugs and held orgies in St. Gabriel's. Andries, who has denied many of the allegations, has resigned from St. Gabriel's and is under discipline, ENS said. <BR><B>...Thirty-five bishops signed a statement blaming the events in Long Island on lax standards</B> in the Episcopal Church.  <P> <B>Kathy and Tom Lindquist, an American couple with the Berean Mission, were unable to leave Bukavu</B>, Zaire, when the fighting began, according to Marge Crumbley, Kathy's mother. The couple has been in Bukavu while soldiers were taking the city, she told Mission Network News. Three of the Lindquist children are safe in the bush area, said Crumley, who has been receiving email from people in Kigali. <P> <B>Christians in the United States, Australia, Canada, England and Holland</B> are participating in the fourth annual Operation Christmas Child sponsored by Samaritan's Purse. The volunteers hope to assemble half a million shoe boxes filled with school supplies for distribution to children in 28 countries. A copy of the Christmas story from Luke 2 is included in each shoebox. <P> <B>The newly formed National Institute on Media and the Family</B> is developing an evaluation system for television shows, movies, video games, and computer games. The institute, located in Minneapolis, is independent of major broadcasters. It evaluates products for appropriateness for age groups by observing violent and sexual content, whether vulgar or sexually explicit language is used, and whether characters are respectful, responsible, and caring. Find it on the Internet at: <A HREF=http://www.mediaandthefamily.org>www.mediaandthefamily.org</A>. <P> <B>Broadcaster Bill Moyers, a Baptist minister, criticized the conservative faction of the Southern Baptist Convention</B> for clinging to a literal interpretation of the Bible. Speaking in Fort Worth to 1,700 people at the Baptist General Convention of  Texas, Moyers described their belief system as &quot;less a set of ideas than it is a pathological distemper, a militant anger over the fact that the universe is not closed and life is not static.&quot;    </font></p>

Most of those arrested were youths, unemployed persons, and repeat offenders, police said. Indonesian Moslem leaders accused unnamed groups with possible communist links of causing the riots. The riots started Thursday after reports that several policemen beat three Muslims; four policemen reportedly may be court martialed for conduct that triggered the violence. <P> <B>Jewish graves were vandalized in a Rome cemetery Saturday</B>. Vandals broke tombstones and ripped off names and Stars of David, and surrounded one tomb with barbed wire and swastikas, news reports said. After the desecration was discovered, 300 Jews attended a ceremony to resanctify the site. <P> <B>Larry Flynt is not a hero, his daughter says</B>. Flynt's oldest daughter Tonya Flynt-Vegta, now a Christian, said the recent release of the film<I> The People vs. Larry Flynt</I> is a nightmare for her, <I>Charisma Magazine</I> reported. The film depicts Flynt as a heroic defender of the First Amendment because of his legal battles to publish <I>Hustler</I>, a pornographic magazine. Flynt-Vega, 31, said she endured sexual abuse from her father and was forced to pose for the magazine at age 19. &quot;I've been sexually abused, beat up, and tortured all my life. I am still suffering from it,&quot; she said. <P> <B>An evangelist in the Chinese house church movement</B> has been arrested in a central province of China, according to Voice of the Martyrs. The U.S.-based group described the missionary as a 35-year-old man. The evangelist was carrying a sizable amount of money that was passed on to him through VOM to help his ministry. The money was confiscated. <BR><B>...This has been the most repressive year for Christians in China</B> since the Cultural Revolution, another VOM missionary in China said. Many Christians fear greater difficulties to come after Beijing takes control of Hong Kong in six months, he said. <P> <B>China launched a manhunt across Tibet</B> <B>and offered a reward of $120,000</B> for the arrest of those responsible for planting a bomb outside government offices in Lhasa last week. Officials blamed the explosion on followers of the region's exiled god-king, the Dalai Lama, who has waged a non-violent campaign to win autonomy for the deeply religious Buddhist region. Officials have vowed to retaliate for the bombing. <P> <B>Acrobat Philippe Petit will walk across a wire 90 feet high without a net</B> in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York City on New Year's Eve. The performance is part of an evening of tribute to James Parks Morton, who is retiring after 25 years as dean of St. John's. The tribute also will include dance, mime, music, and special lighting. <BR><B>...Morton welcomed worshipers of any faith</B> and those with different social and artistic messages to the cathedral, the world's largest. There is a poet's corner above one altar, a fish tank in another, menorahs, Japanese vases, a sports tapestry, and an AIDs memorial, the Associated Press said. Concerts and Halloween parties are a regular part of the cathedral's schedule.    </font></p>

Vijay Chander, who plays the title role. Chander said the series offers a wholesome alternative to sex-filled shows such as <I>The Bold and The Beautiful.</I> Indian television has shown classic Hindu epics, with actors reliving the tumultuous adventures of deities, United Press International reported. <P> <B>The Christian church is &quot;growing enormously&quot; amid political instability, violence, and persecution in Sudan</B>, according to the Sudan Interior Mission. Christians pay higher rent than Muslims, are in danger of being imprisoned for their faith, and are often refused permission to travel, said Benjamin, a pastor in a Khartoum &quot;displacement camp&quot; for refugees. Benjamin's church, where services were held for 800 people, was recently destroyed by fundamentalist Moslems. &quot;But the Christians have great passion, especially for those who repress them,&quot; the SIM report said. <P> <B>Militant Islamics are reshaping their image with acts of charity among the poor</B> in Lebanon, Turkey, Egypt, and Algeria<I>, The Christian Science Monitor</I> reported. Hizbullah, the anti-Western, anti-Israel group in southern Lebanon, still promotes violence. But among Lebanon's poor, Hizbullah's image is evolving from resistance fighters to charity campaigners as the militia's leaders use humanitarian and welfare projects to win support. <BR><B>...Hizbullah operates 45 medical dispensaries and a network of clinics</B> and hospitals in southern Lebanon. Financing comes from Iran, other Arab states, and individual contributors. Hizbullah work crews have helped rebuild houses destroyed by Israeli bombs in 1993. <BR><B>...In Turkey, the Islamic party gained power this year with popular support</B> earned by aiding residents during door-to-door campaigns. Moderate Egyptian Muslims have followed the same strategy, and in Algeria appealing to the poor won victory for an Islamic party in 1992 elections, until the army intervened. <P> <B>James Skillington, a Methodist minister and former newspaper writer</B>, edits a weekly Web-based magazine called <A HREF= http://www.villagelife.org ><I>Village Life</I></A>. It offers information on issues such as teen pregnancy and homelessness, and puts readers in contact with groups that address these problems. The ecumenical nonprofit group Kaleidoscope Ministries publishes<I> Village Life, </I>which has one full-time writer, three other staff members, and 33 freelance writers across the country. <P> <B>Christians are praying that a Lincoln, R.I., man suffering from incurable Lou Gehrig's disease</B> will cancel his planned suicide. Noel Earley, 47, who announced his intentions in September, receives about 35 telephone calls a day from people offering to send him Christian books and take him to revival meetings. A Georgia congregation taped Earley's photograph to the pulpit and spent Sunday praying for him. Early, who practices no particular religion and believes he will simply go to sleep when he dies, listens politely but often jokes about religion. His death, which he plans to bring about by injecting himself with a deadly combination of drugs, would be a protest against a state law banning assisted suicide, he has said. <P> <B>The Mormon Church plans to build a 94,000-square-foot, $30-million temple</B> in a residential area in Belmont, Mass., a Boston suburb. The church would have six spires and stand on a rock ledge 40 feet above a highway on one of the highest points in the area. Residents who are opposed to the plan have argued with church officials for a year at zoning board meetings and 50 informal gatherings. Town resident Julie Altshuler told the Associated Press that she feels the church has a right to build, but &quot;they can build an adequate temple that will not tower above my house, the equivalent of a 25-story building.&quot; <P> <B>Researchers in Finland found that women who have had abortions are more likely to commit suicide</B>. The National Research and Development Centre for Welfare and Health said its findings, published in the <I>British Medical Journal</I>, were important to those who want to prevent suicides. The suicide rate after an abortion was three times the general suicide rate, the researchers wrote. <P> <B>A Pennsylvania woman who drove a 13-year-old girl to New York for an abortion without telling the girl's mother</B> was sentenced Dec. 5 to a year of probation for interfering with the custody of a child. Rose Hartford, who lives in LaPorte, also must pay a $500 fine and perform 150 hours of community service.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 16, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Two powerful explosions occurred outside an Atlanta building containing an abortion clinic Thursday</B>.  The second explosion injured several people, including police and fire officials who had answered the first emergency call.  Police said it appeared the clinic was the target.  Pro-choice and anti-abortion groups immediately condemned the explosions. <BR><B>...The first blast shattered one side of the building</B> housing the Atlanta Northside Family Planning Services center in suburban Sandy Springs.  At least four people were inside the clinic at the time, but were not injured, news reports said.  The blast reportedly shattered plate-glass windows in a nearby office building. <BR><B>...About an hour later, a garbage container in the corner of an adjacent parking lot</B> exploded, knocking people to the ground.     <BR><B>...The explosions came as abortion-rights advocates were announcing</B> in Washington that anti-abortion violence had declined slightly last year.  The Feminist Majority said that a survey of 312 clinics showed that about 30% of clinics reported acts or threats of violence last year, down from 39% in 1995. <P> <B>Wisconsin's plan to use taxpayer money to send poor Milwaukee children to religious schools</B> has been ruled unconstitutional.  The ruling in the school choice program is expected to reach the U.S. Supreme Court. <BR><B>...Circuit Judge Paul Higginbotham struck down Gov. Tommy Thompson's plan</B> to expand a tuition voucher program involving private, nonreligious schools to religious schools.  The judge said that even though Milwaukee public schools have &quot;performed dismally,&quot; sending children to religious schools at taxpayers' expense would violate the constitutional separation of church and state. <P> <B>President Clinton is expected to ask Congress for more family-planning funds</B> for developing countries, and argue against restrictions on how the money is used, news reports say.  The U.S. Senate and House will debate the measure early next month and vote whether to add some $123 million to current fiscal-year population-control funding. <P> <B>A New York law prohibiting dissemination of indecent materials over the Internet</B> is being challenged.  The American Civil Liberties Union said in a lawsuit Tuesday that the law would reduce adult communications to levels acceptable for a 6-year-old.  The law could send a person to prison for four years &quot;for talking about safer sex or displaying online classic nudes or other artistic images,&quot; Norman Siegel of the New York Civil Liberties Union told Reuter news service. <BR><B>...The ACLU said the New York law is similar to the U.S. Communications Decency Act</B>, which has been ruled unconstitutional by federal judicial panels in Philadelphia and New York.  The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to review findings by the Philadelphia panel. <P> <B>Leaders of 10 Christian denominations in Kansas issued a Call for the Renewal of Civil Community</B>, encouraging people to respect each others' differences and find common ground.  The document asks Christians to &quot;lower the inflammatory rhetoric&quot; and &quot;raise the level of civil discourse about community issues.&quot;  Signers included representatives of the United Methodist, American Baptist, Episcopal, Presbyterian Church (USA), Christian Church (Disciples of Christ), Mennonite, United Church of Christ, and Evangelical Lutheran denominations. <P> <B>Islamic men beat a woman with a belt in a shopping area</B> <B>in Kabul, Afghanistan, </B>today for failing to cover her ankles, witnesses said.  The men who beat her are members of the purist Taleban militia, which issued guidelines last week on how people should behave during the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, Reuter news service reported.  The guidelines warned women not to leave their homes during Ramadan except to buy food, visit patients in hospitals, or attend a funeral. <BR><B>...Since capturing Kabul Sept. 27, the Taleban have enforced their version of Sharia law,</B> banning women from working in government offices and closing schools for girls.  Witnesses say several women have been lashed, hit, or intimidated for what the Taleban consider moral crimes. <P> <B>Religious organizations in Hong Kong and on the mainland </B>should not be &quot;subordinate to each other&quot; or &quot;interfere with each other&quot; after Hong Kong becomes part of China, the Chinese government said today.  Foreign Ministry spokesman Shen Guofang denied media reports that Beijing had said it would reserve the right to appoint bishops in the territory, Reuter news service reported. <P> <B>A right-to-die activist in Rhode Island died Wednesday.  </B>Noel David Earley, 48, had planned to commit suicide to avoid the final stages of Lou Gehrig's Disease, a neuromuscular malady.  Earley wanted to test a state law banning assisted suicide, but his condition worsened before he could, a spokeswoman said. <BR><B>...Sens. John Ashcroft (R-Mo.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.) will introduce legislation</B> to prevent federal funding of assisted suicides, news reports said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 23, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Hundreds of thousands of Hindus joined an annual procession</B> to a holy cave near Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, Reuter news service reported.  Many of the pilgrims pierced their bodies with hooks and skewers.  For a month before the festival, known as Thaipusam, participants observe a dawn-to-dusk fast and a vegetarian diet, and abstain from alcohol, smoking, and sex. <BR><B>...Many devotees went into a trance.  </B>Some have glazed eyes and screech, a manifestation that Hindu spirits have taken over their bodies.  They then carry idols mounted in boxes on their heads and shoulders up the 272 steps to a temple inside a cave, tossing their burden on to a heap before the god Lord Murugan. <P> <B>Thousands of pilgrims gathered in southern India Wednesday to celebrate the Hindu goddess</B> Yelamma, whose followers include an ancient cult that dedicates children to prostitution.  According to <I>The London Times</I>, girls become the sexual property of priests, and many end up in brothels once the priests are bored with them.  The Indian Health Organization estimates that 1,000 girls are dedicated to the goddess each year, but other groups put the figure much higher.  Most pilgrims have nothing to do with the cult, which is illegal.  Efforts to stamp it out have resulted in fewer girls being trapped into prostitution, police and social workers told Reuter news service. <P> <B>A skateboard manufacturer is offering children a &quot;deal with the Devil</B>.&quot; El Segundo, Calif., skateboard manufacturer World Industries encloses a brochure that looks like a gospel tract in its packages to encourage purchasers to sell their souls to the devil, according to the Christian Coalition. <BR><B>...The coalition said that when a Florida man bought a skateboard</B> for his grandson at a local shop, a brochure titled <I>Lets Make a Deal</I> was concealed inside the packaging.  In the brochure, a smiling devil explains that hell is a lot more fun than heaven.  Children are asked to sign and return a contract giving possession of their souls to the devil.  During calls placed to World Industries and its distributor, U.S. Eastern Skateboard Supply, &quot;neither company expressed any moral objection to the literature,&quot; the coalition said.  Shop owners said they were unaware that the brochure was included in the packaging, and refunded the purchase price. <P> <B>An American Express charge account and a Lord &amp; Taylor credit card associated with missing atheist</B> Madalyn Murray O'Hair have been used as recently as December, the <I>Houston Chronicle</I> reported.  O'Hair and her children, Jon and Robin Murray, have been missing since September 1995.  At the time of their disappearance, the IRS was seeking $750,000 from Jon and Robin, alleging they took money raised for an atheist group and bought a Mercedes-Benz, a Porsche, maid services and a home, news reports said.  The cards, issued to Robin Murray, have been used regularly for the past six months, the <I>Chronicle</I> reported.   <BR><B>...Police say they know little about the missing trio</B> and that officials of American Atheists Inc., O'Hair's Austin, Texas-based corporation, have been uncooperative with investigators.  Bill Murray, who is seeking to become guardian of his relatives' estates, has said he believes the trio is dead and that foul play was involved.   <P> <B>Five Christians whose names were signed to a letter threatening to bomb a mosque</B> in Pakistan are under arrest despite agreement by city authorities that they are innocent.  According to <I>Compass Direct</I> news, police in Chichawatni arrested the men Jan. 10 because their names were signed to a bomb threat letter that included derogatory statements against the prophet Mohammed.  Authorities say no Pakistani would sign his name to a direct bomb threat or religious blasphemy, since both crimes carry the death penalty.  But they detained the suspects, demanding that they confess who their enemies were who might have written the letter. <P> <B>Sexually explicit magazines cannot be banned from sale at U.S. military bases,</B> a federal judge in New York ruled Wednesday.  The parent company of sexually explicit <I>Penthouse </I>magazine and other publishers had challenged the Military Honor and Decency Act of 1996, which forbids the sale or rental of sexual material at military bases. <BR><B>...&quot;The fact that others might find the magazines offensive</B> is not a rationale for barring them,&quot;<I> Penthouse</I> publisher Bob Guccione said.  The ruling is &quot;another indicator of an out-of-control judiciary,&quot; said Lt. Col. Robert Maginnis of the Family Research Council.  Congress oversees the military, and it passed the ban, declaring that pornography is bad for military readiness, he said.  The Pentagon has said it does not intend to appeal the decision. <BR><B>...&quot;A military that says it wants more servicewomen</B> is at the same time forced to remain one of the nation's largest purveyors of pornography,&quot; Maginnis said.  That &quot;sends the wrong message to traumatized women who understand the direct association between exposure to pornography and sexual misconduct.&quot; <P> <B>First lady Hillary Clinton, Vice President Al Gore</B> and his wife, Tipper, each affirmed support for abortion rights at a luncheon in Washington, D.C., Wednesday.  The event marked the 24th anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion.     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 16, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...Women have a right to be left alone at abortion clinics,</B> defenders of  the injunction say. They argue that the injunction prevents interference with access to health care and disruptions to public safety. The injunction stops a campaign of  &quot;illegal harassment, intimidation, obstruction and trespass&quot; at abortion clinics, Lucinda Finley, representing the Pro-Choice Network of Western New York, told the court. <BR><B>...In practical terms, the injunction amounts to a ban on free speech anywhere near the clinics</B>, said Jay Sekulow of the American Center for Law and Justice, who is representing abortion protesters Paul Schenck and Dwight Saunders. If someone orders a protester to back away, free speech stops -- even before a word is said, Sekulow told the court. A ruling in the case is expected next year. <P> <B>An ad campaign airing on some Christian radio stations claims President Clinton </B>opposes some late-term abortions. The ad, sponsored by Clinton's campaign, also notes that the President signed legislation to prevent homosexual marriages, <I>The Washington Post</I> said. <P> <B>Hundreds of people stood and prayed to become a Christian in south central Siberia</B> when the drama Heaven's Gates and Hell's Flames was performed, missionary Scott Holmes told Mission Network News. Churches in the area now are seeking to follow up on the new believers and incorporate them into congregations, he said. <P> <B>An increasing number of Muslim families in the United States are educating their children in private Islamic schools</B>. In the Washington, D.C., area, the demand for Islamic schooling far outstrips the supply, and consequently some Muslim families are educating their children at home,<I> The Washington Post</I> said. Many Muslim parents say values their children are exposed to in public schools conflict with the strict morality of Islam. The parents say their children have encountered prejudice and anti-Muslim stereotypes. <P> <B>A Scottish man who killed his suffering brother won't be sent to prison</B>. Paul Brady, 37, killed his brother James, 40, at his request last year. Brady gave his brother -- who suffered from Huntington's chorea, a debilitating, degenerative disease -- an overdose of medicine and put a pillow over his head, news reports said. The judge at Brady's trial, Lord Macfadyen, said he feared that the lenient sentence would send an unintended message, but was sure Brady's action, though unlawful, was done in compassion. <P> <B>A fight between two children in Egypt led to an all-out machine-gun battle</B> between their Coptic Christian and Muslim families, according to <I>The Strait Times</I> of Singapore. Twenty people were wounded in the incident, which took place in a village south of Cario, police said. <P> <B>The interests of children should come first when considering reproductive and genetic technologies</B>, evangelicals in Canada say. &quot;Children are not commodities,&quot; said Janet Epp Buckingham, spokesman for the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada, commenting on proposed legislation. She applauded the legislation's ban on several controversial practices, including retrieval of sperm or eggs from cadavers or fetuses, and commercial surrogate arrangements. Buckingham also said research should be prohibited on embryos. <P> <B>A former headhunter who was the chief of a group of vicious warriors has become a Christian</B>. According to the DAWN FridayFax newsletter, the chief is a member of the Was tribe of the southeast Asian nation of Myanmar, formerly known as Burma. The tribe asked for 100 Bibles and wanted to meet Christian missionaries. The missionaries reported that when the chief became a Christian, he was baptized by immersion, then ducked under the water one hundred times -- once for every head he had hunted. Afterward, he began promoting the <I>Jesus</I> film. <BR><B>...The<I> Jesus</I> film also has had an impact on Romania</B>. Campus Crusade for Christ, which produces and distributes the film about the life of Christ, said 185 new churches have been planted in Romania since 1991 as a result of showings of the film. More than a million people have seen the film in 16,076 showings, Campus Crusade said. <P> <B>Violence on network television declined somewhat last year from the previous TV season</B>, the UCLA Television Violence Report found. The study said a few series, some made-for-TV movies, and some of the theatrical features on television were more violent than was appropriate. Several popular children's shows feature &quot;sinister combat violence,&quot; the group said. The study analyzes whether the violence is appropriate and whether consequences are addressed, UPI reported. <P> <B>Carl Hunziker, an American citizen being held in North Korea on espionage charges</B>, met with a Swedish diplomat and denied having confessed to spying, the U.S. State Department said. Hunziker is reported to be in good health and has not been mistreated, Reuters news service said. North Korea's news agency, however, said Hunziker has been proven to be a spy and will have to pay the consequences. Hunziker was in the Far East to act as a Christian missionary, reports said.     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 21, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Nearly ten thousand recent immigrants from the former Soviet Union came to an evangelistic crusade</B> in Sacramento, Calif., last weekend, Mission Network News said. An evangelist and musician from the former Soviet Union were featured at the nondenominational event. The crusade was held in a sports arena and conducted in the Russian language. Sacramento has a large population of evangelical Christians from the former Soviet Union. <P> <B>A new Christian is leading a peace campaign among gangs in Cape Town, South Africa. </B>Rashied Staggie -- who once led a 3,000-member gang that included murderers, thieves, and drug dealers -- is promoting peace and seeking government protection from anti-gang vigilante violence. <BR><B>...Vigilantes killed Staggie's twin brother, Rashaad</B>, on Aug. 4, news reports said. But after his brother's death,<B> </B>Rashied became a Christian and vowed not to take revenge. Staggie, who has been shot nine times and carries a concealed revolver, says God has called him to end gang violence. The newest tattoo on his back reads &quot;The Chosen.&quot; <P> <B>Some 30,000 people attended Franklin Graham's crusade in Farmington, N.M., Nov. 10-13</B>. Thousands of Native Americans came to the event, which was held on the border of the Navajo nation. Programs were translated into Navajo and Spanish. The crusade also featured performances by contemporary and country Christian bands. <P> <B>Poland's president signed an abortion law</B> giving women who are financially or emotionally unable to give birth the right to end their pregnancies until the 12th week. The law replaces Poland's strict anti-abortion statute. &quot;Conscience and not the fear of punishment meted out by the state should influence the people's decisions in the matter,&quot; said President Aleksander Kwasniewski. <P> <B>The British are accepting more sex in the media,</B> a poll showed. A majority of people said they would not object to sex scenes between a man and a woman in a movie if children are prevented from watching, Reuter news service said.  <BR><B>...Marijuana also is being viewed with greater approval</B>. In 14 years, public disapproval of smoking the drug has dropped to 58% from 82%, while those under 25 voted two-to-one in favor. Attitudes toward heroin remain hostile, with 86% saying it should remain illegal. <P> <B>Spain is the &quot;most sinful&quot; among 19 industrialized countries</B>, according to <I>Svensk Export Strategi</I>, a Swedish business journal. Prevalence of the seven &quot;modern deadly sins&quot; of smoking, drinking, drugs, gambling, over-eating, night life, and prostitution were considered in the rankings. <BR><B>...Spain is active in night life and gambling</B>, Reuter news service said. France ranked the second most sinful nation because of alcohol consumption, and the United States third because of drugs. Next were Great Britain and the Netherlands. The Nordic countries, Portugal, and Japan were judged least sinful. <P> <B>The World Council of Churches is considering major structural changes.</B> Among changes included in a WCC proposal is discontinuation of the WCC's assembly, which takes place every seven years and is the group's highest policy-making body. The assembly could be replaced by more frequent meetings of churches and ecumenical organizations, the group said. <BR><B>...The WCC said it wants the Roman Catholic Church and evangelical and Pentecostal bodies</B> to be more involved in the ecumenical movement. The WCC should &quot;repent of the ways we have sinned&quot; against evangelicals and Pentecostals &quot;through caricature or indifference,&quot; the WCC document said. <BR><B>...Earlier this year, the WCC suggested a gathering in Germany</B> among the main Christian traditions to start resolving issues -- including the primacy of the Pope -- dividing Christians. The WCC, which includes 330 member denominations such as the Anglican, Lutheran, Orthodox and other non-Roman Catholic churches, wants to eventually convene a universal Christian council. <BR><B>...To meet its financial crisis, the WCC is expected to discontinue some of its current programs</B> in favor of a smaller and more flexible central staff at its headquarters in Geneva. The group has more than 200 staff. <P> <B>The World Council of Churches is holding a conference with Moslem scholars in Tehran Friday</B>. The WCC said it hopes dialogue can create tolerance, understanding, and cooperation among people of different faiths &quot;in Iran and beyond.&quot; <P> <B>A conservative group is thinking about suspending or expelling the Christian Reformed denomination</B> because of its decision to ordain women. Meeting Nov. 19 and 20, the North American Presbyterian and Reformed Council voted to consider action against the Christian Reformed Church, which helped start NAPRC 21 years ago and is the organization's largest member. Any such action would require a two-thirds vote and approval within three years by two-thirds of the national synods or general assemblies of the seven member denominations, Christian Reformed News Service said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 2, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Evangelical mission organizations in Rwanda are reuniting refugee children with their parents,</B> Mission Network News reported. The exodus of refugees from Zaire left many children lost. Workers are taking unidentified street children in Kigali and Butati to orphanages, where tracing work is done, Phyllis Sorter of the Free Methodist Church said. Some 130 of the children, highly traumatized and despairing, have been returned to their parents.  <P> <B>The Salvation Army in Akron, Ohio, is accepting credit-card donations</B>. The $3,000 computer credit-card ready kettle was put into action last week at Chapel Hill Mall, the <I>Akron Beacon Journal</I> reported. The kettle prints out a receipt that can be saved for the IRS. The national Salvation Army said it may use the collection method in other parts of the nation. <P> <B>The Church of England may abolish the 800-year-old tradition of reading Banns.</B> The Banns -- an announcement of intent to marry -- is read in church on three consecutive Sundays before a wedding. The practice was introduced in the 12th century to prevent clandestine or improper marriages. Critics describe it as &quot;a medieval anachronism&quot; that has outlived its usefulness, especially since very few couples married in churches are known to the congregation. Marriage services will retain the question of  whether anyone knows an impediment to the marriage. About 200,000 couples are married by the Church of England each year. <P> <B>Evangelical Christians make up about 35% of the population of Kenya</B>, according to Operation Mobilization missionary Katherine Parker. According to DAWN, Kenya has the third-highest proportion of evangelical Christians in the world, following El Salvador (54%) and Guatemala (43%). <P> <B>Romania has begun a new era that is neither communist nor godless</B>. Newly elected President Emil Constantinescu marked a milestone for post-Communist Eastern Europe last Friday by supplementing his civil inauguration with a religious ritual held in an Orthodox cathedral. Constantinescu, 57, indicated that the decades of official atheism under Communism were also being set aside. He listened as the head of the Romanian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Teoctist called on him to preserve the country's spiritual and national dignity. <P> <B>Involvement of churches in New Age spirituality is a blind alley rather than a path to God</B>. That's the conclusion of Mission Theological Advisory Group, which reported its findings to the Council of Churches for Britain and Ireland and to the Church of England's general synod. The report, <I>The Search for Faith and the Witness of the Church,</I> said New Age practices such as aromatherapy, divination though stars, crystals, or the Tarot, and meditating on pyramids are not true paths to God, but are directed only at making the individual feel good. Involvement in the New Age produces a &quot;Religion of Me&quot; in which where the self becomes an idol, the report said. <P> <B>Roman Catholics who want more democracy in the Church</B> have grown into an international movement. Reform-minded Catholics from Europe and North America who make up the We Are the Church movement met in Rome. They called for a meeting to take place in Rome on Oct. 11., 1997, coinciding with the 35th anniversary of the Second Vatican Council. At that time, petitions signed by Catholics in Europe and North and South America will be presented to the Vatican, addressed to Pope John Paul II, the group said. <BR><B>...The movement began in Austria, where a half million signatures</B> have been gathered supporting the petition. We are the Church also has spread to Germany, where 1.8 million people signed a similar appeal, and to other European countries, the United States, and Canada, where petitions are still being collected, Ecumenical News International said. The petitions call for regular dialogue at all levels of the Roman Catholic Church, equality between men and women in all ministries, optional celibacy for clergy, freedom of conscience for married couples in matters of birth control, respect for homosexuals and divorcees who have remarried, and a greater commitment to justice and peace. <BR><B>...Most bishops have ignored the initiative or opposed it, but a few have shown cautious openness. </B>During a visit to Germany this summer, Pope John Paul said Catholic beliefs and the authority of the bishops &quot;cannot be suspended, either in public debate or in pastoral discussions.&quot; <P> <B>In France, 450 new evangelical churches have been planted in five years</B>, according to AUBE 2000, a national evangelistic strategy group. David Stephens of the research organization Action Recherche Croissance, which prepared a report on the French church, said the new congregations are &quot;a clear sign that God is at work in this evangelistically neglected country,&quot; DAWN FridayFax reported. There are 2,465 Protestant congregations in France, about one per 23,000 people. <P> <B>Roman Catholic feminists were victims of a hoax</B>. The Catholic Women's Network published an article in its journal <I>Network</I> that purports to have been written by &quot;Carmel Lenehan&quot; from Western Australia. <I>The Daily Telegraph</I> described the article as a parody that is full of heresy and feminist rhetoric. It was written by traditionalist Catholic author Joanna Bogle, a <I>Catholic Times </I>columnist. Bogle, 44, wrote the article as a parody of the summer issue of the <I>Network</I>.  <BR><B>...Bogle's parody described a fictitious &quot;Circle Weekend&quot; of CWN women</B> in Western Australia and included passages such as: &quot;We began with a foot massage and then, in a circle, we each in turn spoke, saying I matter. I affirm self. What I am, I have a right to be, and then some affirming/growth statement, such as the loving and caring in me reaches out to you, and you, and you. It was really moving. Over avocado and salads, we shared music. And there was talk about the Church and the way it/he oppresses us and how we can change it.&quot;  <BR><B>...&quot;I put in everything - even a woman living in sin with a priest.</B> I thought they would never fall for this. But they did -- hook, line, and sinker,&quot; Bogle said. &quot;I don't know why they call themselves Catholics. They are not Catholics at all.&quot;    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 19, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Kentucky school bus drivers can say &quot;Merry Christmas&quot; again</B>. The Dec. 5 issue of Fayette County's newsletter for the drivers advised them that the school board's attorney said &quot;any greeting directed toward students which includes a particular religious significance should be avoided.&quot; That includes the word Christmas, since it is associated with the Christian religion, the newsletter said. <BR><B>...School officials backed down after a public outcry</B> and a telephone call from an attorney from the Rutherford Institute, a religious liberty group. A subsequent memo to Fayette County school district employees said no bus driver would be punished for wishing a passenger a Merry Christmas. <P> <B>A school concert in Birmingham, England, broke up in chaos </B>when a Muslim teacher started berating Muslim pupils for taking part. The choir was singing <I>Have Yourself A Merry Little Christmas</I> when Israr Khan, a mathematics teacher at Washwood Heath School, stood up and shouted &quot;Who is your God?&quot; at the singers and the audience of pupils, <I>The London Times</I> reported. &quot;Excuse me, there are Muslim boys and girls in this choir who are saying that Jesus is their God by taking part. This is totally wrong,&quot; Khan was quoted as saying. <BR><B>...Some of the audience, about a third of whom were Asian students, </B>started clapping and shouting &quot;Allah.&quot; Many students walked out. The school said it would investigate the incident, and many parents have called for a public apology from the teacher. <P>    <P> <B>A Christian convert from Islam was released from an Egyptian prison</B> Dec. 10, Compass Direct news service reported. Mohammed Wajdi Mohammed Dura<B>, </B>22, was arrested Oct. 3 by Egyptian state security police and charged with &quot;promoting ideas that disturb the security of Egyptian society.&quot; He had been held in Tanta Prison, 25 miles north of Cairo. His whereabouts and the official status of his case now are not known. <BR><B>...Dura also was arrested in May 1995 and April 1996,</B> when he was accused of  &quot;leading activities against Islam.&quot; A newspaper article blamed Christian radio and a Bible correspondence course for Dura's conversion. The article, published in May by <I>Islamist El-Shaab,</I> was headlined &quot;Mohammed Becomes Michael.&quot; It said State Security police tortured Dura because, by leaving Islam, he had slandered the Koran and its traditions. <P> <B>Episcopal and Lutheran congregations in Missouri share a priest</B>. On Sunday morning, Mary Lou Kator drives 21 miles and crosses two Christian denominations. She is pastor of Peace Evangelical Lutheran Church in Salisbury, where she leads prayers from the Lutheran Book of Worship during a Eucharist service. Her second service is at St. Barnabas Episcopal Church in Moberly, where she is vicar. She carries a chalice to the altar and reads the Book of Common Prayer. <BR><B>...The arrangement is thought to be unique among Episcopalians and Lutherans,</B> Episcopal News Service reported. Rural congregations of the same denomination often share a pastor. But sharing clergy could become more common in &quot;clergy-starved rural America,&quot; said Bishop Charles H. Maahs of the Evangelical Lutheran in America central state synod. Many churches face closing or reduced services because they can't find or can't afford full-time clergy, he said. <BR><B>...Evangelical Lutherans and Episcopalians have been sharing the Eucharist since 1982. </B>Next summer in Philadelphia, delegates to the two denominational conventions  will vote on an agreement recognizing each other's ordained ministers. <P> <B>A memorial service for an Indianapolis minister and his wife </B>murdered in their home last weekend was held this morning in Louisville. The service for C. Frederick Mathias and his wife, Cleta, was held at Northminister Presbyterian Church, where Mathias was the senior pastor for the past 11 years. <BR><B>...Firefighters found the bodies Dec. 15 after responding to a neighbor's report</B> of a fire at the home. According to the Associated Press, the couple's bodies were bound with ropes. They had been beaten with a blunt instrument and an ax was lodged in Mathias' head. An accelerant was used to start a fire in an upstairs hall. <BR><B>...Security has been tightened around the church</B> since the investigation into the murders began, Presbyterian News Service reported. The church's staff has been urged to be cautious since police are not sure whether the murders were random. <P> <B>Homosexual and lesbian couples must be treated the same as heterosexuals</B> under family law, the Court of Appeal in Ontario, Canada, has ruled. In what <I>The Globe</I> newspaper described as a monumental decision, the court upheld a lower-court ruling that said Ontario's Family Law Act violates Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms since it permits only heterosexual couples to sue for support payments. <P> <B>Gospel for Asia has begun an effort to plant churches among 100 South Asian groups of people </B>who have never heard the gospel. The strategy involves sending missionaries to distribute Christian literature, show films on the life of Jesus, and preach. Additional missionaries will continue the long-term effort, according to the Carrollton, Texas-based ministry. <A HREF= http://www.gfa.org/> Gospel for Asia </A> hopes to complete the effort by 2000.    </font></p>

Speaking in Rome at the World Food Summit, the pope blamed food shortages on political instability, war, money spent on weapons, and an international debt that impedes developing countries. The Pope called on world leaders to take radical measures to tackle hunger, including canceling the debts of developing countries. He urged leaders to bridge the &quot;intolerable contrast&quot; between rich and poor. <BR><B>...Food production must increase 75% in the next 30 years</B> to cover additional needs from the planet's growing population, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, which is hosting the summit. The meeting is being held amid the sufferings of a million refugees caught in warfare in eastern Zaire.  <P> <B>Socialism must take precedence over religion, Chinese authorities said</B>, promising to restrain Buddhism in Tibet. In the Himalayan region, monks outnumber students and more money is spent on monasteries than on Communist Party buildings, according to the official <I>Tibet Daily</I>. &quot;Further development of  temples, monks, and nuns cannot be without restrictions,&quot; the publication said. <BR><B>...In recent years, China has shut temples in Tibet</B> to stop the influence of the region's spiritual god-king, the Dalai Lama. He fled to India in 1959 after an unsuccessful uprising against communist rule. <P> <B>Carl Hunziker, an American being held in North Korea on spy charges, is in good physical health but in very low spirits</B>, the State Department said Tuesday. The report came from Swedish diplomat Ake Lafquist, who visited Hunziker last week, Reuters news service said. Hunziker, described by his family as a missionary, was arrested in North Korea Aug. 24 after entering from China. United Press International said U.S. officials suspect Hunziker may be suffering from a psychological disorder. <P> <B>An Assemblies of God congregation in Illinois experienced a summer of revival</B>. Special services that began May 26 at Urbana Assembly of God lasted until September. A total of 873 people made salvation decisions and 667 were &quot;filled with the Holy Spirit,&quot; the denomination said. More than 125 pastors from churches of various denominations across the Midwest visited the revival meetings. The speaker was Mobile, Ala., evangelist Joey Hipp. <BR><B>...Many people reportedly were healed of physical ailments during the services</B>. Several people who were scheduled to have tumors surgically removed found the tumors had disappeared; one man with chronic back pain was completely healed; a boy with asthma no longer needed his inhaler; and a girl with 90% hearing loss in one ear recovered her hearing, the church said. <BR><B>...Pastor Gary Grogan said his university town was in great need of revival</B>. Citing state statistics, Grogan said Champaign County had the lowest church attendance per capita of any county in the state, with only 7.4% attending a church or synagogue on any given weekend. Satanists are active in the area and there is a small witches' coven, he said. <P> <B>The Clinton administration has urged the Supreme Court to rule that states may ban doctor-assisted suicide</B>. The Justice Department filed two friend-of-the-court briefs Tuesday asking the justices to reinstate laws in New York and Washington that banned doctors from prescribing fatal drugs for terminally ill but mentally competent people who want to die. <P> <I><B>Touched By An Angel</B></I><B>, a CBS-TV program praised by religious groups</B>, is the eighth most-watched show on television, according to prime-time ratings compiled by Nielsen Media Research for Nov. 4-10. Last week's show reached 14.7 million homes.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 17, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A legal battle could delay introduction of the French abortion pill in the United States </B>until late next year. The dispute centers on San Diego businessman Joseph Pike, whose NeoGen Investors is responsible for raising $28 million in capital for the RU-486 venture. In part, the money would be used to distribute the drug and pay for U.S. clinical trials. So far, Pike has raised $14 million, news reports said. <BR><B>...Pike has been accused by the New York-based Population Council,</B> which has the U.S. marketing rights to  RU-486, of hiding his criminal past; Pike is a disbarred lawyer convicted of forgery. The Population Council sued Pike for fraud to force him to relinquish control of NeoGen. The council fears Pike's background could scare off investors and provide ammunition to abortion foes, news reports said. <P> <B>A Baptist pastor has been arrested for letting homeless people camp on his church property</B>. On Dec. 9, the city of Buena Park, Calif., filed criminal charges against Wiley Drake, pastor of First Southern Baptist Church, for refusing to dismantle what one official calls a &quot;shanty town&quot; of more than 70 people. The church's secretary and its treasurer also were charged, Associated Baptist Press reported. <BR><B>...The dispute began last fall, when the church let a few people camp</B> on its two-acre property. The city charges that the people are camping in violation of a city code. Police also blame the camp for increased crime in the city. <BR><B>...Drake says the city's main concern is image, not safety</B>. &quot;To admit you have homeless is bad for business,&quot; Drake said. The church distributes food each month to about 500 families. <P>   <P> <B>The way to create peace after a war is to grant amnesty and forgiveness</B> to those who have &quot;admitted crimes committed during a period of turmoil,&quot; Pope John Paul said. Speaking during a message today to mark the Roman Catholic Church's World Peace Day, the Pope urged forgiveness to heal the wounds of ethnic, religious, and cultural conflict and end what he called &quot;the deadly cycle of revenge,&quot; Reuter news service reported. The Pope said steps should be taken to stop the growth of the arms industry and arms trafficking and called on churches and governments to do more to promote peace. <P> <B>China will send a statue of a folk-religion goddess to Taiwan</B> to improve religious and cultural relations. The Yuanshi Chinshen Matsu, a 1,000-year-old Chinese national treasure, will be displayed in Taiwanese temples for three months beginning in January, the <I>United Evening News</I> reported. Matsu, the patron saint of fishermen, is worshipped in Taiwan and along the southeast coast of China. Beijing claims Taiwan as a runaway province, but retains economic and cultural ties with the island. <P> <B>Thieves stole a bronze statue of a lion, the symbol of Venice</B>, from St. Mark's Basilica in the city, Reuter news service reported. The small statue, which dates from 1615, had been removed from a marble pedestal in a side chapel, possibly with a crowbar, police said. <P> <B>One in four American children under 6 are poor</B>, according to a study released last week by the National Center for Children in Poverty at the Columbia University School of Public Health. From 1979 to 1994, the number of children under 6 living in poverty in the United States grew from 3.5 million to 6.1 million, the study showed. The poverty level for a family of four in 1994 was defined as $15,141 a year. <P> <B>The trial of five Indonesians accused of taking part in a riot</B> in which 25 churches and a temple were destroyed and five people died has begun in Jakarta. Antara news agency reported that the five are accused of  lighting fires and damaging buildings; they could receive 12 years in jail. They are the first of 53 people to go on trial for taking part in the riot, which occurred in October when a crowd became angered with the progress of a court case involving a man tried for blasphemy. <P> <B>A naturalized American citizen was forced to confess</B> to distributing religious materials in Vietnam and entering the country under false pretenses. Man Thi Jones, a 54-year-old resident of Folsom, Calif., told reporters that Vietnamese officials told her she could distribute the materials, but later arrested her. She was questioned for six days and forced to pay a $1,000 fine before officials returned her visa and passport, she said. Jones was released earlier this month and returned to California last week. <BR><B>...Jones said the U.S. State Department sympathized with her, but failed to protest</B> the religious persecution and allowed the case to drag on through Vietnamese legal channels.     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 1, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...The 82-count indictment accuses Bennett of bank and mail fraud, money laundering, and tax evasion</B>. It said Bennett persuaded nonprofit groups to give New Era money that would double in six months with matching funds from anonymous donors, news reports said. The donors did not exist, and instead New Era was running a ponzi scheme, using money from new participants to pay off earlier investors, the indictment said. <BR><B>...Much of the money is owed to evangelical Christian groups</B>, colleges, and churches. About 600 investors never received grants and lost about $150 million, including $3.5 million Bennett used to maintain a lavish lifestyle, prosecutors said. Some nonprofit groups received grants from New Era, and most of them have agreed to return the money to help pay creditors who failed to receive the money.  <P> <B>A record number of Canadian women obtained abortions in 1994</B>.  A total of 106,255 abortions were performed in hospitals and  private clinics, a rate of 27.6 abortions for ever 100 live births and an increase of 1.8% from the previous year, according to the Evangelical Fellowship of Canada. Private abortion clinics, legalized in 1988, perform an increasing number of abortions each year as abortions in hospitals remain steady, the EFC said.  <BR><B>...Even though the Supreme Court of Canada has acknowledged</B> that the federal government has an interest in the life of the unborn child,  there is no legal means to exercise this interest, the EFC said. Having no law to protect the unborn &quot;suggests indifference to the value of human life at its most vulnerable stage,&quot; the EFC said. <P> <B>Legalization of physician-assisted suicide in the United States would quickly slide into involuntary euthanasia</B> -- as it has in the Netherlands -- two prominent Christian leaders said. Former U.S. Surgeon General C. Everett Koop and David Stevens, executive director of the Christian Medical &amp; Dental Society, said  physician-assisted suicide would endanger the elderly, poor, depressed, handicapped, and other vulnerable members of society. &quot;Physicians know it is dangerous for them to have the power to help kill patients. That is why it has been prohibited in the medical profession for over 2,000 years,&quot; Stevens said at a press conference hosted by  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.). Canady presented findings from a new congressional report, <I>Physician-Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia in the Netherlands</I>.  <BR><B>...In Holland, strict regulations have failed to keep deaths voluntary</B>, Stevens said. Government reports show that in 1990, 2,300 people were killed by Netherlands doctors in its euthanasia program, including more than 1,000 people without their consent. &quot;Who will know what really went on between the doctor and the patient when the patient is dead?&quot; Stevens said.  <P> <B>A church in Michigan conducts a question-and-answer session</B> during its informal Saturday evening worship service. Rob Bell, pastor at Calvary Church, an independent evangelical congregation in Grand Rapids, takes questions after his sermon. Hand-written questions are collected, and each is anonymous.  Some questions focus on the meaning of passages from the Bible, but most focus on personal matters, such as sexual issues, abuse, and suicide. Bell avoids pat responses, often directs questioners to the Bible for further contemplation of the issue, and sometimes admits he does not know the answer. The session is risky but spiritual seekers consider it authentic, Bell said.  <P> <B>There's nothing very monastic about the monastic life in the United States any more</B>. Economic pressures are forcing modern monks to become workaholics, laboring long hours in secular jobs outside the monastery. This creates stress and consumes too much of the monks' lives, leaving little time for prayer, contemplation, and monastic community activities.           <P> <B>Neighbors Who Care, a national Christian ministry formed to help victims of  crime</B>, has grown since its founding in 1993 to nine chapters across the United States. A subsidiary of  Prison Fellowship, the ministry started by Chuck Colson, Neighbors Who Care provides practical, emotional, and spiritual support. The latest chapter began as a support group for homicide survivors in Memphis, Tenn., formed by Kitty Lawson, associate pastor at Abundant Grace Fellowship. Lawson formed the group after a couple from the church was murdered in their apartment. For information: Neighbors Who Care, P.O. Box 16079, Washington, D.C., 20041; phone: (703) 904-7311.  <P> <B>A translation of the Dead Sea Scrolls for non-scholars</B> is scheduled to be published in November. <I>The Dead Sea Scrolls: A New Translation</I>, contains no momentous revelations about early Christianity, researcher Edward Cook said. <P> <B>Cook and two colleagues pieced fragments together for the translation</B>, transliterated the Aramaic text into modern Hebrew, and translated the Hebrew into English. <P> <B>The scrolls, written by the Essenes, an ascetic Jewish sect</B>, were discovered in 1946 in a cave near the Dead Sea. They are thought to date to the second century before Jesus and to the first century after his death. No scroll directly connects the Essenes with early Christianity, he said. <P> <B>Australia's parliament is facing pressure from religious, political, and community groups</B> to overturn the world's first law legalizing mercy killing.  Australia's outback Northern Territory introduced the world's first voluntary euthanasia law earlier this year. The first person to die under the law was 66 year old Bob Dent, a former carpenter and one-time Christian missionary. Dent was terminally ill with prostate cancer. <BR><B>...However, opinion in the territory is running stronly in favor of the law</B>. Nationwide, opinion polls show strong support, with up to eight in 10 Australians in favor of the law. <P> <B>Nearly half of all pregnancies  in the United States are unintended and nearly a quarter end in abortion,</B> researchers for the Alan Guttmacher Institute said. Speaking at an American Medical Association conference in San Francisco Sept. 30, said that although 98% of American women use contraception during their reproductive years, two-thirds have had an unplanned pregnancy.  <P> <B>Plans are under way to provide World Wide Web home pages to all 19,500 Catholic parishes</B> in the United States. Catholic Online and the Catholic Catalog Company of Bakersfield, Calif., announced a joint venture to set up the pages free of charge, calling it a large but important task. The sites will allow parishes to communicate with their local parishioners as well as with the whole Catholic community, the companies said. A database of all parishes, including a Mass timetable, will allow travelers to type in their destination and receive information about the closest Catholic churches. <P> <B>Busloads of foreign tourists come each Sunday to attend some of the 400 churches in Harlem</B>, N.Y., one of the world's most famous African-American neighborhoods. Tours are given in English, Italian, French, Spanish, German, and Portuguese. They are part of the rejuvenation of Harlem neighborhoods,  some of which are being revived as centers of  business and entertainment for tourists and residents of all races.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 3, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A Catholic nun will administer juvenile court in Chicago</B>. Catherine Ryan, a 50-year-old lawyer, was named chief of the juvenile court system for the Illinois attorney's office in Cook County. She will oversee cases of juvenile delinquency, child abuse, and neglect. The job pays $101,000 a year, but as a nun who took a vow of poverty, she will turn over the money to her Franciscan order.  <BR><B>...Lawyers should be peacemakers,</B> said Ryan, a graduate of Northwestern University law school who has been a prosecutor and worked in a private law practice. Lawyers should treat each person with dignity so they &quot;can better accept the results, even if it's not what they wanted.&quot;  <BR><B>...Ryan stopped wearing a habit, dropped the name Sister Marie Shawn</B>, and went back to her given name in the 1970s. She lives with five other nuns in an apartment building in Chicago. Two of the nuns are teachers, one is a counselor, one is a nurse, and one is studying theology.  <BR><B>...Another nun, former hospital president Sheila Lyne</B>, has been commissioner of Chicago's Department of Health since 1991. <P>   <P> <B>Colorado taxpayers must pay $950,000 to cover the legal fees</B> of plaintiffs who successfully challenged Amendment 2. A settlement was reached to split legal fees among The American Civil Liberties Union, Lambda Legal Defense Fund, and the Denver City Attorney, United Press International reported. <BR><B>...Last spring, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Amendment 2,</B> which had been approved by voters. The amendment would have banned laws that protect homosexuals from discrimination based on their sexual orientation. <P> <B>About 125 girls from 36 states are in New York this weekend</B> for a First National Girls Conference. The two-day event features feminists Gloria Steinem and Marlo Thomas. Modeled on the Beijing Conference for Women, held in 1995, it is seen as the start of a new feminist movement for adolescent females. <BR><B>...The conference grew out of a self-esteem program</B> called Girls Speak Out founded by Steinem and Andrea Johnston, the author of a book by the same name. Conference participants will focus on girls' portrayals in the media, girls' experiences with violence, and human rights. <P> <B>Buddhists worship in the annex of First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta</B>. &quot;They worship an idol god, but that god has some of the same principles of love and compassion as our unseen God,&quot; said pastor Tim McDonald. Konomu Utsumi, a Buddhist monk from Japan, established the small temple with a gold shrine to Buddha in the annex five years ago. <P> <B>Barrington, R.I., can no longer provide free municipal snowplowing</B> for parking lots of churches and a synagogue. The town said it does not have the $60,000 necessary to appeal the decision of a federal judge, who ruled last month that the practice violates the constitutional separation of church and state. A lawsuit on behalf of six residents had been brought by the Rhode Island affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union. The town has been plowing the lots for 50 years. <P> <B>The Serbian Orthodox Church's support for opposition protests</B> that have shaken Yugoslavia since November may have come too late, analysts say. The Church's announcement on Thursday, after 46 days of silence, will not regain popularity the Church lost when it supported the Serb cause in nationalist wars, Reuter news service reported. Opposition Serbs have held daily mass protests after authorities annulled the Nov. 17 local election results, which showed the opposition had won 15 of Serbia's 18 largest towns. <P> <B>Interior ministers from 20 Arab countries gathered in Tunis, Tunisia</B>, today to approve a strategy to fight terrorism, a term they use to refer to Muslim fundamentalist violence. The annual session of the Arab Interior Ministers Council, a specialized body of the Arab League, is expected to commit itself to &quot;take effective and firm measures&quot; to fight terrorism. The strategy includes a commitment that member countries not be used to plan, organize, or carry out terrorist acts, and that the countries will cooperate in investigating suspects. <P> <B>A movement within the Catholic Church is incorporating Native American traditions</B>. A Mass at St. Peter's on the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, in Fort Yates, N.D., features drumming, chanting, and use of traditional incense such as sage, cedar, and sweet grass. Native music and the sacred pipe ceremony are employed, and Jesus is depicted as an Indian with darker skin color and different physical features. The liturgy also is culturally adapted. <P> <B>Brazil's first Protestant cable television station is about to begin broadcasting</B>, ALC News Service reported. The cable television market in Brazil is reportedly the fastest growing in the world. The advance of nondenominational, evangelical television in Brazil reflects a change of opinion among believers, many of whom considered it to be an instrument of the devil, observers said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 7, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...&quot;We don't want to build a federation on the foundation of the ashes of another. </B>We have to move ahead,&quot; the URC's stated clerk said at the group's first synod Oct. 1 and 2 in Lynwood, Ill. About 100 delegates, including those who have seceded from the Christian Reformed denomination in recent years, met to organize the new denomination. <BR><B>...The URC synod issued a letter encouraging a hundred conservative Christian Reformed churches</B>, called the Interclassical Conference, that have remained in the United Reformed Church. The conference has warned the Christian Reformed Church of a possible secession unless the denomination reverses its decision to allow the ordination of women ministers and elders. The URC is the largest of  several secessionist movements in the Christian Reformed Denomination. <BR><B>...The Christian Reformed Church has lost about 25,000 members in the last four years</B>, dropping to 291,796 this year. About 18,000 of those members have joined secession churches opposed to the ordination of women. <P>   <P> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court today rejected a challenge to the Freedom of Access to Clinics Entrances Act</B>, the law that protects access to abortion clinics. The appellants were five Wisconsin pro-life protesters arrested for blockading the Wisconsin Women's Health Care Center in Milwaukee in 1994. Protesters blocked the front and rear doors to the clinic with cars and welded and handcuffed themselves to the cars, news reports said. <BR><B>...The justices let stand a ruling that said Congress acted within its authority</B> to regulate interstate commerce when it passed FACE in 1994. Three federal appeals courts previously have upheld the law. In each of those cases, the Supreme Court let stand the decisions upholding the law. <P>     <P> <B>Public schools can continue to make charitable work a graduation requirement</B>, the Supreme Court decided today. The justices rejected, without comment, the appeal of Daniel Immediato, a former student at Rye Neck High School in Mamaroneck, N.Y., who was denied a diploma because he refused to participate in a mandatory community-service program. The school required all students to perform 40 hours of community service before graduation. Work for a variety of not-for-profit corporations, charities, political organizations or public agencies would qualify. <BR><B>...Immediato and his parents argued that decisions to serve others</B> should be determined by the family and conscience, not government edict. An estimated 8% of the nation's public school districts have such mandatory service programs. <P> <B>A proposed parental-rights amendment to Colorado's Constitution</B> has led to sharp debate. Proponents of Amendment 17 want protection for the &quot;inalienable right&quot; of parents to &quot;direct and control the upbringing, education, values and discipline of their children.&quot; Supporters say they are tired of battling schools, health-service organizations, and other agencies for control of their children. They say Amendment 17 would protect families against government meddling. <BR><B>...Opponents say parents already have the right to raise children the way they see fit</B>. They worry that the amendment would harm those most in need of help by keeping children in abusive homes and making it harder to prosecute child-abuse cases. Opponents include teachers' unions, the national Parent Teachers Association, and the American Civil Liberties Union,  <BR><B>...Signatures of more than 80,000 registered voters were gathered</B> to put the measure on the ballot.  A poll taken Sept. 3-5 by the <I>Rocky Mountain News</I> found 76% in favor of the amendment, 11% said they opposed the proposal, and 13% were undecided. <P> <B>Worship of Satan has penetrated institutions in Keyna</B>, a government commission found. The commission, appointed by President Daniel arap Moi in 1994, was led by Roman Catholic Archbishop Nicodemus Kirima and included representatives of  Kenyan society, Ecumenical News Service said. Information was gathered from self-confessed devil worshippers and corroborated from independent sources. <BR><B>...Evidence of  devil worship is plentiful,</B> the commission said in a two-page summary of its report. It includes kidnapping of children, rape, child abuse, murders, and the severing of tongues, eyes and limbs. Also occurring is human sacrifice, drinking human blood, black masses, nudity at rituals, use of drugs and snakes, and homosexuality and lesbianism, the report said. The president said the government is taking action to &quot;curb the evil practices,&quot; and advised the public to stop getting involved in devil worship. <P> <B>Kabul's middle class -- doctors, lawyers, engineers and their families -- have begun an exodus from the Afghan capital </B>after last week's victory of the Taleban militia. The radical Taleban seeks to establish a strict Islamic state. Taleban fighters seized the capital from the relatively moderate Islamic government of President Burhanuddin Rabbani. <BR><B>...Before dawn, families creep from their homes and head to the Kabul River</B>, hauling trunks and burlap sacks full of clothing and household goods, the<I> New York Times</I> reported. There, they wait for minibuses that go east to Jalalabad. Then, many switch to camel routes into Pakistan. <BR><B>...Kabul's schools and colleges have not reopened</B> since women have been forbidden to hold jobs outside the home and 70% of teachers are women. Some women doctors and nurses are working at hospitals, where they may care for female patients, but others have not returned for fear of harassment. <BR><B>...Iran's spiritual leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei criticized Afghanistan's Taleban movement</B> as &quot;un-Islamic&quot; and said it was backed by the United States, Reuters news service said. <P> <B>Pope John Paul's announced appendix surgery, scheduled for Tuesday, has begun a flurry of  speculation</B> from the media  that he may be more seriously ill and suffering from a tumor, news reports said. The Vatican has dismissed such speculation. <BR><B>...The Pope's left hand trembled violently Sunday at a service in St. Peter's Square</B>, Reuters news service said. This occurrence, along with facial rigidity and a stooped gait, could indicate Parkinson's Disease. The Vatican has not denied such reports. The pope underwent surgery twice in 1981 after suffering gunshot injuries in an assassination attempt, and again in 1992, when doctors removed a benign tumor from his colon.  <P> <B>Mothers should forgo full-time jobs in favor of raising their children at home</B>, Mormon Church president Gordon Hinckley said. It is nearly impossible to be a full-time homemaker and a full-time employee, he said in a sermon directed to the women of his 9.6-million member church. Women who work outside the home should do so to meet basic needs and &quot;not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries,&quot; he said. <P> <B>Some 300 men on death row in Russian prisons </B>received New Testaments distributed by the Bible Society of Russia. <B> </B>&quot;I will pray the Lord Jesus Christ to set me in the right way,&quot;  one prisoner said in response to the gift. <P> <B>An Assemblies of God pastor has entered Nicaragua's presidential race</B>. Guillermo Osorno would get 3.8% of the vote, according to a survey taken in Managua last month. But Osomo told Ecumenical News International that polls conducted by his party, the Christian Path, put him at between 14%-22% of the vote. <BR><B>...The main two rivals for president</B> -- Arnoldo Aleman and former Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega of the Sandinista National Liberation Front -- share about 75% of the vote, with none of the other 21 presidential candidates previously registering more than 2%. A strong showing by Osomo would prevent either Aleman or Ortega from getting at least 45%, necessitating a runoff. Evangelicals make up about a quarter of Nicaragua's population. Balloting is Oct. 20.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 31, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Homosexual and lesbian students interrupted a speech by Christian Coalition head Ralph Reed Wednesday at Harvard University</B>, UPI reported. As Reed began to talk, half the audience held up signs denouncing the coalition's criticism of homosexuality. Same-sex couples among the protesters embraced and kissed until police removed them from the hall. &quot;Get used to us, because we're going to be here a long, long time,&quot; Reed told the protesters before they were removed. During a question-and-answer session after Reed's talk, a black woman who identified herself as a lesbian told Reed he is &quot;a geeky, post-modern Christian racist in an expensive suit.&quot; <P> <B>Zaire and Rwanda moved closer to war with a third day of artillery and machine gun exchanges</B> across the border, news reports said. Tutsi fighters attacked near the eastern Zairean city of Goma today, sending refugees fleeing. Earlier this week, fighting in eastern Zaire claimed the life of Roman Catholic Archbishop Christophe Munzihirwa Mwene Ngabo. The Vatican said he was killed during an attack on the eastern town of Bukavu. <BR><B>...Volunteers in Bukavu were burying bodies,</B> the Red Cross said. The last foreign aid workers fled from Bukavu on Tuesday, reports said. Missionaries there had stayed in their homes fearing being shot, a Burundian priest told Reuters news service. <P> <B>Ten thousand Ugandan Christians have joined an AIDS campaign</B>. The Good Samaritan Volunteers, who are members of the Anglican diocese of  Namirembe, will provide food, clothing, and medical care for the sick and promote awareness of AIDS prevention and care. The three-year project will cost $300,000. <P> <B>..More than 100,000 Ugandans have died from AIDS-related diseases s</B>ince the virus first was identified there in 1982. An estimated 1.5 million Ugandans out of the total population of 20 million are HIV-positive, news reports said. Uganda is among the worst-affected countries in Africa. <BR><B>...Roman Catholic, Anglican, and Orthodox Church leaders in Uganda have been criticized</B> for opposing condom use to stop the spread of the disease. The churches have said use of condoms encourages promiscuity. <P> <B>The Orthodox Patriarch in Serbia has blessed the Reconciliation Walk.</B> &quot;In view of the previously icy relationship between the Orthodox church and evangelicals,&quot; the Patriarch's action was very surprising, according to DAWN FridayFax. Walkers are following the path of the Crusades, from Cologne to Jerusalem, as they apologize to Muslims and Jews.  <BR><B>...The walkers said the Patriarch emphasized &quot;brotherhood and unity</B> between Orthodox believers and Western Christians.&quot; Another Orthodox bishop apologized for &quot;the bitterness&quot; he had felt toward Western Christians, a walk organizer said. <P> <B>A Messianic Christian fellowship has begun in Stuttgart, Germany</B>, according to the German magazine <I>idea</I>. Attendance at the fellowship ranges from 70-150; most are Russian-speaking Jews who believe that Jesus Christ is the Messiah promised by the Old Testament. Other visitors are Christian friends of Judaism.  <P> <B>In Brazil, more than 1,000 people made decisions to become Christians during a crusade this month led by American evangelist Sammy Tippit</B>. A total of 39,000 people attended four days of crusade meetings in Sao Luiz. Tippit also spoke at a True Love Waits conference, where 600 teen-agers committed themselves to sexual abstinence before marriage.   <P> <B>The Methodist church in Brazil has been growing 33% annually since 1992</B>, according to DAWN FridayFax. Most new churches are planted by laypeople and are &quot;charismatically oriented,&quot; according to Paulo Lockmann, Rio de Janeiro's Methodist bishop. <P> <B>A South African judge sentenced the former head of a police assassination squad</B> to two life sentences and 200 years in jail. Eugene de Kock's actions were cruel, calculated, and without sympathy for his victims, <I>The New York Times</I> said. De Kock is the highest-ranking official to be convicted of apartheid-era crimes. His conviction could encourage others to cooperate with the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which is uncovering details of thousands of apartheid-era murders, disappearances, and tortures. The commission is considering amnesty for those who testify. <P> <B>A church has begun among a Vietnamese tribe where witch doctors once ruled.</B> Because of a Vietnamese Christian named May, the church was established among the very poor Churu Indian Tribe, according to Mission Network News. God miraculously destroyed that power, many Churu became Christians, and now 300 attend church in the village, May said. The new believers are difficult to disciple because there is no Churu Bible. <P> <B>Jerry Falwell denied Wednesday that he has become a Southern Baptist,</B> saying news reports had misinterpreted his position. The Lynchburg, Va., pastor described himself as &quot;a Baptist in the South,&quot; but still independent of the Southern Baptist Convention. Falwell contributed funds to a conservative group of Virginia Baptists, indirectly affiliating his congregation, Thomas Road Baptist Church, with the SBC. A Falwell spokesman characterized the contribution as friendly cooperation rather than a sign of membership. <P> <B>Five of Britain's best preachers held a preach-off in front of a full congregation and a panel of judges</B> at Southwark Cathedral in London Wednesday. William Anderson, a 65-year-old Roman Catholic from Aberdeen, Scotland, won the Preacher of the Year Award. Finalists for the award, organized by the College of Preachers, were chosen through unannounced visits to churches.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 8, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Psychics have a cloudy future in suburbs around the country</B>.  They face hundreds of dollars in fines as municipalities erect shields to protect the public against fraud and undesirable elements, according to the <I>Chicago Tribune.</I> <BR><B>...&quot;I don't know if there are any really legitimate fortune-tellers out there,&quot; s</B>aid Carl Ceretto, chairman of a committee drafting a ban in Alsip, Ill.  &quot;If there are, can they give me the lottery numbers for Wednesday night?&quot; he asked the <I>Tribune</I>. <BR><B>...Anti-psychic laws have met resistance from the Association for Astrological Networking</B>, a Los Angeles group that has challenged regulations in a dozen states.  &quot;Just because you fear something or don't like something personally doesn't mean it doesn't have a right to exist.  The law protects all kinds of speech,&quot; said Dorothy Oja, chairwoman of the association's legal committee. <BR><B>...&quot;There are bad apples in every bunch,&quot; said one psychic</B> who asked to remain anonymous.  &quot;You could say, let's look at Jim Bakker and other people who have been convicted.  Are they going to pass a law outlawing Christianity?&quot;  <P> <B>A school for homeless children operates at St. Mary's Interfaith Dining Room</B> in Stockton, Calif.  An average of  65 children a day, age 5 to 13, are bused from shelters, street corners, and transient motels.  The curriculum focuses on literacy skills, acquisition of a second language, and math. <BR><B>...When children arrive with no shoes or inadequate clothing</B>, they are given new shoes, socks, underwear, personal hygiene kits, and school supplies donated by individuals and community groups; 300 children a day receive clothing.  St. Mary's also provides lunch for about 40 children a day, as well as medical and dental care and support services for children and their families.  When a child's family moves into permanent housing, volunteers help with the transition to a new school, visit each child weekly during the first month, and help with any physical, emotional, and social adjustment. <P>   <P> <B>Motorists should obey the &quot;10 Commandments&quot; of ethical driving</B>, according to the Christian Road Safety Association.   The group, based in England, urges motorists to see their cars as instruments of God's purpose, Ecumenical News International reported.  Drivers should begin and end each journey with a prayer, make it easy for aggressive drivers to pass, and realize that if they start late it is sensible to arrive late. <BR><B>...The CRSA will celebrate its 60th anniversary with a service in Canterbury Cathedral</B> next month.  It is part of a movement supported by drivers in many countries, and has a worldwide membership of 16,000.  The association provides materials for road-safety services in churches and arranges talks in schools. <BR><B>...The association's 10 commandments are</B>: <UL> <LI>Begin with a prayer. <LI>If you start late, arrive late. <LI>Alcohol is for the radiator, not for the operator. <LI>If entry into the flow of traffic is facilitated by the courtesy of another driver, wave in appreciation. <LI>If you have inadvertently inconvenienced or endangered the safe passage of another vehicle, wave as an apology. <LI>Make it easier for aggressive opportunity-snatchers to get ahead of you -- far ahead. <LI>Drive so that the sudden appearance of a patrol car is a pleasant site. <LI>Give plenty of space to taxis and cars marked with dents. <LI>Never accelerate, and decelerate if advisable, when another car wishes to enter your lane. <LI>End every trip with a prayer of thanksgiving.   </UL><P> <B><A HREF= http://www.messiah.edu/hpages/facstaff/chase/h/exodus/index.htm > Exodus International </A> has formed a network for the families and friends of homosexuals</B>.  Exodus, a Christian group that helps those who want to leave the homosexual lifestyle, calls the network Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays.  It is intended to include people who love someone who is homosexual but reject homosexual behavior as sinful, Exodus said. <BR><B>...PFOX provides an alternative to Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays</B>, or PFLAG, who are encouraged to accept their loved one's homosexuality rather than to urge them to seek change, Exodus said. <P> <B>The Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) is working to make each of its 3,900 congregations accessible</B> and welcoming to people who have disabilities.  A first step in the program is distributing a 52-page handbook from the National Organization On Disability.  The handbook discusses how congregations can examine their attitudes about disabilities, train ushers, and overcome physical barriers.      </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 12, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Wal-Mart, the largest seller of pop music in the country, refuses to stock albums with lyrics or cover art it finds objectionable.</B> That has pleased parents, but frustrated some customers, musicians, and record-industry executives, who call it a form of censorship, <I>The New York Times</I> said.  <BR><B>...Record companies are sanitizing CDs to win approval from Wal-Mart.</B> Because of the discount chain's influence, record producers and bands design covers, drop songs from albums, mask words, and change lyrics to gain Wal-Mart's approval.  <BR><B>...Blockbuster video chain also is making an impact on popular culture</B>. Film studios are recutting movies, removing scenes, and changing video boxes -- often without the director's consent -- so Blockbuster will put the videos on its shelves, <I>The Times</I> said.  <P> <B>Prayer and hard work were heavyweight boxer Evander Holyfield's formula</B> for defeating heavily favored WBA champion Mike Tyson. Holyfield said he battled discouragement while training to fight the powerful Tyson. &quot;I prayed during training. I prayed when I got into the ring. I prayed when I was fighting him. I realized what I'd be facing. I knew I'd have to pray to be in there with the man,&quot; Holyfield said. <BR><B>...Holyfield, who has proclaimed his Christian faith on a number of occasions</B>, sang a gospel tune in the dressing room before the fight, leading his staff in &quot;joyous, revival-style celebration,&quot; <I>USA Today</I> said. Stitched on Holyfield's robe and trunks was Philippians 4:13, &quot;I can do all things in Him who strengthens me.&quot; Holyfield remained calm and steady in the ring -- almost as if he had won the fight in the dressing room, one observer said. <P>   <P> <B>Jerry Falwell's Liberty University came up with $1.1 million to pay bondholders,</B> averting a threat to foreclose on the school's Lynchburg, Va., campus. It was the second time in four years bondholders had threatened to sell the school's assets to satisfy its semi-annual payment. Bondholders are feeling &quot;a very high level of frustration and mistrust,&quot; representative Claude Ferebee told The Associated Press.  <BR><B>...The bonds were issued in the 1980s by Falwell's <I>Old-Time Gospel Hour</I> television program</B> to finance Liberty's expansion. But the school struggled to pay its debts when viewer donations dropped after scandals involving other television evangelists. Bondholders say they are owed $20 million and have refused Liberty's offer of $7.5 million to pay off the bonds. <P> <B>Aid workers were in rebel-held Goma, Zaire, today, but distribution of a small amount of food</B> and medicine was delayed by long talks between aid agency officials and rebel leaders. The aid remained in seven trucks under rebel guard at a football stadium. The aid workers entered from Rwanda despite Zaire's assertion that they were violating its sovereignty. <BR><B>...The United Nations refugee agency said it would start flying relief supplies</B> within days. Canada offered to lead a multinational force to help end the crisis and bring relief to the more than one million Hutu refugees. South African President Nelson Mandela also said he was ready to send troops to Central Africa. The United States said it had still not seen a coherent plan for assembling an international force. <P> <B>Ultra-Orthodox Jewish men shouted in anger and threw a folding chair at a group of Reform Judaism women praying at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem. </B>The women were challenging traditional ultra-Orthodox control of prayers at the Wall, and the men were angry that they wore skullcaps and brought Torahs. The women want the right to pray anywhere along the wall, a remnant of the temple destroyed in A.D. 70. Presently, the Wall is divided into separate sections for men and women, who are forbidden to pray together. Women are not allowed to read directly from the Torah at the Wall or wear prayer shawls there. <P> <B>A Church of the Brethren congregation barred a lesbian from attending services </B>after she married a male transsexual, The Associated Press said. Debi Easterday, who had attended Medina, Ohio, Church of the Brethren, for four years, was escorted off the property Sunday by a police officer. <BR><B>...&quot;No one has the right to tell me where I can go to hear God's word,&quot;</B> Easterday said. The denomination, which welcomes anyone who believes in Jesus but doesn't condone relationships between homosexuals, said it was &quot;deeply saddened that despite our initial acceptance, love, generosity and prayers, Debi remains unrepentant and seeks to mock God.&quot; <P>   <P> <B>U.S. Catholic bishops, meeting in Washington, D.C., defended the requirement of celibacy for priests.</B> &quot;There is no greater sign of hope in the Lord than to believe that serving Him is worth sacrificing the most truly human of all joys -- marriage and family,&quot; Cleveland Bishop Anthony Pilla said. Scandals involving priests in the last few years have called the idea of celibacy into questions, but most Catholics do not judge the priesthood by the behavior of a few individuals, Pilla said. The Church weathered a far more severe shortage of priests in the 14th century when a plague devastated Europe, the bishops said. <BR><B>...A group of about 50 Catholics conducted a prayer vigil</B> outside the hotel where the bishops met. The We Are Church Coalition, based in Fairfax, Va., called for optional celibacy for clergy, ordination of women, and lay participation in selection of pastors and bishops.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 10, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Australia's House of Representatives voted 88-35 to nullify the world's first voluntary euthanasia law,</B> which took effect in July in the Northern Territory. If the Senate also backs the anti-euthanasia bill, the Northern Territory law would be rescinded. <BR><B>...The law allows terminally ill people who meet certain guidelines</B> to kill themselves with a lethal injection or pills; doctors can assist their suicide. In September, Australian cancer patient and former Christian missionary Bob Dent, 66, committed suicide, becoming the first and only person to use the law. <BR><B>...Opinion polls show 75% of Australians support voluntary euthanasia</B>, Reuter news service said. Linda Cracknell, president of the Voluntary Euthanasia Network, a pro-euthanasia group, condemned Australian politicians for &quot;failing to represent the beliefs of the people.&quot;  <P> <B>U.S. Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) proposed a law that would allow taxpayers to give $500 of their annual tax</B> debt to a charity in their community that fights poverty, drugs, or crime. The money would finance agencies such as the Salvation Army, Catholic Charities, Habitat for Humanity, and &quot;countless others, who are rescuing lives from addiction, dependence and despair,&quot; Coats said. Funding such agencies is more effective than giving money to the government and &quot;hoping that some of it filters down to the poor,&quot; he said. <P> <B>At least $625,000 disappeared last year about the time Madalyn Murray O'Hair</B>, her son Jon, and adopted daughter Robin mysteriously vanished, the<I> San Antonio Express-News</I> reported. The admission of huge losses by two groups that O'Hair controlled contradict claims by atheist officials last summer that corporate assets were intact after the three disappeared in August 1995, the newspaper said. O'Hair, America's  most famous atheist, won a 1963 federal lawsuit removing prayer and Bible reading from American public schools. <P> <B>A zoning appeals board on Monday approved a plan to build a $30 million, 94,000-square-foot Mormon temple</B> in a residential neighborhood in Belmont, Mass. The panel voted 4-1 to approve plans for the Boston Temple, which would include a lighted 139-foot steeple and five other spires. Some residents oppose the temple, saying it would dominate the skyline and flood the neighborhood with traffic. <P> <B>Former Ku Klux Klansmen Hubert Rowell and Arthur A. Haley pleaded guilty</B> Monday in Charleston, S.C., to federal charges of conspiring to burn down rural black Macedonia Baptist Church and a migrant labor camp last year. Prosecutors said the men provided the flammable liquids that two other men used to burn the church, and conspired in the arson that destroyed the camp. The two other men pleaded guilty in August to setting the church fire. Rowell and Haley face up to 60 years in prison and a $1 million fine. <P> <B>A 51-year-old British grandmother has carried her daughter's embryo to term</B>, news reports said. The baby girl was born Thursday in northern England. The woman acted as a surrogate for an embryo created from the eggs of her daughter, who was born without a womb, and the sperm of her daughter's husband.  <P> <B>Homosexual couples in the Netherlands may soon be able to register their relationship</B> as a legally binding union. A proposal to that effect has broad backing in parliament and is expected to become law in January 1998, news reports said. It would give registered same-sex couples the same rights as married heterosexuals except that homosexual couples could not adopt children. <P> <B>The Christian Coalition reported today that it raised nearly $27 million</B> in 1996, a 36% increase over 1995. The group estimated that 1.3 million members contributed. Much of  the money was spent on distributing 46 million guides for voters in last month's election. The guides were given out at 126,000 churches.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 24, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>In a massive ecumenical project, half a million copies of the Danish-language New Testament were given away</B> in Denmark. Some 98% of the households in Copenhagen received copies, with only a few people refusing the gift, according to the Danish Bible Society. <BR><B>...Local Danish churches cooperated to distribute the Bibles. </B>The effort was preceeded<B> </B>by an advertising campaign on television, billboards, and in newspapers. Copenhagen's 38,000 foreign-language households were offered a free copy of the New Testament in their own language. Each household also received a list of 600 follow-up events such as Christian concerts and Bible-study groups.   <BR><B>...The Swedish Bible Society plans a similar New Testament distribution</B> in Stockholm in 1998. <P> <B>Christian relief groups are aiding refugees fleeing to Rwanda from eastern Zaire</B>, an area that is close to war. Workers from groups such as World Relief and the Free Methodist Church are in Rwandan refugee camps providing food, soap, medicine, and blankets for the Banyamulenge refugees, most of whom are widows and orphans. The Banyamulenge are ethnic Tutsis who arrived in eastern Zaire up to 200 years ago from what is now Rwanda and Burundi. They have been the target of ethnic persecution and denied Zairian citizenship. On Oct. 8, Zaire ordered all the Banyamulenge to leave Zaire or face a war.   <BR><B>...The refugees are completely without resources</B>, said Eraste Iyamuremye of the Free Methodist Church in Rwanda. Children are showing signs of malnutrition, said Jean Gakwandi, World Relief's program manager in Rwanda. Some refugees &quot;are of Free Methodist background and are godly people,&quot; Gakwandi added. &quot;Most of their time is spent in prayer and worship.&quot; <P> <B>A Vatican emissary visited Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) denominational headquarters</B> in Louisville seeking ecumenical ties, Presbyterian News Service said. Monsignor John Radano, an American from New Jersey who serves on the Vatican's Council for Promoting Christian Unity, signaled the Roman Catholic Church's &quot;irrevocable commitment&quot; to the ecumenical movement. He told PNS that the Vatican's relationship with international ecumenical bodies such as the World Council of Churches is &quot;a good partnership.&quot; <BR><B>...The Vatican has been having constructive dialogue on matters of liturgy and doctrine</B>, such as justification by faith, Radano said. Social issues have been more problematic, since various churches are far apart on issues such as birth control, abortion, and the role of women in the church, he said. <P> <B>A prayerwalk took place this month in Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, and Oman</B>, Mission Network News said. In addition to praying, participants worshipped and held seminars with evangelical Christians. About 10,000 evangelicals reportedly live in the region.  <P> <B>Feminists for Life, a nonsectarian Washington, D.C.-based group,</B> is targeting college campuses. The group's campaign includes counseling, campus-reform proposals, and advertisements challenging students to &quot;Question Abortion.&quot; <A HREF= http://www.serve.com/fem4life > Feminists for Life </A> is located at 733 15th St., NW, Suite 1100, Washington, DC  20005. The phone number is (202) 737-3352. <P> <B>The U.S. government allowed Catholic Relief Services to send one planeload of food, clothing, and medicine to Cuba</B> for victims of  Hurricane Lili. The hurricane hit central and western Cuba last week, destroying 5,000 homes and damaging 78,000. Winds also damaged crops, power lines, and communications. <BR><B>...Supporters of the State Department's ban on direct flights</B> from the United States to Cuba say they fear humanitarian supplies will be stolen by the government of Fidel Castro. But a U.S. Catholic group said it would monitor the shipment to ensure the supplies get to the needy. <P> <B>Five hundred women marched in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-e-Sharif,</B> chanting slogans against the country's Taliban rulers and waving a giant banner reading &quot;Men and Women Need Each Other,&quot; Reuter news service said. The radical Islamic Taliban control two-thirds of Afghanistan, but do not control Mazar-e-Sharif, where the rally was held at Balkh University. Men and women study together at the school, a practice opposed by the Taliban.    </font></p>

That means student-led prayer at graduations is permissible in Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi -- the states covered by the Fifth Circuit -- while other prayer is not permitted. <BR><B>...School boards across the country say they had been looking for guidance </B>on the subject of student-led prayer in public schools, especially at graduation time. <P> <B>Canadian police made arrests in a major international child-pornography ring on the Internet</B>. Authorities confiscated 30,000 pornographic computer files and arrested Trevor Davis, 22, of Ontario. Davis is believed to be connected with a group of American men known as the Orchid Club who were charged last summer with running an Internet pornography ring, news reports said. The files seized included photos and video clips of young children as well as text of child-abuse incidents. <P> <B>Destitute street children in Mexico City are going to a Christian camp</B> run by Bothell, Wash.-based Action International Ministries. The children -- who are not in school and have no parents or guardians -- often respond readily when invited to attend the camp. Once there, they are safe from harm and receive three meals a day and loving care, Mission News Network said. About the third day, the children start relaxing and listening, and eventually many of them make commitments to Christ. <P> <B>Churches are growing fast in Madagascar</B>, an island off the southeastern coast of Africa. An evangelistic conference motivated 25 volunteers to show the <I>Jesus</I> film to 30,000 people throughout the country. Nearly 9,000 people made professions of faith in Christ and 600 were trained in evangelism.  <P> <B>Missionary students hundreds of miles apart are studying together</B> in Youth With A Mission's &quot;electronic classroom.&quot; The 12-week Leadership Training School is run by YWAM's University of the Nations. The first such class begins this month with a live broadcast connecting students in Lausanne, Switzerland, to others in Budapest, Hungary. Students follow the same course and share teachers, who are able to interact with students at each location through a two-way video link. <P>        <P> <B>Promise Keepers drew 1.1 million men</B> at 22 conferences in stadiums around the country this year, according to Randy Phillips, president of the men's ministry. <P> <B>Afghanistan's Taleban rulers want to ban opium poppy production</B> on religious grounds, according to United Nations officials who spoke to the strict Islamic leaders. That could cut Asia's heroin output by half, U.N. drug experts said. But the Taleban, which controls two-thirds of Afghanistan, said it first must find replacement crops for poppy farmers, Reuters news service said. <P> <B>An Anglican was ordained as the first woman priest in Rome</B>, creating a stir in the capital of Roman Catholicism. Cecilia Monge Teran de Erazo is a 43-year-old grandmother who converted from Catholicism in the 1980s. She was ordained Nov. 3 at the American Episcopal Church of Saint Paul's Within-the-Walls. Her husband, Juan, is also a priest. <P> <B>Arson attacks on black churches have declined somewhat</B> and arrests have quadrupled since a task force began to concentrate efforts on the problem, the U.S. assistant attorney general for civil rights told Ecumenical News International. <P> <B>A Chaldean family gave $400,000 to President Clinton's re-election campaign</B> at a fund-raiser last month, <I>The Detroit Free Press</I> reported. Chaldeans are Christian Iraqis; the Detroit area is home to the largest Chaldean community outside of Iraq. At the Oct. 21 fund-raiser in Detroit, many members of the Chaldean community urged the president to be lenient toward their Iraqi homeland, the newspaper said. People paid as much as $10,000 per couple to the Democratic National Committee for the chance to speak with the president privately. <P> <B>Mississippi has dropped its attempt to toughen its abortion laws</B>, already among the nation's strictest. The state said it stands little chance of reversing a Sept. 27 federal court ruling against the restrictions, which were enacted by the Legislature in March. The restrictions included a ban on clinics near churches and schools. Also included were rules requiring at least five rest rooms in clinics, alarm and emergency power systems, separate locker rooms for nurses and doctors, and a formal agreement with a hospital to receive emergency patients. <P>      </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 6, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A British medical charity issued a stark warning that refugee camps</B> in eastern Zaire could become scenes of genocidal massacres in the next few days. John Howarth of the charity Merlin said hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into the camps. <BR><B>...Food also is in short supply.</B> &quot;A severe human catastrophe&quot; is unfolding<B>,</B> said a spokesperson for Action by Churches Together, a worldwide network of churches that coordinate emergency response. &quot;I'm afraid a lot of people are going to die&quot; and there is &quot;very little, if anything, we can do about it,&quot; said Richard Oaten of the Lutheran World Federation. Humanitarian agencies can only observe the situation and try to raise emergency resources, ACT said. <BR><B>...Since mid-September, a minor conflict in Eastern Zaire has escalated into open warfare</B> between the Zaire military and the ethnic Tutsi people known as Banyamulenge. <P> <B>People lined the streets to applaud as a group of 60 Christian &quot;peace walkers&quot;</B> wearing T-shirts proclaiming <I>We Apologize</I> in Turkish marched through Istanbul, <I>YWAM News</I> said. The procession ended the first leg of a 1,500-mile, four-year effort to build bridges between Christians, Muslims, and Jews. The journey, which began in Cologne, Germany, last Easter, retraces the steps of the Medieval Crusades, often considered the root of centuries of conflict between the religions. <BR><B>...The walkers had passed through Austria, Slovakia, Hungary, Serbia, and Bulgaria</B> on their way to the Turkish capital. Another team of walkers, following one of the other main routes of the Crusades, arrived in Istanbul in late August. The Walk is due to end in Jerusalem in 1999 with an event marking the 900th anniversary of the fall of the city to the Crusaders. Up to two million Muslims and Jews are expected to hear the reconciliation statement in the next two years. <P> <B>A dispute between groups working to bring the French abortion pill to American women</B> may delay the drug's availability, <I>The New York Times</I> said. On Monday, the nonprofit Population Council, which holds the U.S. rights to mifepristone, and the nonprofit Advances in Health Technology, established to educate doctors about the drug, filed a lawsuit. They went to court against Joseph D. Pike, who was chosen by the council to raise money to manufacture and distribute mifepristone. <BR><B>...The suit charges Pike with fraud</B>. It says he has not accounted for all the money invested and has put some money into a &quot;previously unknown entity&quot; whose name has been changed four times in the last 18 months. The suit seeks to have Pike's interest in the drug transferred to a receiver, who would then sell it. Pike was disbarred for forgery in a 1985 North Carolina real estate deal and had been given a suspended two-year sentence, news reports said. <BR><B>...Roussel Uclaf, the French manufacturer of mifepristone, refused to bring the drug to market</B> in the United States because of concerns over anti-abortion boycotts and product-liability lawsuits. In 1994, Roussel Uclaf gave its American rights to the Population Council, which last year chose Pike to handle it.  <P> <B>A week of prayer, fasting, and special services Oct. 27-Nov. 3 has stirred renewal</B> among Southern Baptist churches nationwide, Baptist Press reported. The special week was inspired last June by Arkansas pastor Ronnie Floyd during his sermon at the Southern Baptist Convention's annual meeting in New Orleans. Pastors said they anticipate the week's impact will continue as people take on prayer and fasting as a way of life. Many people reportedly experienced &quot;a touch from God&quot; during the week, BP said. <P> <B>The proposed Episcopal-Lutheran merger -- under consideration for 30 years -- is moving into its final stages</B>. A committee responsible for drafting the final version of the Concordat of Agreement between the denominations met Nov. 1-3, Episcopal News Service said. <BR><B>...The revised Concordat describes the doctrinal consensus that underlies proposals</B> for full communion: Scripture and the historic creeds, the sacraments of baptism and Eucharist, and &quot;a ministry of pastoral oversight&quot; to safeguard the church from doctrinal error. The revised Concordat calls for continued study of how the diaconate relates to other ministries. Both churches have gifts they bring to the &quot;spiritual marriage,&quot; the committee said. A vote on full communion will take place next summer. <P> <B>The gospels are based on Jewish stories, not literal truth, according to Episcopal Bishop John Spong. </B>The controversial leader of the Diocese of Newark, N.J., has written a book arguing that many events described in the life of  Jesus -- such as the circumstances of his birth to his physical resurrection -- are not literally true. Spong argues in <I>Liberating the Gospels: Reading the Bible with Jewish Eyes </I>that the New Testament uses sacred Jewish stories to describe the holiness that Jesus' contemporaries saw in Him, <I>The Los Angeles Times</I> said. Many people have rejected the church over its insistence that the Bible's account of Jesus' life is factual instead of digging deeper into the meaning of Jesus' life, Spong said. <BR><B>...&quot;The Gospels were not written to be history,&quot;</B> Spong wrote. Consequently, he said, there might have been no actual person called Joseph as the husband of Mary, no temptation of Jesus during 40 days in the wilderness, no Sermon on the Mount, no miraculous feeding of the 5,000 and no ascension into heaven following Jesus' crucifixion and resurrection.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 31, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Surgeons transplanted cells from the eye of an aborted fetus</B> into the eye of an 80-year-old woman in hopes of curing her macular degeneration.  The disease is the leading cause of blindness among older Americans.  Tissue the size of a pinhead was placed under a damaged area of the woman's left retina in an operation performed Jan. 29 by  University of Chicago surgeon Samir Patel. <BR><B>...The 250,000 cells were collected from the eyes of a fetus</B> donated by a woman who underwent an abortion to save her life, news reports said.  Scientists say cells from such second-trimester abortions are the only ones that might help cure the disease.  It will take a few weeks before doctors know whether the implanted cells were growing or rejected by the woman's immune system.  It will be at least three months before she can expect any improvement in her vision. <BR><B>...Pro-life groups oppose the use of fetal tissue in medical procedures</B>, saying they may encourage abortions.  The patient, a Christian, said she discussed the operation with her minister before proceeding. <P> <B>Abortion on demand will become a reality in South Africa Saturday.  </B>Hospitals are preparing for a rush of women requesting abortions.  Initially, officials say they expect anything from 200 to 520 abortions a year for every 1,000 live births, Reuter news service reported. <BR><B>...Women and girls of any age are entitled to a state-funded abortion</B> on demand during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy if they have no private medical insurance.  Under certain conditions, that can be extended eight more weeks.  Pro-life groups, which fought the law vociferously, are planning more protests across the country.  South Africa's first democratic parliament approved the liberal abortion legislation in November. <P> <B>The Christian Coalition has changed direction.  </B>The group issued a new legislative agenda that embraces blacks and Hispanics.  The new eight-point program calls for funding for counseling to encourage teen abstinence; scholarships to low-income children in 100 of the most impoverished school districts; and a $500 tax credit for people who give money and volunteer time to private groups that help the poor. <BR><B>...Other parts of the plan, called the Samaritan Project, </B>include holding a meeting to encourage greater understanding between people of all races; creating empowerment zones in 100 poor communities that would provide tax relief on the startup costs for new businesses; and assisting 1,000 places of worship that serve neighborhoods and communities in need. <BR><B>...The Coalition, an overwhelmingly white, evangelical, Republican group</B>, claims 1.7 million members.  Two years ago, when Christian Coalition leader Ralph Reed presented his legislative program for the last Congress, he was flanked by top Republicans.  This time, he was joined by a collection of black and Hispanic church pastors.  There were no politicians on hand.  Reed said the Coalition wanted to acknowledge its failure to adequately address racial issues. <P> <B>Kuwaiti convert to Christianity Robert Hussein,</B> who was declared an apostate by a Muslim court, has reportedly returned to Islam.  Hussein came to the United States in August saying he feared for his life after the ruling. He said it could be interpreted by Muslims as permission to kill him.  The newspaper said Hussein married an American Christian missionary before returning to Kuwait earlier this month.  His wife wants to convert to Islam, the paper said.  The court declared Hussein an apostate last May 29 in the first such finding by a court in the conservative Gulf Arab state. <P> <B>Troops patrolled an Indonesian town the day after a Muslim mob</B> went a the rampage over a reported insult against Islam.  Rioters in Rengasdengklok burned and wrecked five churches, a Chinese Buddhist temple, shops, and homes, news reports said.  The riot apparently started after a Chinese woman complained of the noise Muslim youths made as they beat drums before the start of the daylight Ramadan fast. <P> <B>Religion is practically nonexistent in television commercials.  </B>A study of 797 television commercials found less than 2% had any religious or spiritual content.  The study was done by researchers at Western Illinois University in Macomb and Gonzaga University in Spokane.  The Bible was not prominent in any commercial.  Conventional religious symbols were found in some commercials, such as a Buick ad depicting a family driving to church and a Coke ad  showed a choir singing. <BR><B>...Some commercials are irreverent</B>, such as a Wendy's ad that depicts the devil winning a debate with an angel.  Advertising &quot;exists in the material world, and religion is of the spiritual world, and there is not a great deal of overlap,&quot; said Thomas Johnson, an analyst at the Media Research Center in Alexandria, Va. <P> <B>More churches and counseling centers are creating programs for pastors</B> who need help with depression and burn-out.  The Kettering Clergy Care Center in Dayton, Ohio, offers counseling referrals and support for ministers.  The Turning Point program at the Center for Congregational Health in Winston-Salem, N.C., offers pastors a physical examination, exercise and nutrition education, a spiritual assessment, and goal-setting for the next five years.  Kempsville Presbyterian Church in Virginia Beach, Va., offers a burned-out or fired minister employment at odd jobs while he considers a new career or a return to the pulpit.  The Episcopal Diocese of North Carolina has a resource manual for ministers and their families that offers information and phone numbers for support and mental health groups. <P> <B>Roman Catholic priest Charles Fiore denied that he encouraged a man to falsely accuse</B> Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of sexual abuse, news reports said.  Bernardin suggested in memoirs published after his death that a right-leaning priest, whom he did not identify, may have urged Steven Cook to sue Bernardin in 1993 for sexual abuse.  Fiore said he is the one the cardinal was referring to. <P> <B>President Clinton will ask Congress to speed up spending on overseas family planning</B> programs, news reports said.  Clinton wants Congress to advance by four months the monthly installments for spending $385 million to distribute condoms, IUDs, and birth-control pills.  Congressional votes on the measure could come as early as Feb. 11. <P> <B>Gambling in California costs society $5 billion a year</B> in lost work, family breakups, crimes, and other problems, according to a report today by the California Research Bureau.  There are 400,000 gambling addicts in the state, including 60,000 or more who are under 21 years of age, the report said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 29, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Africa's worst humanitarian disaster looms in Zaire</B> as more than half a million people roam the bush in search of food, water, and safety. Aid workers say 400,000 refugees packed Mugunga camp, near Goma, and an additional 200,000 are arriving.  <BR><B>...Mugunga has become the largest refugee camp in the world</B>, U.N. spokesperson Sylvana Foa said. The camp is built on a volcanic rock, so adding more latrines and water &quot;is a nightmare,&quot; she said. There also is a shortage of food and water. <BR><B>...The conflict between Zaire, Rwanda, and Burundi</B> threatens to engulf the entire Great Lakes region of central Africa. Zaire is trying to evict the Banyamulenge Tutsis, and accuses Tutsi regimes in neighboring Rwanda and Burundi of helping the Banyamulenge. <P> <B>A group of Kenyan Christians made a four-week visit to Richmond, Va.,</B> on behalf of their forefathers, who sold their relatives to slavetraders, YWAM International News Digest said. Members of the group prayed at the site of slave auctions and visited the urban poor. The group said it was motivated by the story of Joseph, whose brothers sold him into slavery. They prayed that God would exchange the bad for good, as He did with Joseph. <P>   <P> <B>Cuban President Fidel Castro met with visiting Vatican Foreign Minister Jean Louis Tauran</B> on Monday. Tauran's five-day visit reflects improved relations between Cuba and the Roman Catholic Church and could be a prelude to a meeting between Castro and Pope John Paul, news reports said. <P> <B>Approximately 5,000 people are working long hours in a Lancaster, Pa., warehouse</B> Oct. 21-Nov. 2 to assemble thousands of packages containing school supplies. The items will be delivered to Russian children in orphanages, schools, and hospitals. Each package also contains a 90-day supply of vitamins, a Bible storybook, and a copy of evangelist Josh McDowell's book <I>More Than A Carpenter</I>. The effort, called Operation Carelift '97, is sponsored by Dallas-based Josh McDowell Ministry.   <P> <B>Jews in Dresden, Germany, plan to build a $13 million synagogue</B> near the site of one destroyed by the Nazis on &quot;Kristallnacht,&quot; the infamous night of broken glass. On Nov. 9, 1938, the Nazis looted 7,000 Jewish shops and burned hundreds of synagogues across Germany. About 130 Jews live in Dresden, compared with 6,000 at the start of the 1930s. <P> <B>Russia is giving the Holocaust Museum in Washington copies of documents</B> containing details of  Nazi atrocities. The 15,000 pages of documents detail Soviet investigations and trials of German defendants and their collaborators from 1946 to 1949. Also, there are excerpts from Soviet field reports of  atrocities behind German lines. <P> <B>Christians are giving Jews in Ukraine free bus rides</B> from their hometowns to airports where they can fly to Israel. In five years, the Exobus Project has helped 19,000 Jews leave Ukraine for Israel. Twenty full-time volunteers from 11 nations are active in the ministry.  <P> <B>  </B> <P> <B>Church leaders in Australia are trying to calm an increasingly heated national argument over race</B> and immigration. Asian-Australians are being spat on as they walk down the street, and one town mayor called children of inter-racial marriages &quot;mongrels,&quot; news reports said. Sydney's Anglican Archbishop Harry Goodhew urged political leaders to defuse and resolve the situation. Asians make up 4.5% of the 18 million population and constitute a quarter of the 100,000 migrants each year.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 25, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Thirty-eight percent of American adults and 43% of registered voters say they are &quot;born-again&quot; Christians</B>, according to a Barna Research Group poll. Evangelicals make up 8% of the population and 7% of  registered voters, the poll found. Barna defined &quot;born-again&quot; Christians as those who say they have made a personal commitment to Christ and believe they will go to heaven. Evangelicals were described as those who say they are born again and believe the Bible is totally accurate. Those who described themselves as theological liberals make up 39% of the population, Barna said. <P> <B>In Romania, 438 people made professions of faith in Christ this summer</B> during evangelistic efforts by eight American Protestants. Organized by evangelist Mark Puckett of Houston, the Americans led several crusades and visited homes in the Filipesti region. Puckett, who has visited the Eastern European nation several times, said Protestants there are becoming more assertive in evangelism, but are concerned about a Parliamentiary proposal to make the Orthodox Church the state denomination. That would nullify the rights of some three million evangelicals, he said. <P> <B>The Roman Catholic Church is beginning a special effort to reach out to Generation X.</B> The National Conference of Catholic Bishops in the United States suggested that parishes telephone, write, or e-mail young adults to invite them to church. Parishes should start small groups for young adults, preach on issues of importance to them, and encourage older adults to mentor younger members, the bishops said. <P> <B>Poland has liberalized its abortion law.  </B>The lower house of  Parliament passed a bill Thursday overthrowing a Senate veto, and ex-communist President Aleksander Kwasniewski said he will sign it into law. The new law will allow women to have an abortion before the 12th week if they face financial or personal problems. Women considering abortion must receive counseling and take three days for reflection. Under Poland's old law, abortion was legal only if a pregnancy threatened a woman's life or health, resulted from rape or incest, or resulted in a hopelessly damaged fetus. <P> <B>The Barbie doll has competition in Iran</B>. The Islamic republic's new &quot;Sarah&quot; doll doesn't flaunt her figure in a Western-style bathing suit, but wears modest, flowing robes. Iran's version of  &quot;Ken&quot; is &quot;Dara,&quot; her brother, who wears the garb of an Islamic cleric. Although importing Barbie dolls is prohibited, dozens of Tehran shops sell Barbies -- some in swimsuits -- news reports said. <P> <B>Jets flown by the radical Islamic Taleban pounded mud homes in a village</B> north of  Kabul Thursday, killing at least 20 people, including children. The Taleban also demonstrated their loathing of alcohol by using a battle tank to crush hundreds of cans of beer, sending streams of  foam over bystanders, news reports said. <P> <B>An AIDS-awareness program that focuses on Jesus Christ as the only answer</B> to the deadly disease is opening doors for the gospel in South Africa. Vern Tisdalle, an Assemblies of  God missionary, said Soweto officials asked him to present the program to students and government workers, the denomination said. Many listened intently and wanted to learn more about the gospel. &quot;Non-Christian leadership is begging for answers to a human tragedy for which they have no answers,&quot; Tisdalle said.  <P> <B>Harold Hughes, who left the U.S. Senate to devote himself to religious work</B> and help alcoholics, died at age 74. Hughes was a former truck driver who overcame alcoholism to become a three-term Democratic governor and U.S. senator. <P> <B>North Korea said Carl Hunziker, an American jailed on spying charges</B>, is not a Christian missionary as he claims because he does not know hymns, the Ten Commandments, or how to pray. North Korea said Hunziker's situation would worsen if the United States does not apologize. The State Department says Hunziker, 26, is not a spy, but inadvertently strayed into North Korea while on a visit to China. <BR><B>...Hunziker has signed a confession</B>, Reuters news service said. If convicted, he faces a possible death sentence. <P> <B>A judge upheld a New York City zoning law barring sex shops from certain areas</B>. Restricting peep shows, nude bars, and other adult businesses to some sections of the city does not hinder free speech, said Justice Marylin Diamond of the state Supreme Court. The restrictions could close down 85% of the city's X-rated businesses, lawyers said. The limitations bar sex shops from within 500 feet of schools, day care centers, houses of worship, and new residential areas.    </font></p>

The corpses are being used without the knowledge or consent of relatives, the study said. <BR><B>...Some 46% of hospitals in Australia and New Zealand accredited to train doctors in emergency medicine</B> had used the bodies of newly deceased  patients in teaching resuscitation skills, and none had obtained consent from relatives, the study said. About three-quarters of respondents said the practice was ethical. There are no laws to stop the practice on patients whose deaths did not have to be reported to the coroner, <I>The Sydney Morning Herald</I> reported. <BR><B>...Previous studies had found up to 40% of  hospitals in the United States engaged in the practice,</B>  although objections had been raised on religious, ethical, and legal grounds, according to the researchers, Corinne Ginifer and Anne-Maree Kelly of the Western Hospital in Melbourne. <P> <B>More than 100 lepers who converted to Christianity during their treatment</B> at a Christian clinic in Niger have become full-time missionaries, the missions group SIM said. Many former patients of the Danja Health Center in southern Niger are preaching while working in the mission hospital, Mission Network News said. <P> <B>The U.S. Postal Service is issuing a stamp to commemorate Hanukah</B>, the Jewish festival of lights. It is the first in a series of  &quot;holiday celebration&quot; stamps that will include secular and religious holidays. For 34 years, Christmas was the only religious holiday recognized by a stamp. Jewish groups have lobbied for a Hanukah stamp for many years, <I>The Washington Post</I> reported. <BR><B>...Critics say that, since it is impossible to issue a stamp for every religious group in America</B>, issuing any stamps with religious themes implies preferential treatment for certain faiths and violates the principle of the separation of church and state. <P> <B>Orthodox Jews in Israel will surf on a kosher Internet</B>. Observant Jews have produced a kosher version of the Internet that shelters them from anything offensive, <I>The Jerusalem Post</I> said. Five young religious men examine the content of web pages and decide whether to include them in Toranet, administered by an Israeli company of the same name. Subscribers will see no photographs of women; they will be able to correspond by e-mail with Orthodox rabbis. <P> <B>American Indian creationism, which rejects the theory of evolution</B> in favor of the Native American explanations of  human origins, is gaining political clout, <I>The New York Times</I> reported. <BR><B>...Indian tribes have blocked archeological research</B> on hundreds of prehistoric skeletons. Under the federal repatriation act of 1990, negotiation between tribes and federal agencies -- rather than the law -- determine who gets ancestral bones. Most Indians say they do not need science to study their origins because their creation accounts tell them where they came from, <I>The Times</I> said.  <P> <B>The Mobile Bible Institute is bringing a seminary to Christians in rural Honduras</B>, according to Mission Network News. The institute has two locations and 105 students. A third program is beginning in El Salvador. The Institute is run by Birmingham, Ala.-based World Reach. <P> <B>German Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats pledged to put the Church of Scientology under surveillance</B> and bar its members from public service, Reuters news service said. A resolution passed by the political party called for a national information network to track the group's activities and to warn Germans against joining it. Germany has refused to register The Church of Scientology as a religion, instead considering it a tyrannical, manipulative money-maker. The U.S.-based Church of Scientology compared the Christian Democrats' resolution to the Nazis' strictures against the Jews. <P> <B>Bob Dole failed to mobilize evangelical Christians in his final debate with President Clinton Oct. 16</B>, religious conservatives said. The GOP candidate did not answer adequately when asked how he would return the country to godly principles, and did not explain why he described homosexual rights as &quot;special rights,&quot; Baptist Press quoted several prominent conservatives as saying. Dole also failed to mention partial-birth abortion, even though he said he would do so.<BR>  <P> <B>Some Christians are fair-weather friends and hypocrites</B>, Tammy Fae Messner says. In her new book, <I>Tammy: Telling It My Way </I>(Villard), the former wife of Jim Bakker says many friends did not stand by the couple during their troubles after the collapse of the PTL ministry. She told <I>USA Today</I> that &quot;Christians don't walk their talk.&quot; Pastors, in particular, &quot;can be the most judgmental people in the world.&quot; Messner said she has &quot;grown up a lot&quot; and no longer is &quot;looking at the world through rose-colored glasses.&quot; <P> <B>Many Orthodox Christians in Romania are too poor to die</B>. Traditional Orthodox burials -- including lavish feats -- average $900 in the nation, where the average monthly salary is $100, according to the daily <I>Cronica Romana</I> of Bucharest. <P> <B>Sweden's national social insurance has allowed a lesbian policewoman to take paternity leave</B>, Reuters news service said. The woman's partner gave birth last winter to a daughter, conceived by artificial insemination. <P> <B>A drunken driver was given 16 years in prison for causing the death of  a baby</B> delivered prematurely after a June 15 crash. Frank Flores Cuellar was found guilty of manslaughter in Corpus Christi, Texas. Krystal Zuniga was delivered shortly after the accident, then died a few hours later. <BR><B>...The case tested whether a Texas citizen can be held criminally liable for harming an unborn child.</B> Several states have laws allowing the relatives of unborn children to sue in criminal cases, The Associated Press said. Similar legislation has been proposed in Texas.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 20, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Residents of predominantly Muslim Kyrgyzstan are accepting the gospel</B>, reports say.  The central Asian republic is located on China's western border below Kazakhstan.  There are hundreds of new Christians in this country of more than 2.3 million.  The New Testament has been translated into Kyrgyz and the Old Testament translation is in progress.  A worker with New Tribes Mission said several mountain villages have &quot;heard a clear presentation of the gospel through Kyrgyz believers, who were among the first ones to clearly understand and believe....They are going out as disciples with a firm understanding of the gospel,&quot; <I>Global Prayer Digest</I> reported. <BR><B>...The Bible is being distributed widely in Kazakhstan</B>, another Muslim country.  More than 50,000 children's Bibles have been distributed to Kazak schools in one province, where it is being used as a text for reading, according to<I> Global Prayer Digest.</I> Bookstores bought 40,000 Bibles and are distributing them throughout the country.  The Kazaks also ordered 70,000 books containing illustrated Bible stories for their schools.  Although many Christians are persecuted and pressured to deny their faith, 700 people became Christians last year in one Kazak church alone, reports said. <P> <B>A magazine that is planned, written, and produced by homeless</B> <B>people</B> is being distributed in Montevideo, Uruguay.  <I>Sirve</I>, a 24-page magazine, is financed by Christians and sponsored by various Uruguayan churches, according to the Latin American and Caribbean Communication Agency.  The magazine's purpose is to give a voice to the homeless.  Stories, poems and drawings deal with life on the street. <P> <B>A United Methodist Church school for training urban ministry workers</B> opens in Mansfield, Ohio, this week.  The program has attracted 120 local clergy and laity from 40 churches and mission organizations.  The two-year school, called Holy Boldness Academy, is to be a prototype for other such UMC schools. <BR><B>...Initial classes focuses on building the spiritual maturity </B>of those who will minister in cities.  Then, students develop skills in building relationships with churches, residents, business leaders, and others in the community, and learn to develop resources and leaders. <P> <B>The relief agency World Vision helped 400 families in Ecuador end their alcoholism</B>.  Some people in the village of Tilivi had started small businesses selling liquor.  Many families sold their farm animals and land to get alcohol, and more than 1,000 children suffered from malnutrition and violence at the hands of their parents. <BR><B>...After World Vision began community development projects and evangelization</B> in Tilivi, the three main wholesalers of alcohol became Christians and smashed their warehouses in front of the villagers as a testimony to their conversion.  Within a few years, the community became an evangelization center for the region. <P> <B>International aid workers in Rwanda are meeting today to decide whether to suspend their efforts</B> in some parts of the country after three Spanish colleagues were shot to death by Hutu rebels.  During the attack, American citizen Nitin Madhav of Pittsburgh was shot in the leg.  His leg was amputated, and he was flown to Kigali and evacuated to Kenya for further treatment. <P> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court is reassessing the constitutionality of sending public school teachers</B> into parochial schools to give remedial help to students.  The court agreed Friday to consider appeals by New York City school officials and parents of parochial school students.  In New York, such remedial help has been offered since 1985 in mobile vans parked near parochial schools or at some other off-campus facility.  A 1985 Supreme Court decision did not ban public school teachers from helping parochial students, but it barred public school teachers from church-affiliated schools.  Arguments will be heard in April, and a decision is expected by July.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 2, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A 155-foot, $3-million, stainless steel statue of Jesus Christ</B> will be built next spring near Louisville, Ky., <I>USA Today</I> said. The statue, which will reveal no gender or race, will be part of  a $13 million spiritual complex that its owners, the Waverly Hope Foundation, hope will draw 1 million visitors a year. The idea was inspired by the 120-foot statue of Christ in Rio de Janiero, Brazil. <P>   <P> <B>Switzerland is trying to find out if it still holds money that belongs to Jews killed by the Nazis</B>. The Swiss lower house of parliament created a panel of experts to account for Switzerland's financial dealings with the Nazis and determine whether the Swiss have done enough to identify the lost assets of those killed in the Holocaust, Reuters said. Newly declassified U.S. wartime archives increased speculation that Switzerland could still be holding Nazi gold or millions of dollars in assets from people who perished during Hitler's reign of terror. <BR><B>...Some historians say the Swiss were spared a Nazi invasion</B> in part because they provided monetary services to the Nazis. Swiss gold purchases were a crucial source of funds to finance the Nazi war effort. Others see the move as  part of an attempt by London and New York financiers to dull Switzerland's competitive edge as an international financial center. <P> <B>In Britain, Holocaust disbelievers could face prison</B>. The Labour party wants to make denial of the Holocaust a criminal offense punishable by two years in prison, the <I>London Times</I> reported. The party wants to muffle right-wing intellectuals and political campaigners who claim the Holocaust never happened or that Hitler was unaware of its extent. Opponents of  the legislation say such restrictions on freedom of speech would increase racial tensions in Britain and play into the hands of extremists by attracting sympathy for their cause. <P> <B>Burma's military government arrested 500 pro-democracy supporters and warned Buddhist clergy</B> to stay away from others in the movement. The government is worried that the monks, who have supported pro-democracy movements in the past, may do so again. The military kept roads to democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi's home in Rangoon closed and prevented the Nobel Peace laureate from convening a pro-democracy meeting, the Associated Press reported. <BR><B>...Many monks were killed in 1988 when the military regime took power</B>. In 1990, monks protested the junta's activities by declining to perform religious rites for members of  the military regime. Dissidents released from a Burmese prison have reported that 200 monks are being held. Troops reportedly have arrested pro-democracy activists staying at monastery guest houses. <P> <B>Amnesty International says rights abuses abound in Turkey</B>. The London-based human rights group issued a report exposing what it called Turkey's failure to prevent torture, extrajudicial killings, and the phenomenon of  suspects &quot;disappearing&quot; in detention. Turkish leaders, judges, and physicians have ignored abuses by Turkey's security forces, Amnesty said.  <BR><B>...Amnesty accused the West of not pushing NATO-member Turkey hard enough on human rights</B>. The West is afraid of upsetting an ally in a troubled region, the report said. <P> <B>British parents are resorting to fraud, blackmail, and financial threats</B> to get their children into church schools, a London television news show said. According to Channel 4's <I>Witness</I>, parents are joining churches, then threatening to withdraw their financial support unless the minister allows their children into the church's school. Some schools have set up a points system, requiring parents to attend services regularly with their children in order to get their child into the school. Parents blame poor education for a decline in moral and spiritual values, and the demand for church schools has increased rapidly, the <I>London Times</I> said. <P> <B>Poland may liberalize its abortion law, ignoring the Roman Catholic Church</B>, the <I>Chicago Tribune</I> reported. The lower house of  Poland's parliament voted  208-61 to legalize abortion for women who live in &quot;difficult living conditions&quot; or where they have other important personal reasons. The upper house of the Sejm will consider the bill this week.  <BR><B>...Under communism, abortion was freely available,</B> but when the church-backed Solidarity movement overthrew the country, Poland's bishops succeeded in getting one of Europe's most restrictive pro-life laws passed. Now reformed communists have returned to power. Pope John Paul II said this development in his native land has caused him great personal anguish, the newspaper reported. Surveys show a majority of Poles favor liberalization of abortion laws. <P> <B>The Norman Vincent Peale Center for Christian Living is a veritable &quot;prayer factory,&quot;</B> the <I>New York Times</I> said. The center, which was founded in New York in 1940 and moved  to Pawling, N.Y., in 1952, has a prayer administrator and 240 Prayer Partners, located on and off the site. They handle 3,000 prayer requests a week. Peale wrote the author of the 1952 inspirational classic <I>The Power of Positive Thinking.</I> <P> <B>D. James Kennedy has started an organization to mobilize conservative Christians.</B> The Center for Reclaiming America will not support specific candidates or political parties, the group said. Founded by the television pastor's Coral Ridge Ministries, the group will track policies, draft legislation, and encourage volunteers to lobby lawmakers. Its constituency will overlap somewhat with the Christian Coalition, but the groups will complement rather than compete with each other, the center said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 13, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Mother Teresa, who suffered a heart attack last month, is stepping down as head of the Missionaries of Charity, </B>the order she started 47 years ago, The Associated Press reported.  A replacement is to be elected next month.  The Missionaries of Charity has 4,000 nuns and runs 517 orphanages, homes for the poor, AIDS hospices, and other charity centers around the world.   <P> <B>South Carolina will become the first state to bring homicide charges</B> against doctors who perform partial-birth abortions, according to state attorney general Charlie Condon.  Citing the state's  Supreme Court ruling in July that a viable fetus is a person, Condon said doctors could face life in prison for performing such abortions, UPI reported.  &quot;I am placing the physicians of South Carolina on notice.  This office will not stand idly by and tolerate this form of infanticide,&quot; he said. <P> <B>Promise Keepers took a stand against Mormonism</B> in its official magazine, <I>New Man</I>.  PK published an article last year by Craig Branch of Watchman Fellowship, a counter-cult ministry, that describes the doctrinal errors of Mormonism, Jehovah's Witnesses, and the New Age Movement. <BR><B>...The men's ministry has begun to form working relationships</B> with several Protestant denominations to encourage the growth of local men's ministries.  PK formed a partnership with the Assemblies of God and the International Pentecostal Holiness Church, and reportedly is discussing plans with at least four other groups.     <P> <B>The second annual Reconciliation Sunday, Jan. 19</B>, is being organized by the National Black Evangelical Association and the National Association of Evangelicals.  The event is a way for members of various racial and ethnic groups to show support and love for one another, the groups said.  For information, contact the <A HREF=http://www.nae.net/intro.html>National Association of Evangelicals </A>, P.O. Box 28, Wheaton, IL 60189. <BR><B>...Six practical steps for achieving racial reconciliation</B>, according to the groups, are: <OL> <LI> Hold a racial reconciliation service each year. <LI> Form a racial reconciliation task force to educate and activate your church. <LI> Begin a friendship with an individual of another race. <LI> Adopt a &quot;sister church&quot; of a different race. <LI> Commit to persistent prayer for reconciliation. <LI> Adopt a statement on racism similar to the 1991 NAE/NBEA Statement of Affirmation.   </OL> <B>Church property cannot be part of evangelist Robert Tilton's pending divorce case</B>, a Dallas court ruled.  Lawyers for Tilton's second wife, Leigh Valentine Tilton, argued that assets of the Word of Faith World Outreach Center in Farmers Branch should be part of the divorce case since Leigh claimed she became a co-pastor.  The church has assets estimated at $25 million to $30 million, according to <I>The Dallas Morning News</I>. <P> <B>Sri Lankan Catholic priest Tissa Balasuriya</B> said his excommunication by the Vatican last week is null and void because he never committed heresy.  &quot;I have never denied, rejected, or deviated from any doctrine of the Catholic faith,&quot; he said.  The dispute stems from the 1990 book <I>Mary and Human Liberation</I> in which Balasuriya, a priest for 51 years, challenges the doctrines of baptism, original sin, and immaculate conception.  He said he has appealed the decision to the Vatican's supreme ecclesiastical court and will launch an international signature campaign for Pope John Paul II to withdraw the excommunication. <P> <B>The Dalai Lama is planning to visit Taiwan in the spring</B>.  The trip by Tibetan Buddhism's exiled god-king will almost certainly anger Beijing.  Taiwan and the Dalai Lama deny advocating independence for their territories, but denounce Beijing's authoritarian rule.  Tibet has been under army-backed rule since a failed uprising in 1959 forced the Dalai Lama and thousands of followers into exile in India. <P> <B>Police stopped a group of students from distributing condoms in St. Peter's Square</B> during Pope John Paul's address Sunday.  The students were demonstrating in support of a decision by students, teachers, and parents of a secondary school in northern Turin to install a condom vending machine to help fight the spread of AIDS.  The Catholic Church asserts that the only way to stop the disease's spread is through abstinence from premarital sex and monogamy within heterosexual marriage. <P> <B>Officials in central China issued a plan to stamp out worship</B> by the underground Catholic church loyal to Rome, according to The Cardinal Kung Foundation, a U.S.-based Catholic group that monitors religious persecution in China.  A Communist Party document was issued by officials of Chongren county in central Jiangxi, according to the foundation, which obtained a copy. <BR><B>...The plan spells out actions including public relations, registering and setting up</B> a file for each religious believer for local and transient Catholics, and forcing each underground Catholic to write a letter denying their faith and to join the official church.  The plan was to be implemented from Nov. 25, 1996, to March 31, 1997. <P> <B>Spirituality is important in losing weight</B>, according to a woman who developed a program followed in thousands of churches.  Gwen Shamblin, who developed the Weigh Down Workshop, directs a staff of 55 in Franklin, Tenn.  The organization distributes Shamblin's videotapes and videocassettes, and counsels individuals who call on a toll-free telephone line.  Several thousand groups in the North America, Europe, and Asia have taken her 12-week course, Ecumenical News International reported. <BR><B>...Shamblin condemns most diet plans as legalistic regulations</B>.  Instead, people should eat what they want, but merely stop eating when full.  Those who find themselves eating to satisfy an emotional need should &quot;turn to God and ask Him to fill your heart with something better than ice cream,&quot; she said.   <BR><B>...&quot;God did not put chocolate or lasagna or real blue cheese dressing</B> on earth to torture us, but rather for our enjoyment,&quot; Shamblin writes.  &quot;However, he wants us to learn how to rise above the magnetic pull of the refrigerator so that food does not consume our lives.&quot;    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 3, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>The archbishop of Canterbury, George Carey,</B> is in Rome for meetings with Pope John Paul II. Discussions between Carey, spiritual leader of the world's 70 million Anglicans, and the Pope are expected to include differences over women priests and papal authority. <BR><B>...In 1995, the Pope said in an encyclical that, for the sake of unity,</B> he was willing to seek accommodation with other denominations on the role of the papacy. The Pope said, however, that Rome would have to hold the primary place among Christians. He reiterated the position in remarks in a speech Monday. <P> <B>Two imprisoned church leaders have been released in Uzbekistan</B>. Twelve days after the arrest of 64 Christians in Tashkent, authorities released a Pentecostal pastor and his assistant, who had been given jail sentences for holding worship services without government permission, Compass Direct reported. Pastor Dennis Podorozhny of the Word of Faith Church and Lev Folkovitch were released in late November. The other 62 Christians were released a few hours after their arrest. <BR><B>...In the past few months, secret police in Tashkent have interrogated other Christian workers</B>, threatening them with fines, imprisonment, and death for doing missionary work among the Uzbek people, who are Muslims, Compass Direct reported. <P> <B>An Egyptian convert from Islam has been imprisoned for two months.</B> Mohammed Wajdi Mohammed Dura, 22, was arrested Oct. 3 for &quot;promoting ideas that disturb the security of Egyptian society,&quot; according to Compass Direct news service. He is incarcerated in the Tanta Prison 25 miles north of Cairo, his attorney, Morris Sadek, said. A court hearing is scheduled for Dec. 9.  <BR><B>...Dura had been arrested twice previously by security police</B>, who accused him of &quot;instigating dissension between Muslims and Christians.&quot; On both occasions, Dura was kicked, slapped, burned, and hung by his hands, he said. Dura reportedly refused to agree to spy for the security police against other Egyptian citizens who have left Islam and become Christians. <BR><B>...Dura, a former law student, was studying in an informal Bible school program</B> at the time of his third arrest. His family also has been harassed, prompting his father and brothers to apply for jobs abroad, one source told Compass. <P> <B>Prison Fellowship International is sending volunteer workers on short-term projects at prisons worldwide</B>. Volunteers from the First Presbyterian Church of  Houston, Texas, recently helped rebuild roofs on a nursery and infirmary at Santa Monica Women's Prison in Lima, Peru<B>,</B> a facility where children live with their mothers. <BR><B>...More than 80 Santa Monica inmates packed the chapel for a worship service</B> during which volunteers and inmates shared music and personal testimonies. Volunteers donated money and each of the inmates received a Bible with their name on it. Two more Prison Fellowship teams left in November for a medical project in Zambia and a construction project in Namibia. <P> <B>Eighty members of China's underground Roman Catholic Church were arrested, beaten, and jailed</B> Nov. 14, according to the Cardinal Kung Foundation. The arrests, which occurred in the eastern Chinese city of Linchuan, are meant to discourage church members from holding an outdoor Mass at Christmas, the Stamford, Conn.-based group said. Some 20,000 underground Catholics gather on Yujia Mountain for important church holidays; authorities often break up the worship services, arresting many. <BR><B>...Five thousand troops destroyed a shrine to Mary in Hubei,</B> in central China, earlier this year and sealed the village to keep out pilgrims, the foundation said. <P> <B>The manager of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn's pension office</B>, who admitted stealing more than $1 million, has accepted a deal that will require her to pay all the money back, prosecutors said. Vincenza Bologna, 53, a church employee for more than 30 years, will avoid prison time under the arrangement. <P> <B>A religious service was held at a dock in Brazil where, for 300 years, millions of Africans arrived for slavery</B>. The Nov. 30 service, held in the city of Salvador during a World Council of Churches conference, included African American spirituals, African and Brazilian music, and rhythmic drumming. Salvador was Brazil's main slave port, the point of arrival starting in 1550 for 6-12 million Africans forced to work on sugar cane plantations. <BR><B>...Ten times more slaves were shipped to Brazil than to the United States.</B> The slave trade to Brazil was abolished in 1854, but the use of slave labor continued until 1888. Descendants of slaves now make up 60% of the population of Salvador. <BR><B>...The death rate for Brazil-bound slaves was so high</B> (about 40% died in the ships' hulls) that in 1860 Brazil's black population was half the size of that in the United States. The slaves were collectively baptized by priests, thus increasing their value, Ecuemnical News International said. <BR><B>...&quot;Words cannot express what this moment means to us,&quot;</B>said Janice Nessibou, a  Presbyterian from Ghana. &quot;The water of this ocean carried the slaves from Africa to Brazil; this sea gathered their tears,&quot; said Kwame Labi, an Orthodox priest from Ghana.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 22, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Several groups are fostering biblical ethics in Hollywood</B>. Entertainment Fellowship, founded in 1993 by actor Robert Hanley, helps actors and actresses &quot;recognize and apply Judeo-Christian principles into their careers,&quot; <I>The Washington Times</I> said. Other groups promoting spiritual values are Actor's Co-Op, Arts and Entertainment Ministry, Open Call, Inter-Mission, Master Media International, and Associates in Media. <P> <B>A little money and a lot of caring is going a long way in Madagascar, </B>where some of the world's poorest people live. Thousands of residents of the island, located off the east coast of Africa, were left homeless and destitute in 1993 by Cyclone Geraldo. Many in the country, where the average monthly income is less than $20, were driven to begging or prostitution, Baptist Press said. <BR><B>...After the cyclone, 180 homeless families created the village of Amboanjobe</B>. Southern Baptist missionaries, hoping to help the residents become self-supporting, used relief funds to give each family a $10 credit toward the purchase of animals such as chickens, ducks, or turkeys. Some families pooled their credits to buy a sheep or pig. Now a herd of dairy cows provides milk to improve the diets of children and a new biogas plant uses cow manure to produce gas to cook meals.  <BR><B>...Some of the families have become Christians and formed a congregation.</B> Members of the new church began going door-to-door sharing the gospel with every family in the village, resulting in 40 decisions for Christ in one week. Now the congregation is turning its attention to other villages, some of which are controlled by witch doctors.  <P> <B>Evangelist Sammy Tippit, preaching in Cuba this week,</B> found a hunger there for spiritual things. Tippit, who received a visa to preach, spoke in several churches where numerous people made public commitments to Christ and &quot;many Christians prayed to God to do a deep work in their lives,&quot; he said. At one church, &quot;the people didn't want to leave. Finally, at 11 p.m., the pastor could tell we were exhausted and he dismissed the people.&quot; <BR><B>...Tippit also held a conference for pastors and their wives.</B> &quot;Pastors wept and shared how God had shown them sin in their lives and wrong relationships with their wives,&quot; Tippit said.  <P> <B>Mother Teresa was recovering Friday after suffering partial heart failure</B>. The Roman Catholic nun was rushed to a hospital in Calcutta, India, where her cardiologist said she suffered left ventricular failure. <P> <B>Shortly before his death last week, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin</B> completed a book about rediscovering the importance of prayer. <I>The Gift of Peace</I> will be published in January by Loyola Press. In it, Bernardin says that after lapsing in his prayer life for several years, he &quot;decided to give God the first hour of my day, no matter what, to be with Him in prayer and meditation where I would try to open the door even wider to His entrance.&quot; <P> <B>Gaylord Entertainment Co. will buy Word Records and Music</B> for $110 million from Thomas Nelson Inc., news reports said. Word's artists include Amy Grant, Shirley Caesar, Sandi Patty, Point of Grace, Petra, Jaci Velasquez, Anointed, and Crystal Lewis. Gaylords' other properties are cable networks The Nashville Network (TNN) and Country Music Television (CMT); the Grand Ole Opry; Opryland theme park; two television stations; and three radio stations. <P> <B>The Supreme Court of Canada rejected a demand by Jewish and Protestant </B>parents in Ontario to receive the same public funding for their schools as is given to Roman Catholic schools. The parents said the policy is an unconstitutional violation of their religious freedom and right to equality. But the court ruled that the constitution under which Canada was formed in 1867 guaranteed funding for Ontario's Catholic schools but not for any other religious groups in Ontario, according to Reuter news service. <P>   <P> <B>An American held on spy charges in North Korea might be coming home soon</B>. Rep. Bill Richardson, D-N.M., will travel to North Korea next week in an attempt to bring home Evan Hunziker of Tacoma, Wash., who was arrested in August after crossing into North Korea from China. Hunziker's family said he went to China as a missionary and they are not sure how he ended up in North Korea. In 1994, Richardson negotiated the release of two U.S. helicopter pilots shot down over North Korea. <P> <B>Dutch theologian Jan Veenhof has been fired</B> by Calvin Seminary, where he had arrived this fall as a distinguished visiting professor of theology. The seminary's board of trustees dismissed Veenhof  for his pro-homosexual views, United Reformed News Service reported. Veenhof had been a parish pastor at a Swiss Reformed Church at Basel and a professor of theology at the Free University of Amsterdam, one of the most prestigious positions in the Christian Reformed denomination's &quot;mother church&quot; in the Netherlands.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 28, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>The Roman Catholic Church believes in the possibility of communication with the dead,</B> according to one of its spokesmen.  &quot;Communication is possible between those who live on this Earth and those who live in a state of eternal repose, in heaven or purgatory,&quot; said Rev. Gino Concetti, chief theological commentator for the Vatican newspaper <I>L'Osservatore Romano</I>.  &quot;It may be that God lets our loved ones send us messages to guide us at certain moments in our life,&quot; he added.  The Church opposes the raising of spirits, the <I>London Observer</I> quoted Concetti as saying. <BR><B>...Dead relatives could be responsible for prompting impulses,</B> inspiration, and even dreams, Concetti said.  The remarks have caused interest in Italy, where mediums, tarot readers, and astrologers flourish despite the Church's disapproval. <P> <B>A national association of black churches has begun a three-year, $12-million campaign</B> to rebuild burned churches in the South.  The Congress of National Black Churches Inc., which represents 65,000 churches and 20 million people, said it also will lead efforts to prevent further arson and run a reconciliation campaign in communities with burned churches.  Half the money will come from the Lilly Foundation and the rest from a fund-raising drive. <P> <B>The taping of a conversation between a priest and a murder suspect was illegal</B>, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled Monday.  The court said the taping violated the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which restricts a state's right to infringe on the exercise of religion.  The taping also violated the participants' freedom of religion, the court ruled.  It barred any further recordings of discussions between inmates and clergy. <BR><B>...But the court refused to order destruction of the tape,</B> which records a conversation between Rev. Timothy Mockaitis and Conan Hale at a Eugene, Ore., jail, last April.  That left open the possibility the tape could be used at Hale's trial for the shooting deaths of three teen-agers. <P> <B>Florida Gov. Lawton Chiles vetoed a school prayer bill</B> the Legislature passed last year.  The legislation would have allowed voluntary, student-led, nonsectarian prayer at nonmandatory extracurricular events such as football games and graduation ceremonies.  Chiles said he was concerned that students who choose not to participate in prayer could be ostracized by classmates. <P> <B>Promise Keepers has set the date for its long-planned mass gathering of men</B> in Washington, D.C.  The event will be held from noon to sundown Saturday, Oct. 4, on the Mall between the U.S. Capitol and the Lincoln Memorial, the men's ministry announced.  It will be called &quot;Stand in the Gap: A Sacred Assembly of Men.&quot; <P> <B>Thirty outdoor advertising companies nationwide are donating 2,100 billboards</B> to Focus On the Family to help spread its pro-family message.  The idea was started by Atlanta billboard company owner Charles Renfroe, who attended a retreat last year put on by the Colorado Springs, Colo.-based ministry. Renfroe encouraged other ad firms to donate their signs as well.  The messages began Monday on billboards in 120 cities.  They show families happily spending time together.  One says, &quot;My husband works the night shift&quot; and shows a man feeding a baby while the mother sleeps. <P> <B>Pope John Paul II plans to visit Lebanon</B> May 10-11.  It will be the pontiff's first official visit to the country.  An estimated 30% of Lebanon's 4 million people are Christians. <P> <B>Churchgoers in Leon, Spain, can charge donations on their credit cards.  </B>A shoebox-sized machine installed on a wall inside the San Claudio Catholic Church works like an automatic teller machine.  Donors insert a credit card, but instead of receiving cash, the person operating the machine types in the amount of the gift and gives out a receipt for the tax-deductible donation.    </font></p>

They called for compassion and racial harmony. <BR><B>...Australia recently has had a record number of complaints of racial discrimination.</B> The nation's 300,000 Aborigines are the most disadvantaged group, with a life expectancy 10-to-15 years shorter than non-indigenous people. Malaysians studying in Australia say they have been verbally assaulted and spat upon. The clergy also said gambling, domestic violence, and drug abuse was afflicting families, adding that 14% of Australian children live in poverty. <P> <B>Germany is warning its citizens to be wary of the Unification Church.</B> Adherents comply with Korean evangelist Sun Myung Moon's &quot;absolute authority,&quot; Family Affairs Minister Claudia Nolte said. &quot;Education, family and friends are often abandoned in favor of complete devotion to the sect. Immaturity and dependency are reinforced by the fact that members turn all their possessions over to the group.&quot; Moon was banned last year from entering Germany, where he has an estimated 1,000 followers. <BR><B>...Earlier this year, the German government issued a warning critical of the American-based Church of Scientology</B>. Scientology was criticized as a profit-making group relying on manipulation. Some German states have called for Scientology to be put under surveillance or for members to be banned from public service. <P> <B>A death row prisoner in Virginia who was given an 11th hour stay of execution</B> thanked Italy for championing his cause. Joseph O'Dell, who was convicted in a 1986 rape and murder, received appeals for clemency from the Vatican and Italian human rights groups and politicians, including Prime Minister Romano Prodi, who spoke to President Clinton about his case, <I>La Repubblica</I> newspaper reported. O'Dell's case has stirred passions in Italy, which is in the forefront of  international campaigns to end capital punishment. <BR><B>...O'Dell thanked the Italians for showing &quot;such compassion and love</B>. It's something I'm not used to seeing,&quot; he said. He claims new DNA evidence casts doubt on his murder conviction. <P> <B>Job bias has become a crime in Cleveland</B>. The City Council passed an ordinance making it a misdemeanor punishable by a jail term and fine to refuse to hire or promote someone because of  &quot;race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, national origin, age, disability, ethnic group&quot; or disabled veteran status. It is believed to be the first such ordinance in the nation. &quot;Civil penalties have not been enough to stem the tide of discrimination,&quot; said the ordinance's sponsor, Councilman Bill Patmon. <P> <B>Turkey's deputy prime minister has ordered casinos shut down</B>. The order was in line with efforts by the Islamic-led government to curtail gambling, which Islam regards as a sin. Casinos, located in major hotels, provide tourist income. <P> <B>The nation's largest private social services network</B> responded to almost as many requests for emergency help in 1995 as it did in 1994, even though the economy improved during that period. Catholic Charities USA reported it assisted 10.7 million people in 1995, including 7.1 million who needed emergency food, shelter, and clothing. In 1994, the charity aided 11.1 million people, including 7.2 million who needed emergency help. More than half of those seeking emergency help were not on welfare. <P> <B>Billy Graham will use the Internet to communicate with new believers.</B> In addition to calling a telephone number shown on the TV screen, viewers can report their decisions to follow Christ, receive spiritual counseling, or request follow-up materials after a crusade telecast by visiting <A HREF= http://www.billygraham.org >Graham's site.</A> Visitors can pick from nine interactive blocks addressing different needs.    </font></p>

Hundreds of businesses in Iran have foreign names, and many foreign words have no Farsi equivalent. Iran's Muslim government last year banned satellite antennas that can receive foreign television programs. <P> <B>Approximately 10,000 ultra-Orthodox Jews staged a rally </B>in Tel Aviv, Israel, demanding nightclubs, stores, and movie theaters close on the Jewish Sabbath. Rabbi Ovadia Yosef said Sabbath-desecraters should be executed, and other speakers called for a boycott of companies that run television ads on the Sabbath. <BR><B>...Some Israelis feel threatened by the power of ultra-Orthodox Jews</B>, who gained political influence in elections last May. Since then, a government commission in Jerusalem recommended that a highway be closed during Sabbath prayer hours; the Supreme Court upheld a ban on the import of pork; and &quot;modesty squads&quot; have attacked women they considered to be scantily dressed. <P> <B>An anonymous donor dropped a gold coin into a Salvation Army kettle</B> in Chicago this week, continuing a Christmas tradition dating to 1982. The 1996 1-ounce U.S. gold coin is worth about $370. Last year, more than 25 gold items were found in kettles, and brought about $6,500 at an auction. Salvation Army officials think one donor made the early contribution and others have copied it. <P>   <P> <B>A day after he issued a ruling allowing homosexual marriages in Hawaii</B>, Circuit Court Judge Kevin Chang put the decision on hold while the state appeals to Hawaii's Supreme Court. Chang said there would be confusion if homosexual couples got married, then the court overturned his ruling.   <P>    <P> <B>China and the Vatican are trading words over the rights of religious believers.</B> Beijing today rejected  an appeal from Pope John Paul to legalize the Roman Catholic Church and allow its members to worship openly. A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said China wants better relations with the Vatican, but won't allow interference in its internal affairs. China allows Catholics to worship openly only if they belong to the Communist-backed Catholic Patriotic Association, which does not recognize the Pope's authority. <P> <B>The world's major nations have increasingly overlooked human rights</B> in foreign policy in order to promote trade or reflect political calculations, Human Rights Watch said Wednesday. The group said major powers, especially the United States, have been willing to exert economic pressure in the name of human rights on poor states such as Burundi, Cuba, Libya, or Sudan, but acquiesce in abuses by economically attractive countries such as China, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia for fear of losing access to lucrative markets. <BR><B>...&quot;Although few governments overtly jettisoned human rights concerns</B>, the major powers argued that the immediate defense of human rights must take a back seat to the creation of conditions that would supposedly, some day in the future, guarantee respect for basic civil and political rights,&quot; the 383-page report said. <P> <B>Abortion foe John Salvi, convicted for killing two clinic workers</B> and wounding five others, was buried Wednesday in Ipswich, Mass. Salvi, 24, apparently committed suicide last Friday in his prison cell in Walpole, Mass. Among the 80 mourners at St. Stanislaus Church was one of Salvi's victims, security guard Richard Serone, who said he blames &quot;the mental illness,&quot; not Salvi or his family, for what happened. <BR><B>...Massachusetts Gov. William Weld ordered an investigation into Salvi's death.</B> Salvi's parents said they want to know why their son was sent to a maximum security prison rather than to another prison where he could have received more mental health treatment. <P> <B>A supermarket tabloid says John Wayne Bobbitt, who gained notoriety </B>when his wife severed his penis, has found religion. <I>The National Examiner</I> interviewed Bobbitt, who was quoted as saying he hopes to perform marriage ceremonies and become a Baptist minister. Bobbitt, who appeared in two pornographic movies after his penis was surgically reattached, says he wants to lead seminars describing &quot;what it was like to go through the tragedies, the turmoil, the drinking, the pornography, and finding God.&quot;     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 17, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...The central figure at the rally was again Louis Farrakhan</B>, leader of the Nation of Islam. He spoke for nearly three hours, discussing the need for nations to atone for violence and human rights violations. Farrakhan criticized the world's powerful nations for fueling the arms race, and chided the &quot;weak  nations&quot; that buy arms. Farrakhan denounced the United States as the world's leading weapons exporter and Saudi Arabia as the biggest buyer. &quot;I have to tell it, whether the kings like it or not,&quot; he said. Farrakhan also warned of an impending &quot;great cataclysmic war.&quot; <BR><B>...&quot;The U.S. government entered into a conspiracy to kill the (black) male</B> and spare the female,&quot; Farrakhan said. &quot;We are dying worse than they are in Northern Ireland, worse than they are in the Palestinian revolt, worse than they are in Bosnia. Black people are dying in the streets of America and no congressman speaks out against it. No president speaks out against it. No governor speaks out against it. They don't give a damn about what happens to the black man because they want you dead.&quot; <BR><B>...Speaking from a bulletproof glass case,</B> with thousands of New York City police officers nearby, Farrakhan called for lifting sanctions against Iraq and Cuba, and demanded recognition of the Palestinians' right to sovereignty. <P> <B>A white South African church leader formally apologized to Desmond Tutu for his silence concerning racial injustice</B>. &quot;We must confess that we backed away at crucial moments from letting a clear testimony against injustices being heard in the land,&quot; a Dutch Reformed Church leader said. He was representing the Stellenbosch group of congregations, which are part of the Dutch Reformed Church and have been derided as &quot;the apartheid regime at prayer,&quot; Ecumenical News International said.  <BR><B>...Tutu, the retired Anglican archbishop, has traveled throughout South Africa</B> since May hearing accounts from victims and their families of atrocities committed by former security police during the apartheid era. The confession was the first made formally to the panel, which Tutu calls the Truth Commission. After the Dutch Reformed leader spoke, Tutu walked up to him and other theologians in the delegation and embraced them, news reports said. <BR><B>...Many atrocities have come to light during the public hearings</B>, ENS said. In Paarl, an anti-apartheid activist said police stripped him and placed a snake around his neck, then left him in the room with a dog that repeatedly bit him. Another witness said her husband was found decapitated in a field; security police showed her the severed head. <P> <B>About 425 supporters of  a &quot;fidelity and chastity&quot; amendment to the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) constitution</B> met to plan their strategy last month in Chicago. If the amendment is approved, church officers would have to repent of any &quot;self-acknowledged practice&quot; that the denomination calls sin. The PCUSA's constitution, or Book of Order, describes acceptable sexual behavior as &quot;fidelity within the covenant of marriage between a man and a woman, or chastity in singleness.&quot;  <BR><B>...A number of speakers called for less recrimination against others and more self-examination.</B> &quot;If we come to these debates with a hardness of heart that does not communicate the caring of Christ, we will lose,&quot; said speaker Roberta Hestenes, who chaired the General Assembly's Committee on Ordination and Human Sexuality, which drafted the amendment. Finger-pointing has characterized the denomination's debate about sexuality for the past 20 years, Presbyterian News Service said. <BR><B>...Voting on the amendment will be completed by next year's General Assembly</B> in Syracuse, N.Y. A majority of the presbyteries must ratify the amendment for it to become part of the church's constitution. Observers say the vote is too close to call. <P> <B>China has warned Hong Kong residents it will place limits on their freedom of expression</B> after the territory reverts to Beijing's rule on July 1, 1997, Reuters news service said. Liberties will remain, but within the law, the Chinese government said. China has promised to give Hong Kong, a British territory, political freedom for 50 years after the transfer of power, and has said it will not to change its capitalist system. <BR><B>...Foreign Minister Qian Qichen</B>, interviewed by the <I>Asian Wall Street Journal</I>, hinted that Hong Kong would no longer be able to mark the anniversary of Beijing's June 4, 1989, crackdown on student-led protests. That stirred an outcry in Hong Kong. <BR><B>...Christians in Argentina are organizing to pledge a million hours of prayer</B> on behalf of  Hong Kong Christians, Mission Network News said.  <P> <B>When four Christian workers in Shanxi Province, China, were arrested</B> for their faith, they led 26 fellow prisoners to Christ, according to Christian Aid Mission. <P> <B>The former New England treasurer of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, pleaded innocent</B> to charges he embezzled $800,000. Prosecutors say George A. Patrick, 55, used the denomination's money to send his children to college and pay for vacation homes, news reports said. <P> <B>South Africa's Roman Catholic Church denied an accusation that it paid for a woman to have an abortion</B> after she had<B> </B>sex with a priest, Reuters news reports said. The woman, who was not identified, told a parliamentary hearing on abortion that a bishop paid her hospital bills when she needed the abortion. The bishop denied he paid for the abortion, but &quot;spoke to her only after she had told him that she had the abortion,&quot; a church spokesman said. The National Assembly will vote Oct. 29 on whether to relax South Africa's abortion law, one of the world's strictest. <P> <B>A man who killed two elderly nuns and attacked two others</B> with a statue of the Virgin Mary in a Waterville, Maine, convent<B> </B>has been declared legally insane. Mark Bechard, 38, was declared not criminally responsible and will be sent to a mental institution rather than prison, news reports said. Bechard has been in and out of mental institutions 25 times, The Associated Press said. <P> <B>Indonesian authorities arrested 40 people for last week's arson attacks</B> by thousands of Muslims on churches around Situbondo in East Java, <I>the Jakarta Post</I> said. Authorities suspect the attacks were premeditated, Reuters said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 4, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...Because Ntakirutimana is charged with participating in killings in western Rwanda</B>, the U.S. plans to extradite him to Tanzania to face the charges before a United Nations' tribunal, Ecumenical News Service said. About half a million Rwandans died in the ethnic bloodbath; some clergy have been accused of participating in the massacres. <BR><B>...There are 806 Adventist congregations in Rwanda, with 285,440 members</B>, Adventist News Service said. The Adventist relief agency ADRA provides relief supplies to Rwandan refugees in Zaire and Burundi. <P> <B>The issue of  women in the ministry continues to stir controversy in the Christian Reformed Church</B>. On Sept. 29, Eastern Avenue Christian Reformed Church in Grand Rapids, Mich, ordained  Mary Antonides, 26, as its pastor and the denomination's second femal minister, Reformed News Service said. But the denomination's Northern Michigan classis, meeting Sept. 24, voted 18-13 not to ordain Mary-Lee Bouma. Last year, the CRC Synod voted to give each classis autonomy in deciding the issue of women's ordination.  <BR><B>...Two CRC churches seceded from the denomination because of the denomination's decision to allow women ministers</B>. They are Bethany CRC in South Holland, Ill., and  Franklin Lakes CRC in New Jersey. Rev. Daniel Bratt of the Franklin Lakes CRC told the news service that allowing women to become ministers indicates &quot;the authority of Scripture is being eroded in the practices of the church.&quot; <P> <B>The United Methodist Church is confused about its identity and mission</B>, according to an evangelical group within the denomination. The group Good News, meeting  Sept. 25-27 in Wilmore, Ky., issued <I>A Resolution to a Church in Crisis, </I>United Methodist News Service said. The document calls on the UMC's Council of Bishops to preach and practice &quot;the doctrinal standards and moral principals of the church&quot; or to resign. <BR><B>...The beliefs of  some UMC leaders on homosexuality are &quot;contrary to Wesleyan theology,&quot;</B> Good News said. The group said it opposes the Reconciling Congregation program, a movement that welcomes full inclusion of homosexuals into the church. That  movement &quot;promotes a counterfeit gospel of grace without repentance, and salvation without transformation,&quot; Good News said. Instead, Good News supports the ministry of Transforming Congregations, a movement which it says &quot;offers a warm and welcoming place for those struggling with homosexuality&quot; and &quot;proclaims the biblical understanding that homosexual behavior is sin, and that hope and healing are available.&quot; <BR><B>...Good News board members said they would help organize people in the UMC who want to withhold their giving</B> from programs they consider &quot;inconsistent with the Gospel.&quot; <P> <B>The case of a British woman who tried giving birth to octuplets has raised questions</B> about who should receive fertility treatment. Mandy Allwood, 31, took a fertility drug, then ignored medical advice to avoid sex for a while. The babies all died. The six boys and two girls were laid in a cot beside Allwood's bed, Reuter news service said. <BR><B>...Critics said doctors should not have given Allwood the treatment</B> since she already had a child and took the drugs in an attempt to save a troubled relationship. She is a divorced single mother. Nicholas Coote of  the Catholic Bishops' Conference told Reuters news service that only married couples should  be eligible to receive fertility treatment. <BR><B>...In a separate case in England, a 30-year-old widow is fighting for the right to be impregnated</B> with her dead husband's sperm. The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority refused permission, saying she did not have his written consent. In July, the authority ordered the destruction of thousands of  fetuses created by in-vitro fertilization because they had passed a legal deadline. <BR><B>...British doctors also were criticized this summer for agreeing to a selective abortion </B>of one of a pair of  fetuses after the mother said she could afford only one child. <P> <B>Gypsies in Central and East Europe will soon be able to hear the gospel on radio in their native tongue.</B> The Bulgarian Baptist Union plans to begin the broadcasts on AM radio in the Romani language beginning Oct. 28, according to Trans World Radio. Romani is spoken by 1.5 million Gypsies in Bulgaria, the former Yugoslavia, and neighboring countries. The dialect also is understood by most other Gypsies in those areas. Listeners who respond to the 15-minute programs will be invited to join fellowship groups. Gypsies have often been ostracized and targets of hatred, TWR said. TWR also plans next year to begin programs in the Kalderash Romani dialect, spoken by 1 million Gypsies. <P> <B>A man who wants to become a notary public is challenging</B>  the South Carolina constitution's requirement that public officers acknowledge the existence of God. Herb Silverman, an atheist who is a 54-year-old math professor at the College of Charleston, is taking his case to the state's Supreme Court today. A lower court threw out the constitution's so-called &quot;God clause,&quot; which has been part of the document since 1886. The state appealed the ruling. Becoming a notary public is not the main issue; changing the state constitution is, Silverman told the Associated Press. <P> <B>In France, ex-followers of  the Church of Scientology are accusing the religion</B> of  pressuring them psychologically and extracting large amounts of money from them, news reports said. Their testimony came during the trial of 23 French Scientologists. The church members are accused of charges ranging from manslaughter and embezzlement to fraud in the 1988 suicide of a church follower. The trial, held in Lyon, is expected to provide a glimpse into the church's inner workings. <BR><B>...One former Scientologist said church officers shouted questions at her</B> as she was made to stand against a wall with arms apart. She also said she gave the church $200,000 over four years, Reuters reported. A Catholic priest said he gave the church $100,000, which  he had received from an elderly woman, for &quot;purification sessions,&quot; the news service said. <BR><B>...Prosecutors say the church exploited gullible victims for money</B> through &quot;pseudo-scientific and paramedical means&quot; and also caused them &quot;medical and psychological risk.&quot; If found guilty, the defendants could go to jail for five years and be fined $1 million. A Church of Scientology spokesman denounced the trial as &quot;the return of the Inquisition.&quot; <P> <B>Los Angeles is considering naming a Hollywood street after Scientology founder L. Ron  Hubbard.</B> The City Council voted  Tuesday to change Berendo Street to L. Ron Hubbard Way, the Associated Press said. A second vote next week would make the change official. <P> <B>William Murray, a Protestant minister and the son of  atheist leader Madalyn Murray O'Hair</B>, filed a missing person report on his mother, news reports said. O'Hair, who filed the lawsuit that led to the 1963 Supreme Court decision that banned compulsory prayers in public schools,  has not been seen for 13 months, police said. O'Hair, 77, her son, Jon, and daughter, Robin, vanished after years of crusading against organized religion. Police assigned an investigator to the case.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 1, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Christian missionaries in the Philippines are staying up all night to reach homeless children</B> living on the streets, Mission Network News reported. The missionaries find children gathered in parks and under bridges or stadiums, said Marvin Graves of Action International Ministries. There are 70,000 homeless children in Manila alone, Graves said. The ministry also is sponsoring vocational training in automotive repair, leathercraft, and welding. <P> <B>A hundred foreigners are trapped in a Roman Catholic cathedral in Bukavu, Zaire</B>, as fighting rages, news reports said. Nationalities of the foreigners was unknown, but reporters in Kamanyola, Zaire, this week said Belgian and Italian missionaries were still in Bukavu. <P>    <P> <B>The Sacred Heart League of Walls Miss., the Catholic charity that produced the Hollywood movie</B> <I>Spitfire Grill</I>, says it will follow up on its success by making another movie. <I>Spitfire Grill</I>, a feature-length film, depicts a woman's struggle for a new start after her release from prison. It has earned the Sacred Heart League $3 million, which it will spend on a new school. The League is part of  a mission that supports grammar schools and social service programs in an impoverished area. It also is building a low-income housing development. <P> <B>The Church of Scientology has complained to the United Nations about discrimination in Germany</B>. The Los Angeles-based church said the German state of Bavaria is prohibiting Scientologists from holding public-sector jobs, breaking Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political rights. Bavaria requires state employees to reveal ties to the church. It also requires private companies with state contracts in sensitive fields to promise not to use the methods of Scientology, news reports said. <BR><B>...Leaders of Germany's 16 regional states are considering putting the Church of  Scientology under surveillance</B> by the government. German leaders deny that the Church of Scientology is a church.  <P> <B>President Clinton wants public school teachers</B> to have the right to travel to parochial schools to teach federally financed remedial classes. Clinton joined New York City officials in asking the court to reverse a 1985 ruling barring the practice. In New York City, students from religious schools are transported to public schools for the special instruction or are given the remedial help in mobile vans parked near parochial schools. <P> <B>The Presbyterian Church (U.S.A) has appealed to religious and political leaders in Iran</B> to investigate the death of a 35-year-old Assemblies of God pastor in September, the PCUSA News Service reported. The body of Mohammed Bagher Yousefi was found hanging from a tree near Ghaem-Shahr. He is the seventh Christian pastor to be killed since the Islamic revolution in 1979. <BR><B>...Iranian Christians in the United States say they are frustrated </B>over their inability to pinpoint blame for the deaths. Some believe paramilitary groups with ties to high government officials are to blame, while others say vigilantes organized by local Islamic hardliners caused the killings, the news service said. Another theory is that the deaths are the work of groups attempting to embarrass the Rafsanjani government. <P> <B>The Episcopal Church has been implicated in an alleged sex scandal</B> involving Long Island priests. An article in December's <I>Penthouse</I> magazine contains allegations of sexual misconduct against Long Island priest William Lloyd Andries and other unnamed priests. The article claims they are involved in &quot;bizarre&quot; homosexual rituals, Episcopal News Service said. Howard Williams, the Episcopal Church's coordinator for children's ministries, who was mentioned in the article, has already agreed to resign. <P> <B>Another meteorite from Mars contains evidence for possible life on that planet</B>, British scientists said. American geologists who found possibly life-related compounds in a Mars rock in August said the British research confirms their findings. <BR><B>...The latest discovery will encourage more testing of meteorites</B> from Mars and increase interest in spacecraft missions to the planet, news reports said. The first such mission is scheduled for launching next Wednesday.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 17, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>An assailant threw a hand grenade into a congregation of 500 Christians</B> taking part in an open-air prayer meeting at Bwaise, a suburb of the Ugandan capital of Kampala, Jan. 12.  Six people died and 40 were injured in the terrorist attack, news reports said.   <BR><B>...Police suspect Islamic militants</B>.  Kampala newspapers said several preachers at the prayer meeting had criticized the Qur'an, Islam's most sacred book, angering local  Muslims.  Sheikh Suleiman Kakeeto, head of one of Uganda's main fundamentalist Islamic groups, Tabliq, said his organization was not connected with the attack.   <BR><B>...Uganda is a largely Christian country</B>.  About one third of the population of 20 million is Protestant, one third is Catholic, and 15% Muslim.  The rest follow African religions or are atheists.  Relations between Muslim and Christian communities have been friendly, but Islamic fundamentalism has grown in recent years. <P> <B>Ninety percent of deaths in hospital intensive care units</B> happen after patients or their surrogates decide, with their doctors, to limit treatment, a study found.  That is almost double the rate found five years ago, reflecting changes in the way doctors treat the terminally ill, Reuter news service reported.  The figures appear in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, published by the American Lung Association. <BR><B>...Doctors are becoming more frank with patients</B> and more willing to accept the inevitability of death, said the study's author, Dr. Thomas J. Prendergast of the VA Medical Center in White River Junction, Vt.  Doctors traditionally believed that they could not stop treating patients, but now are more willing to discuss withholding treatment that would only be futile, he said. <P>   <P> <B>Christians in China turned a garbage dump into a church</B>.  Some 600 Christians in Laohutai did not have a place to meet.  They purchased a small, abandoned house surrounded by slag heaps and garbage.  The site, situated on a mountain inaccessible by car or donkey cart, first had to be cleared of the accumulated garbage. <BR><B>...The Christians removed more than 100 tons of garbage</B>, carrying it down the mountain in baskets.  They were dripping with sweat but still singing hymns during their breaks, Amity News Service said.  The congregation constructed a church next to the old house, which was renovated.  All building materials, including bricks, sacks of mortar, and wood, were hand-carried up the hill.  The work took 56 days, with an average of 50 people laboring every day.   <BR><B>...After seeing the hardships that Christians endured to erect the church</B>, more than a hundred people in surrounding villages became Christians, according to <I>Tian Feng</I>, the Chinese church magazine.  The congregation has been commended by the local government for its contribution to building a &quot;spiritual civilization.&quot;  <P> <B>Sony's release of a Christmas album to raise money to promote pro-choice activities </B>has been<B> </B>denounced by the Catholic Church.  &quot;This mockery of Christmas is offensive to every Christian and to Christianity itself,&quot; Cardinal Bernard Law, Chairman of the Bishops' Committee for Pro-Life Activities, said in a letter to Thomas D. Mottola, president of Sony Music.  <BR><B>...Proceeds from the album <I>O Come All Ye Faithful </I>will benefit Rock for Choice</B>, an organization that attempts to repeal laws requiring parental consent to a minor's abortion, prevent restrictions on federal funding of abortions, and promote &quot;massive pro-choice community organizing.&quot; <P> <B>An operation removed part of prostate gland from South African Nobel peace laureate Desmond Tutu.  </B>Cancer was discovered in the gland, and further tests will be taken to determine whether the disease has spread, doctors for the 65-year-old archbishop said. <P> <B>Bar-hopping brings people to worship services at a church in West Hollywood, Calif.  </B>Each Christmas eve since 1989, members and pastors of Crescent Heights United Methodist Church have visited every bar in the neighborhood and distributing &quot;complimentary tickets&quot; for its Midnight Christmas Eve candlelight service.  About 60 people attend, including many who have no families to be with on the holiday, United Methodist News Service reported. <P> <B>Ireland recorded its first divorce since it was legalized</B> by a half percent margin in a constitutional amendment in November 1995.  The High Court granted a divorce to a terminally ill man, even though a law approving divorce does not go into effect until next month.  There are reportedly 80,000 people waiting to get divorced in the overwhelmingly Roman Catholic nation.  Many are already living with new partners.  Ireland was the last European country to legalize divorce. <P> <B>Don Argue, president of the National Association of Evangelicals, will lead a prayer</B> for President Clinton during the morning church service prior to Clinton's inauguration on Monday.  Argue is the first <A HREF=http://www.nae.net/ >NAE</A> executive to be included in the presidential inaugural party and to participate in a pre-inaugural service.  It will be carried live on C-Span. <P> <B>New technology is enabling missionaries to communicate from remote places</B>.  A portable satellite telephone called Planet One allows telephone calls to be made from anywhere in the world.  It is about the size and weight of a laptop computer with a lid that serves as an antenna.  Data also can be sent or received when the unit is plugged into a fax machine or laptop.  Mission Aviation Fellowship is making the telephone available to missionary agencies. <BR><B>...The phone is particularly valuable for missionaries in isolated parts of the world</B>, Paul Lay of MAF told <I>Religion News Today</I>.  The telephones are manufactured by NEC and distributed by the Comsat Corp., for which MAF is an agent.  Cost is about $3,000 for the unit.  Calls cost about $3 a minute.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 26, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Some 200 Catholics in Chiapas, Mexico, attacked evangelical Protestants</B> with firearms, rocks, machetes, picks, hoes, and sticks. One person was killed and 19 injured, the newspaper <I>Cuarto Poder</I> reported. The clashes began last Sunday when the Catholics marched onto the evangelicals' land to measure the property, which they consider their own even though it was given to the evangelicals by the government. <BR><B>...Long-running clashes among the groups, both of whom are Tzeltal Maya Indians, have worsened recently</B>. In the last 25 years, more than 25,000 Indian converts to evangelical Christianity have been expelled from Chiapas communities. Evangelicals, who are members of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, are resented by members of the leftist opposition Democratic Revolution Party, who practice a Mayan religion mixed with Catholicism. <P> <B>Christian missionaries in Israel are concerned about their safety after a direct-mail evangelism campaign last week</B>. The electronic publication <I>Speed the Need</I> said influential ultra-Orthodox Jews are threatening Christian missionaries after a million books about Jesus the Messiah were mailed to Israelis who had requested information about Christianity. Names of the missionaries are linked to the distribution.  <P> <B>The United States announced it will evacuate 5,000 relief workers from northern Iraq,</B> news reports said. The State Department said the workers, who had helped feed anti-Saddam Hussein rebels, will be flown to Guam along with their families. The group consists of employees of 24 relief organizations funded or based in the United States. It would be the third such airlift from the area. <P> <B>The U.S. Navy discharged an enlisted man</B> who said he could no longer work for an &quot;immoral and corrupt&quot; government that supports abortion. Petty Officer 3rd Class William J. Downes was being separated from the Navy at his own request, a Navy spokesman said. Downes was given a &quot;general discharge,&quot; which is less than an honorable separation but avoids a dishonorable discharge. <BR><B>...Downes said he requested a court martial trial in order to defend his actions</B>, but the request was denied. He also was denied an administrative discharge since the issue did not fall within the parameters of &quot;conscientious objection&quot; as defined by military law, a Navy spokesman said.  <BR><B>...Downes said he grappled with his conscience over the decision</B>. On Oct. 15, he began going to work out of uniform and refusing to perform any duties, <I>The Washington Times</I> said. &quot;I can't support any government that sanctions the killing of unborn children and which performs abortion at its military medical facilities,&quot; Downes said in a statement. Downes, 31, who is Catholic, is married and the father of two small boys. He had been assigned to the chaplain's office at the U.S. naval Academy in Annapolis. <BR><B>...&quot;In my oath of enlistment, I promised under God to support and defend the Constitution</B>. I firmly believe that the 14th Amendment, which states that 'no person may be deprived of life...without due process,' should properly apply to pre-born persons,&quot; he wrote in a letter explaining his actions to his commanding officer. &quot;All three branches of government are aligned against the right to life,&quot; Downes said, citing the Senate's failure to override President Clinton's veto of the ban on partial-birth abortions. Downes said that after leaving the Navy, he wants to get involved in pro-life advocacy on full time. <P> <B>The gospel is being broadcast from Armenia, deep in the heart of Islamic territory, </B>Trans World Radio said. The million-watt AM transmitter was built and used by the Soviet Union for propaganda purposes. The new broadcasts, which began this month, bring the gospel to millions of people who have never heard it, including 60 of the world's least-evangelized people groups, TWR said. Countries covered by the signal include Turkey, Georgia, Iran, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikstan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. <P> <B>Saudi Arabia beheaded two women and three men Tuesday for drug smuggling</B>, Saudi television reported. That increases to 58 the number of people executed this year in the Moslem kingdom, which enforces sharia law by publicly beheading by the sword convicted murderers, drug smugglers, rapists, and other criminals. <P>     <P> <B>Cuba's Catholic church has gained government approval to create a Catholic press association.</B> The rare, non-official media group reflects improved ties between the church and communist authorities. Most members of the new Cuban Catholic Press Union are not journalists, but people who have worked on church publications. The journalism profession has been barred for a long time to people practicing religion, Reuter news service reported. <P> <B>Uzbekistan police reportedly have arrested 64 Christians in Tashkent</B>. A Pentecostal pastor, his assistant, and 62 members of the Word of Faith congregation were arrested Nov. 18 when they gathered at the Dinamo Tennis Club to discuss the congregation's future, according to a report from Compass Direct. The wife of pastor Dennis Podorozhny confirmed the arrests and imprisonment of her husband and his assistant, Lev Folkovich. The two men were sentenced to 12 days imprisonment, and were being held in a cell in which they had room only to stand or sit. Congregation members were &quot;rudely interrogated&quot; and released. <BR><B>...During the meeting, security police in uniforms entered the club and ended the meeting</B>, Podorozhny's wife said. Word of Faith started five years ago, but the Ministry of Justice revoked its official registration in 1994. Legal efforts to renew the church's status have been denied, forcing the congregation to meet in homes with a monthly gathering in a rented hall. Podorozhny, 25, also was arrested Sept. 22 after security police disrupted a worship service in a rented hall. He was fined three months' wages and released after being handcuffed and interrogated. <P> <B>A French court acquitted all eight national leaders of the Scientology church</B> in a criminal trial stemming from a follower's suicide. At the trial, prosecutors depicted Scientology as a business concealed as a religion. Scientology force money from gullible people through abusive, high-pressure techniques, prosecutors said. Defense lawyers said the group was a legitimate religion and argued that their clients were victims of a government campaign to crack down on cults.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 26, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>More than a thousand rampaging youths set fire to churches, commercial buildings, and cars</B> in the West Java town of Tasikmalaya, 125 miles southeast of Jakarta, Indonesia, police said. The youths apparently were angered by a report that police beat religious teachers and students, news reports said. <BR><B>...Christians have become targets for recent mob violence, </B>primarily because they are affluent, observers said. More than 80% of Indonesia's nearly 200 million people are Muslims, but the government recognizes all the world's major religions. <BR><B>...In October, 25 churches and a temple burned and five people died</B> after a mob rampaged in Situbondo, East Java. That riot was begun by Muslims angered by what they considered a court's lenient sentence in a blasphemy case. <P> <B>The first patent for a euthanasia drug combination with potential human use</B> has been granted by the European Patent Office, <I>Newsday</I> reported. It was developed by Michigan State University with research funds from the German chemical company Hoechst AG. The drug originally was intended for animals, but also could be used for humans, the newspaper reported. <BR><B>...Euthanasia and doctor-assisted suicide have been practiced for several years</B> in The Netherlands, and recently were made legal in Australia. Oregon voters approved a measure in 1994 allowing doctor-assisted death, but that has been blocked by a court challenge. In January, the U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments in New York and Seattle lawsuits that challenge state bans on doctor-assisted death. <P> <B>Clergyman Rob Schenck said the Secret Service detained him</B> after he admonished President Clinton during a Christmas Eve service at the Washington National Cathedral. Schenck said agents blocked him from leaving the cathedral for 15 minutes while they reached inside his pockets and looked through his wallet.   <BR><B>...Schenck confronted Clinton about his veto of  the partial-birth abortion ban.</B> While Schenck was waiting to receive communion, he leaned over the altar rail toward the front row where the president, his wife, and daughter were seated and quietly told Clinton: &quot;God will hold you to account, Mr. President.&quot; <BR><B>...Schenck returned to his seat after taking communion, but was pulled aside</B> by an agent as he tried to leave the cathedral, he said. An agent told Schenck the president complained to the Secret Service that Schenck had &quot;said words&quot; to him. <BR><B>...The &quot;spectacle&quot; of agents rifling through Schenck's pockets</B> as the choir sang <I>What Child Is This </I>left eyewitness &quot;wondering whether they had been suddenly transported not to Bethlehem but to Beijing,&quot; said Steve Meyers, who watched the incident. Schenck is head of The National Clergy Council, which reportedly includes 5,000 Catholic, Orthodox, and Protestant members. <P> <B>A suicide bomber who killed herself and two other people</B> in a Frankfurt, Germany, Protestant church on Christmas Eve was a 49-year-old who had been separated from her husband and was undergoing psychiatric treatment, police said. The woman, whom police did not name, detonated two hand grenades strapped to her abdomen. The blast sent shrapnel and bits of smashed pews flying, injuring 13 others, police said. <P>   <P> <B>A $60 million, 43,000-square-foot cathedral will be built in downtown Los Angeles</B> to replace the one damaged by a 1994 earthquake. The 2,000-seat Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels will replace 120-year-old St. Vibiana's as headquarters for the Los Angeles Archdiocese. St. Vibiana's was condemned after being damaged by the Northridge earthquake. An area next to the new cathedral will include living areas for the archbishop and priests, a meeting center, and a three-acre plaza. <P> <B>The nation's 25 most generous philanthropists</B> are mostly self-made, attribute their generosity in part to their religions, and have been giving to others for years, even before they had much themselves, <I>Fortune</I> magazine reported. In its Jan. 13 issue, the magazine said the top 25 philanthropists gave $1.5 billion this year. At the top of the list are George Soros, president of Soros Fund Management ($350 million); retired grocery and drug store magnate L.S. Skaggs ($155 million); Microsoft chairman Bill Gates ($135 million); Walter Annenberg, former chairman of Triangle Publications ($128 million); and William Hewlett, co-founder of Hewlett-Packard ($100 million). The magazine noted that many billionaires are &quot;stingy&quot; in relation to their wealth. <P>   <P> <B>Utah's law banning abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy is unconstitutional,</B> a federal appeals court ruled. The 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Monday that the law infringes upon a woman's right to choose, news reports said. <P> <B>Fifty years after the end of World War II</B>, the General Synod of the Nippon Sei Ko Kai (the Anglican Church in Japan) described as sinful its support for Japan's &quot;war of aggression.&quot; Primate James Takashi Yashiro said the apology &quot;has finally come to the surface after much prayer, reflection, discussion, and heart-felt concern.&quot; Nippon Sei Ko Kai said it will start a program in each diocese and parish to &quot;review the historical facts and to deepen our understanding of the Gospel.&quot; <BR><B>...Last year, Presiding Bishop Edmond Browning</B> was among a group calling itself the Fellowship of Reconciliation that expressed &quot;profound sorrow to the Japanese people&quot; for the &quot;unimaginable pain&quot; caused by the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Episcopal News Service reported. <BR><B>...&quot;The two statements represent an incredible witness towards healing</B> and reconciliation,&quot; said Brian Grieves, the Episcopal Church's peace and justice ministries officer.    </font></p>

During half time, party hosts will show their guests a video with Irving Fryer of the Philadelphia Eagles giving his Christian testimony.  Some high-profile Christians will be involved in the game, including Reggie White and coach Mike Holmgren of the Green Bay Packers and Curtis Martin of the New England Patriots, SOA's Tom Felton said.  More than 5,000 people became Christians during last year's Superbowl parties, Felton told Mission Network News.   <P> <B>A small crucifix from the Byzantine era has been found in Jerusalem</B>.  The bronze-and-wood crucifix was discovered during excavation work just outside the walls of the Old City in East Jerusalem, archaeologists said.  They said the cross, which fits in the palm of one's hand, was rare because it was the first to be uncovered with wooden pieces dating back to the fifth and sixth centuries.  Archaeologists said there is no evidence that the wood comes from the cross on which Jesus was crucified, as some have speculated. <P> <B>A Greek judge ordered Scientologists in Athens to shut down.  </B>The judge said the group obtained a license to operate under false pretenses, according to Reuter news service.  The ruling said the Scientologists obtained a license as a nonprofit organization, but made money and put people's mental and physical health at risk.  Germany has also taken measures recently against Scientology. <P> <B>For the first time, the U.S. Supreme Court does not have a Protestant majority.  </B>The court lost its Protestant majority last year, when Clarence Thomas left a charismatic Episcopal church and, after a 25-year hiatus, returned to the Roman Catholic Church.  Justices Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy also are Catholic; Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer are Jewish; Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justices John Paul Stevens, Sandra Day O'Connor, and David H. Souter belong to Protestant denominations. <P> <B>Forty-five students suspected of drinking each other's blood</B> and worshipping the devil were charged with blasphemy Thursday in Cairo, Egypt.  Another 31 suspected members of the cult were released on bail.  News reports said the students, aged 16 to 28, held orgies in the desert and took drugs.  They face up to three years in prison if convicted.  Some are Coptic Christians, and the rest are Muslims, reports said.  Most of the members reportedly had learned the sect's doctrines during travels abroad. <P> <B>One hundred seventy churches are helping the city of Lexington, Ky.,</B> design a welfare system.  In two months, numerous proposals for ways churches can assist the poor have emerged from 11 church-and-community forums, Baptist Press reported.  The &quot;town halls&quot; have been reviewing options for providing child care, food, clothing, transportation, job information, and low-income housing.  The churches are planning to cooperate with each other to help supply assistance. <P> <B>A U.S. District Court judge barred enforcement of an Iowa abortion-notification law</B>.  Judge Ronald Longstaff issued a preliminary injunction against the law, which requires doctors performing abortions on women younger than 18 to first notify a parent, grandparent, aunt, uncle or adult sibling -- depending on who can be reached.  Gov. Terry Branstad urged the legislature to rewrite the law to require notification to parents only.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for February 6, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>&quot;This town is gripped with people who are self-righteous</B>, sanctimonious, and hypocritical,&quot; President Clinton said today in an address to the National Prayer Breakfast.  &quot;I plead guilty from time to time.&quot; The annual event drew 4,000 governors, judges, diplomats, bureaucrats, foreign leaders, and soldiers.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich read from the Bible before Clinton spoke. <BR><B>...&quot;Pray for the people in public office</B> that we can rid ourselves of this toxic atmosphere of cynicism and embrace with joy and gratitude this phenomenal opportunity and responsibility before us,&quot; Clinton said. <BR><B>...&quot;Do not forget the people in the rest of the world</B> who depend on people of the United States...and most of all remember that in every scripture and every faith there are hundreds and hundreds of admonishments not to forget those among us who are poor,&quot; he said.  &quot;They are no longer entitled to a handout, but they surely deserve -- and we are ordered to give them -- a hand up,&quot; Clinton said. <P> <B>More than half of San Francisco doctors who regularly treat AIDS patients</B> say they have helped terminal patients to commit suicide by permitting lethal doses of drugs.  In an anonymous survey of 118 doctors, published in <I>The New England Journal of Medicine</I>, 53% said they had granted patients' requests for suicide assistance at least once, up from a 1990 report of 48%.  The average number of requests granted was four per doctor.  The number of doctors going along with the controversial and illegal practice is increasing, according to the study.  Opponents of assisted suicide cautioned that just because a practice is increasingly acceptable, that is no reason to legalize it. <P> <B>Alabama Gov. Fob James threatened to call out the National Guard</B> to prevent the removal of prayer and a Ten Commandments display from a courtroom.  &quot;The only way those Ten Commandments and prayer would be stripped from the courtroom is with the force of arms,&quot; James said Wednesday.  The American Civil Liberties Union has challenged Circuit Judge Roy Moore's inviting Protestant ministers to open court sessions with prayers, and his display of a hand-carved replica of the Ten Commandments.  Another judge ruled against the courtroom prayers, but said the commandments can stay, along with other historical items on the walls.  Both sides are appealing. <P> <B>A coalition of 25 Catholic, Protestant, evangelical, and Jewish groups</B> is announcing a plan Thursday in Washington, D.C., to focus attention on environmental problems that hurt the poor.  The coalition, which looks at environmental problems from a theological perspective, plans a $4 million campaign to involve congregations in such issues as air and water pollution and toxic wastes in urban areas.  The funding is from a variety of foundations.  More than 100,000 kits have been sent to congregations, showing how to start local antipollution campaigns.  Air pollution is a particular focus, because it has the greatest impact on congested, low-income areas, the coalition said.  As a result, asthma is the single most common cause of hospital admissions for inner-city children, the leaders said. <P>   <P> <B>Thieves stole shoes left outside a mosque as Muslims prayed in Turkey today</B>.  The thieves took 210 pairs of shoes from outside the Vali Kamil Acun mosque in the southeastern city of Sirnak, Anatolian news agency said.  Muslims remove their shoes before entering a mosque. <P> <B>Allegations of sexual misconduct against television chef Jeff Smith,</B> known as the Frugal Gourmet, have led United Methodist Communications to suspend<I> The Frugal Gourmet Keeps the Feast</I>, a series it produces for the Odyssey Cable Television Network.  Smith, 58, a United Methodist minister, is being sued by George Heitman of Tacoma, Wash., 36, who says Smith sexually assaulted him when he was 15.  Smith denied Heitman's charges.  Smith also hosts the <I>Frugal Gourmet</I>, watched in 6 million households on 300 public television stations.  A spokesman for Public Broadcasting Service said the network will distribute the show and local stations can decide whether to broadcast it.   <P> <B>Fifty-nine percent of Germans want the Church of Scientology placed under federal observation</B>, according to a survey released Wednesday.  Respondents favor calling in the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution to keep an eye on the controversial organization.  Only 9.5% opposed the measure and 31.3% had no opinion or did not know what Scientology was.  Germany does not consider Scientology to be a religion, and officials say it exploits the insecurities of its members in order to make profits from expensive self-improvement courses.  Scientology has compared Germany's treatment to Nazi persecution of the Jews before World War II. <P> <B>German broadcasters want more explicit sex on television</B>.  German TV already shows enough nudity to make most other nations cringe, but broadcasters are demanding permission to show more, news reports said.  Pay television channels want to broadcast films showing &quot;real sex&quot; after midnight that could be seen only by using a decoder to prevent children from watching.  A survey found more than 50% of Germans favor the changes, news reports said. <P> <B>A weekly biblical passage read in Israeli synagogues last Saturday, Isaiah 7:3,</B> contains the name of the village over which two army helicopters collided three days later, killing 73 soldiers, Reuters news service reported.  The town, Shaar Yishuv, is also the name of the prophet Isaiah's son.  Newspapers reported that many people consider the passage a clue to the tragedy.  The Bible also was cited in the November 1995 assassination of Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.  He was killed in the week in which the biblical story of Abraham's near-sacrifice of his son Isaac, Yitzhak in Hebrew, was read in synagogues.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for February 5, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>The girl pictured running from burning napalm in the famous Vietnam War photograph</B> has met and forgiven a soldier-turned-pastor, who ordered the bombing strike on her village.  John Plummer, minister of Bethany United Methodist Church, Purcellville, Va., was haunted for many years by the war, United Methodist News Service reported.  He set up the 1972 air strike on the village of Trang Bang after being assured twice that there were no civilians in the area.  Shortly thereafter, he saw the photo of 9-year-old Phan Thi Kim Phuc. <BR><B>...Almost no day passed without Plummer thinking of the girl</B>, he said.  Raised a United Methodist, Plummer stopped going to church, began to abuse alcohol, and got divorced.  Eventually, he came to grips with the fact that he had done everything possible to make sure the area was clear of civilians, but still wanted to tell Kim Phuc how sorry he was. <BR><B>...In 1990, Plummer became a Christian</B>.  He attended Wesley Seminary and became the student pastor of Bethel United Methodist Church in Warrenton, Va.  Last June, Plummer saw on the news that Kim Phuc was living in Toronto, so he traveled there to meet her. <BR><B>...&quot;She saw my grief, my pain, my sorrow,&quot;</B> Plummer wrote in a story about the incident.  &quot;She held out her arms to me and embraced me.  All I could say was I'm sorry, over and over again.  At the same time, she was saying it's all right.  I forgive.&quot; Plummer, his wife and another couple spent two hours with Kim Phuc, talking and praying.  Raised a Buddhist, Kim Phuc became a Christian in 1982. <BR><B>...&quot;She is the closest thing to a saint I ever met,&quot; Plummer said</B>, describing how Kim Phuc got down on her knees and prayed for him in the hotel lobby that day.  She plans to visit Virginia in April. <P> <B>A former hotel in France has been transformed into a retreat house for missionaries &quot;wounded in action.&quot;</B> Missionaries are treated like heroes during their stay at Le Rucher, a seven-acre property overlooking Mont Blanc and run by the missions agency Youth With A Mission.  They rest, relax, and exercise, and also talk and pray with the staff.  Many of the missionaries are working through fear, anger, and guilt arising from serving in war zones, crisis areas, and other adverse conditions.  Some have been evacuated in emergencies, faced death and rape threats, or been worn out by serving in areas of desperate need.  The missionaries stay up to two weeks. <P> <A HREF=http://www.moody.edu/><B>Moody Bible Institute's</A> annual Founder's Week Conference</B> is being covered live on the Internet Feb. 3-8.  Live audio will feature Joseph Stowell, David Jeremiah, Ravi Zacharias, and Crawford Loritts.  The week's schedule is on-line, along with speaker biographies and a listing of radio stations broadcasting the sessions. <P> <B>United Methodist clergy are issuing conflicting statements on homosexuality</B>.  As stated in the denomination's official <I>Social Principles and Book of Discipline</I>, the UMC adheres to the &quot;lifelong commitment between one man and one woman&quot; as the only appropriate form of marriage.  It excludes &quot;self-avowed practicing homosexuals&quot; from ordination and supports &quot;ministries of transformation&quot; for homosexuals &quot;who wish to leave such lifestyles.&quot; <BR><B>...Last month, 15 clergy issued <I> In All Things Charity, </I>which lamented </B>the denomination's policies, United Methodist News Service reported.  Now, United Methodist clergy and lay members from 20 states have reacted to that statement, calling for an end to &quot;needless debate&quot; on an issue that was &quot;settled centuries ago.&quot; Those who are pressing for the acceptance of homosexual practice should use forums other than &quot;United Methodist pulpits, boards, agencies, educational institutions and other affiliated entities&quot; to express their views, the group said. <P> <B>A government guide on how to spot religious cults</B> in heavily Roman Catholic Austria has turned into a bestseller with 230,000 copies printed.  The guide<I>, Sects--Knowledge Protects</I>, lists 22 active sects, Reuters news service reported.  The guide gives tips on recognizing  pseudo-religious groups, detailing their methods and practices.  About 50,000 Austrians belong to such groups, with 200,000 more suspected of having loose links with them. <P> <B>The first &quot;burial&quot; of cremated ashes in space will take place in March</B>.  Celestis Inc., a Texas company, plans to send into orbit the ashes of 23 people, including Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and 1960s LSD guru Timothy Leary, UPI reported.  The remains will hitchhike on the spacecraft carrying Spain's first satellite.  In order to avoid an orbiting cloud of ashes, capsules bearing the remains will stick to part of the launch vehicle, which will stay aloft for up to 10 years then sink back into the atmosphere.  Celestis charges $4,800 for the service and hopes to arrange several flights a year.  It has reportedly been overwhelmed by inquiries. <P> <B>An estimated three million Muslims thronged the holy city of Mecca</B>, Saudi Arabia, Tuesday night, marking Laylat al-Qadr, the anniversary of the Koran being revealed to the Prophet Mohammad in the year 610.  Muslims around the world are celebrating the holy month of Ramadan. <P> <B>Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has been nominated for this year's Nobel Peace Prize</B> by the American Friends Service Committee, the American service arm of the Quakers.  The group said Carter deserved to be recognized for his efforts at promoting peace and democracy.  Carter has pursued peacemaking missions to North Korea, Bosnia and Haiti; promoted democratic elections for Palestinians and Nicaraguans; and tried to solve the conflict between the Hutu and Tutsi peoples of Africa.  The Quakers emphasized the spiritual underpinnings of the attempts by Carter, who is a Southern Baptist.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 11, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Relief workers were waiting at the border to be allowed into Zaire today</B>. Neighboring Rwanda agreed on Sunday to let food and medicine be brought into Goma, but permission still was being sought from rebels that control the Zairean town. <BR><B>...Even if relief convoys enter Goma, it remained doubtful</B> whether they could reach many of the 1 million refugees, who are scattered across eastern Zaire. The refugees are widely feared to be dying by the thousands.  <BR><B>...The U.N.'s Security Council decided on Saturday to deploy a multinational force</B> to ensure the safety of humanitarian relief deliveries. But the U.N.'s failure to state when or how it should go in was greeted with anger by relief agencies. <P> <B>Some people are using their Christmas holidays to do volunteer work.</B> Various organizations offer opportunities over the holidays for human-service, construction, and environmentally oriented work. Churches also place people in service projects. For example, the Heifer Project International, which donates livestock and expertise in 110 countries, welcomes volunteers at its International Learning and Livestock Center in Perryville, Ark., to care for animals or help construct buildings. <BR><B>...Motivations for taking a &quot;volunteer vacation&quot; vary</B>. Some people are trying to avoid the commercialism of Christmas. Others escape holiday loneliness. Many find the work makes their Christmas more significant and meaningful, reports said. <P> <B>British society may be on the verge of disintegration, church leaders warned</B>. The decline in church attendance is linked to the breakdown of family life and traditional moral values, they said. Even practicing Christians hold New Age beliefs, evidence that society is in danger of losing its Judeo-Christian roots, according to a report by the mainstream churches. In Britain, 70% of people say they believe in God, but only 14% go to church. <BR><B>...&quot;Civilizations have broken up in the past and we cannot be complacent</B> that ours will not,&quot; Michael Nazir-Ali, chairman of the group that produced the report, told <I>The London Times</I>. He said the report was a challenge to churches to lower barriers separating them from the community. The report cited the need for a renewed Christian orthodoxy as a &quot;common language about ultimate values and beliefs.&quot; <P> <B>A proposed tax cut in Germany could mean financial disaster for the country's churches</B>. Church tax, which is collected by the state authorities, is a percentage of church members' income tax, so cuts in income tax lead automatically to reductions in church tax. According to Ecumenical News International, the Protestant and Catholic denominations each receive $5 billion a year in church tax; an 11% tax cut is being proposed. A number of politicians are questioning whether church tax should be maintained in its present form. <P> <B>The Southern Baptist Convention has distributed nearly $700,000 to help churches victimized by arsonists,</B> Baptist Press reported. In addition, Southern Baptist construction crews are volunteering to rebuild the burned churches. Donations to the SBC Arson Fund may be sent directly to state Baptist convention offices or the SBC Executive Committee, 901 Commerce St., Nashville, TN 37203.  <P> <B>Charity tax breaks have enabled the Russian Orthodox Church to import millions of dollars worth of duty-free cigarettes</B> and buy a share in an oil exporting business that is expected to make $2 billion this year, <I>The Moscow Times</I> newspaper reported.  <P> <B>Dueling Christmas parades are planned in Key West, Fla.</B> The city will sponsor one parade, but a rival parade will be held on a different day by the Lower Keys Ministerial Association, a coalition of 15 conservative pastors. The ministerial group excluded the largely homosexual Metropolitan Community Church from its parade. The city has a large, politically organized homosexual population.  <P> <B>Military veterans having trouble finding their place in society are becoming homeless</B>, a Christian charitable group said. The International Union of Gospel Missions said one in every three homeless men at its shelters is a veteran. Men discharged recently from a shrinking military are joining troubled Vietnam veterans among the homeless, the group said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for November 15, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Joe Lusi is risking his life serving refugees.</B> The Zairean doctor, a member of the Nairobi Baptist Church in Goma, works in the Virunga Baptist hospital in Goma. <BR><B>...As battles raged outside, terrified patients prayed all night,</B> Lusi's wife, Lyn, quoted her husband as saying, &quot;The screams of the women and children are an unforgettable memory for those who heard them,&quot; she told Baptist Press.  <BR><B>...Calm returned to the area and more wounded arrived at the hospital's door, </B>but there was no electricity for sterilizing or water to wash wounds. Lusi instructed his remaining staff to tell the patients' family members to bring water. For firewood, he ordered people to burn doors from the operating room. For seven days, the hospital was the only one in Goma remaining in operation.  <BR><B>...Lusi has served Hutu refugees in the Goma camps since 1994</B>, after the Rwandan genocide sent tens of thousands of people fleeing to the Rwanda-Zaire border.  <P> <B>Scripture is unclear about salvation apart from Christ</B>, according to the controversial pastor of the fourth-largest church of the Reformed Church in America.<B> </B>Richard Rhem of Christ Community Church in Spring Lake, Mich., said he questions &quot;salvation is through Jesus Christ alone,&quot; according to United Reformed News Service. <BR><B>...If salvation is only through Jesus Christ, &quot;I don't know what to do with the Jewish believers</B> <B>I </B>have become so fond of,&quot; Rhem said, delivering the keynote speech at the RCA's Nov. 9 Regional Synod of the Mid-Atlantics. <BR><B>...The Bible includes some clear teaching on salvation through Christ</B>, but that would have been expected given its context as a book of proclamation, Rhem said. &quot;I don't think we should try to whitewash this book and say there is no possibility of constructing an exclusivist view of the church; the only thing I would argue is [that] this is not the only voice.&quot; There was a &quot;strong strain of universalism&quot; in the early church, he noted. <BR><B>...Rhem said he does not believe in blending religions</B> into &quot;some new kind of mush,&quot; but that people should select a religion and follow it without believing that it is the only means to salvation. <BR><B>...A group of 219 conservative Christian Reformed ministers</B>, elders, and deacons asked the denomination to allow conservative opponents of women's ordination to form a group within the CRC. The conservatives said they want to avoid more secession in the denomination, which has lost nearly 8% of its members since 1993. <P> <B>The Anglican Synod of the Diocese of Sydney today voted against ordaining women as priests.</B> The synod also registered its opposition to pending legislation that could allow same-sex couples to adopt children. <P> <B>A Pennsylvania woman apparently bleeds as she speaks about Christ</B>. Mary Ellen Lukas, a devout Catholic from Hazleton, is said to be a stigmatic, with sores in her hands, feet, and side that mimic Christ's wounds on the cross. During an interview, bright red beads appeared on Lukas' forehead and ran down her face as she spoke of Christ, according to <I>The Wilkes BarreTimes-Leader</I>. The stigmata have drawn thousands of people to Lukas' healing services in Ireland and the Philippines. The Vatican appointed a priest to investigate Lukas' case, the Associated Press said. <P> <B>The United Methodist Church is undertaking an extensive, long-range evangelistic effort in Russia</B>. Since the end of communism, 34 UMC congregations have been established in Russia and other parts of the Commonwealth of Independent States, Ecumenical News International reported. The congregations are organized into the Eurasia Annual Conference led by a bishop in Moscow. UMC evangelistic and humanitarian programs have begun in 38 other places in Russia and other CIS states. <BR><B>...Also under way is a &quot;partner churches&quot; program</B>, in which 31 congregations in the United States are providing help to Russian communities without establishing a UMC presence there. The Methodist Church of Korea also is establishing churches in former Soviet states. <BR><B>...Potential friction between the UMC and the Russian Orthodox Church in Russia is lessened</B> because the UMC has been working with the Russian Orthodox Church in the World Council of Churches and other settings. <P> <B>What is thought to be the first international school in China sponsored by a church body</B> is being planned by the Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod. The denomination plans to open the school in Beijing or Shanghai next fall, LCMS News reported. It would be modeled after the synod's Hong Kong International School. <BR><B>...The school would cater to the children of expatriates working in China</B>, including Asians from Japan, Singapore, Indonesia, Korea, Thailand, and India as well as North Americans and Europeans. Initially, the school would offer English-language classes in Grades K-6, with an American, Christian curriculum. Additional grades, up to 12, will be added later. <P> <B>A religious court in the United Arab Emirates sentenced Elie Dib Ghalib, a Lebanese Christian</B>, to a year in jail and 39 lashes for marrying a Muslim woman, Amnesty International said. The court ruled the marriage between Ghalib and UAE citizen Mona Junaidi was void. Amnesty said Ghalib has been beaten and flogged many times since his arrest. Under Islamic law in force in the UAE, a Muslim woman is not allowed to marry a non-Muslim unless the man converts to Islam.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 6, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Dutch Reformed Christians in rural Allegan, Mich., </B>are asking the national synod of the 292,000-member Christian Reformed Church to declare that tolerance for partial-birth abortion falls into the same category as Nazi war crimes against the Jews. <P> <B>The abortion rate in the United States dropped to its lowest level in 20 years in 1994</B>, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. A recorded 21 of every 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 had an abortion in 1994, the smallest number since 1976. About 1.2 million abortions were performed in 1994, down from 1.3 million the year before and the fourth straight decline. <BR><B>...Reasons for the reduction may include fewer unplanned pregnancies</B>, reduced access to abortion services, changes in attitudes to abortion, and aging of the American population, the CDC said. <P> <B>The Vatican will formally apologize for the &quot;anti-Semitic errors&quot; of Catholicism, </B>news reports said. The apology is part of an attempt to reconcile Christianity, Judaism, and Islam in time for the millennium, <I>The London Times</I> reported. The Pope instructed a new commission to examine the persecution and torture of Jews by the Inquisition in 15th-century Spain and the ambivalent attitude of Catholics toward the Nazi elimination of Jews during World War II. The commission is expected to hold two international symposiums on anti-Semitism at the Vatican in the fall. <BR><B>...The Pope has been &quot;increasingly preoccupied with the millennium</B>, which he speaks of in almost apocalyptic terms,&quot; the <I>Times</I> reported. The Pope has rehabilitated famous &quot;heretics&quot; Galileo and Darwin as part of his pre-millennium &quot;squaring accounts with history.&quot;  <P> <B>Youth With A Mission workers plan to deliver a Bible to every home</B> in the former Portuguese colony of Macau before it reverts to Chinese rule in 1999. The province, a peninsula and two small islands 40 miles west of Hong Kong, is a gambling and entertainment center with thousands of illegal immigrants, many of whom are involved  in drugs and prostitution. The name Macau means &quot;City of God.&quot; <BR><B>...YWAM workers will go door to door distributing the Bibles.</B> When every home has been contacted in a neighborhood, the residents will be invited to a local church or community building to hear more about the gospel. Some 400,000 Bibles will be distributed in Portuguese, Cantonese, Tagalog, and Mandarin. <P> <B>Men who struggle with their sexual identity can find help</B> from a Christian who understands their struggles. Keith Tiller meets with men who believe they are women trapped in males bodies, or who enjoy dressing in female clothes, according to Youth With A Mission <I>News Digest</I>. Tiller, who has an office in London, offers advice and prays as the men seek to change their lifestyles. Tiller formerly had a secret life as a cross-dresser and once considered undergoing a sex-change operation. <BR><B>...Tiller had to overcome a lot of shame in order to talk openly</B> about his past, he said. &quot;If I had my way I wouldn't be doing this. I'd be going along quite anonymously. But God has worked in my life and I believe he wants me to help bring healing and restoration to others.&quot; <P> <B>Sri Lankan priest Tissa Balasuriya has been excommunicated </B>for challenging beliefs of the Roman Catholic Church, the Vatican said. Balasuriya, a member of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate,  refused to retract claims made in his book, <I>Mary and Human Liberation. </I>The theologian had maintained that the sacrament of baptism wasn't necessary; refused to recognize the infallibility of the pope; questioned the divine nature of Jesus; denied the doctrine of original sin, which holds that all people are born with the stain of the sin of the first human beings; and denied that Mary was a virgin and was assumed bodily into heaven. <P> <B>Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan arrived in Tripoli, Libya,</B> Sunday for the third time in a year, the Libyan news agency reported. Libya awarded Farrakhan a human rights prize worth $250,000 in August, but the U.S. Treasury Department denied his application to receive the prize money or a $1 billion sum pledged by Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. <P> <B>Jerry Falwell doesn't plan to see <I>The People vs. Larry Flynt</I></B><I>. </I>The movie chronicles <I>Hustler</I> publisher Flynt's First Amendment court fight, which started when the magazine published a fake Falwell interview in 1983. <BR><B>...Falwell said he considers Flynt mentally deranged</B>. &quot;I pray for him on a regular basis and have for years. I don't believe he is beyond the grace of God.&quot; Falwell said he has not attended movies since he became a Christian 45 years ago. <P> <B>Madonna says her baby daughter, Lourdes, is going to read the Bible</B>. &quot;She'll certainly know about Catholicism,&quot; the singer told the British magazine <I>She</I>. &quot;I want my daughter to read the Bible, but I will explain to her that these are stories that people made up to teach people -- it's not the rule.&quot; Madonna also called television &quot;poison&quot; for children, and said she does not plan to marry Lourdes' father, Carlos Leon. <P> <B>Fires destroyed three small buildings at the former Branch Davidian compound</B> near Waco, Texas, late last week. Branch Davidian leader David Koresh and 75 followers died at the site in 1993 after their 51-day standoff with federal agents. <BR><B>...Last week's fires are thought to be of suspicious origin.</B> They leveled the home of Amo Bishop Roden, former common-law wife of one-time Branch Davidian leader George Roden, and two museums she used to chronicle the group's history. <P> <B>Pope John Paul will make his planned trip to Cuba in January 1998,</B> Cuban Cardinal Jaime Ortega announced. Meanwhile, a Vatican leader said the trip will &quot;in no way whitewash the Cuban regime nor cancel 30 years of repression.&quot; The Church will &quot;not easily forget his malfeasance,&quot; said Rosalio Jose Castillo Lara, the governor of Vatican City. <P> <B>Two-thirds of Americans say that Jesus is not their main focus for Christmas</B>, a poll by Barna Research Group found. When 1,008 people in 48 states were asked what made Christmas day important to them, 44% said family time. Other responses included parties and gift-giving (3%) and having a day off from work (3%). Five per cent said nothing was special about Christmas and 6% gave responses not covered in the other categories. The poll was done for Lutheran Hour Ministries.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 16, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Religious faith can make people healthier, doctors believe.</B> A Yankelovich Partners survey of 269 family doctors found that 99% of those asked said belief can have a profound influence on health and well-being. Some 91% of the doctors reported they have had patients who sought the aid of a rabbi, priest, or minister to help with their medical problem. <P> <B>Not only children, but 9% of adults believe in Santa Claus</B>, a <I>U.S. News and World Report</I> survey found. Forty-eight percent said the Santa Claus tradition detracts from the religious celebration of Christmas, while 20% said it enhances the holiday. Ninety percent said celebrating Christmas is important to them, but 69% said it has lost meaning. Some 70% said Christmas is the most significant Christian holiday to them, while 19% named Easter. Thirty-eight percent said they hear too little religious Christmas music, while 31% say they hear too much non-religious music. Sixty-three percent attend a religious service over Christmas and 68% give food, money, or clothing to the poor. <P> <B>Abortion protesters hope to spoil President Clinton's inaugural celebrations. </B>The Jan. 18-20 inaugural events overlap with protests against the Jan. 22 anniversary of Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion. <BR><B>...Inaugural day pro-life protests will include a Cemetery of Innocents display</B> of small white crosses -- meant to represent aborted babies -- near the Washington Monument. There also is expected to be a speaker's rally in Lafayette Park, just 100 yards from the reviewing stand where the president and first lady will watch the inaugural parade. Anti-abortion groups said they hope to line the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route with large full-color pictures of aborted fetuses. <P> <B>A pagan worshipper has become a magistrate, or minor judicial official, in England</B>. Aileen Grist, 42, said her Wiccan faith &quot;teaches me to see the god and goddesses in all people. So I will make court decisions on the act done by a person, rather than on their appearance,&quot; <I>The London Times</I> reported. Grist's living room in her home is a temple dedicated to Hermes, Aphrodite, and the Unconquered Sun. <P> <B>Some 300 Burundian refugees returning from Zaire were slaughtered</B> on the premises of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Muramba, about 25 miles north of  Bujumbura, the Burundi's capital, Adventist News Network said. According to reports from the area, the massacre took place Oct. 22 when the refugees were returning to their homes and had taken refuge at the church. <P> <B>Groups of thugs attacked a newly opened church in Bulgaria</B>, news reports said. The attacks appeared to be an effort to drive non-Orthodox Christians from Assenovgrad, a town near Plovdiv. The attacks followed a newspaper report that said a student who committed suicide had been under the influence of  an unnamed &quot;religious sect.&quot;  <P> <B>A Christian political movement has begun in Moscow</B>. The aim of the new All-Russian Christian Union is to become Russia's first major Christian Democratic movement. Similar attempts in the past have formed only marginal political groups, according to Mikhail Men, organizer of the new Christian Union. Men is a member of the Russian Duma, or parliament, and is the son of Alexander Men, a Russian Orthodox preacher and ecumenical theologian. The new movement will be largely Orthodox but open to other denominations so that &quot;people of democratic convictions for whom Christian principles are the cornerstone of their lives can influence the public life of the country,&quot; Men told Ecumenical News International. <P> <B>A missionary in Japan preached on national television</B> about the meaning of Christmas. The Fuji Film Company visited the Tokyo Baptist Church and recorded Southern Baptist pastor Norman Wood last week, Mission News Network reported. Wood's message then was broadcast to the Japanese people.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 30, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>To the alarm of those who favor tough drug policies, the legal use of marijuana is gaining support</B>. In California, three recent polls show 56%-58% of voters favor Proposition 215, the initiative that would legalize medical use of marijuana for those suffering from AIDS, cancer, glaucoma &quot;or any other illness for which marijuana provides relief.&quot; Users would not need a written prescription, but only a &quot;doctor's recommendation,&quot; <I>The New York Times</I> reported. <BR><B>...Public sympathy has been generated by people such as Judith Cushner, a former cancer sufferer</B>, who described on television how marijuana helped her through the pain of chemotherapy. &quot;Some day, you may need it,&quot; she warned. <BR><B>...Advocates of tough drug policies say they fear a massive loosening of control over marijuana use</B> in the nation's most populous state. The real motive of Proposition 215 is eventual legalization of marijuana, they say. Other states are watching California, which sometimes sets the pace on legislative issues. <BR><B>...Illegal drug use among teens has been increasing sharply</B>, several recent studies found. The National Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education found that the number of children in grades six through 12 using illicit drugs every day increased 147% in the past decade, <I>Family Issues Alert</I> said.  <P> <B>An Idaho county is arresting pregnant teen-agers and charging them with fornication</B>. The Gem County prosecuting attorney has used the state's 1921 law prohibiting sex between unmarried people to arrest 10 girls and their boyfriends, <I>The New York Times</I> reported.  <BR><B>...Teens usually plead guilty and are placed on probation for three years</B>. During that time, they are required to attend parenting classes, finish high school, stay employed, and not use drugs, alcohol, or cigarettes. <BR><B>...Gem County officials say they are trying to restore the social stigma</B> to teen-age pregnancy. Attempts elsewhere around the nation include more sex education, easier access to contraceptives, and tougher enforcement of statutory rape laws. In Orange county, Calif., some fathers face the choice of marriage or jail. <P> <B>A mother of  six was convicted Tuesday in Williamsport, Pa., of helping her stepson's 13-year-old girlfriend get an abortion</B>. Rose Marie Hartford was charged with driving the girl to New York -- without her parents' knowledge -- for an abortion in 1995. Pennsylvania has a strict parental-notification law. Hartford faces up to seven years in prison. The stepson, Michael Kilmer, 19, is serving a one-year to 30-month prison sentence for statutory rape. <P> <B>A South African Catholic priest who was an anti-apartheid activist said he was tortured</B>. Smangaliso Mkhatshwa told a committee in Johannesburg that military intelligence officers handcuffed, blindfolded, interrogated, and tortured him, Ecumenical News International reported. Mkhatshwa said he was stripped naked and forced to stand with a bag over his head for long periods without sleep. <P> <B>Interest in religion among Russians has grown in the five years since the collapse of the Soviet Union</B>, a poll confirmed. The All-Russian Public Opinion Research Centre found that 37% of respondents are not religious, as compared to 53% in 1991. Eight percent declined to comment as compared to 15.3% in 1991, Ecumenical News International reported. <BR><B>...Most of the growth is in the Orthodox Church.</B> Fifty percent of the country's adult population say they are Orthodox, compared to 30% in 1991. However, only an estimated 5% to 10% of them attend church. Four percent are Islamic, compared to 1% in 1991. The number of Roman Catholics, Protestants, Jews, and Buddhists are in the tenths of a percent, the poll found. <P> <B>Christian ministries have started in about half the areas of Calcutta, India</B>, according to the missions publication <I>Advance</I>. Twelve of  Calcutta's 65 people-groups have new churches, prayer groups number 650, and in five years 50 film and literature teams will be at work. <BR><B>...In Madras, India, the number of churches has grown from 700 in 1989 to 2,000 today</B>, <I>Advance</I> said. At least 400 new fellowships have been started in the last two years. <P> <B>Jerry Falwell has become a Southern Baptist</B>. Falwell and his Thomas Road Baptist Church in Lynchburg, Va., have been unaligned, although friendly with the Southern Baptist Convention. Falwell's move is a sign of support for the SBC's conservative policies, achieved after years of theological conflict in the 16 million-member denomination. <BR><B>...Falwell's affiliation follows the formation last month of the Southern Baptist Conservatives of Virginia</B>, a state group that mirrors the theological views of the SBC. The SBCV broke away from the 173-year-old Baptist General Association of Virginia, charging its leaders with liberalism. <P> <B>Half a million gospels of John will be sent to Mexico as part of a saturation evangelism</B> effort by the evangelical churches of Guadalajara, according to Bibles for Mexico. Thousands of New Testaments and Bible study courses also will be sent, according to Mission Network News. Members of evangelical churches in Guadalajara plan a door-to-door witnessing campaign.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 15, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Three American missionaries kidnapped four years ago by Colombian guerrillas</B> are still alive.  Costa Rican Vice Chancellor Rodrigo Carreras said missionaries David Mankins, Mark Rich, and Rick Tenefoff are being held somewhere in the country, ALC News Service reported.  The three were captured Jan. 31, 1993, in the Panamanian province of Darien, on the Colombian border. <BR><B>...Carreras said Costa Rica has attempted to obtain release of the missionaries</B> for  the past two years and that guerrilla leaders assured him the hostages are alive.  He made his statement to 3,500 Protestants from 27 countries who attended the Latin American 2000 Evangelism and Missions Congress in Panama recently. <P> <B>Egyptian soldiers destroyed a building at a Coptic Christian c</B>enter for mentally disabled children outside Cairo on Dec. 15.  According to <I>Compass Direct</I>, 300 soldiers broke into the desert-reclamation project, and used four army trucks, a dump truck, and a bulldozer to destroy a building. <BR><B>...Hany Fadel Abdel Mesih was arrested </B>when he tried to show the soldiers official papers for the project.  They began &quot;kicking and beating me as if I were a criminal,&quot; he told the independent weekly <I>Middle East Times</I>.  Egyptian censors have reportedly blocked publication of the incident. <BR><B>...The soldiers caused $20,000 damage.  </B>&quot;We stood helpless.  Every one of us was guarded by five soldiers at least,&quot; said engineer Adel Fahney.  They said that they came to demolish buildings that were &quot;built illegally on arable land.&quot;  But &quot;the whole area is desert!&quot; Mesih said.  &quot;It seems as if they were launching a war against us,&quot; said Ezzat Bishay, a project supervisor<B>.</B> <BR><B>...The order to destroy the building</B> may have come from soldiers at a nearby military base who had been demanding money, not from Cairo officials, the Dutch daily newspaper <I>Nederlands Dagblad</I> reported.  Anti-Christian feelings may have played a part in the attack, but only a thorough investigation will clarify whether the incident was related to growing Islamic fundamentalism within the Egyptian army, the paper said <br> <B>...Egypt's ancient Coptic Christian community</B> dates back to the beginning of the Christian era and comprises 15% of the country's population. <P> <B>Religion is increasingly a motivating force behind terrorism,</B> according to the director of the Center for Terrorism and Political Violence, located in Scotland.  Bruce Hoffman told a meeting of experts in Washington, D.C., that an increase in deaths from terrorism is due to the formation of more religious extremist groups, Reuter news service reported.  This includes &quot;amateur&quot; terrorists who acquire weapons, as well as the increasing competence of  &quot;professional&quot; terrorists, Hoffman said. <P> <B>Hungary's family life is declining rapidly, </B>a new report shows.  &quot;Our situation is worse now than at any time in the 20th century, which has itself been the worst period in our 1000-year history,&quot; Bishop Lorant Hegedus, head of Hungary's Reformed Church, told Ecumenical News Service. <BR><B>...All religious communities must stress social and moral renewal</B>, Hegedus said.  &quot;Calvinists, Lutherans, Roman Catholics, Jews must proclaim the need for real answers, for finding God again in today's new, troubled environment.&quot; <BR><B>...Hungary's Central Statistics Office reported a 5% drop in the 1996 birth rate</B> to 107,000, making it the lowest rate in a century.  The nation's population of 10,174,000 is expected to fall by 10% in the next 20 years.  Twenty-one percent of children born in 1996 were born out of wedlock, compared to 10% a decade ago, confirming a trend similar to that of Western countries. <BR><B>...Hungary suffers from a 10% unemployment rate</B>, a growing gap between rich and poor, and a 23% drop in the value of pensions over five years.  Some 3.5 million Hungarians live below the poverty level compared to one million in the 1980s.  There also has been a surge in abortions, to 75,000 a year. <BR><B>...The population decrease began under the &quot;moral destructiveness&quot; of communism</B> from 1956 to 1988, Hegedus told ENI.  But the transition to a market-based economy, combined with &quot;appalling, negative policies&quot; under the current socialist-led government, had created even harsher conditions, he said. <BR><B>...&quot;We hoped for high moral standards from the West</B>, but instead got libertinism and nihilism, which produced a second form of atheism to add to the still-widespread  influence of Marxism-Leninism,&quot; he said.  &quot;Our most important hope now comes from a post-atheist Christianity as more and more citizens who cannot believe in God themselves nevertheless conclude that they do not want their children to inherit the same spiritual vacuum.&quot; <P> <B>Some 7,000 worshippers regularly crowd into Wembly Area in London</B> to attend Holy Ghost Festivals.  The meetings are sponsored by The Redeemed Christian Church of God from Nigeria, which has 20 churches in London, <I>The London Times</I> reported.  Worshippers from many denominations attend to pray, sing and dance -&#173; sometimes all night long.  Since many of the worshippers could not see the stage clearly, the church suspended a &quot;gigantic cube packed with two tons of electronic technology&quot; over the choir to capture pictures from a number of smaller video display units.      </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 11, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>Thirteen Christians completed an 800-mile &quot;prayer walk&quot; though Georgia and the Carolinas</B>. They covered 15-45 miles a day for a month and a half, retracing the path of Gen. William T. Sherman's Union Army during the Civil War. Sherman's troops pillaged, burned, and raped as they rampaged through the region in 1864-1865. The interdenominational prayer group said its purpose was to ask God to break the legacy of hate, bitterness, and racism left by the war, and thus help &quot;remove an obstacle&quot; to national revival. <P> <B>Pentecostal and Charismatic movements worldwide have seen &quot;astonishing growth&quot;</B> over the past 26 years, according to researcher Justin Long of the Global Evangelization Movement. From .6% of the Christian world in 1900, Long projects the movements will include one-third of global Christianity by 2025. <P> <B>Pope John Paul met today in the Vatican with the leader of the world's six million Armenian Christians</B>, His Holiness Karekin I. The apostles Jude and Bartholomew introduced Armenia to Christianity, and in 301 A.D. Armenia became the first nation to adopt Christianity as a state religion. The Armenian Church is independent, having split from Byzantine Christianity before the Great Schism of 1054, which divided the Eastern and Western Churches. Pope John Paul said he hopes the two Churches eventually can reach full unity. <P> <B>A preacher who illegally bought food stamps on the street and exchanged them for food</B> for the poor faces two years in jail and a $5,000 fine. Slim Lake, founder of God's Church of the Streets in Toledo, Ohio, said he is not afraid of going to jail, but is worried about the poor who depend on him. Lake, 40, pleaded guilty Monday to trafficking in food stamps. He said that, if put on probation, he will stop buying food stamps and find other ways to feed his congregation. <P> <B>Yale University will spend $30 million to rebuild portions of its dilapidated Divinity School</B>. The move will reduce the size of the school, constructed in the 1930s, by about half. A year ago, the university said it would maintain the school's mission of training students for ordination but reduce the number of students and faculty. <P> <B>The <I>Jesus</I> film is being shown extensively in South America.</B> The Nazarene Church in South America is raising funds to buy buses that will be staffed by those traveling throughout the continent showing the evangelistic film about the life of Christ. They also will plant churches, Mission Network News reported. In Paraguay, 100,000 students saw the film in the first year after the country began allowing it to be shown in schools. <P> <B>Stealing of antique statues from cemeteries is becoming more common in the United States</B>. Thieves armed with crowbars drive their trucks into cemeteries when few people are around and steal angels, sundials, or lambs, <I>USA Today</I> reported. The looted items are resold to unscrupulous traders for up to $10,000.  <P> <B>Franklin Graham held a week-long evangelistic campaign in Honduras</B> last month. The effort included emergency relief aid for victims of the flooding that recently swept through the northern parts of the country.  <P> <B>The heads of the three branches of El Salvador's government </B>listened to evangelist Luis Palau preach last month. Palau conducted crusades in three cities Nov. 23-29, coinciding with the country's centennial celebration of the introduction of evangelical missions. Missionaries with Central American Mission, now CAM International, planted the first evangelical church in El Salvador one hundred years ago. Some 300 leaders attended the nation's first prayer breakfast Nov. 27, which included a talk by Campus Crusade for Christ founder Bill Bright.    </font></p>

Human rights groups say a third of East Timor's population, or about 200,000 people, died during the invasion, subsequent fighting, or famine. <BR><B>...Indonesian troops killed dozens of pro-independence East Timorese protesters in 1991</B>. Bishop Belo prompted the government to investigate the killings, which led to the dismissal of two generals and the imprisonment of several army officers.  <BR><B>...The Noble Peace Prize committee said it hoped to focus world attention</B> on East Timor's struggle for independence, which it said is in danger of being forgotten by the rest of the world. The island is located midway between the Indonesian island of Java and the northwestern tip of Australia. Indonesia expressed &quot;regret&quot; at the awards. <P> <B>JAKARTA, Indonesia</B> - Five people died inside a church when a mob burned nine churches, four Christian schools, and a convent in the Indonesian town of Situbondo, on Java island, Reuters news service said. Some 2,000-3,000 people rioted during the incident. The crowd also destroyed a court building and cars, police said. Several arrests reportedly have been made. <BR><B>...The riot apparently broke out after a court hearing in a case of alleged blasphemy against Islam</B>, a journalist in Situbondo said. Several thousand people outside the court demanded that the accused be sentenced immediately or handed over to the crowd. Indonesia is overwhelmingly Moslem, but the state preaches religious tolerance and recognizes five main religions. Situbondo is 100 miles east of  Surabaya, where attacks on churches were reported in June. <P> <B>SLOVAKIA</B> -  For the first time, family issues will be aired from an evangelical perspective on national radio. Beginning this weekend, short, weekly programs will use material from Focus On the Family, Mission Network News said. Listeners who respond to the programs will receive printed information.  <P> <B>WASHINGTON, D.C</B>. - A commission being created to study gambling's impact on society is in danger of  stacking the deck in favor of appointees tied to the industry, two lawmakers said. Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.), who sponsored the bill that created the commission, and Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), said they were concerned by reports that two pro-gambling appointments to the commission were being considered. One member of the 9-person committee already has been appointed: James Dobson, president of Focus on the Family. <P> <B>KABUL, Afghanistan</B> - The two-week old administration of the radical Islamic Taleban is looking precarious, reports said. Its militia has faced guerrilla assaults near the Afghan capital by commanders and units loyal to former military chief Ahmad Rashid Masood. Also, foes to the north have formed a military alliance. <BR><B>...Moderate elements in the Taleban may welcome talks</B> with rivals, Reuter news service said. But more hard-line Taleban leaders may want to push through their Jihad (Holy War) to its conclusion. <P> <B>NORTH KOREA</B> - Evan Carl Hunziker, an American being detained in North Korea on espionage charges, will get a visit today from a Swedish envoy acting in the interest of the U.S. government, the State Department said. Hunziker, who went to the Far East as an unaffiliated Christian missionary, was arrested on Aug. 24 after crossing from China. <P> <B>JERUSALEM, Israel</B>  - Jerusalem police were on alert Friday against possible renewed Israeli-Palestinian violence. They feared that Jewish extremists would try to attack the Temple Mount before a small, new mosque opens there next week near the controversial archeological tunnel operated by Israel. Violence erupted two weeks ago when Israel opened an exit to the tunnel; 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis were killed. <P> <B>NEW DELHI, India</B> - McDonald's is opening its first restaurant in India next week. In keeping with Hindu religious practices, the restaurant's Maharaja Mac sandwich will contain no beef, company officials said. Hindus, who make up 80% of  India's 940 million people, do not eat beef, and many are vegetarians. The Maharaja Mac will contain mutton, eaten by Hindus and Muslims. <P> <B>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla</B>. -- Astronaut Shannon Lucid, who returned Sept. 26 after an 188-day space flight, is the daughter of Baptist missionaries. Asked if her spiritual life has been changed by the flight -- the longest by an American -- she said, &quot;I like to think that it was the same as it was basically my whole life. The location of  where you are, to me, doesn't necessarily affect your spiritual life.&quot;    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 14, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...&quot;Large numbers of Americans are biblical illiterates</B> and lack awareness and understanding of their own religious traditions and the central doctrines of their faith,&quot; the researchers said. &quot;We want the fruits of faith, but less of the obligations.&quot;  <P> <B>Social well-being in the United States has fallen to its lowest point in 25 years</B>, researchers at Fordham University say. Children and young people are suffering the most, according to their study of government statistics on 16 social problems<I>, The 1996 Index of Social Health</I>. Child abuse, teen-age suicide, drug abuse and the high school dropout rate all worsened in 1994, the report found.  <BR><B>...The report is &quot;a warning,&quot;</B> Marc Miringoff, director of the Institute for Innovation in Social Policy at the Fordham Graduate Center in Tarrytown, N.Y., told<I> The New York Times</I>. Miringoff noted pessimism among youth, isolation, less sense of community, and a teen suicide rate 95% higher than in 1970. <P> <B>A reported 500,000 people have seen the <I>Jesus </I>film in churches and homes in China</B> <B>in the last 12 months, </B>Mission Network News said. One fellowship of 30 Christians grew to 500 in a few years through weekly showings of the video drama, which depicts the life of  Christ. The film, distributed by Campus Crusade for Christ, is available in nine of China's primary languages. <P> <B>Vatican officials are debating if and when to disclose</B> what is causing Pope John Paul's left hand to tremble violently, Reuters news service said. The Vatican has not denied media reports that the Pope, 76, who underwent a successful appendectomy last week, may be suffering from Parkinson's disease or a related neurological disorder. The Pope also sometimes suffers from rigidity of the facial muscles and a slow, stooped gait, reports said; these also can be symptoms of Parkinson's or a related disorder. <P> <B>A cult leader in Taiwan admitted he swindled up to $3 billion</B> from thousands of followers, news reports said. &quot;Please don't believe in me any more,&quot; said Sung Chi-li, who had claimed he was the reincarnation of a &quot;cosmic body&quot; and had supernatural healing powers. During nine hours of  questioning by police, Sung was unable to display special powers. He tearfully confessed to defrauding his followers -- who had worshipped him like a god -- of land, cars, and cash, police said. <BR><B>...Sung attracted followings in Taiwan and China by using photographs that appeared to show him with a  halo</B> or levitating above the Great Wall, Reuters news service said.  A cult photographer arrested in the scam admitted that he faked the pictures. <P> <B>More than a million men have attended 20 Promise Keepers men's conferences so far this summer, </B>the organization said.<B> </B>Two conferences remain: at Jacksonville Municipal Stadium Oct. 18-19 and Texas Stadium in Irving Oct. 25-26. <BR><B>...Some 52,436 men attended the PK convention at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium in Memphis</B>, Tenn., last weekend. Speakers included Christian author John Trent, psychologist Gary Oliver, and Prison Fellowship chairman Charles Colson. Teen-ager Shon Stewart, who has cerebral palsy, sang <I>These Things to Be True</I> from his wheelchair. The song focuses on the relationship between a father and son. <P> <B>The tragedy of  burned churches has resulted in an unprecedented spirit of cooperation</B> among blacks and whites of various religions, according to a leader of the rebuilding effort. Arsonists meant the fires  to harm, but God means them for good, according to Sullivan Robinson, deputy director of the Washington-based Congress of National Black Churches. She spoke to the National Rebuilding Initiative, a public and private effort to reconstruct dozens of burned churches. <P> <B>Abdurrahman Wahid, leader of Indonesia's largest Moslem group, apologized</B> and asked for forgiveness for an attack by a mob of  10,000 Muslims on churches in East Java last week, Reuters news service said. Reports said five people died in the rioting, and 21 Christian churches, five Catholic elementary schools, and one Christian orphanage were burned. The riot broke out after a court hearing in a case of alleged  blasphemy against Islam. Wahid said members of the group he leads, the 30-million-member Nahdlatul Ulama, probably were responsible for the destruction.  <P> <B>The government of Egypt placed 608 private mosques under state control</B> as part of a campaign to prevent Muslim extremists from using them to promote their ideas, UPI reported. The decree, which involved 21 mosques, is part of a plan to bring all mosques under control of  the Ministry of Religious Endowments. A proposed law would restrict the building of mosques by individuals and bar preachers not licensed by the government from serving at mosques. <P> <B>Armstrong Williams, an African-American conservative radio commentator</B>, will leave his call-in show with Salem Radio Network, a Christian network, to join the secular division of USA Radio Network, <I>The Washington Post</I> said.     </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for January 22, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>The religious affiliations of members of Congress reflect those of the nation</B>, according to a survey by demographer Albert Menendez.  The conservative political tone of the new 105th Congress corresponds to an increase in the number of theologically conservative representatives and a decline in the number of more liberal mainline Protestants.  Menendez' findings were published recently by Religion News Service. <BR><B>...Catholics, the largest religious group </B>in the United States, also are the largest religious group in Congress, with 151 of the 535 members.  Southern Baptists, the nation's second largest religious group, have 67 members. <BR><B>...Other religious groups in Congress</B> are: United Methodists (59), Presbyterians (55), Episcopalians (42), Jews (35), unspecified Protestants (28), Lutherans (22), Mormons (14), United Church of Christ (10), and &quot;Christians&quot; (10).  There are six Eastern Orthodox Christians, 30 members who belong to a variety of smaller religious organizations, one member of the reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and seven who claim no religious affiliation.   <P> <B>The U.S. Supreme Court is allowing a group of 13 states </B>to argue against the constitutionality of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  The court said Ohio, representing 12 other states, can join in arguments Feb. 19 when the justices hear the case of Boerne, Texas, vs. Flores.  Boerne is trying to keep a Catholic church from changing its historical facade.  At least four additional states have challenged the validity of RFRA. <BR><B>...The states say RFRA has &quot;disrupted several core functions&quot;</B> of government, including &quot;running prisons, educating children, defining criminal laws (and) exercising other police powers.&quot; RFRA has generated a wave of litigation and allowed &quot;violent inmate gangs, racist organizations, drug distributors, and like-minded groups to shroud illicit activity under the cover of  religious belief,&quot; the states said. <BR><B>...A coalition of 75 religious and civil-liberties groups</B> that worked together for passage of RFRA in 1993 now is defending its constitutionality.  The Coalition for the Free Exercise of Religion has filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the case. <P> <B>A grenade fuse exploded at 7:45 a.m. Wednesday across the street from a Planned Parenthood clinic</B> less than a mile from the White House.  There was no apparent damage.  News reports said the device was a M228 fuse, commonly used by the military and police departments for training; it is intended to cause a flash and loud noise without explosive damage.  Today is the 24th anniversary of the Supreme Court's ruling in Roe vs. Wade legalizing abortion nationwide. <P> <B>Campus Crusade for Christ and the Southern Baptist Convention</B> are planning a joint evangelistic effort to reach young people.  Twenty-five leaders of the two groups met in Atlanta Jan. 17 to discuss the project and appointed a task force to plan details.  Several cooperative initiatives already are occurring, including True Love Waits (an abstinence movement), See You At The Pole (prayer at schools), and Right From Wrong (headed by evangelist Josh McDowell).  Campus Crusade, based in Orlando, Fla., is a parachurch organization known for its evangelistic ministries on college and high school campuses.   <P> <B>Parents who think their children may be using drugs</B> can use a home drug-testing kit.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved a kit, available without a prescription, called &quot;Dr. Brown's Home Drug Testing System.&quot; It tests urine for marijuana, PCP, amphetamines, cocaine, heroin, codine and morphine.  The kits are expected to be on the market within six weeks and cost about $30 each. <BR><B>...Users collect the sample and send results to a lab,</B> receiving results one to three days after the lab receives the sample.  The testing center gives results of the test and offers referrals for drug abuse counseling. <P> <B>Feminists have threatened to force their way into a monastery </B>in Spain to see a painting of the Virgin Mary.  Carthusian monks appealed to the Pope for help after feminist groups threatened their monastery near Zaragoza, home to the largest mural in Spain, <I>The London Times</I> reported.  Only men are permitted to enter the monastery, so women have never seen Goya's work.  Women's groups say they should be allowed to see the painting because it was restored recently using public money.   <P> <B>Pope John Paul II will visit the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo</B> in April, the Vatican announced.  The pontiff tried to visit Sarajevo during the war, but the trip was put off for security reasons.  Most of the city's 300,000 people are Muslims or Orthodox Christians. <P> <B>Episcopalian priest Chester LaRue was charged with drug trafficking</B> after police found him smoking crack cocaine as he wrote his Sunday sermon, news reports said.  Police said LaRue, 53, and three other people had 17 bags of crack in the rectory of St. John's Episcopal Church in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, N.Y. <P> <B>A 69-year-old man suffering from stomach cancer has committed suicide</B>, becoming the third Australian to do so under the euthanasia law of the Northern Territory.  Doctors  said the man's death shows the controversial law is working.  Under the law, a terminally ill person needs the signatures of a doctor, psychiatrist, and a specialist before killing himself.  The federal parliament is considering a bill to overturn the law. <P> <B>Former pop star Cat Stevens</B>, who converted to Islam, changed his name to Jusuf Islam, and gave up his music career in the 1970s, plans to produce a recording of Bosnian music.  Yusuf wrote two songs for the album, one of which was dedicated to the memory of children killed in Bosnia and last year's massacre at a school in Dunblane, Scotland.  Yusuf sold 25 million albums before devoting his life to religion.  He has been out of the recording business for 17 years.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for February 3, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A conservative Anglican group plans to set up a network of bishops</B> from England and other countries to provide oversight to churches, bypassing the archbishops of Canterbury and York.  The group, called Reform, opposes ordination of women and practicing homosexuals.  Reform says its membership is 600 clergy and 1,300 lay members. <P> <B>Twenty Catholic, Jewish, mainline Protestant, Orthodox, and evangelical leaders</B> will be in Washington, D.C., this week to tell members of Congress and the Clinton administration that protection of nature is important to the poor and vulnerable.  The gathering is being organized by the National Religious Partnership for the Environment, comprising the National Council of Churches, the Evangelical Environmental Network, the Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, and U.S. Catholic Conference.  In its three years of operation, the group's program manuals have gone out to 100,000 congregations.   <BR><B>...&quot;For us it really is a biblical issue, a spiritual issue,&quot;</B> Stan LeQuire of Wynwood, Pa., director of the Evangelical Environmental Network, told the <I>Christian Science Monitor</I>.  The evangelical group has 1,100 affiliate churches and several hundred campus organizations.    <P> <B>Miami city commissioners are siding with a strip club in a zoning battle with a church</B>, UPI reported.  The Church of God of Holiness of Christ bought a building next  to the Take One Lounge.  A city ordinance prohibits nude entertainment within 500 feet of a church, but officials say the club's owner has rights under zoning codes since his club was there first. <P> <B>Covenant House, a home for runaway teens, </B>is making contact with more than 1,500 runaways a year in Atlantic City, N.J.  Of those contacted, 212 participated in the shelter's programs, including job placement, drug counseling and life-skills training.  Covenant House is about to open a $2.8 million center with 27 beds, a separate room for mothers with children, a kitchen and dining area, a chapel, and a health clinic, Reuters news service reported.  Runaways often are attracted to Atlantic City, which has 13 casino hotels and more than 30 million visitors annually. <P> <B>Massachusetts Gov. William Weld says he will try to have the murder conviction</B> against abortion clinic gunman John Salvi III reinstated.  A jury found Salvi guilty of murdering two receptionists and wounding five other people at two abortion clinics in suburban Boston Dec. 31, 1994.  But a lower court last week threw out the conviction, saying that if a person dies before appeals are heard, their slates are wiped clean. <P> <B>A declining New Zealand congregation donated its building --</B> complete with 250-seat auditorium, children's center, offices, and book store -- to a growing congregation.  Members of the Piako Christian fellowship in Te Aroha, whose attendance had been steadily decreasing, gave the building to the Apostolic Church of New Zealand, which plans to plant new churches, according to <I>Apostolic News</I>.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for December 12, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>A Lutheran pastor saved 700,000 books from destruction in the former East Germany.</B> Martin Weskott earned the nickname &quot;the book pastor&quot; for his attempts to save books discarded by the millions after Germany was unified in 1990. Libraries threw out the old books, assuming they would soon get newer ones from the West, news reports said. Even science and engineering texts that carried references to socialism were discarded. Weskott took books from heaps by the side of the road and stored them in monastery barns. <BR><B>...One of the books proved invaluable to scientists at Max Planck Institute</B> in Katlenburg-Lindau. When researchers needed certain information for the Cassini Probe on its planned seven-year voyage to Saturn, they turned to Weskott and his barns. There they found the information they needed. <P> <B>A land-mine victim now leads a Christian ministry to other amputees in Cambodia</B>. Iv Vanna Rith of the Khmer Baptist Convention helps the disabled, who often think they are useless, to regain hope. He tells them about the new hope he gained through Jesus Christ, Baptist Press reported. During three months, 29 handicapped people made professions of faith in Christ through Rith's ministry.  <BR><B>...Rith began holding worship services for the new converts</B> in November, 1995. Since then, 100 people have accepted Christ as their savior. The church Rith started meets in six groups throughout the city, and he visits each of them twice a week. <P> <B>An Alabama judge refuses to stop praying in his courtroom.</B> Etowah County Circuit Judge Roy S. Moore said he will defy a ruling prohibiting prayer in his courtroom, Baptist Press reported. Moore opens jury selection with a prayer from visitors or clergy members. Circuit Judge Charles Price banned prayers in any Alabama courtroom, saying it violates the First Amendment. <BR><B>...Price's ruling came a few days after Moore was unseated from a divorce case</B> in which the woman is alleged to have had a lesbian affair. The woman and her attorney filed suit, claiming Moore's Christian beliefs prevented him from being impartial in the proceedings.  <P> <B>As Ethiopian Airlines Flight 961 was about to crash in the Indian Ocean</B> last month, the stewardesses held hands in the tail of the plane and prayed, then asked passengers to become Christians, according to Joe Harding of SIM, who talked to survivors of the crash. Passenger Andy Meekins shared his faith and tried to keep people calm during the crisis, Mission Network News reported. Meekins and two friends from World Vision, Ato Beyene Gutema and Ato Zelalem Ayenew, were on their way to Nairobi for an urban ministry conference; all three died in the crash, Harding said. <P> <B>Co-premier Prince Norodom Ranariddh of Cambodia had his head and eyebrows shaved</B> in a ceremony marking his entry into the monkhood for one week, Reuter news service reported. Ranariddh was following a royal family tradition by briefly serving as a monk. <P> <B>A homosexual Mardi Gras in Sydney, Australia, is gaining corporate support.</B> Qantas Airways began sponsoring the event in 1995 and telecommunications company Telstra began last year. Family department store Grace Bros. became the latest backer, agreeing to sponsor the post-parade party called the Sleaze Ball. Grace Bros. also will sell Mardi Gras merchandise. The Mardi Gras is a month-long festival, culminating in a parade that attracted 600,000 spectators last year. <P> <B>A court in Kentucky denied a zoning request for a creation museum</B>. Ken Ham, executive director of Answers in Genesis, wanted to build Genesis Park on the site of a farm in Union, but the Boone County Fiscal Court denied his request to rezone the land. Ham blamed &quot;Cincinnati skeptics&quot; and the humanist organization Free Inquiry Group for opposing the project. Ham said he will fight the decision and search for a new location in Kentucky or Ohio. <P> <B>Financially struggling denominations, including the Episcopal Church, </B>increasingly are hoping to tap into donations from members' wills, Ecumenical News International reported. Financial analysts estimate that the older generation of Americans will give away, in their wills, more than $10 trillion in the next few decades. <P> <B>As the result of the overhaul in the federal welfare system, </B>state officials are calling on the religious community to provide more than soup kitchens for the homeless. In Maryland, social service officials asked congregations to help provide child care and transportation for poor families, administer cash benefits, and broker adoptions<I>, The Washington Post</I> reported. <BR><B>...But Maryland religious leaders say they will not cooperate.</B> A coalition of clerics said their congregations cannot afford to assume services to the poor that once were provided by the government. They insist the government is trying to dump its responsibilities on churches when churches already are doing all they can. <P> <B>After high-level opposition, the Vatican suspended its Internet service</B>. According to the Italian newspaper <I>La Stampa</I>, Vatican hierarchy questioned the value and purpose of the web site. Subscribers paid $400 a year for access to information about the Pope's activities, a selection of papal speeches and homilies in Spanish, English, or French, and email to the Vatican.    </font></p>

There has been a vast spiritual vacuum here which the church has not effectively touched.&quot; <P> <B>Attacks  such as those on churches in East Java last week could happen again</B>, the leader of Indonesia's largest Islamic organization said. Abdurrahman Wahid, head of the 30-million person Nahdlatul Ulama, told Reuters that intolerance was the cause of  attacks on the 25 churches. Church groups in Surabaya say six people were killed, including a pastor, his wife and two children, who were trapped in a burning church. The mob was angered by a court hearing in a blasphemy case. Photos of the aftermath of the attacks can be found <A HREF= http://fica.visi.com/GerejaSBY/persecution.html>here.</A> <BR><B>...Some Islamic leaders promote a type of nationalism that derides other religions, Wahid said</B>. Instead, religious leaders should promote mutual understanding and &quot;be at home with pluralism in religion.&quot; <P> <B>Crowds packed an 8,000-seat hockey arena in Central Ontario, Canada</B>, Oct. 5-9 for a crusade led by Franklin Graham. Others watched from a 2,000-seat overflow arena equipped with a closed-circuit giant screen television. Some 1,200 people made decisions for Christ during the crusade, held in the city of Kitchener. Christian musicians Ricky Skaggs, Paul Overstreet, Dennis Agajanian, Crystal Lewis, and the Maranatha! Praise Band opened each evening's events. Special meetings were held for children and teenagers. Graham, the son of Billy Graham, also addressed 250 students and faculty at the University of Waterloo. <P> <B>Wycliffe Bible Translators is working on a new Scripture version in Persian</B>. It will present the gospel in the language of 100 million people, the group said. <P> <B>Homeless people in Moscow are being sent away against their will. </B> So far, the city has deported 6,000 homeless people, who have been detained for up to 30 days and loaded onto trains bound for villages where they grew up or were residents,<I> The New York Times</I> said. Police estimate 20,000 people live on the streets in Moscow, a city of  8 million. <P> <B>Pygmies and the Water People in Zaire reportedly are responding in large numbers to the gospel</B>. Churches are being formed in the equatorial forests through evangelistic efforts of families living near the rivers, AD2000 Unreached Peoples News said. Two missionaries in the Bosuka region have seen 7,000 formerly unreached people become Christians.  Near Kivu, 44 new churches have evangelists, deacons, and choirs.  <P> <B>Ecumenical organizations risk becoming service agencies</B> indistinguishable from other non-governmental organizations, an American ecumenist said. &quot;If they are not careful, the National Council of Churches and the World Council of Churches will be trapped into becoming secular service agencies, seeking funding from government and secular agencies,&quot; said Paul A. Crow, Jr., president of the Council for Christian Unity, Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Crow, a member of the WCC Central Committee, said the WCC must resist the idea that the church must be &quot;servants of human causes.&quot; <P> <B>Republican vice presidential candidate Jack Kemp said he thinks Louis Farrakhan's message</B> of self-help last year at the Million Man March was &quot;wonderful.&quot; In a <I>Boston Globe</I> interview Sept. 8, Kemp said he does not endorse all of Farrakhan's teachings, but described the march as a &quot;celebration of responsible fatherhood, individual initiative...and getting an opportunity to be the man that God meant you to be.&quot;    <P> <B>A federal judge refused to throw out a defamation lawsuit filed by four professors</B> at Louisiana College, a Baptist school.  Judge Tom Yeager of Louisiana's 9th District Court in Alexandria ruled Sept. 24 that the defendants had a right to sue Leon Hyatt of Pineville and the theologically conservative group Hyatt led. The group wrote and mailed 21 letters criticizing the professors. <BR><B>...Judge Yeager said the criticisms were not protected by the First Amendment</B> since the dispute did not involve internal church matters, Associated Baptist Press said. Hyatt and the other defendants were acting on their own, without authority from an ecclesiastical body, the judge said.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for October 10, 1996</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><BR><B>...The proposed Concordat of Agreement </B>provides that the future ordinations of bishops will involve ordaining bishops from both churches. As a result, all Lutheran bishops eventually would be incorporated into the &quot;historic succession,&quot; or continuity in the ordination of bishops from the early church to the present. Sixteenth century Lutheran reformers stressed the functions of ordained ministry over tradition. <BR><B>...At the meeting, Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey drew parallels</B> between the Concordat and a new agreement between the Anglicans and Lutherans in northern Europe. &quot;Will the mission of the church be stronger for unity?  My unhesitating answer is yes, it will be,&quot; Carey said. <P> <B>A small mosque is opening in the Israeli Parliament building in Jerusalem</B>. It will serve as a prayer room for the Arab members of the Knesset, the <I>Jerusalem Post</I> said. The prayer room is furnished with prayer mats, a closet for prayer books, and a picture of the Aksa Mosque on Temple Mount. <P> <B>New Jersey is using finger scanning to identify welfare applicants &quot;double dipping&quot; by applying in more than one location</B> under false names and counterfeit ID cards, Intercessors for America said. New York will cooperate with New Jersey, using computerization of the fingerprint patterns of welfare recipients, IFA said. <BR><B>...Other states are expected to use finger scanning</B>, building a nationwide network, IFA said. Credit cards and check-out counters soon will use fingerprint scanning.    <P> <B>Oct. 11 is National Coming Out of Homosexuality Day</B> -- organized to help people who want to leave the homosexual lifestyle -- as well as National Coming Out Day, organized to affirm the homosexual lifestyle. Conservatives also have formed the group Parents and Friends of Ex-Gays. <P> <B>Christian pen pals in North America are being sought to disciple new believers in Russia</B>. Dan Wooding of ASSIST Ministries said he has received 76,000 letters from new believers in the former Soviet Union -- many of  them young people -- who are looking for pen pals in the West. For a packet of information, contact ASSIST at P. O. Box 2126, Garden Grove, CA 92842-2126. Call (800) 222-6441 to be enrolled over the phone. <P> <B>Several hundred Christians from a variety of denominations</B> marched through downtown Sydney, Australia, Oct. 7 carry placards in support of marriages between a male and female. The marchers denounced what they described as subtle actions taking place in society to undermine marriage. Moves are being made in the Uniting Church and the government to downgrade marriage as society has always known it, the marchers said. The march closed with speeches, prayer, and hymn-singing. <P> <B>More than 2,000 Muslim texts now are available on CD-ROM</B> as part of a project to make 5,000 of the most significant Islamic works available on computer, <I>The Christian Science Monitor</I> said. Eventually, they will put these volumes on the Internet for worldwide use. <BR><B>...Muslim scholars in Qom, Iran, are entering the information onto computers.</B> Each volume takes 500 hours to input and edit. Most are interpretations of the Koran and its laws that have been analyzed and passed down by Muslim scholars since Islam began in the 7th century. Recently, scholars from the Vatican visited Qom to examine references to Christianity in Islamic texts. <P> <B>The picture emerging from arrests in the arson attacks on African-American churches in the South is complex</B>, <I>The Washington Post</I> said. More than a third of the suspects charged in recent months in the attacks are black, according to federal law enforcement officials. In the past 21 months, two-thirds of those arrested for burning black churches have been white and 34% African American. The figures suggest that while race is factor in some cases, other motivations are involved, <I>The Post </I>said. <BR><B>...The U.S. Commission on Civil Rights said Wednesday,</B> after issuing its report on black church fires in the South, that it would formulate a grass-roots plan to bridge the divide. It plans to meet with Southern governors and political leaders before implementing community-based programs promoting racial tolerance. <P>   <P> <B>Lutheran theologian Walter Wangerin, Jr., has developed a liturgy to be used after a divorce</B>. The church uses rituals for other situations involving grief, but &quot;at the death of a marriage, the church remains distant and mute -- baffled perhaps since it presumes sin in divorce.&quot; But &quot;forgiveness is our stock in trade,&quot; he said. <P> <B>A 10-minute break is church time for Sunday workers at a tire-manufacturing plant</B> in Roanoke, Va.  About 60 of the 200 employees at Yokohama Tire Corp. gather in the lobby to recite the Lord's Prayer and listen to a lay preacher speak. Then employees join hands and pray for fellow workers who have been laid off or become ill. After a quick exchange of handshakes and some hugs, they return to the production floor. It's better than a cup of coffee, and it makes it feel like the Lord's day even though its a work day, employees say.    </font></p>

&nbsp;<br><font face="Arial, Helvetica" size=4 color="#990051"><B>Summary for February 7, 1997</B></font><P><font size="2" face="Arial, Helvetica"><P> <B>First lady Hillary Clinton has echoed her husband's call for bipartisanship.  </B>&quot;I have felt often as though I were thrown into a breach, and I have felt other times that I wish to push someone into a breach,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said to chuckles from her luncheon audience<B> </B>at Thursday's National Prayer Breakfast in Washington D.C.  &quot;I have to confess it has crossed my mind that you could not be a Republican and a Christian.&quot; <BR><B>...She described an encounter the previous night</B> with a man who asked her forgiveness.  &quot;For most of the last four years, I have worked very hard to destroy you,&quot; she quoted him as saying.  &quot;I was taken aback,&quot; Mrs. Clinton said.  &quot;What I should have said is, 'I don't know you and I don't know anything about you, but I want you to forgive me also, because I am sure that in my moments of frustration and anger I have said terrible things about people like you -- and I have thought even worse.&quot;  Her remarks won a standing ovation. <P> <B>Canada's Supreme Court ordered a new trial for a farmer convicted</B> of killing his disabled daughter.  The farmer, Robert Latimer, was convicted of murder in 1994 for killing his 12-year-old daughter, Tracy, who had severe cerebral palsy.  Many Canadians sympathize with him, which disturbs advocates for the disabled.  Latimer says prosecutors do not understand how much agony his daughter endured. <BR><B>...Latimer had been sentenced to life in prison</B> with no chance of parole for 10 years.  But the Supreme Court ruled that he deserved a new trial because prosecutors should not have questioned prospective jurors about their views on mercy killing, abortion and religion.  Latimer's confession to police can be used in his second trial. <P> <B>A public high school must allow a student religious club to use an empty classroom</B> during a lunch period if secular clubs can do the same, a federal appeals court ruled Thursday.  The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled in favor of Melanie Rose Ceniceros, a former student at San Diego's University City High School.  In 1992, she was denied permission to hold a meeting during lunch even though several other voluntary, noncurricular student groups and clubs meet during the same time. <BR><B>...School groups must have equal access, </B>meaning their rights are defined by the extent to which other groups were permitted to meet, Judge Melvin Brunetti ruled, citing the federal Equal Access Act.   <P> <B>Egypt's two top Muslim officials are disputing</B> whether women are too sensitive to hold positions of power.  The dispute could have wide implications, since the two clerics are respected throughout the Muslim world.  Sheik Nasr Farid Wassel, Egypt's top theologian, says women are too soft and sensitive to hold top jobs.  The grand imam of the al-Azhar responded that women are fit for any job.  Egyptian women doubt that the debate will produce immediate changes. Some worry it will affect how young women think of themselves and how young men think of them. <P> <B>Police in Pakistan's central province of  Punjab fired on rioting Muslims </B>enraged by rumors that Christians committed blasphemy against the Koran.  Thousands of armed Muslims took to the streets Wednesday, shouting for a holy war against Christians.  The mob reportedly burned down homes and a Salvation Army church, assaulted women, and killed cattle.  Two men were killed.  The trouble began when pages torn from the Koran, carrying the names of several Christians, were thrown into several mosques during prayers.  Christians denied involvement, and said local police could have done it to avenge a Christian protest last month against alleged police excesses. <P> <B>A 15-year-old boy was charged Thursday with bomb and gunfire attacks</B> on an abortion clinic in Tulsa, Okla.  The Reproductive Services Clinic in Tulsa has been attacked three times since the start of 1997. <P> <B>An anti-abortion campaign has begun in Britain.  </B>England's new Pro-Life Alliance promised this week to support 50 to 70 political candidates against pro-choice members of the major political parties in the next election.  The privately funded alliance stands for &quot;absolute respect for innocent human life from fertilization until natural death.&quot; Members distributed a long list of pro-choice candidates, many of them top members of the opposition Labour Party. <P> <B>Roman Catholic investigators have concluded that a statue of the Madonna did weep blood</B>, <I>Il Messaggero</I> newspaper said Thursday.  A commission studied the statue in Civitavecchia, north of Rome, holding 14 meetings and listening to 50 eyewitness accounts regarding the white plaster statue.  Initial scientific tests revealed that the red liquid streaking the statue's cheeks was male blood, but there has been no explanation as to how it got there.  A local magistrate ordered church authorities to impound the statue pending an investigation into whether it was a hoax. <P> <B>Southern Baptists are offering help to people struggling with sexual addictions</B> at <A HREF=http://www.rtvc.org/helplink >HelpLink</A>.  &quot;Sexual addiction is a much greater problem, even among church members, than most Christians want to admit,&quot; said counselor Darel Robertson.  Many sexual addicts &quot;find hope on our pages.&quot;  Sexual addiction is a state of devotion to erotic feelings that reinforce a need for new and more exciting experiences.

The Pope accepted Castro's invitation to visit Cuba next year. In the 35-minute meeting, the Pope, 76, was expected to urge more freedom for the Catholic Church in Cuba<B> </B>and permission for foreign priests to work on the island. Castro, 70, one of the world's last-remaining Marxist leaders, welcomes papal criticism of the U.S. embargo against Cuba. The Pope has faulted the long-standing blockade for causing suffering to the island's poor. Media were not allowed to be present during the meeting. <BR><B>...Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev met with the Pope on Monday,</B> his fourth visit to the Vatican since 1989. Many people consider Gorbachev's first trip to the Vatican as a landmark in the decline of Communism. Observers said the timing of the Pope's meetings with Castro and Gorbachev appeared to be deliberate, and that the Pope wanted to remind Castro that the Cuban system is bankrupt. <P> <B>More than 200 million people can hear Chuck Swindoll's <I>Insight for Living</I></B> Bible teaching in the Hindi language over Trans World Radio in India. Roger Kemp of <I>Insight for Living</I> said the lessons, broadcast five days a week, are helping Indians realize that Scripture can be understood and applied to their personal lives. The program is part of TWR-India's strategy that includes personal follow-up to those who write letters in response to the program. <P> <B>A Cincinnati church group that has been feeding expired parking meters</B> as part of a random-acts-of-kindness campaign now has a champion. Sylvia Stayton, a 62-year-old grandmother, has become a folk hero in the Ohio city after she was arrested Oct. 24 for putting 15 cents into two expired meters in order to spare drivers she didn't know from getting tickets. <BR><B>...Stayton was charged with violating an ordinance</B> intended to keep office workers from hogging storefront parking spaces. She also was charged with disorderly conduct, saying she screamed when the arresting officer put handcuffs on her and &quot;kept pulling my arm up.&quot; She faces up to four months in jail and $1,000 in fines. Stayton was on her way to court to file for bankruptcy when she put the three nickels in the meters. <BR><B>...The church group has printed T-shirts that read &quot;Sylvia Stayton...guilty of kindness.&quot;</B> <I>The Cincinnati Enquirer</I> published a cartoon of &quot;Cincinnati's 10 Most Wanted&quot; depicting Stayton along with people who yell &quot;Bingo&quot; prematurely. <P> <B>Focus on the Family is publishing a monthly newsletter to help parents and youth leaders</B> &quot;guide teens through the world of popular youth culture.&quot; The October issue of <I>Plugged In</I> contains articles and advice about popular music, video games, the Internet, movies, and drugs.      <P> <B>Four out of eight legally blind patients regained some sight</B> after undergoing a transplant of fetal eye cells, news reports said. A University of Rochester School of  Medicine and Dentistry researcher said the experimental treatment is the first to successfully improve the vision of patients suffering from retinitis pigmentosa, a common cause of blindness in adults. <P> <B>Chinese officials in the city of Erzhou shut down 1,600 temples because of illegal religious activities</B> including fortune telling and ancestor worship, the Chinese newspaper <I>Guangming Daily</I> reported. Such activities weaken faith in science, squander farmland, and have wasted more than $732,000 in contributions, the publication said. <P> <B>A lawsuit is challenging the U.S. military's policy </B>of barring its chaplains from encouraging their constituents to lobby Congress on legislation, Baptist Press said. The Becket Fund, a nondenominational public-interest law firm in Washington, says directives issued by all three armed services interfere with the chaplains' rights to preach. <BR><B>...The controversy arose when Roman Catholic officials urged their chaplains</B> to join a campaign to speak out against partial-birth abortions and President Clinton's veto of a bill banning the procedure. The chaplains received memos from their superior officers prohibiting them from participating in the campaign or encouraging others to do so. <P> <B>An American nurse from Sacramento, Calif., is being held in Vietnam</B> for distributing pens with the Christian cross on them. Man Thi Jones, who was born in Vietnam but became naturalized 21 years ago, was arrested a month ago, according to Freedom House, a human rights group. <P>      </font></p>
