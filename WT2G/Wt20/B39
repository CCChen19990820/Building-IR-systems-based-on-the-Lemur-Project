<center><h3>Written Testimony by<br>
William J. Bennett<br>
Former Director, Office of National Drug Control Policy
<p>
Delivered before the<br>
United States Senate<br>
Caucus on International Narcotics Control<br>
April 25, 1996</h3>
<p>
======================================================
<p>
</center>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Caucus: 
<p>
Little more than a year ago I came before both the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight and the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on the drug resurgence in America and the need for strong leadership and serious action.  The situation was serious then.  It is worse now.   Consider these events of the last fifteen months:
<p>
<ul>
<li>The National Household Survey on Drug Abuse reported that in 1995, almost three million 12 to 17 year olds used marijuana.  Among high school seniors, the users number one in three, according to the Parents' Resource Institute for Drug Education.
<li>LSD was tried at least once by 11.7 percent of the class of 1995 -- the highest rate since record keeping began in 1975. [Monitoring the Future Study, December, 1995]
<li>The Office of National Drug Control Policy reports that "on the Texas border, the popular practice of smoking cocaine-laced 'blunts' [cigar-like marijuana cigarettes] may also be leading to an increase among teens of smoking crack."  
<li>In Chicago, a marijuana cigarette laced with both PCP and crack, called "Ozone," was marketed over the summer for $15.
<li>The popular culture, emboldened by a softened attitude toward drugs, escalated its glorification of marijuana.  Adidas brought out the "Hemp" shoe; Capricorn Records produced the album, "Hempilation;" and  20,000 young people gathered in Seattle to attend Hempfest '95.
<li>During the past year there has been a startling rise in the use of methamphetamine in California and the Southwest.  Last July we read the horrifying story of Eric Smith who, high on methamphetamine, murdered his son, cut off the boy's head, and threw it out the window of his van.
<li>It has been reported that having discovered how much money can be made, the citizens of Bolivia have gone into cocaine production rather than simply supply the raw material to other countries.  
<li>And, finally, the advocates of drug legalization have stepped into the breach and made their case vociferously during the past year.
</ul>
<p>
These are troubling trends.  But the good news is that the American people are not 
complacent.  The will to fight drugs is very much alive in the land.  Late last year, 
the Gallup Organization released the results of an extensive survey on American attitudes toward drugs.  The poll found that more than nine in ten Americans are intensely concerned about drug abuse, and that the issue of drugs rates second only to violent crime in seriousness.  When asked what they wanted to see a lot more of, more than half of the Gallup respondents cited strict law enforcement and education of the young, and two-thirds cited reduction of the supply of drugs coming into the United States.  Even more forcefully, by 85 percent, those surveyed rejected the despairing proposal that drugs should be legalized in America.  By contrast, fewer than half -- 43 percent -- asked for more treatment programs.
<p>
Clearly, citizens are aware of the devastating effect that drugs are having on 
society.  We are watching the addicts at the end of the pipeline getting 
older and sicker while seeing record numbers of young people enter the pipeline 
that leads to addiction.  In the face of all this, failure of leadership and lack of 
moral seriousness simply cannot be tolerated.  The federal government has to do a 
better job in this area.
<p>
There is no mystery to fighting drugs effectively.  This job is doable.  The
combined effort of vigorous foreign interdiction, tough and intelligent law
enforcement, accountability within the drug treatment system, and a morally firm 
attitude of intolerance toward drug use paid off in the last decade.  From the late 
1970s to the early 1990s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by over fifty 
percent.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost eighty 
percent.
<p>
I commend you for holding these hearings and for the attempt to bring the drug 
issue to the top of the national political agenda.  That is certainly where it belongs.  
I urge the legislative branch to put all possible pressure on the executive branch
seriously to take up the fight.  We've done it before, and it was successful.  
Let's do it again.

<title>Columbia, America's Favorite "Narco-Democracy"</title>

<h2>Colombia, America 's Favorite 'Narco-Democracy'</h2>
<h3>By WILLIAM J. BENNET AND JESSE HELMS</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
The deluge of illegal drugs flooding into the U.S. has become one of the principal threats to our national security. More Americans die each year from the use of cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs than from international terrorism. Yet, while the Clinton administration has rightly maintained a tough line with Libya, Iran and other governments known to be sponsoring terrorism, it has let Columbia -- which ships more cocaine into the U.S. than any other country -- completely off the hook. It is time for the administration to stiffen its spine and show some resolve in its anti-drug efforts.<p>

The administration's recent annual review of international cooperation on counter-drug efforts by major drug-producing and trafficking countries is instructive. Under this review, countries that fail to meet certain minimum standards of performance in combating drug trafficking are supposed to be denied U.S. aid. The Clinton administration acknowledged in its report that Colombia has indeed failed to meet minimum standards, yet, amazingly, granted Colombia a "national interest waiver" allowing U.S. aid to flow into Colombia despite its miserable record.<p>

This is a grave moral and geopolitical mistake. All available evidence clearly indicates Colombia has totally capitulated to the drug lords. By extending certification to Colombia, despite overwhelming evidence that its government is rife with narco-corruption, the Clinton administration has sent a troubling signal to all drug producing nations: The U.S. will impose no penalty for collusion in trafficking with the drug lords.<p>

Colombia is no borderline case. It has indisputably, become a "narco-democracy" -- a country with a facade of democratic government that is effectively controlled by drug kingpins who manipulate the political establishment with cocaine money. According to the administration's own background papers on Colombia:<p>

<ul>
<li>The Cali cartel has been left free by the Colombian government to exploit the banking system and launder vast sums of drug money with impunity.

<li>There is practically no effective investigation or prosecution of the more than 15,000 current cases of corruption involving government officials (more than half of them senior level authorities).

<li>A "guilt-laundering" system exists, in which Cali drug lords surrender, and submit to a jerry-rigged plea-bargaining system that leaves their assets intact and allbws them to plead to minor charges.

<li>The government's eradication programs have been half-hearted at best, despite massive increases in the growing of opium and new cocaine cultivation.

<li>High-level government collusion enables the shipment of enormous quantities of cocaine into the U.S., with 727 jets transiting in Mexico with tons of the drug.

<li>There is evidence of the corruption of many members of the Colombian Congress, and increasing evidence of presidential ties to the drug cartels.
</ul>

The Clinton administration cannot plead ignorance as the excuse for its abdication of responsibility. But conditions in Colombia are in fact worse than even the administration's report acknowledges. The influence of the cartels and their blood money pervades almost all aspects of Colombia's political, social and economic life. Cartel money finances political campaigns. It silences journalists. It buys judges. It infiltrates virtually every major business activity in Colombia-from cut flowers, to oil, to paper, to banking.<p>

Colombia is now the primary base for the cartels to extend their drug operations throughout the hemisphere. Despite the fact that the Cali cartel now supplies more than 80% of all the cocaine entering the U.S., the Colombian government has failed to arrest or prosecute even one significant cartel member. To the contrary, Colombia has given the cartel cover and protection from international extradition, allowing these drugs to end up on American streets and in American schools, where they destroy the lives of American children.<p>

We believe the Colombian government's collusion with the drug lords poses a direct threat to the national security of 'the U.S.  It is time to meet this threat head-on.  And since the Clinton administration has failed to provide leadership on this issue, it is all the more important that Congress assume responsibility.  That is why a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee will hold a hearing today on the issue.  And why legislation will be introduced this week to cut off all economic support, trade benefits, and military assistance to Colombia by Feb. 6,1996, unless the president of the United States can certify that Colombian President Ernesto Samper has implemented the reform agenda he promised the U.S. Congress he would enact.<p>

Elements of this agenda include investigating the financing by drug traffickers of political parties and candidates in Columbia; putting law enforcement resources behind investigating, capturing, convicting and imprisoning major drug lords in Colombia; ending the "guilt-laundering" system; confiscating assets of cartel leaders; and destroying 44,000 hectares (108,680 acres) of coca and poppy plants in Colombia by Jan. 1,1996 (and all remaining acreage by Jan. 1, 1997).<p>

The Colombian leaders must be sent a clear and unmistakable message: In the war on drugs, they can either continue to ally themselves with the cartels, and thereby become a pariah state like Libya and Iran; or they can return to the community of civilized nations, fulfill the promises President Samper made, and join with the U.S. in an effort to put the cartels out of business. The choice is theirs.<p>

<title>Suddenly losing the war against drugs</title>

<h2>Suddenly losing the war against drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[President Bush] hasn t fought a real war on crime and drugs, I will."</I><br>
	-Bill Clinton, Democratic National Convention, July 16, 1992.<p>

During the first half of the Clinton presidency, the morally serious and tough-minded anti-drug policies of the Reagan and Bush years have been replaced with such Clinton-era messages as the president's infamous "I didn't inhale" comment and the former Surgeon General's repeated calls to study the legalization of drugs.<p>

Enforcement has been de-emphasized and Attorney General Janet Reno has decried the harshness of federal mandatory minimum prison terms for drug crimes, complaining that too many dealers are in prison.  Over the past two years, the administration and its Democratic congressional allies have slashed drug interdiction and domestic drug eradication activities.  Offering enforcement assistance to -- and if that did not work, sanctioning -- foreign countries where cocaine and other drugs are produced and shipped to the US. has ceased to be a foreign policy priority.  And the Clinton administration's announced priority?  Drug treatment.  Yet neither the president nor the Democratic leaders in the 103rd Congress provided the treatment resources they said were needed most.  In this area, as in so many others, the President al said one thing and did another.<p>

The results of the administration's indifference are now in.  And they are not good.<p>

Last July, the White House released a "Pulse Check" on "national trends in drug abuse" reporting that supplies of cocaine, heroin, marijuana and other illegal drugs were plentiful.  And in mid-December, the Clinton administration announced that, in 1994, illegal drug use by teenagers -- specifically 8th, 10th, and 12th graders -- rose sharply in 1994.  (See chart.)<p>

In response, the Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University warned, "If historical trends continue, the jump in marijuana use among America's children (age 12-18) from 1992 to 1994 signals that 820,000 more of 3 these children will try cocaine in their lifetime.  Of that number, about 58,000 will become regular cocaine users and addicts."<p>

The administration also revealed that drug-related emergency-room cases-- dominated by aging, inner-city drug addicts -- have reached the highest levels ever, in reporting going back to 1978.  Cocaine, heroin, and marijuana cases all increased sharply to record levels.<p>

Put another way: if these trends continue, by 1996, the Clinton administration will have presided over the greatest increase in drug use in modern American history. And this will have occurred after a reduction of overall drug use of more than 50 percent between 1979 (the peak) and 1992, and a reduction of almost 30 percent in cocaine use between 1985 (the peak for cocaine) and 1992.<p>

President Clinton has shown little concern about the carnage drugs cause.  Where violent street crime once seemed to be fed largely by battles between cocaine and crack dealers, drug testing of urban arrestees reveals most of them are drug users and under the influence of drugs when they commit a wide array of violent crimes.<p>

Drug use is also a major contributing factor to child abuse. Last April, Newsweek magazine published a long article on child abuse. It reported what those working in the field have known for years: "Drugs now suffuse 80 percent of the caseload; sexual and physical assaults that once taxed the imagination are now common." In the same month, The New York Times Magazine ran a cover story which profiled of a group of homeless, street people in New York City.  All the individuals featured in the article were drug addicts.  Whether it is violent crime, child abuse, homelessness, or inner-city poverty, drugs, -- and in particular crack cocaine -- have made those social pathologies far more acute and in some places, unmanageable.  While there are other factors contributing to these pathologies, it is crack that sustains the violence that is ripping apart large segments of American society.<p>

We believe two myths present serious obstacles to reducing such drug use.  First is the mantra that the root causes of drug use are poverty, racism and slow self-esteem."  And second is the more general view that therapy by a team of counselors, physicians and specialists is the only effective way to reduce drug use.  At their core these myths deny individual responsibility and, assume that drug use is not the product of an individual's decision, and that decisions are somehow made in a vacuum where things like f ear of getting caught, public disgrace and punishment are never considerations.  This attitude is precisely what got us in trouble in the first place.  Reversing the new drug epidemic and finishing the job of the Reagan and Bush years, requires restoring common sense about the drug problem and a recognition of the primary importance of the things contemporary liberalism has sought to discredit: enforcement, individual responsibility, and reducing the supply of drugs on our streets.<p>

Drug enforcement and individual responsibility are important because drug use can be intensely pleasurable.  The desire for drugs must be countered by certain moral precepts: drug use is wrong and those who use and traffic in illegal drugs deserve to be punished.  A responsible community teaches these things by what those in positions of authority -- parents religious leaders, teachers, friends, employers and political officials -- say about drugs and how they act toward drug use and sale.  If those in authority do not address the issue seriously, they teach that drug use is not a serious matter. And if they say
 drug use is intolerable but fail to act effectively to stop and punish those who sell and use drugs, their actions convey a much more powerful lesson than their words.<p>

Reducing the supply of drugs is important because drug use -- whether by non-addicts or
 addict -- is fueled by the desire to use and by the ease with which those who want drugs can obtain them. A nation that permits wide availability of dangerous drugs is sending its citizens particularly its youngest citizens an unwitting message: We are indifferent to drug use. The harsh reality is that drug use begins with experimentation, with a substantial portion escalating to addiction, which often ends in death. A free democratic society ought to display a special intolerance for those things that destroy people's
 virtue and eventually, destroy people's lives.<p>

There are some who believe the drug war is unwinnable.  They argue that the federal government has spent enormous sums of money to no effect and they assert that the drug trade is too rich and too powerful to be defeated. This is the "big lie" about the drug problem, and it is demonstrably false  The success of the 1980's gives witness to the lie.<p>

First the energy and resources devoted to the anti-drug effort during the last two administrations, combined with hardening public attitudes, produced dramatic declines in the drug problem. No other contemporary social pathology has declined by 50-80 percent.  The drug war was a huge domestic policy success that some have simply denied and are now dismantling.<p>

Second, while federal spending on the drug war was substantial, it only approached $12 billion at the end of the Bush years. At no time did such spending exceed federal spending for, say, NASA. The point here is that neither the space program nor the federal and-drug effort ever represented a serious burden in terms of the federal budget And busting the budget today is not required either. In fact, for the president to devote only a modicum of his valuable time seriously, to the drug issue can make a significant difference.<p>

Finally, there is no question that the drug trade has created some very wealthy and powerful criminals here and abroad. But they are not invincible. They corrupt and terrorize third-world countries and inner-city communities, largely because they are not seriously challenged. In 1989, Pablo Escobar was the well-known king of the Medellin Cartel, the seemingly unconquerable "King of Cocaine." A year later he was on the run. Eventually, even the corruption-plagued Colombian government was able to hunt him down and destroy the Medellin Cartel in the process.<p>

Our drug problem will continue to get worse until we once again pursue responsible, intelligent, and tough-minded policies. We have the means, it is simply a matter of whether we have the will. Consider this question: what would be the national response if a foreign-produced poison was contributing to the large-scale killing of white children in Chevy Chase, or Scarsdale, or Scottsdale? Would we have long debates about "root causes" -- or would we do whatever it took to close open-air drug markets, put an end to the killing, and stop the poison from reaching our children? We all know the answer to this question. It's time federal policy showed the same kind of concern for poor black inner city residents as it does for residents of upper middle class white neighborhoods.<p>

<h2>A record of failure in drug treatment</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<I>"[We] should deal with the drug problem in a far more heads-up manner than we are now with two things.  Number one, treatment on demand without delay . . . The second thing we ought to do is find an alternative for first-time drug offenders."</I><br>
	--Bill Clinton, address at Georgetown University, December 12, 1991.<p>

Today's addicts are the most visible casualties of both the permissive culture and the drug fad of the late 1960's, 70's, and early 80's.  These addicts have moved up in the ranks from casual users.  They are largely aging, never married, and predominately male.  Most commit crimes - including selling drugs - as a means of income to purchase drugs. They are also largely concentrated among blacks and live in our inner cities.  While these addicts constitute the single largest demand for heroin and cocaine in the United States, they  also use a variety of other drugs (particularly marijuana) and alcohol.<p>

The overwhelming reaction to this problem has been a call for more drug treatment.  "Treatment on
 demand" is the preferred weapon of many in the drug fight. In fact, many liberals have argued the rational and humane response to drug addiction is to shift resources from drug enforcement and supply reduction to drug treatment.<p>

There are a number of very sophisticated and very effective drug treatment programs (many of which we visited), including very modest ones sponsored by churches and using
 variants of the 12-step method.  These are often every bit as effective as much more expensive and elaborate programs.  But the typical discussion of drug treatment in the press and by the government reflects a dangerous ignorance of the most basic facts.<p>

First, the government treatment bureaucracy is manifestly wasteful and ineffective.  From fiscal 1988 to fiscal l994, federal drug treatment spending almost tripled.  At the same lime, however, the number of treatment slots remained virtually unchanged and the estimated number of people treated actually declined by 145,000.  Why?  As with much of government, it is because the bureaucracies have consumed more and more of the resources, leaving less and less for services.<p>

Bureaucratic waste and inefficiency aside, the number of addicts served per year, measured in terms of persons served per year, is equivalent to more than half the total estimated number of cocaine and heroin addicts.  Clearly, when given the chance, the bulk of these programs are not that successful.<p>

A substantial number of addicts have attended several treatment programs.  The real-world fact is that many treatment programs are simply not effective.  In addition, federal treatment funds continue to e distributed largely on the basis of population, even though we know that addicts are concentrated in our major cities.  And there has been no effort to ensure that addicts are placed in appropriate programs.  Today, out-patient treatment slots predominate when most experts argue that the only reasonable hope of successfully treating today's hard-core addicts is to place them in long-term, residential treatment.  Bush Administration efforts to make programs accountable - to cut off support to those that did not produce results, and match resources with the need-were not enacted by Democratic leadership in Congress.  And the Clinton Administration has abandoned all such efforts.<p>

In last year's crime bill large sums were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were offered for drug courts.  These provisions were highlighted by liberals who announced that they were being "smart and tough."  The model, and essentially the justification, for this funding was the Miami Drug Court and Attorney General Janet Reno's personal involvement with it as prosecutor.  But last August, as the crime bill fight was near its peak, the Miami Herald published a lengthy report raising serious questions about the effectiveness of the program.  In particular, the program established to divert first-and second-time drug offenders into treatment instead of prison was being used by robbers and burglars to serves as little as 45 days.  .And in December the Herald reported that the chief judge overseeing the Miami drug court order an audit of the entire program, expressing alarm that it "had no mechanism to measure whether it was succeeding" A central flaw in the rush to embrace drug courts as a major answer to addiction and crime is that a very large number of addicted offenders today are long-term, hard core addicts who are poorly suited for diversion program.  Drug courts, properly run, may hold promise for treating young addicts.  But young addicts are not the primary problem.<p>

Last year, two groups of studies were released that purport to demonstrate the effectiveness of drug treatment and its superior cost effectiveness to all other categories of drug-enforcement and supply control.  One, funded by the California Department of Alcohol and Drug Programs, received attention for its conclusion that treatment "averages [a] $7 return for every invested."  But it included both alcohol and drug addiction and was thus too broad to be enlightening in regard to the cost-effectiveness of treating cocaine, and particularly crack, addiction -- the most destructive addiction threat today.  None of the sympathetic news reports noted that such "benefits-to-society-for-every-dollar-invested" studies for expenditures on prisons and jails have produced estimates as high as 17-to-1.<p>

A second, widely-reported study, was funded in part by the White House drug office, and conducted by the RAND Corp.  It was entitled "Controlling Cocaine," and concluded that "treatment is seven times more cost effective in reducing cocaine consumption than the best supply control program." Most of the press reports on the release of this study failed to mention that even Clinton Administration drug office officials participating in the release distanced themselves from the reliability of the methods RAND used to measure the effectiveness of supply control programs. And to our knowledge none of the press reports explained what the study actually found in regard to the effectiveness of programs treating cocaine addicts.<p>

In reviewing all forms of cocaine treatment, RAND found that 20 percent of addicts continue using drugs while in treatment and only 13.2 percent of the cocaine addicts treated reduce their drug use below weekly or more frequent use (what RAND defined as "heavy use") during the year following their treatment Overall, RAND reported, only "6 percent of heavy users leave heavy use each year [i.e., to something less than heavy use, not to be equated with no use]. About two-thirds of that out flow is apparently due to existing treatment programs . . . [and] one third of the total annual outflow from heavy use is estimated to be due to unassisted desistance from heavy use."<p>

In other words, overall, cocaine treatment is only 4 percent effective in reducing heavy use and only two percent more effective in reducing heavy use than no treatment at all. Needless to say, if the effectiveness of cocaine treatment were measured in terms of the percentage of addicts who stopped using cocaine altogether and for good, these numbers would be much, much smaller.<p>

While we should continue to support treatment programs, we need to face the harsh reality of cocaine and crack addiction: most addicts are likely do die from the effects of their addiction, sometime in their 40's, if not earlier.  This is yet one more compelling reason why preventing casual drug use by young people -- the first step on the path to addiction -- is so important.<p>

As long as the drug problem is discussed in terms of treatment vs. Enforcement or supply vs. demand, it will remain fundamentally misguided. These dogmatic positions are at odds with both reality and common sense. An effective drug policy should begin with this assumption: as long as young people and those who receive treatment reside in communities where the supply of dangerous, addictive drugs remains plentiful -- i.e., where there is de facto legalization -- prevention and particularly treatment efforts will be severely undercut and for purposes of national policy, ineffective.<p>

<h2>Why aren't we attacking the supply of drugs?</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
In August, 1989, the Medellin Cartel, led by Pablo Escobar, assassinated Colombian presidential candidate, Carlos Galan and publicly declared war on the Colombian government In response, Colombian-President Virgilio Barco launched an intense attack on the cocaine cartels.  Shortly after that crackdown began, the US military deployed the most extensive detection, tracking, and interdiction effort ever mounted against cocaine transit from the Andean countries north.  These events produced a substantial disruption in the cocaine supply to the US from 1989 to 1991, with striking consequences for cocaine and crack addicts.  For example, during the fall of l989, and well into1991,federal law enforcement agencies reported that cocaine trafficking groups were experiencing problems securing cocaine or securing it in a timely manner, even at a higher price.<p>

Reductions in the supply of cocaine to the US market are reflected at the retail level by an increase in street prices, a decline in purity, or both, or by scarcity if the disruption is large and sudden enough.  The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) compiles data on cocaine prices throughout the nation and issues quarterly and annual reports.  The data reveal that in gram amounts (the accepted retail measure), a downward trend in prices and upward trend in purity abruptly reversed in late 1989.<p>

The magnitude of the change in availability is best represented by using a standardized price; that is, a price that reflects both price and purity changes by calculating the cost of a 100 percent-pure gram of cocaine for each year.  Not surprisingly, the reduction in the availability of cocaine coincided with a 27 percent reduction in cocaine emergency room cases between 1989 and 1990.<p>

Medical examiner reports of deaths related to cocaine use during this period also declined. Analysis initiated by the White House drug office and released in the publication "Price and Purity of Cocaine: The Relationship to Emergency Room Visits and Deaths, and to Drug Use Among Arrestees, found declines in cocaine emergency room cases, deaths, and cocaine use among arrestees for the 17 US cities for which data are available. In addition, cocaine prices increased and purity decreased.<p>

Further, the cocaine supply reduction also coincides with a decline in the estimated number of heavy cocaine users (i.e., cocaine and crack addicts) throughout the country.<p>

Even though the data are limited, the forced reduction in cocaine availability between the latter part of 1989 and the first half of 1991 seems beyond question.  That it was a key causal factor in the decline of cocaine use, particularly heavy use, is the most obvious and reasonable conclusion in light of all the evidence.<p>

In addition, we know from the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse that immediately prior to and during this period casual or nonaddictive use of cocaine dropped dramatically. While non-addictive users consume a much smaller quantity of cocaine than heavy or addicted users, an almost 80 percent drop in nonaddictive users between 1985 and 1992 certainly reduced demand significantly (though it cannot be measured by existing surveys and analyses). In order to increase cocaine retail prices and reduce purity, supply reduction efforts would have to cut supply beyond the surplus supply resulting from reduced demand by casual users. So the actual supply reduction was probably even greater in magnitude than the sizable change reflected in the price and purity data.<p>

The cost of the entire international drug control effort for programs and assistance to foreign countries rose from $209 million in fiscal year 1988 - to $660 million in 1992 (its peak); it moved from 4.4 percent to 5.6 percent of the federal drug control budget. Interdiction costs increased between 1988 and 1992, but almost that entire increase involved the estimated cost of Department of Defense (DOD) activities in support of the anti-drug effort.  And even with this increase, interdiction costs as a percentage of the federal drug control budget declined between FY 89 and FY92.<p>

If measured strictly by results, prevention efforts -- assisted by Presidents Reagan and Bush but primarily those carried out by parents, teachers, young people and communities throughout the nation -- made unprecedented progress in combating drug use (in particular, casual cocaine use declined dramatically). But contrary to what is viewed as settled fact by many in Washington, interdiction and cocaine source country programs seem to have been the crucial cause of the only reductions in heavy or addictive cocaine use in the past decade. The most intelligent approach to drug policy, then, is to work both the prevention and interdiction fronts; to integrate efforts instead of posing an either/or scenario.<p>

The obvious question to ask is: why didn't the reduction in cocaine supply continue throughout 1991 and beyond? The movement in the summer of 1991 of US. military resources to the Persian Gulf for Desert Shield and, later, Desert Storm, reduced interdiction coverage, particularly in regard to some of the most powerful airborne and surface naval systems.<p>

Those resources were never returned.  Today, all of the source-country governments are reducing efforts against the cocaine trade. And unfortunately there is no visible effort by the Clinton administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign supply control.  This is an unconscionable abdication.  We face the real prospect of foreign nations permitting the unchallenged production and shipment of illegal drugs to the U.S. and throughout the world: which is a prescription for uncontrollable supplies of illegal drugs.  Which in turn is a prescription for even greater social chaos.<p>

<center><h2>Losing the Drug War Without a Fight</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
During the past 15 years, American society experienced an alarming increase in social pathologies.  But during this period, there was one area against which we made significant progress: drug use.  Unfortunately, the latest reports indicate a resurgence of drug-taking.<p>

The progress against drugs was the result of a significant cultural shift.  During the  late 1960s and much of the 1970s, drug use was widely thought of -- especially by the young -- as harmless fun or as mere self-indulgence.  But beginning at the end of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, when the human carnage caused by drug use was all but impossible to deny, it became Increasingly -- and far more accurately -- seen as a personal, medical and economic catastrophe.<p>

Parents, educators, students, clergy, community leaders and even the media helped to change and harden American opinion about drugs.  Behavioral change followed, and the federal government and many states implemented intelligent antidrug strategies.  As a result, overall drug use went down.  From the late 1970s to the early lS90s, casual drug use by Americans dropped by almost one half.  Between 1985 and 1992, monthly cocaine use declined by almost 80%. For a decade, drug use among young people steadily declined.<p>

But earlier this year, the nation received bad news on the drug front.  Drug use among adolescents is once again on the rise.  Survey results for 1993 indicate a sharp increase in marijuana use for eighth- 10th- and 12th-grade students, as well as an increase in the use of stimulants, ISD and Inhalants.  And hospitals reported a record number of drug-related emergency-room visits in 1992, suggesting that heavy drug use is also on the rise.<p>

These findings should have mobilized the federal government to forcefully state the case against drug use, to enforce the law, and to provide safety and security for its citizens.  Instead, the Clinton administration has said little to encourage those fighting the good fight and has proposed fundamentally misguided policies.  Consider the record:<p>
<ul>
<li>Days after taking office, the administration cut the Office of National Drug Control Policy's staff by more than 80%. 

<li>Soon after assuming office, Attorney General Janet Reno announced that she wanted to reduce the mandatory minimum sentences for drug trafficking and related federal crimes.  Her focus? She is engaged in a never-ending search for the "root causes" of crime and drug use.

<li>The administration has endorsed a drug strategy calling for a cut of more than 600 positions from drug enforcement divisions of the Drug Enforcement Agency, the FBI, the Immigration and Naturalization Service and other federal agencies.

<li>The administration has also proposed cutting more than 100 drug prosecution positions in the U.S. attorney's offices; a cut in funds for drug interdiction and drug intelligence programs from fiscal 1994 levels; and an unfocused, wasteful drug treatment strategy that will do little to target hard-core users.
</ul>
But there is more involved here than a failure of public policy. The Clinton administration suffers from moral torpor on the  issue.  Policy follows attitude.<p>

In 1991, when asked about his past drug use, Mr. Clinton declared that he had never "broken any drug law."  A year later, he admitted that when he was in England, he had experimented with marijuana but "I didn't like it.  I didn't Inhale it, and never tried it again."  Later, when asked whether he would inhale if he had to do it over again, he answered, to laughter: "Sure, if I could.  I tried before."<p>

And then there is Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, the administration's loudest voice on drugs.  While President Clinton dissociated himself once from Dr. Elders's favorable words about drug legalization, she has continued to make such statements --and the president has done nothing effective to stop her.<p>

These statements are significant because of the mindset they reveal and the signals they send.  One of the conditions that allowed the drug epidemic to occur in the first place was the collapse of institutional authority.  Government in the 1970s often didn't know where it stood or what to say about drugs; Peter Bourne, who early on served as President Carter's adviser on drugs, said that "cocaine is probably the most benign of illicit drugs currently in widespread use."<p>

Government officials, through legislation and public discourse, can legitimize and delegitimize certain acts.  In a free society, few things matter more than speaking about- the right things in the right way -- and making moral common sense the touchstone of social policy.<p>

During the 1980s, Nancy Reagan was ridiculed for her "Just Say No" campaign.  But it turns out that "Just Say No" is far more effective than "I didn't inhale."<p>

Mr. Clinton spent much of the presidential campaign and the first 14 months of his presidency decrying, in the name of the defenseless poor, the social programs of two Republican administrations.  But today, on one of the Issues that disproportionately harms the poor -- that is wiping out many of the children of the poor -- he and his administration have demonstrated massive indifference.  One would think that a little more concern and serious thought would come from a president who claims to "feel the pain" of those who suffer.<p>

<h2>Renewing the war on drugs</h2>
<h3>By William J. Bennett<br>
and John P. Walters</h3>
</center>
<blockquote>
<p>
Through its indifference to rising drug use and its erosion of the moral and governmental foundations of the successful anti-drug efforts of the past two administrations, the Clinton Administration has put the nation on a dangerous path. The President bears the principal political responsibility for this record. And only he can use his office to begin to correct it. Congressional leaders in both parties should give him every possible to that.  If the Clinton Administration does not see the light, it should feel the political heat.<p>

As the past two years demonstrate, the nation cannot sustain an effective anti-drug effort without leadership. Congress, governors, mayors, and community leaders, need to meet this challenge.  There are specific roles to fill for federal, state, and local governments, as well as the private institutions that support our families and communities.<p>

<I>Restoring effective federal action</I><br>
The cornerstone of national anti-drug efforts is to give force to the principle that drug use is wrong, harmful and will not be tolerated. This principle should be embodied in the institutions of society, which, in turn, should be organized to give force to that principle.  Without the federal government doing its part, this endeavor will be much more difficult<p>

1. While efforts by the federal government are not sufficient, they are a necessary element of an effective national anti-drug effort.  Executive leadership begins with the president and his appointees in relevant executive agencies. The White House drug policy office was created - at the insistence of a Democratic Congress - to organize and lead the war on drugs. Right now that office is not doing its job, and the Clinton Administration made it largely irrelevant. The President should give someone the responsibility and the authority to get the executive branch, and the federal government, back in the fight.<p>

2. The world headquarters for the cocaine industry is Colombia. The era of meaningful partnership with that government has ended. And there are reliable press reports that the current president of Columbia received campaign money from the cartels. But the heart of the matter today is that U.S. and Colombian enforcement agencies know who the leaders of the cartels are and where they are. The Colombians could arrest or force into hiding the management of the cocaine industry, and disrupt the cocaine trade as they have done in the past. But there is no evidence the Colombian government has any intention of doing so. Occasional showy enforcement operations continue, but no real efforts are mounted and therefore no real progress is made. The US. government has done virtually nothing to give the legitimate interests in Colombian society reason to undertake the risk and effort of making their government put the cocaine trade out of business. It is time to give them such a reason. During the recent embargoes on Iraq and Haiti, experts warned that these measures are most effective when applied rapidly and totally against a trading ally. The US. accounts for more than 35percent of Colombia's licit foreign exports. Such action against Colombia would change the priority of anti-drug efforts throughout the international community.<p>

3. Put the US. military in charge of stopping the flow of illegal drugs from abroad. Require federal law enforcement agencies responsible for drug interdiction to operate under the overall command and control of the military. This mission will require continuous adaptation because traffickers will inevitably try new avenues as the old ones become too costly. Some in the military will object to this non-traditional mission and its cost. But no law enforcement organization will ever have the intelligence and operational capabilities for the interdiction task that the military already possesses. Over the last few years the US. has used its military resources to protect poor and endangered citizens of other countries.  It is time-it is past time- to stop overlooking the poor and endangered in our cities.<p>

4.  The drug trade inside the US. relies on sophisticated senior management.  Despite periodic law enforcement successes, federal domestic enforcement agencies have produced no serious disruption of major trafficking operations.  And for the last two years the Clinton Administration has allowed the DEA, FBI, and other drug enforcement agencies to curry political favor with local authorities by assigning federal personnel to augment manpower for cases with no federal significance.  This might be acceptable if important federal responsibilities were being met.  But they are not.  We therefore need to establish clear federal drug enforcement priorities and hold enforcement authorities accountable for meeting them.  For example, the Attorney General should be required to prepare a report every six months identifying all major drug trafficking organization know to be operation in the US and  a plan to deploy federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal enforcement personnel to dismantle them.  Congress should also make the funding for federal drug enforcement agencies contingent on effectively implementing this policy.<p>

5.  The Congress should combine existing federal aid to the states and localities for drug enforcement, prevention, and treatment (now, roughly $3.5 billion per year) into a single block grant distributed on the basis of population.  Individual program mandates should be abolished so states and localities can establish and pursue their own priorities for fighting drug use and drug crime.  Law enforcement, drug treatment, and prevention education are local responsibilities.  Washington's bureaucratic regulation has utterly failed to engender programs that foster local accountability.  Therefor, the new block grand should be designed to restore local responsibility by phasing them out after three years.  In this way, communities will have an incentive to use these funds for those activities that demonstrate sufficient merit to deserve long term support entirely from local sources.<p>

<I>Creating effective local action</I> <br>
6.  Drug prevention is central to all effective anti-drug efforts.  Young people who do not use drugs in their teens are unlikely to ever become involved with illegal drugs.  But each generation bust be taught that illegal drug use is wrong and harmful.  This lesson must be taught by the community as a whole; indeed, by our culture.  Children learn about drugs by what the adults around them as a whole say and do.  Parents teach by precept and example.  The same is true of schools and the communities.  If drug use and sale is not aggressively opposed and prevented, children learn it is acceptable despite what some adults may occasionally tell them.  Teaching drug prevention must be apart of teaching children right from wrong.  It will always fall to parents to provide that education in home and act to ensure that schools and their communities are teaching this lesson effectively.  This task is easier if national leaders set the right example and speak in support of parents.  But since that national support has seriously eroded, parents, churches, schools, youth organization, and communities are more important than ever.  They have always been, and will always remain, the first line of defense for children.<p>

7.  Open-air drug markets feed addiction and are a visible sign of the toleration of the drug trade in our nation.  It is a national disgrace that such markets are tolerated in virtually every major American city. Drug pushers cannot operate effectively when law enforcement personnel are present.  Forcing drug deals from open spaced makes their lives more difficult and dangerous and hence their activities less frequent.  Many communities have demonstrated that creating a law enforcement presence and maintaining it in response to relocation efforts by drug dealers is doable - but only if closing drug markets is made a priority.  In the next year, mayors, city councils, and police chiefs should pledge and make clear that they will insist that these officials keep it.  We need to stop claiming that the crime and drug problem in our communities is someone else's responsibility.  Decisive action can be taken by local officials and community members now.<p>

8.  Drug testing is a proven tool to discourage drug use by individuals in treatment and those in the criminal justice system.  Good treatment programs require regular testing and apply sanctions against individuals who relapse.  Drug testing arrestees provides a basis for using bail, sentencing, release conditions and other aspects of the criminal justice system to compel individuals to stop using drugs.  Including an extended period of regular testing after offenders complete their sentences, discourages a return to drug use and crime.  Positive drug tests must involve steadily escalating penalties (starting with a one or tow-day return to jail or a half-way house and moving to reincarceration for an extended period).  Most heavy drug users pass through the criminal justice system and any short-term of a drug testing program will save larger costs to the community in repeated criminal justice expenditures on the same individual land the damage their crimes do to the innocents.<p>

These eight steps - involving federal, state, local, and individual action - will reverse the dangerous resurgence of drugs that has occurred during President Clinton's watch.  These actions will help turn the country away from its present course and go a long way toward making progress in the war on drugs.  And that, in turn, will help America to become a safer, more decent and more civilized society.<p>

<u><h3>Impact of Drug Use</h3></u>
<P>
 <B>Illicit drug use is extremely costly to society</B>.  One
study conducted by Columbia University's Center for Addiction
and Substance Abuse found that drugs cost New  York City alone
$20 billion annually, or 21 cents of every taxpayer's dollar.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug abuse is surpassed only by violent crime as the issue
Americans consider the most serious facing the nation</B>.  According
to a recent Gallup poll, 94 percent of Americans surveyed consider
the use of illegal drugs a &quot;crisis.&quot;<BR>

<P>
<h3><U>Drugs &amp; Crime</h3></U>
<P>
 <B>The vast majority of criminals use drugs</B>.  Data from Bureau
of Justice Statistics studies show that 79 percent of state prisoners
in 1991, 60 percent of federal prisoners in 1991, and 83 percent
of youths in long-term public juvenile facilities in 1987 had
used drugs at some point in their lives. <BR>

<P>
 <B>Drug use contributes to and exacerbates other crimes</B>.
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics also found that 31 percent of
prison inmates in 1991 had reported being on drugs at the time
of their offense.  In addition, more than 80 percent of reported
cases of child abuse involve illicit drug use by the abusing adult.
<BR>

<P>
 <B>The percentage of prisoners convicted of drug charges has
increased</B>. The number of persons convicted of violating federal
drug laws rose to 17,349 in 1991 from 5,981 in 1981, an increase
of 190 percent.  The number of drug trafficking convictions in
State courts more than doubled between 1986 and 1990.  In 1960,
approximately one out of every 25 prisoners was incarcerated on
drug charges; today, around one in three is.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
higher rate of  conviction and punishment of drug offenders</B>.
 More than 170,000 people were convicted of drug trafficking charges
in 1992, more than four times as many people so convicted just
four years earlier (before mandatory sentencing requirements).
 About half of those convicted were sent to prison, compared to
around 37 percent in 1986.<BR>

<P>
 <B>Mandatory sentencing requirements have corresponded with a
significant increase in the average length of sentences imposed
on convicted drug traffickers</B>.  Since the U. S. Sentencing
Commission set guidelines on November 1, 1987, the average drug
sentence has more than tripled from 23.1 months in 1987 to 84.2
months in 1991.<BR>

Since its birth on Earth Day, 1970, the modern environmental movement can
claim many successes:  Air and water are cleaner; automobiles operate more
efficiently and pollute less; "smokestack" industries are more
environment-friendly than ever before.  

<P>
Perhaps more impressive than these tangible achievements is the impact the
environmental movement has had on American culture.  The vast majority of
Americans now think of themselves as "environmentalists," and most people
engage on a regular basis in some activity (e.g. recycling newspapers) that
allows them to act personally on their environmental beliefs.  The
environmental movement fundamentally changed American values on a scale
comparable to such great historical movements as Methodism and the American
suffrage movement.<p>

<h2>Hijacking the Broadcast Spectrum</h2><br>
<b>Opinion Editorial by 
Karen Kerrigan,
President
Small Business Survival Committee
&
Founder,
Campaign for Broadcast Competition</b>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Here is a story you won't see on network shows such as "60 Minutes," "Dateline," or
"Prime Time Live." <p>
America's network broadcasters are scurrying to preserve one of the greatest government giveaways in history.  In an era when telecommunications companies are paying the government for the use of our nation's airwaves, the broadcasters are on the verge of gaining additional spectrum for free.   A gift of taxpayer assets which, if auctioned, could raise more than $100 billion for federal debt reduction.  Even in Washington, that's a big number.<p>
This sweetheart deal will double the amount of spectrum each broadcaster currently
controls, and will allow them to offer new services such as two-way paging and wireless voice and data services, in addition to multiple channels of digital television.  It should cause considerable consternation to the telecommunication companies who have had to pay billions for their right to use the airwaves.<p>
The deal originated as part of the government's attempt in 1991 to develop an American version of High Definition Television (HDTV).  Experts were afraid that the Japanese would dominate the next generation of television technology and eliminate any American presence in the high-profile consumer electronics industry.  In a classical case of wrong-headed industrial policy, the FCC coordinated the technology development effort, and agreed to provide the broadcasters with additional spectrum to transmit the HDTV signal in order to create a market and make the transition from analog television.<p>
But a funny thing happened on the way to the market.  Technological gains made HDTV a technological dinosaur -- especially in the broadcaster's eyes.  They realized that they could provide digital (but not high definition) television utilizing a fraction of the airwaves, making way for multiple television channels, while leaving space for other lucrative services.<p>
Given the market and technological realities, the broadcaster's reneged on their
commitment to deploy HDTV.  However, they still want the spectrum.  They argue that -- without the additional spectrum -- they will never be able to compete with the new players in television, such as cable and telephone companies.  This, despite a fifty year head start.  They also argue that paying for additional spectrum will sound the death knell for "free T.V." <p>     
This line of reasoning rings hollow, especially with a budget-focused and  market-oriented Congress.  For the past fifty years the broadcasters have profited handsomely from their current business;  there is certainly no need for the federal government to guarantee their future success as participants in a competitive communications environment.  It is also hard to feel sorry for an industry whose performance last year was the most profitable in history.  It is difficult to see this as the end of advertiser-supported television.<p>
A few Members of Congress and concerned citizens are finally raising this issue for what it really is -- a multi-billion dollar giveaway.  It is an insider deal that will come at the expense of others.  With increasing pressure to reduce the national debt, Congress cannot let this deal pass by unchallenged.<p>
More importantly, an extremely expensive and profoundly wrong presumption remains
untouched:  that the government should continue to be in the business of promoting certain technologies such as HDTV, or attempting to guarantee the success of an industry by shielding, for example, the broadcasters from competition.  Recent communications success stories such as direct broadcast television and cellular telephone service offer compelling evidence that the market remains the only effective vehicle for selecting industrial winners.<p>
The recent wireless auctions, where telecommunications companies bid $10 billion to
offer a new generation of cellular services, provide an effective model for allocating the public airwaves.  It would work beautifully in allocating spectrum now being offered free of charge.  Allow the broadcasters to keep their current, free licenses to use for broadcast television.  Put the new spectrum allocation up for auction.  And forget about foisting HDTV technology onto the American public -- if they want it, someone will figure out a way to offer it to them and make the necessary investment.<p>
     The current proposal reflects wasteful stewardship of a valuable asset.  At a time ofheightened awareness of our budget limitations, Congress should not be bullied into this giveaway.  Economics, not special-interest politics, should decide the allocation and uses of the spectrum.  In a competitive telecommunications environment, entrepreneurs will meet and create new demands.<p>
Allow the market to determine the value and use of this asset and let competition reign. It will pay great dividends to consumers, the economy and the Treasury.<p>

<title> $100 BILLION GOVERNMENT GIFT </title>

 --- SBSC'S KERRIGAN ANNOUNCES CAMPAIGN FOR BROADCAST COMPETITION ---
</center>
<p>


<b>  WASHINGTON, DC --</b> The already rich and powerful television networks and
broadcasters, who have made billions on the free television licenses given to them by the
government, are abut to get even more, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayers.  Congress and the Federal
Communications Commission, in a bill which has passed the Senate and will soon be considered
by the House, will bestow on broadcasters -- for free -- new spectrum valued at up to $100
billion, according to Karen Kerrigan, President of the Small Business Survival Committee
(SBSC).  The plan will double the airwaves controlled by each television broadcaster.
<p>
     Kerrigan today announced that SBSC is creating the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to facilitate a debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
television broadcasters' plan to shortchange the U.S. taxpayers.  The Campaign will be joined by
individuals and public policy groups around the country to enhance public awareness and
understanding of this issue.
<p>
     "The broadcasters were initially supposed to receive this valuable spectrum as a way to
shift their current analog service to High Definition Television (HDTV) but have recently
admitted their intention to use the spectrum, not just for HDTV, but for whatever is most
profitable for them such as the addition of up to six new television channels, or paging, cellular,
or similar services.  And Congress is going along with this plan!  Do the promoters of shows
under attack by this very same Congress for their violent sexual content deserve this multi-billion
dollar gift?," Kerrigan said.
<p>
     "The Campaign is asking only that the television broadcasters be treated the same as
every other entity that wants new rights to the airwaves.  The spectrum should be auctioned off,
creating a competitive broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and
generating up to $100 billion to reduce the federal deficit.  In an era when spectrum auctions are
welcomed by government for new wireless services, it is incomprehensible that they continue
corporate welfare to benefit America's wealthiest interests."
<p>
     "The marketplace is the only place to pick winners and losers.  Competition makes the
best technological decisions for the consumer, not government," added Kerrigan.

TO:  Concerned Citizens<br>
FROM:  Small Business Survival Committee<br>
RE:  <i><b>Broadcast Spectrum Could Cost Taxpayers Billions</i></b><br>
DATE:  August 3, 1995
<p>
<hr>
<br>
The Federal Communications Commission is about to give away billions of dollars worth of public airwaves to television broadcasters free -- this after the broadcasters have already made billions on the free television licenses they already possess.  Under the current plan, the broadcasters will double their spectrum and can use it for anything they want from pay television to cellular phone service to paging -- all at the taxpayers' expense.  The spectrum should be auctioned, creating a competing broadcast environment, encouraging the growth of new companies and granting up to $100 billion to reduce the deficit. <p>
Last week, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called on broadcasters to forge a "Contract for Kids and Community" to meet the public interest obligations they have already shirked.  Hundt's efforts to expand education programming and attain concrete commitments for broadcasters to help parents choose high quality, nonviolent programming are well-meaning.  But he has failed to connect the dots.  The broadcasters have proven in the past (and backed by public opinion surveys) that they
do not use their spectrum to further the public good.<p>
<h3>WHY AUCTIONS?</h3><p>
Since Congress decided in 1993 to stop giving the airways away free, telecommunications companies have bid over $10 billion in auctions to obtain spectrum to provide services.  Why are the broadcasters entitled to twice as much spectrum at no cost?  Shouldn't they compete along with everyone else for the rights to use the public's scarce spectrum?  Hasn't the government proven that it is lousy at picking "winners and losers" in the marketplace?  Competition makes the best decisions for consumers not the government.<p>
Broadcasters claim that auctioning the spectrum will mean the end to free television. 
Competition has benefited not only consumers, but the broadcasters!  What they fail to mention is that the broadcasters have just enjoyed their most profitable year in history. <p>
Apart from denying broadcasters corporate welfare they do not deserve, auctioning the spectrum will provide funds and flexibility to truly use the spectrum for public good.  Auction proceeds could be used to reduce the national debt and better yet, new innovative broadcast companies will provide the public with the quality programming they are demanding.<p>
<h3>ACT NOW</h3><p>
The National Association of Broadcasters is a very powerful lobby in Washington.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich is on record saying no one will take them on.  FCC Chair <a href="mail to:kidstv@fcc.gov"> Reed Hundt</a> (e-mail address: kidstv@fcc.gov) and <a href="mail to:georgia@hr.house.gov">Speaker Gingrich</a> (e-mail address: georgia@hr.house.gov) need to hear from concerned taxpayers who will not sit idly by while the powerful NAB seeks protection from market competition and robs American consumers of innovative services and costs taxpayers billions of dollars.<p>
The FCC is considering this issue now, and must hear from concerned citizens when possible. We suggest that you send a letter to Speaker Gingrich and Chairman Hundt to send them the message that the public hopes that not all of its officials share their fear of the broadcasters.<p>

<h3>Gift to TV Networks</h3>
<br>
To the Editor:<p>
Re "Media Mergers" (editorial, Aug. 2): Under pressure from the television networks,
Congress and the Federal Communications Commission will soon reward these
megacorporations with a multibillion-dollar deal to double their share of the airwaves free.  The broadcasters were to use this spectrum for the transition to high-definition television.  However, they are reneging on that deal -- to provide more "quality" television.  They will also use the airwaves for paging, and voice and data services.<p>
Recent auctions of public airwaves raised $10 billion to reduce the deficit; if these
companies paid billions, why shouldn't Disney, Group W and Rupert Murdoch?  The giveaway is valued at $10 billion to $100 billion.  Unless Congress reverses course, the taxpayer will pay.<p>

<title> America To Receive Six Times The Sex and Violence From Broadcasters </title>

<h2> AMERICA TO RECEIVE SIX TIMES THE SEX AND VIOLENCE FROM
        BROADCASTERS, COMPLIMENTS OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT</h2>
</center>
<p>
<b>Washington, DC --</b>  The networks and broadcasters are looking to double their pleasure.  And if
given twice the airwaves, we will all be subjected to six times the violence and six times the sex
already provided on network television.
<p>
     "As early as next week, HR 1555, a telecommunications bill that would give broadcasters
spectrum valued at up to $100 billion free of charge, may come to the House floor.  Broadcasters,
in this sweetheart deal with Congress, would receive spectrum initially allocated to them for
transition to High Definition Television (HDTV).  Recently, however, they have revealed that
they intend to use the airwaves for whatever is most profitable for them, such as the addition of
up to six new television channels, paging, cellular, or similar services,"said Small Business
Survival Committee president Karen Kerrigan.
<p>
     Last week, Kerrigan announced the formation of the Campaign for Broadcast
Competition (CBC), a coalition formed to spawn debate on the spectrum issue to expose the
tremendous loss of taxpayer funds to wealthy broadcast networks.
<p>
     "Instead of promoting the growth of new telecommunications industry by auctioning the
airwaves on the free market, we can expect the broadcasters to air six times the violence, sex and
immoral content already provided in order to sell advertising and increase their ever-expansive
profits," said Kerrigan.
<p>
     And, in a National Press Club Speech, FCC Chairman Reed Hundt called for a "Contract
for Kids and Community," in an attempt to clean up the airwaves.  Yet, with HR 1555,
broadcasters may double their spectrum giving them free reign, in all aspects, to insult the
sensibilities of middle America with scenes of deviance and violence.
<p>
     "The broadcasters say they deserve these airwaves because they are providing a public
service.  Let's examine the public service accessible to us now:  According to a 1994 study
conducted by the Center for Media and Public Affairs, during an 18 hour period, an average
viewer can expect to see 1,217 violent scenes on network shows and 388 violent scenes in
commercials and promotions.  According to the American Psychological Association, the
average child watches 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of simulated violence before finishing
elementary school," Kerrigan added.

The "networking" arm of Heritage's Educational Affairs program, the <a href="/heritage/resource_bank/rtoc.html">Resource 
Bank</a> is a cooperative exchange program involving more than 2,000 university 
professors, academic research centers, educational foundations, and policy 
groups in the United States and abroad. The purpose of the Resource Bank, which 
was established in 1977, is to help conservative scholars and policy specialists 
participate more fully in the policy-making process.
<p>

Some 300 Resource Bank members from a record 130 organizations attended the 
17th Annual Resource Bank Meeting in Chicago in April. The theme of the two-day 
conference was "Restoring the American Community: The `New Citizenship' at 
Work," a phrase coined by Bradley Foundation President Michael Joyce to describe 
the rebirth of grassroots activism around the country.  The program highlighted 
the efforts of volunteers, activists, entrepreneurs, and citizen-legislators.
<p>
The Resource Bank's working groups focused in 1994 on state issues, public 
interest law, unfunded federal mandates, family issues, and foreign and defense 
policy issues.

What do film critic Michael Medved, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jeremy 
Boorda, Americans for Tax Reform President Grover Norquist, and the Ambassadors 
of Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, and Mexico have in common? They all spoke at 
The Heritage Foundation last fall, all in the same week. Their presentations 
were overshadowed that week by another Heritage speaker: California Gov. Pete 
Wilson, whose denunciation of costly federal mandates made headline news around 
the country and was broadcast repeatedly by SPAN, the Cable-Satellite Public 
Affairs Network.
<p>

<P>
The Heritage Foundation in 1994 remained one of Washington's leading forums. 
Thousands attended the more than 100 public lectures and seminars, and millions 
more watched the proceedings on public-affairs television or read the published 
lectures.
<p>
<B>Among 1994's notable events:</B>
<p>
 The inauguration of a 10-part lecture series, "Sweet Land of Liberty: Strengthening 
America's Culture," sponsored by the Salvatori Foundation. 
<p>
 The Ambassadors Forum on Free Trade, a panel discussion with the four previously 
mentioned ambassadors, held just weeks before the "Summit of the Americas."
<p>
 A major conference on reforming the U.S. agricultural system, featuring three 
former Secretaries of Agriculture: John Block, Earl Butz, and Clayton Yeutter.
<p>
In addition to several governors and numerous members of the House and Senate, 
featured speakers during the year included Heritage Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William 
Bennett</a>; Mickey Kantor, the U.S. Trade Representative; William Kristol, Chairman 
of the Project for the Republican Future; G. Gordon Liddy, the popular radio 
talk-show host; Gen. Merrill McPeak, the U.S. Air Force Chief of Staff; Gen. 
Gordon Sullivan, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff; Cal Thomas, the popular author, 
columnist, and television talk-show host; and Robert Woodson, President of 
the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise.

"The Clinton administration does take national interests into account when 
formulating foreign policy. The trouble is, they are frequently the interests 
of other nations," Lawrence Di Rita, Deputy Director of Foreign and Defense 
Policy Studies, told reporters in one of several well-attended briefings in 
1994. 
<P>

<p>
Heritage analysts throughout the year continued their efforts to bring needed 
clarity and focus to America's meandering foreign policy. The big picture was 
provided by the updated monograph, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>," which went 
into a second printing in 1994. With more than 10,000 copies in print, the 
global blueprint is now used by more than two dozen universities and graduate 
schools, including America's war colleges, as a primer on foreign policy and 
national security. The book explains how U.S. national interests should be 
used to establish foreign policy goals, how to evaluate potential threats to 
those interests, and how to build and maintain the military forces needed to 
respond to potential threats.
<P>

<p>
Individual papers during the year examined the dangers of putting U.S. forces 
under foreign command as part of U.N. "peacekeeping" missions, warned of the 
danger of cutting too deeply into the U.S. defense budget, urged the United 
States not to abandon the idea of building missile defenses, and developed 
a strategy for revamping the U.S. foreign-aid program.

With the approval of  the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) shortly 
after Thanksgiving, Heritage's ongoing efforts to promote the global expansion 
of free trade reached another important milestone. The long march, however, 
is far from over: Of the 101 countries ranked on Heritage's "Index of Economic 
Freedom," released at year's end, just 25 had free or "mostly free" trading 
policies.
<P>


One of the main objectives of Heritage's two-year-old American Trader Initiative, 
a joint effort involving both the business and policy communities,  is the 
liberalization of the rules governing international commerce. The program is 
based on the belief not only that free trade furthers U.S. national interests 
by creating new business opportunities for American companies, but that economic 
freedom helps spawn political freedom as well. The long-term goal of the program 
is a free-trade area encompassing both the Western Hemisphere and Pacific Rim. 
<P>

<P>

In addition to their work on the GATT agreement, Heritage trade experts pushed 
the administration to make trade liberalization the centerpiece of two important 
1994 summit meetings: the November meeting in Indonesia of the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum and the December '94 "Summit of the Americas" 
in Miami. In both cases, the United States and its trading partners agreed 
to phase out all trade barriers - by the year 2005 in the Americas and by the 
year 2020 in the Asia-Pacific region.

Just one day after The Heritage Foundation released its first-ever global report 
card on economic freedom, Sen. Mitch McConnell 
(R-KY), incoming Chairman of the Appropriations Committee's Foreign Operations 
Subcommittee, suggested major changes in America's $14 billion-per-year foreign 
aid program. As Heritage Vice President and Director of Foreign Policy and 
Defense Studies Kim Holmes told reporters at a Dec. 16 media briefing, most 
U.S. development aid is being given to countries "that don't deserve it" because 
their state-controlled economies will waste it. Countries with free economies, 
he noted, generally don't need U.S. aid. 
<P>


<P>
Earlier in the week, Holmes had said in a Wall Street Journal op-ed page article 
that "People in Angola, Haiti, Mozambique and Ukraine are not poor because 
wealthy people in the West haven't been generous toward them." They are poor, 
he said, because their governments' "misguided economic policies" retard economic 
growth and prosperity.
<P>

<P>

This long-overdue debate over U.S. foreign-aid policy was precipitated  by 
the publication of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," a 258-page comparative 

analysis compiled by Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a> and Thomas Sheehy.  Released on Dec. 12, the "Index" examines the economies of 101 countries. As Investor's 
Business Daily noted, Heritage created the "Index," which is similar to Freedom 
House's annual country-by-country survey of political freedom, "to help U.S. 
and international policy-makers better craft their aid policies. If aid money 
is given to a country that is following poor economic policies, the chances 
are good it will be wasted or do little, if any, good."

 

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>sian <FONT SIZE = "+2">S</FONT>tudies 
<FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>enter</H3></CENTER>

Not surprisingly, four of the ten countries with the best ratings on Heritage's 
"Index of Economic Freedom" - and eight of the top 20 - were from the Asia-Pacific 
region. When the United States, Canada, and Chile are included - all of which 
belong to the 18-member Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC) - the 
more broadly defined region boasts 11 of the 20 freest economies in the world. 
The APEC nations also now account for 40 percent of all global trade.
<P>

<P>

In recognition of the growing importance of the Asia-Pacific community, The 
Heritage Foundation's Asian Studies Center was established in 1983. Today, 
the Center is recognized on both sides of the Pacific as one of the most important 
research and policy centers on diplomatic, economic, and security issues affecting 
the United States and Asia.
<P>
While trade and security issues dominated the calendar, Director <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a> 
and the Asian Studies Center staff made a strong case in 1994 for significantly 
upgrading U.S. relations with the Republic of China on Taiwan, a booming country 
of more than 20 million people that continues to be treated as a second-class 
world citizen by the United States. Visiting Fellow Daryl Plunk and Richard 
V. Allen, National Security Advisor to President Reagan and Chairman of the 
Asian Studies Center's Advisory Council, provided Washington with much-needed 
guidance on defusing the growing crisis over North Korea's nuclear-weapons 
program. And Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/oquinn.htm">Robert O'Quinn</a> offered the White House an agenda 
for the mid-November APEC summit, proposing that leaders of the 18 member countries 
set a "time certain" for establishing a trans-Pacific free-trade area, the 
topic of an Oct. 27 Asian Studies Center conference featuring Nancy Adams, 
U.S. Trade Representative for APEC Affairs, and Paula Stern, former Chairwoman 
of the U.S. International Trade Commission.   
<P>

<P>

The Heritage-sponsored Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) 
hosted several "newsmaker" breakfasts during the year. Rep. Floyd Spence (R-SC), 
then ranking Republican on the House Armed Services Committee, discussed the 
North Korean nuclear threat. Political analysts Victor Kamber, a liberal Democrat, 
 and Bradley O'Leary, a conservative Republican, discussed the congressional 
elections. And Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/holmes.htm">Kim Holmes</a> discussed "The Index of Economic Freedom" 
and proposed changes in U.S. foreign aid policy. 
<P>
Important financial support for many of the Asian Studies Center's programs 
continues to be provided by the Korea Foundation Endowment for Korean Studies.

Russian political scientist Evgueni Volk was appointed coordinator of the Heritage 
Foundation's Moscow Office in 1994, succeeding Senior Fellow Jeffrey Gayner, 
who had directed the office since its opening in 1993. 
<P>
Heritage's Moscow office is now seen in Russia as a neutral meeting ground 
where reformers can work out their public differences in private. This is done 
through the Heritage Reform Forum, a monthly "summit" meeting of Moscow's leading 
reform politicians, businessmen, and journalists.    
<P>
The Moscow Office also is involved in more traditional policy analysis. Volk 
and Salvatori Fellow in Russian and Eurasian Studies Ariel Cohen distribute 
draft legislation being considered by the Russian parliament to experts in 
the United States, Europe, and Russia. Comments and suggestions are then sent 
to members of the parliament and appropriate staff. During 1994, legislation 
on defense, "peacekeeping" operations, lobbying, and non-governmental organizations 
was refined in this way.

"The Heritage Foundation is without question the most far-reaching conservative 
organization in the country in the war of ideas, and one which has had a tremendous 
impact not just in Washington but literally across the planet." - House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, R-GA.
<p>

<p>

When more than 300 Republican congressional candidates joined House Minority 
Whip Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., on the steps of the Capitol for a Sept. 27 "photo 
op" - intended to focus national attention on the House GOP's "Contract with 
America" - liberal "spin doctors" warned that Gingrich & Company had gravely 
miscalculated.  Weeks later the voters delivered their own verdict: It was 
the spin doctors who had miscalculated.
<P>
The "Contract with America" drew heavily from years of Heritage Foundation 
research.  While not every detail of every proposal was identical to the recommendations 
made over the years by Heritage analysts in their congressional testimony, 
articles, books, and research papers, the similarities were striking.  Said 
the liberal Boston Globe: "As the leading source of scholarship for that [conservative] 
movement, The Heritage Foundation has been able to hammer home a simple message: 
Government programs have done more to worsen the nation's social problems than 
to heal them."          
<P>
Heritage welcomed the 1994 political season with "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>," a first-of-its-kind 
candidates' briefing book providing comprehensive data on a dozen key national 
issues, from federal spending and defense policy to congressional reform. Newt 
Gingrich, who would become the new Speaker of the House in 1995, called the 
book, which was made available to every House and Senate candidate (and, on 
request, several gubernatorial candidates), an example of Heritage at its best: 
doing "serious work ... and thinking about not just how to get power, but how 
to use power for the nation's good." In the final weeks of the fall campaign, 
talk-radio host Rush Limbaugh read extensive excerpts from "Issues '94," which 
had become a primary reference source for dozens of campaigns. Many of these 
campaigns were successful. 
<P>

<P>

Following the conservative victory in November, Heritage was ready once again 
with a policy blueprint for the new 104th Congress. The 19-chapter "New Member's 
Guide to the Issues" - compared by some to Heritage's Reagan-era "Mandate for 
Leadership" series - offered concrete suggestions for a conservative reordering 
of Washington on issues as diverse as agriculture, the budget, crime, defense 
policy, education, regulation, taxation, and trade. The Guide served as the 
basic "textbook" at Heritage's freshman orientation program for new members 
of Congress, held in December in Baltimore. 
<P>


"Issues '94" and "The New Member's Guide to the Issues" were both collaborative 
efforts involving The Heritage Foundation's entire research staff.

<P>
If not dishonest, Washington's traditional misuse of numbers certainly is misleading. 
The use of a technical device known as "baseline budgeting" has enabled policy-makers 
for 20 years to claim spending reductions while increasing spending. Everything, 
it seems - from omnibus spending bills to the budget reconciliation process 
- has been intended to hide from the public the true cost of Washington's actions. 
Just what does a $260 billion tax increase mean to the average family or the 
typical community?
<P>


The Heritage Foundation can now provide the answers. Thanks to a major half-million-dollar 
technical upgrade of our computer-analysis capabilities, Heritage's Roe Institute 
for Economic Policy Studies can now provide - overnight, if necessary - the 
kind of "hard numbers" and statistical analysis that can change the course 
of debate. Over and over again in 1994 - on the crime bill, on the flood of 
health-care reform plans that threatened to overwhelm Capitol Hill, on the 
fiscal year 1995 budget - Heritage showed that its data-analysis capabilities 
now rival those of the Congressional Budget Office and Office of Management 
and Budget. But that's not all; as often as possible, Heritage analysts attempted 
to make the numbers understandable, showing how various policy proposals would 
impact individual businesses, workers, families, and the cities and states 
where they live.

Endowed by The Roe Foundation of Greenville, S.C., and other supporters, the 
Roe Institute staff specializes in budget and tax issues, the effects of regulation 
on the economy, environmental policy, competitiveness, and trade. Recommendations 
in 1994 included a call for a $500-per-child tax credit, repeal of the Social 
Security earnings tax, and reduction and indexation of the capital gains tax. 
The Roe Institute staff also identified numerous wasteful and inefficient government 
programs that should be cut back or eliminated and helped convince lawmakers 
of the merits of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). And, of 
course, they continued to argue persuasively for a balanced budget amendment 
to the Constitution, which became a major component of the House GOP's "Contract 
with America."

Heritage's popular prosperity plan for America, called "Putting Families First," 
served as the basis for the alternative budget offered by House and Senate 
Republicans in 1994. While the plan, written by <a href="/heritage/s
taff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>, Heritage's Grover 
M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs, fell short in the 103rd Congress, 
most of its components were included in the "Contract with America."

Roe Institute analysts also focused in 1994 on the regulatory burden placed 
on the economy, environmental policies that threaten private-property rights, 
and "unfunded mandates" - regulations the federal government imposes on businesses 
and state and local governments without paying for them. Among the most widely 
quoted studies published during the year was then Deputy Director Susan Eckerly's 
first-ever "Citizen's Guide to Regulation," which illustrated the real damage 
overzealous federal bureaucrats can do to the economy, businesses, and individuals.

The expertise built up over five years of intensive research, aided by new 
data-processing capabilities, enabled Heritage's health-policy experts, headed 
by <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Stuart
Butler</a>, Vice President and Director, Domestic Policy Studies, and 
Deputy Director <a href="/heritage/staff/moffit.htm">Robert Moffit</a>, to play a significant role in the defeat of 
government-controlled health care in 1994. After providing Congress and the 
media with a wealth of material showing why the Clinton health-care plan would 
be a disaster, the Heritage analysts produced more than a dozen papers during 
a three-week summer period analyzing in detail the many alternative plans that 
flooded the marketplace after the collapse of the Clinton plan. The result: 
Any hope of placing one-seventh of the U.S. economy under the control of the 
federal government vanished.
<P>
Meanwhile, Heritage continued to argue that the best way to reform health care 
is to de-link health insurance from the workplace so individuals can own their 
own health policies and have a direct stake in their cost. This idea was the 
model for the Consumer Choice Health Security Act, sponsored in the 103rd Congress 
by Sen. Don Nickles (R-OK) and Rep. Cliff Stearns (R-FL).

Even as Heritage Welfare and Family Issues Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> was exposing 
President Clinton's welfare-reform plan as another expansion of the welfare 
state, Cultural Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a> was helping focus the nation's 
attention on the connection between the startling rise in illegitimate births 
and other social pathologies, such as crime and failure in school. In both 
the House and Senate, 1994 saw the introduction of legislation based on Rector's 
research and recommendations. Many of these same ideas - such as banning increased 
benefits for unwed mothers under age 21 who have additional children, requiring 
welfare recipients to work for their benefits, and putting an overall cap on 
welfare spending - were included in the House GOP's "Contract with America."

Also in 1994, Heritage Distinguished Fellow in Cultural Policy Studies <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William 
Bennett</a>'s "Index of Leading Cultural Indicators" was updated, expanded, and 
published as a quality paperback by Touchstone Books, a division of Simon and 
Schuster. Americans now have at their fingertips the information they need 
to monitor long-term trends in America's social health. Bennett's "The Book 
of Virtues," meanwhile, remained on The New York Times bestseller list throughout 
the year.

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - President's Message -- Heritage</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><H2><I><FONT SIZE = "+3">P</FONT>resident's <FONT SIZE = "+3">M</FONT>essage</I></H2></CENTER>

<CENTER><B>Wow, What a Year!</B></CENTER>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<p>
Early on the morning of November 9, 1994, as I sat contemplating the "tsunami," 
or shock wave, that the national elections had unleashed on official Washington, 
I noticed a copy of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress</a>" in my bookcase, a book which Heritage 
published in 1988.
<P>
In the Foreword to that book, a young Georgia Congressman wrote, "Every citizen 
should be concerned about the arrogance and corruption of the present day Congress. 
 At stake is the liberty of the American public. must reform Congress to make 
it truly representative once again."
<P>
Newt Gingrich had it right. And on Nov. 8, millions of Americans expressed 
that concern at the ballot box by sending to Washington and the statehouses 
and legislatures of America an army of lawmakers dedicated to reforming Congress 
and finishing the conservative revolution Ronald Reagan began in 1980.
<P>
The following week, at the largest President's Club meeting in Heritage's history, 
that same Georgia Congressman gave one of his first public addresses as the 
future Speaker of  the U.S. House of Representatives - the first Republican 
speaker in 40 years. "Heritage," Gingrich said, "is without question the most 
far-reaching conservative organization in the country in the war of  ideas, 
and one which has had a tremendous impact not just in Washington, but literally 
across the planet."
<P>

California Gov. Pete Wilson, three days later, also visited us at Heritage, 
giving a major national address on the ways in which liberalism had distorted 
the relationship between the state and federal governments. Governor Wilson, 
who had spoken earlier in the year at a meeting of our Governors' Forum,  described 
Heritage "as an island of clear thinking and common sense amid the fuzzy-headed 
liberalism of Washington.  Here at Heritage you have long been champions of 
the idea of limited government in order to expand individual opportunity, an 
idea that was at the heart of last week's ballot box rebellion."
<P>
The impact of all this really hit home a week later when Harvard's Kennedy 
School of Government canceled the orientation program it had been holding for 
newly elected members of Congress since 1972. The reason?  Lack of interest: 
Most members of Congress's Class of 1994 had decided to attend the Heritage 
Foundation/Empower America orientation conference. As Harvard's hometown newspaper, 
the liberal Boston Globe, said in a major article, "In the capricious business 
of supplying politicians with academic expertise and advice, if Harvard's star 
is fading, The Heritage Foundation's is surely on the ascent."
<P>

<p>
What a month November was. What a year!

<P>
The important thing to remember is that all of this didn't just happen.  Just 
as Heritage drew up the battle plan for the first conservative insurgency against 
Washington's liberal fortress with our "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/mnd2.html">Mandate for Leadership</a>" series, we 
also have had a major role in fashioning the new conservative agenda.  Heritage 
welcomed 1994 with "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues '94</a>," first-of-its-kind briefing book for congressional 
candidates. "Issues '94" provided comprehensive data on a dozen key national 
issues, from federal spending and defense policy to congressional reform.
<P>
Later in the year our analysts were asked for their input on the House GOP 
leadership's proposal to do the unthinkable: tell the American voters where 
they stand on the important issues of the day. The result was the "Contract 
with America." 
<P>
This was followed by still another major set of recommendations for the the 
conservative 104th Congress, "The New Member's Guide to the Issues."
<P>
As New York's Village Voice, one of the bellwethers of counterculture liberalism, 
said of the new conservative agenda: "The driving force behind this conservative 
program is the Heritage Foundation, which over the last decade has occupied 
center stage as the preeminent think tank in Washington .... Heritage was the 
architect of the attack on the New Deal Congress, and has been an important 
force in developing the assault on the liberal-minded federal civil service, 
the drive for privatization, and the overall philosophy of free market economics."
<P>

<P>
All of this was accomplished as the men and women of Heritage went about a 
range of activities that made 1994 the single most productive year in our 21-year 
history. We developed "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," which already is redefining 
the U.S. foreign aid debate; produced a comprehensive tax-relief and deficit-reduction 
plan, "Putting Families First," which became the official alternative budget 
of congressional Republicans in 1994; provided much of the intellectual ammunition 
that led to the demise of health-care "reforms" that would have put the federal 
government in charge of the trillion-dollar U.S. health-care system; played 
a major role in the GATT debate; exposed the crime bill as little more than 
another pork-laden social-spending bill; crafted a welfare reform plan that 
would truly "end welfare as we know it"; began work on a major study of agriculture 
policy, with publication timed for the 1995 debate on the farm bill; and launched 
a new institution-wide program, the American Trader Initiative, to push for 
a liberalized trade policy that dramatically increases international business 
opportunities.          
<P>

Clearly, 1994 was a banner year in terms of  policy development. But there 
was much more:
<P>
... Heritage military analysts, in a series of studies examining the administration's 
defense budget, found that the administration had underfunded its own defense 
plan more than $100 billion over five years.
<P>
... Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William J. Bennett</a>, one of the country's leading voices 
on cultural policy and a  featured speaker at our April Board Meeting & Public 
Policy Seminar, saw his "The Book of Virtues" stay at the top of the national 
bestseller lists. Touchstone Books, meanwhile, published an expanded and updated 
version of Bennett's landmark Heritage study, "The Index of Leading Cultural 
Indicators." 
<P>
... A seminal study by Heritage Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, chronicling 
the terrible consequences to children and society of out-of-wedlock births, 
sent shockwaves across the country, adding a new sense of urgency to the continuing 
debate over welfare reform.
<P>
... We also released the second edition of "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>," 
which remains the only comprehensive conservative blueprint for post-Cold War 
foreign and defense policy.
<P>
... The Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press (WRAPP) was re-established 
under Heritage's sponsorship; and
<P>
... A record 130 organizations joined us at Heritage's 17th Annual <a href="/heritage/resource_bank/rtoc.html">Resource 
Bank</a> Meeting.
<P>
Major advances in our computer capabilities, meanwhile, provided Heritage analysts 
with a powerful new analytical tool rivaling that of the government itself. 
For example: Using our computer model, Heritage analysts were able to measure 
the impact of health-care proposals on businesses, workers, families, and the 
states.
<P>
In addition to the vastly expanded computer capabilities, we also upgraded 
our radio broadcast facilities, enabling talk show hosts to air their programs 
live from Heritage's studios on Capitol Hill. And our magazine, <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>, 
continued to grow, reaching another circulation milestone - 30,000. As Boston 
Globe columnist David Warsh wrote, "No magazine has been more vivid in conveying 
the cultural breadth and depth of the conservative imagination."
<P>
These are just a few of the highlights from an incredibly productive, whirlwind 
year. Heritage also remained one of Washington's leading policy forums, with 
dozens of  lectures, seminars, and debates filling our Lehrman Auditorium and 
Van Andel Conference Center. 


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>eople <FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>re <FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>olicy</CENTER></H3>
<P>
As you know, when The Heritage Foundation was first established in 1973 we 
made a conscious decision to be different from Washington's other "think tanks." 
 Our goal - then, as now - was to have an impact on the national public policy 
debate, not just publish research papers and host conferences. To do this, 
we identified target markets in the Congress, the administration, and the news 
media and then designed our research product to meet the needs of the marketplace. 

<P>
Today we are a permanent Washington institution. But we still pride ourselves 
on our originality and inventiveness; on steering the debate, not just responding 
to it. 
<P>
What enables us to do this?  Our people - who are among the chief intellectual 
resources of Washington's new conservative establishment.
<P>
During 1994, we made several important changes in our management team. <a href="/heritage/staff/gaynerl.htm">Lew 
Gayner</a> was named Vice President for External Relations and will oversee Heritage's 
outreach to the business community, conservative policy organizations, and 
the nation's governors. <a href="/heritage/staff/przystup.htm">James Przystup</a>, a former Defense Department official 
and a Japan specialist, was named Director of our Asian Studies Center. Bridget 
Wagner, a 13-year Heritage veteran, was named Director of Business Relations. 
And Margaret Bonilla, a seven-year Heritage veteran, was named Director of 
Development.
<P>
Notable staff additions included <a href="/heritage/staff/fagan.htm">Patrick Fagan</a>, Deputy Assistant Secretary 
of Health and Human Services during the Bush administration, who was named 
Senior Policy Analyst, and <a href="/heritage/staff/winston.htm">David Winston</a>, who joined us as Senior Fellow in 
Statistical Policy Analysis.  
<P>
With sadness we note the passing of three giants of the conservative movement: 
Dr. Russell Kirk, a long-time Heritage Distinguished Scholar, lecturer, critic, 
conscience of the conservative movement, and author of dozens of books,  including 
"The Conservative Mind"; Dr. Walter Judd, conservative leader, American patriot, 
recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and a dedicated member of The 
Heritage Foundation; and Shelby Cullom Davis, the New York investment banker 
and former Ambassador to Switzerland who served with great distinction as Heritage's 
long-time Board Chairman. The memory of these three great Americans will live 
on at Heritage, as will the impact they had on America and the world.
<P>
While we continue to take great pride in our work, we realize that it is possible 
only because of the continued generous support of our donors. We thank them, 
sincerely. In 1994, income topped $25.5 million, most of it coming from the 
200,000 individuals, foundations, and businesses that comprise the Heritage 
family.
<P>


<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>he <FONT SIZE = "+2>F</FONT>uture</H3></CENTER>
<P>
What about 1995 and beyond? Conservatives have spent the past 20 years building 
a broad network of institutions dedicated to common-sense government  - think 
tanks, state-based research organizations, public interest law groups, radio 
talk shows, on-line computer networks, even a conservative television network 
(soon to be joined by one or more others).  With these institutions solidly 
in place we got our message out. It was heard and understood. 
<P>
Heritage will play a very active role in shaping the new Washington. Our agenda 
 includes reductions in taxes and federal spending - including the elimination 
of several government departments, agencies, programs, and functions - welfare 
and entitlement reform, a revival of federalism, de-regulation of the economy, 
restoring defense readiness, protecting the United States against possible 
missile attack, stopping the spread of global terrorism, and re-examining U.S. 
foreign aid. 
<P>
We are starting an exciting journey that should result in a major change in 
the relationship between the American people and their government. All of us 
at Heritage look forward to being a part of this promising new chapter in American 
history.

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
Ideas count - and the best way to express ideas remains the written word. Heritage 
offered Washington lots of words in 1994,  publishing more than 250 books, 
monographs, and policy studies. The papers ranged from brief commentaries to 
5,000-to-10,000-word "Backgrounders" and lengthier monographs, such as 
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/issu.html">Issues 
'94: The Candidate's Briefing Book</a>," "A Citizen's Guide to Regulation," and 
"
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/indx.html">The Index of Economic Freedom</a>," a 1995 publication released in December. Regular 
newsletters included "Heritage Today" and  "Heritage Members News," featuring 
information about Heritage Foundation people and activities; "The Insider," 
reporting on publications and activities of Resource Bank groups; "Business/Education 
Insider," focusing on the role of business in education reform; and "Reforming 
Congress: Changing the Way Washington Works," which kept a watchful eye on 
the wayward Congress.
<P>
While Heritage research papers are provided free of charge to the policy-making 
community, there is great demand beyond that. In addition to printed copies, 
most Heritage policy studies also are available electronically on the NEXIS 
data-retrieval system and <a href="http://www.townhall.com">Town Hall</a>, the conservative computer network co-owned 
by Heritage and National Review. Town Hall operates as a private forum on CompuServe. 
Some Heritage publications are available additionally on audiotape. 

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">P</FONT>olicy <FONT SIZE = "+2">R</FONT>eview</H3></CENTER>

Heritage's flagship publication is <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>. Sprightly and unpredictable, 
Policy Review reached an all-time high in paid circulation in 1994: 30,000, 
a 30 percent  increase over the previous year. 
<p>
Policy Review's impact, however, continued to exceed its circulation. The summer 
issue, for example, featured a prescient article, "Flanagan's Island: How Boys 
Town Rescues Troubled Teens." Following the GOP sweep in November's congressional 
elections, Boys Town became a symbol for the kind of "tough love" proposed 
in the GOP's welfare-reform plan. The spring issue featured an article by Houston 
constable Victor Trevino, "Zebra Territory: The Courage of Houston's Volunteer 
Cops." A Mexican immigrant, Trevino told how he has organized volunteer patrols 
in his district, cutting truancy in half and crime by 10 percent without increasing 
taxes. The fall issue featured a headline-making article by  Rush Limbaugh: 
"Voice of America: Why Liberals Fear Me."  Excerpts appeared in the Sunday 
Los Angeles Times and dozens of other newspapers. The talk-radio phenomenon 
had been explored earlier in the year in "The Gurus of Gab," a lively symposium 
featuring 10 of America's top talkers. Among the prominent political figures 
with 1994 Policy Review bylines were Rep. Dick Armey (R-TX); Sen. Phil Gramm 
(R-TX); Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL); and Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler.

<p>
<a href="/heritage/dept_writeups/mbrship.html">Join the Heritage
Foundation!</a>
<p>
The Heritage Foundation received another vote of confidence from its members 
and donors in 1994:  For the 21st consecutive year, income from contributions 
was up - to an all-time record of $21.5 million - as was Heritage's influence 
and impact.
<p>
With more than 200,000 individual, foundation, and corporate supporters, The 
Heritage Foundation remains the most broadly supported research institute in 
the United States. Of the $25.5 million in total income - a 12 percent increase 
over 1993 ($22.9 million) - 50 percent was provided by individuals, 25 percent 
by foundations, and 9 percent by business contributors.
<P>
But Heritage members and supporters do more than write checks: They receive 
Heritage publications, attend meetings, visit with Heritage representatives, 
and learn about the issues of the day. Heritage's members fuel the institution's 
success in two ways: They provide the financial resources needed for Heritage 
to do its job in Washington, and many of them take the knowledge they gain 
through their personal involvement with Heritage back to their local communities.
<P>


Since its founding in 1973, Heritage has made it a firm policy to accept no 
government funding, perform no contract work, and maintain no political or 
academic affiliations. All contributions are voluntary and tax deductible under 
Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. This enables Heritage to maintain 
its independence; it also means that Heritage's officers and staff must earn 
the trust of members and supporters each year.
<P>

Most Heritage donors are motivated by two things: They agree with the conservative 
principles upon which Heritage's work is based, and they believe The Heritage 
Foundation uses their money wisely. Said one President's Club member, "If it 
weren't for ... The Heritage Foundation, I would despair for our country. You 
give me a reason for optimism." Added a corporate Executive Committee Member, 
"The Heritage Foundation has earned a reputation as an incubator of ideas ... 
[that] foster democracy, free enterprise and political freedom. We remain convinced 
that there are ample returns on our investment in Heritage and believe the 
important work of The Heritage Foundation needs to continue." And a Heritage 
Associate put it this way: "As our government becomes more oppressive and as 
our culture deteriorates look increasingly to Heritage for solutions. Keep 
up the good work."
<P>
Heritage strives to involve its supporters in the war of ideas in a number 
of ways.  During 1994, the Heritage staff held more than 400 one-on-one meetings 
with individual, foundation, and corporate donors to hear their views and to 
report on Heritage accomplishments. Heritage publications provide another avenue 
of communications. Heritage Members News, published quarterly, is distributed 
to all  200,000 members; members of the President's Club, Associates, and Founder-level 
donors also receive Heritage studies. Regular programs and events for donors 
featuring presentations by policymakers and Heritage experts include the following:

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">F</FONT>ounders</H3></CENTER>

Heritage Founders are those individuals, foundations, and corporations who 
provide $100,000 or more during the year to The Heritage Foundation.  In 1994, 
30 donors gave at the Founders level. Founders are invited to the Annual Board 
Meeting and Public Policy Seminar and to a special Founders briefing at Heritage. 
Those who attended the 1994 briefing, held on  December 7, were able to talk 
shop with Heritage Distinguished Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a>; William Kristol, Chairman 
of the Project for the Republican Future; Vin Weber, Vice Chairman of Empower 
America; and Michael Joyce, President of the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation.

<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">H</FONT>eritage <FONT SIZE = "+2">A</FONT>ssociates</H3></CENTER>

Heritage Associates, those who give $10,000 or more, are invited, along with 
Heritage Trustees and Founders, to participate in Heritage's Annual  Board 
Meeting and Public Policy Seminar. The 1994 meeting, the ninth in this series, 
was held in Amelia Island, FL, in April. Featured speakers were Distinguished 
Fellows William Bennett and <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a>, Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, author 
and Heritage Trustee Midge Decter, and author Charles Murray. Rep. Tillie Fowler 
(R-FL), who represents the northeastern Florida district in which Amelia Island 
lies, welcomed the more than 150 guests.

With the future Speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich, as the lead-off speaker, 
the Nov. 15 President's Club meeting was the largest in the program's 12-year 
history. The day-long event attracted more than 500 Heritage friends and supporters 
for a series of discussions on Washington's political reordering. In his speech, 
"What the Elections Mean to Conservatives," Gingrich said, "There are changes 
we have to make, and we badly need The Heritage Foundation's help intellectually 
in understanding how to make them." Dinner speaker Jack Kemp focused on Heritage's 
pivotal role as the idea factory for the conservative revolution.
<P>

Representative Gingrich also was the keynote speaker at Heritage's May President's 
Club meeting. Other speakers at the meeting included Rep. Tim Hutchinson (R-AR) 
and, at the Executive Committee luncheon, Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-WA).

Health care issues dominated public policy in 1994.  With many medical doctors 
feeling excluded from the health-care debate, Heritage Chairman David R. Brown, 
M.D.,  started the Physician's Council. The inaugural meeting, in June, featured 
Sens. Don Nickles (R-OK) and Connie Mack (R-FL), co-sponsors of the Consumer 
Choice Health Security Act, and Bernadine Healy, former Director of the National 
Institutes of Health.  A second meeting of the Physician's Council was held 
in conjunction with the November President's Club meeting.  Nearly 700 doctors 
had joined the Council by year end.

Issues and ideas also were on the agenda at two regional policy seminars held 
in 1994: July 18 in Monterey, CA, where Jack Kemp's keynote address focused 
on the need to make U.S. interests the centerpiece of American foreign policy, 
and March 8 in Palm Beach, FL, where the focus was health care and crime.
<P>

<P>

In addition to these two half-day regional meetings, Distinguished Fellow Bill 
Bennett and Heritage Vice President <a href="/heritage/staff/vonkan.htm">John Von Kannon</a> spoke to 150 supporters

1994 saw continued growth in the Windsor Society, a special group of dedicated 
Heritage Members who contribute to the Heritage Foundation's long-range financial 
objectives through their estate plans or other planned gifts. In 1994, twenty-nine 
Heritage members made commitments to Heritage totaling more than $3.5 million. 
These generous gifts will ensure that there will always be a principled conservative 
institution in Washington fighting for free enterprise, limited government, 
traditional American values, and a strong national defense. 

In February 1994, the eighth meeting of the Windsor Society was held at the 
Biltmore Hotel in Scottsdale, AZ. The three-day conference focused on the crucial 
battle over health care that was unfolding in Washington. Heritage experts 
and more than 40 Heritage members discussed the importance of the health care 
debate in terms of America's future. Presentations on estate planning were 
also available to interested Heritage members, not only to support their deeply 
held conservative beliefs, but also to assist them and their families in their 
financial planning.  
<P>
The Windsor Society continues to help build the future financial support Heritage 
will need to continue fighting well into the 21st century for the values and 
principles which built America.

<P>
In August, at the end of a mind-numbing, daylong congressional hearing on welfare 
reform, Heritage Foundation Senior Policy Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> began his remarks.
<P>
"The `War on Poverty' has been an incredibly costly failure," he told the House 
Human Relations Subcommittee.
<P>
The "welfare state" is made up of some 75 programs targeted to low-income and 
poor Americans, with a total annual cost exceeding $324 billion; the nation 
has spent $5.3 trillion since the War on Poverty began, he said.
<P>
"What are the names of these programs? Do you have a listing of these programs?" 
interrupted the Subcommittee Chairman, Rep. Harold Ford, Tennessee Democrat.
<P>
"They're listed in my testimony," said Mr. Rector, who went on to explain that 
the average tax-paying household spent $3,400 in 1993 to combat poverty and 
that by 1999, the nation could be spending $550 billion a year on welfare.
<P>
"I'm going to correct you now," Mr. Ford interrupted again. The subcommittee, 
he explained, was only interested in hearing about Aid to Families with Dependent 
Children (AFDC), food stamps, and Medicaid.
<P>
"With all due respect ... you are not going to come here to this committee 
and give us these numbers," Mr. Ford said. "You are not going to leave the 
public perception that we are spending all these billions and billions of dollars 
on welfare."
<P>

<P>

<P>
The above story was recalled in <a href="http://www.townhall.com/townhall/Wash_Times/">The Washington Times</a> in a major year-end feature 
on welfare reform. Despite Congressman Ford's denials, Heritage's Robert Rector 
is correct: The official Congressional Research Service includes more than 
80 distinct programs in its inventory of "means-tested"  federal welfare programs. 
<P>

Like others at Heritage, Rector spends much of his time challenging conventional 
wisdom. You can't "end welfare as we know it," he says, unless you first understand 
both the nature of poverty and the patchwork system cobbled together during 
the past 30 years to fight it. Rector is one of the few in Washington who understands 
both, and the "fix" he proposed in his August testimony - and in numerous speeches 
and talk-radio appearances throughout the year - can be seen in the House GOP's 
"Contract with America." As <a href="http://www.townhall.com/nationalreview/">National Review</a> described Rector's proposal in 
a Dec. 31, 1994, editorial: "The Heritage Foundation-inspired Talent-Faircloth 
bill takes 65 welfare programs with 10,000 pages of regulations and boils them 
down to one block grant with a short set of guiding principles." The rest of 
the story will be written in 1995.
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>

<P>

Throughout 1994, Heritage Foundation analysts repeatedly challenged both the 
conventional wisdom and the status quo. 
<P>
In a few instances, Heritage's role was primarily that of honest critic. The 
administration's crime bill, for example, almost failed after Heritage's Scott 
Hodge examined the fine print and found that the bulk of the funds would be 
spent on spurious "crime prevention" measures, such as arts and crafts and 
midnight basketball leagues. Heritage also was a vigorous critic of the administration's 
health-care plan, its re-regulation of the economy, its misguided foreign policy, 
and the haphazard way in which it has reduced defense spending.
<P>
In most cases, Heritage analysts were ready with concrete alternatives to the 
flawed proposals. The Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan, for example, provided 
Washington with a principled private-sector solution to America's health-care 
problems - a solution that would increase the choices available to most Americans 
while still helping to control medical costs. Heritage's foreign-policy blueprint, 
"<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>,"  brought to international affairs a sense 
of mission and purpose lacking in the administration's foreign policy. Heritage's 
updated prosperity plan for America, "Putting Families First" - a comprehensive 
program for strengthening family finances, promoting capital expansion, and 
balancing the budget - served as the basis of the alternative budget offered 
by congressional Republicans. And "The Index of Economic Freedom," released 
at year end, not only showed how the U.S. foreign aid program has gone astray, 
but offered a focused free-market approach to revitalizing the wasteful program.
<P>

<P>

There were even instances when the administration and The Heritage Foundation 
found themselves in agreement. John M. Olin Senior Fellow <a href="/heritage/staff/cobb.htm">Joe Cobb</a>, for example, 
played a pivotal role in the debate over the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade (GATT) and was publicly credited by both the White House and the media 
with helping to blunt protectionist attacks on the global trade pact.
<P>
Throughout its 21-year history, The Heritage Foundation has always tried to 
make a difference. As the following stories show, the entire Heritage organization 
- research; government, media, and business relations; the lectures and seminars 
program; Policy Review; and Heritage's more than 200,000 community ambassadors: 
its members - all play a role in Heritage's efforts to change the direction 
of public policy. Sometimes, the entire organization may be involved in a project. 
Other times, a single analyst or a single study - when properly marketed to 
key members of Congress and the right mix of media opinion-leaders - can change 
the course of the debate.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">I</FONT>t's a <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>rime</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress's bitter summer debate over the administration's crime bill, for example, 
might never have taken place if it weren't for the tenacity of Heritage's <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">Bill 
Bennett</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/hodge.htm">Scott Hodge</a>.  
<P>
When the anti-crime package was first introduced, the bill was expected to 
sail through both houses of Congress by wide margins. After all, with drug-related 
street crime running rampant in most urban areas, what politician wanted to 
be seen as an opponent of crime control? Then Bennett, the former Secretary 
of Education and U.S. drug czar, and Hodge, Heritage's Grover M. Hermann Fellow 
in Federal Budgetary Affairs, took a closer look at the proposal. 
<P>
Bennett, the first public figure to criticize the proposal, found that the 
federal government was once again usurping the power and authority of state 
and local government. Hodge's analysis struck closer to home. Rather than put 
100,000 new police officers on America's streets, as the administration claimed, 
Hodge found that the crime bill would finance only 20,000 police officers - 
leaving state and local government with the rest of the tab. [A subsequent 
Heritage study showed each state exactly how much.] The remainder of the more 
than $30 billion Congress was being asked to approve, Hodge's analysis showed, 
was earmarked for various "crime prevention" initiatives - urban pork - that 
duplicated existing programs, none of which had done much to deter crime. 
<P>
Hodge's findings were marketed aggressively to the news media and immediately 
vaulted to the top of talk radio's list of hottest topics. Critics on Capitol 
Hill quickly joined the fray, and support for the legislation went into free 
fall - all because of a single study that looked beyond the rhetoric at the 
details. So compelling were the Heritage data that the White House communications 
office issued a formal rebuttal in an effort to discredit Heritage's analysis. 
This prompted several reporters to do some homework of their own. To the great 
consternation of the White House, they found that Hodge was correct. As a Harris 
poll later confirmed, a majority of the public got the Heritage message: the 
crime bill was more about pork than about fighting crime. 
<P>
The White House effort to discredit Heritage failed - and the crime bill nearly 
failed with it. In the end, the legislation was approved by a very narrow margin, 
but congressional pork-busters are revisiting the bill in 1995.
<P>

<P>
Heritage's involvement in the health-care debate began in 1989 before there 
was a national health-care debate. Since the publication of that original Heritage 
Foundation monograph, "A National Health System for America" (Stuart M. Butler 
and Edmund F. Haislmaier, editors), Heritage has published more than 50 papers 
on the various problems plaguing the health financing system and the proposals 
- good and bad - for fixing those problems. During the summer of 1994, for 
example, as Congress rushed ahead with alternatives to the mortally wounded 
Clinton Health Security Act,  Heritage's research team worked around the clock 
to offer detailed analyses of proposed alternatives. In one three-week period 
in August, Heritage published and publicized 12 different studies detailing 
the serious problems with various health-care proposals.
<P>
In the end,  the entire effort to increase the government's control over health 
care in America collapsed. The final chapter was a war of words over which 
reform plan would give ordinary Americans the same kind of health coverage 
enjoyed by government officials. 
<P>
It was a war Heritage's analysts and media specialists had spent all year preparing 
for - because only Heritage could win this war. As Heritage asked in a widely 
published advertisement: "Hillary Rodham Clinton Has It. George Stephanopoulos 
Has It. Donna Shalala and all Cabinet Members Have It. Ted Kennedy Has It. 
So Why Can't All Americans Have What They Have?" 
<P>


What they have, we explained, is "a health benefits system that allows them 
to choose among dozens of competing health-care insurers and providers, works 
with a minimum of regulation ... and because it relies on the principles of 
choice and competition, has successfully controlled costs." This was important 
because just one reform proposal, the Heritage Consumer Choice Health Plan 
(and its legislative version, the Nickles-Stearns Consumer Choice Health Security 
Act), was similar in design to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program 
(FEHBP). 
<P>
In truth, FEHBP is a government program in name only; all benefits are provided 
by private insurers who compete with one another for business. By focusing 
attention on FEHBP - in hundreds of radio talk-show appearances, speeches, 
congressional Town Hall meetings, Capitol Hill briefings, and newspaper editorial 
board meetings - Heritage experts were able not only to point to an existing 
market-based system that works, but to demonstrate the insincerity of Washington 
officials who would impose a government-run system on most Americans while 
retaining a consumer-based system for themselves.
<P>

<P>
With time running out, most major sponsors of reform legislation - including 
President Clinton, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-MA), and other backers of government-run 
health care - had no choice but to claim their proposals' kinship to FEHBP, 
even if it wasn't true. Those who had been closely following the health-care 
debate knew better; only the Heritage plan - based on the principles of individual 
choice and market competition  - followed the successful model.
<P>
While support for the other reform plans withered as the details became better 
known, support for the Heritage approach increased as details became more widely 
known. The support was as broad as it was deep. Some 25 members of the Senate 
and an equal number of House members co-sponsored the Nickles-Stearns bill. 
The Heritage approach also was endorsed by several state medical societies, 
a national association of nursing homes, and more than 150 newspapers, magazines, 
and columnists. Meanwhile, some 700 individual doctors became personal advocates 
of the consumer-choice plan as members of the Heritage Foundation Physician's 
Council.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">B</FONT>ottoms <FONT SIZE = "+2">U</FONT>p</H3></CENTER>
<P>
When Heritage defense analysts <a href="/heritage/staff/spring.htm">Baker Spring</a> and John Luddy warned in March 
that the Clinton administration had underfunded its own defense plan, the so-called 
"Bottom-Up Review," by a five-year total of $100 billion, the White House and 
Pentagon cried foul.
<P>
A few months later, they - and the rest of Washington - discovered that The 
Heritage Foundation is true to its word when it describes itself as a "conservative" 
think tank. Congress's auditing arm, the General Accounting Office (GAO), took 
its own look at the mismatch between the administration's defense plan and 
the Pentagon budget and found that Heritage's $100 billion estimate had been 
very conservative. The shortfall, GAO said, was closer to $150 billion.
<P>
After the GOP takeover of Congress - which catapulted two long-time friends 
of Heritage's,  Sen. Strom Thurmond and Rep. Floyd Spence, South Carolina Republicans, 
into the chairmanship of the Senate and House Armed Services committees - the 
administration suddenly "got religion" and admitted that the defense budget 
would have to be increased substantially in order to maintain military readiness. 
The increase the administration proposed was inadequate, but at least it was 
a start.
<P>
Heritage's analysts, meanwhile, continued to identify billions of dollars in 
non-defense pork that had been buried in the defense budget. Defense spending, 
no doubt, will be a major policy issue in 1995. 
<P>

<P>
From the crush of reporters and the bank of television cameras lined up in 
the long, rectangular room, you would have thought that President Clinton or 
Pope John Paul II was present. Instead, the star attraction was a radio talk-show 
host. Not any talk-show host, mind you, but the king: Rush Limbaugh.
<P>
The occasion was The Heritage Foundation's orientation conference for newly 
elected members of the 104th Congress. For many of the more than 65 new members 
of the House and Senate who attended the three-day (Dec. 8-10) Baltimore conference, 
co-sponsored with Empower America, the conference was more like a family reunion. 
They already knew Heritage. One new congressman told <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> he had refined 
his political philosophy over the years by reading <a href="/heritage/p_review/welcome.html">Policy Review</a>, Heritage's 
quarterly journal. Many of the others had used Heritage research during their 
campaigns.
<P>
No election in recent memory was more about issues and ideas than the contests 
that took place on Nov. 8, 1994. The House GOP's "Contract with America" - 
attacked by liberals throughout the campaign - provided voters with a concrete 
list of institutional and policy changes. As a number of reporters noted, many 
of the proposals had been seen before - in Heritage books and policy papers.
<P>
True to their promise, Congress's new Republican majority used the first day 
of the 104th Congress to perform surgery on the Congress itself. The "Contract 
with America" had promised a series of far-reaching changes "aimed at restoring 
the faith and trust of the American people in government." Virtually every 
one of these sweeping institutional changes - including a measure that would 
apply all U.S. laws to the Congress itself - had been proposed in Heritage's 
1993 book, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/ruli.html">The Ruling Class</a>," and fleshed out in subsequent Heritage papers. 

<P>
As Seattle talk-show host Mike Siegel reminded his listeners in a week-long 
series of broadcasts from Heritage's radio studio the week after the election, 
the Heritage recipe for reforming Congress had been a popular staple on talk 
radio throughout 1994. Now these proposals - embraced by millions of ordinary 
Americans while bitterly opposed by much of official Washington - had made 
their way back to the Nation's Capital, and a new revolution in government 
had begun.

<P>
What follows is a report on the people and programs that make The Heritage 
Foundation an American original. 
<P>

<p>


None of the programs should be viewed in a vacuum. The wide range of activities 
is possible only because of the encouragement and active support of Heritage's 
donors. In a city long dominated by the liberal left, Heritage's research papers 
command attention not just because they are timely and thorough, but because 
they are  professionally marketed and always on the mark. And Heritage's lectures 
and seminars, Policy Review and the Resource Bank all help widen the conservative 
circle. 
<P>

<p>
The Heritage Foundation's continuing efforts to build a better America and 
a safer world involve more than 150 dedicated employees and more than 200,000 
members who express their confidence each year by providing the financial support 
that has helped Heritage make a difference for 21 years. n

  </center> 
 <P> 
 The American Conservative Union is the nation's oldest conservative   
lobbying organization. ACU's purpose is to effectively communicate and   
advance the goals and principles of conservatism through one multi-issue,   
umbrella organization. The <a href="/conservative/acu.html">Statement of Principles</a> makes clear ACU's   
support of capitalism, belief in the doctrine of original intent of the   
framers of the Constitution, confidence in traditional moral values, and   
commitment to a strong national defense.  
 <P> 
Over the years, ACU has been on the cutting edge of major public policy   
battles. Among ACU's significant efforts, past and present, are opposing   
President Clinton's bureaucratic health proposal, his excessive spending   
and taxes, the Panama Canal giveaway, fighting to keep OSHA off the   
back of small businesses, opposing the SALT treaties, supporting aid to   
freedom fighters in Marxist countries, promoting the confirmation of   
conservative Justices to the Supreme Court, battling against higher taxes,   
and advocating the need for near-term deployment of strategic defenses.   
 <P> 
In 1994, through its Citizens Against Rationing Health coalition,   
sponsorship of national "town meetings," and a "Health Care Truth   
Tour," ACU spearheaded the conservative response on the health   
reform issue.  
 <P> 
Whether fighting for lower taxes and less government spending, more   
effective and efficient military protection, or the cause of freedom world-  
wide, by speaking for the entire conservative movement the American   
Conservative Union is always "Your Conservative Voice in Washington."  
 <P> 
<a name="ratings"><h3>RATINGS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1971, ACU has published annual ratings of Congress. Each   
member of the House and Senate is rated on a scale of 0 to 100, based on   
actual votes cast on a wide range of issues. The ratings are designed to   
show how members vote on all the major issues to gauge their adherence   
to conservative principles. As the conservative rating listed in all major   
political almanacs and reference guides, the ACU ratings are often quoted   
by the media and are extensively used by political strategists and   
candidates running for public office.  
 <P> 
The American Conservative Union has periodically published several   
special Voting Indices on specific important issue areas such as defense   
and SDI, judicial nominations, and pork barrel spending. In election   
years, the ACU has provided Interim Ratings of Congress to track votes   
that occurred during that Session before the elections.  
 <P> 
  
<a name="pubs"><h3>PUBLICATIONS</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>
 <P> 
ACU publishes selected legislative guides that are working manuals   
primarily used by members of Congress and their staffs. One example is   
<i>The Clinton Plan: More Power to Government</i>, documenting the  
Clinton record, and showing how he has consistently worked to give more power to Big Government -- and less to the American people.  
Another is <i><a href="/conservative/platformwelcome.html">The 1996 Committee for a Conservative Platform</a>  
</i>; a coalition effort by more than thirty groups to keep the Republican Party platform conservative.  
 <P> 
ACU has also produced audio and video messages, such as TV   
documentaries on the SALT treaties and the Panama Canal, among   
others. Recent productions have included hard-hitting ads on the Clinton   
gas tax, opposition to an invasion of Haiti, and an "infomercial" on health   
care reform. Complete A-V tapes of CPAC proceedings are also made   
available each year.  
 <P> 
<a name="cpac"><h3>CPAC</h3></a><br>
<a href="#table">Contents</a>  
 <P> 
 Since 1974, the ACU has hosted the annual <a href="http://www.cpac.org">Conservative Political   
Action Conference</a>. Thousands of conservative activists and leaders from   
around the nation meet for three days to discuss current issues and   
policies, and set the agenda for the future. Open to the general public,   
CPAC always offers a distinguished cast of participants. Among them   
have been Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush, Vice   
President Dan Quayle, Senate GOP leader Bob Dole, House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich, numerous other Senators and Representatives, Cabinet   
officers, media correspondents, international celebrities and other key   
political figures. CPAC serves to bring dedicated and talented Americans   
into the conservative movement and to train and motivate them for   
political action.<P>

<title>William W. Pascoe, III -- ACU</title>
</head>
<body>
<center>
<h2>William W Pascoe, III</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
William W. Pascoe, III, is the Political Director of the American Conservative Union, based in Alexandria, Virginia.  The ACU, celebrating its 31st anniversary, is the nation's oldest conservative grass-roots lobbying organization, and represents more than one million members and supporters, in each of the 50 states.  The organization lobbies on the entire range of issues before the Congress, and its annual vote ratings -- widely used by the media, academics, and other congressional analysts -- are considered the premier indicator of the Congress' ideological voting patterns.<p>
In his capacity as Political Director, Mr. Pascoe is responsible for overseeing the legislative, communications, and field operations of the organization.  These responsibilities entail gathering, collating, and analyzing information on matters of legislative interest; maintaining liaison with Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, their staffs, and committee staffs; representing the views of the ACU before such officials and staffs; directing the grass-roots lobbying efforts of the organization; compiling and analyzing the annual vote ratings; preparing all outgoing public communications of the organization; and dealing extensively with print and broadcast media to represent the organization's views on the wide range of public policy issues.<p>
In addition to his current duties at the ACU, Mr. Pascoe is also a columnist on national and international political issues for the Washington Times, and is the conservative talking head on "BattleLine," a twice-weekly point-counterpoint debate heard Tuesdays and Thursdays on Gene Pell's "Dateline America" radio show, nationally syndicated by Radio America. <p>
Prior to joining the ACU in 1993, Mr. Pascoe held numerous positions throughout the Washington political and policy-making community:  chief of staff to U.S. Rep. Bob McEwen (1992-93); Managing Partner of his own public affairs consulting firm, Pascoe, Norquist, Jones & Co. (1990-92); Executive Director of Krieble Associates, Inc., a private foundation and public affairs office in Washington dedicated to providing assistance to democratic activists behind the Iron Curtain (1988-90); liaison to the conservative community for Bush/Quayle '88, as Director of the Office of National Voter Coalitions (1988); Policy Analyst at The Heritage Foundation (1985-88); and consultant to the U.S. Department of State (1984-85).<p>
Mr. Pascoe was the Republican nominee for the 47th District seat in the Virginia General Assembly in 1987.<p>
Mr. Pascoe was graduated from the University of Virginia with a BA in Government and History in 1982, and an MA in Foreign Affairs in 1984.  He is a member of the Council for National Policy, the World Affairs Council of Washington, and MENSA.   <p>

<B><h2><I><center>The U.S. Government's 1995 Budget Estimates Of The Costs
Of IRAs</B></I></h2></center>
<hr>
<P>
The U.S. government's 1995 Budget, for the first time ever, has
included discounted present-value estimates of revenue losses
for certain &quot;tax expenditures&quot; set forth elsewhere in
the Budget presentation (The 1995 Budget of the United States
Government-Analytical Perspectives, pages 59, 60, &amp; 61).
<P>
The government describes these present-value estimates as &quot;representing
the tax expenditure revenue losses, net of future tax payments.&quot;
The 1995 budget document explains that the tax deferrals on the
contributions, and on the accrued earnings thereon (i.e., tax
expenditures), will eventually be paid out upon an IRA withdrawal
when taxes will then be due.  Thus, these expected receipts are
included in these government present-value estimates.  The government
also points out that the discount rate used for the present-value
estimates is the interest rate on comparable maturity Treasury
debt.
<P>
Based upon the above, the government's 1995 Budget document presented
the following estimates for IRAs:
<P>
<pre>		1994 Tax Revenue Loss Estimates for IRAs
		----------------------------------------	
			(In Millions Of Dollars)

	Tax Expenditure 			$5,415 (a)

	Discounted Present-Value
 	Of The Above Tax Expenditure 		$1,735 (b)
</pre>

Based on the above figures, the &quot;present-value&quot; costs of IRAs (b
above) only equal 32% of the tax expenditure costs (a above) used by the
government in formulating tax policy. <P>

In view of the fact that the government recovers the full IRA tax
deduction with interest upon a withdrawal, the above present-value costs
(b above) reflect solely the cost arising from the &quot;second
layer&quot; of ordinary income tax (double taxation) that should not be
imposed in the first place (see pages 6 &amp; 7). <P>

Clearly, the government now admits that its alleged cost estimate for IRAs
in 1994 is not $5.4 billion, but 68% less, i.e., $1,735,000. <I>In effect,
the government admits by its own analysis that its alleged &quot;tax
expenditure&quot; costs for IRAs that are used in formulating tax
legislation are three times higher than they should be!<B> </B>($5.4
billion &#247; $1.7 billion = 3.18)</I>

<P> And even the above severely reduced alleged cost of $1.7 billion is
erroneous, because, as portrayed earlier in this analysis, the government
is assuming that all the saving in IRAs is old saving.  This means that
the government would have, if it had not been for the IRAs, collected its
&quot;second layer&quot; of tax.  This second layer of tax is an improper,
self-defeating form of taxation. 

<P> The government also ignores the fact that there is <I>no</I> cost to
the government if IRA contributions are <I>new</I> saving. Further, the
government calculation <I>omits</I> the dynamic economic gains from
tax-deductible IRAs that create more capital through increased saving,
thereby increasing production, creating more jobs, higher standards of
living, and yes-more taxes. 

<P> <I>The magnitude of the true costs to our nation's economy arising
from such erroneous tax revenue estimates is virtually beyond
comprehension.  It is shocking, scandalous, and worthy of imposed
investigation and correction.</I>

WINCONFERENCE '95<BR>
Geneva, Switzerland<BR>
May 5, 1995<BR>
by Jack Kemp<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>
<P>


Thank you for the opportunity to address WINCONFERENCE 1995.  I am especially honored to be in the company of such distinguished speakers as President Von Weizsacker, Minister Wu Ti, Arthur Dunkel, and Professors Robert Fogel and Grigory Yavlinsky.
<P>
As we begin the celebration in but two days, of the 50th anniversary of the end of the war in Europe, we are reminded of how far the world has progressed.  The victory of Nazism and Fascism are outdone only by the more recent victories over Communism and apartheid.  We are seeing, however, not just an ending but the triumph of those 18th-century liberal democratic ideas today in extraordinary ways and in places we could never have predicted just a few years ago.
<P>
Consider events in South Africa.  Many people--with good reason--expected the Mandela government to lean leftward toward socialism and collectivism.  But look at what South Africa is doing in the field of housing. <I> The Wall Street Journal </I>reported recently, "The new South African Government's approach to housing for the poor is quite different from those of Western nations: the emphasis is on private ownership, not subsidized rental. . . . the South African way offers a route for its poor to build a better life, step by step.  Moreover, it is a historic departure from those of first-world welfare states and merits consideration elsewhere."
<P>
We live in a historical moment of tremendous opportunity in the world economy--a moment when so many nations are finally escaping the prison of centrally planned economies to discover the new world of free markets, free economies, free trade and free people.  It isn't very orderly and it isn't inevitable, but it's an exciting opportunity for leadership.
<P>
In addition, the United States has experienced no less than a political revolution in the last six months.  The Republicans, led by Speaker Gingrich, now control the House of Representatives for the first time since 1954.  Due in great measure to that shift of political power, in my opinion, the United States is poised to make significant contributions to the global economy.
<P>
I've been asked to speak specifically about America's role in this new world.  I don't believe it is an exaggeration to say that America's policies and America's attitudes will help determine not only its shape but its future.  America's foreign policy, and that of our friends and allies, has, at its best, long sought to advance the inter-connected causes of economic freedom and liberal democracy.  After the Second Work War, the United States recognized it had a responsibility as steward of these ideals.  The policy of containment was conceived not merely as military and territorial, but also as economic and ideological.  In announcing the Truman doctrine before a joint session of Congress, President Truman warned:
<P>
The seeds of oppressive regimes are nurtured by misery and want.  They spread and grow in the evil soil of poverty and strife.  They reach their full growth when the hope of a people for a better life has died.
<P>
We must keep that hope alive, indeed nurture and enhance it in the world.
<P>
The United States had enough faith in our democratic political system to help establish it in the lands of our former adversaries--and now close allies--Japan and Germany.
<P>
But we did more.  We recognized that a free international order requires certain international institutions to maintain it.  With the memories of beggar-thy-neighbor protectionism of the 1930s still fresh in our minds, the United States helped lead the world in establishing, at Bretton Woods, an international trading system and monetary regime based on a common and predictable unit of account, thereby removing exchange rate instabilities and fluctuations.  We have worked together in GATT to establish a system of open, free trade among nations.  All of this laid the groundwork for the incredible growth of work trade and the remarkable stability of the new quarter century as the West recovered from World War II.
<P>
It is my belief that an active, engaged America, and a United Europe, must help play that same vital role today;  promoting free markets, restoring stable and honest money, and helping build the institutions of democratic capitalism (particularly in the third world and former communist nations).  But fulfilling that promise directly depends on avoiding two great temptations.
<P>
One is the temptation of isolationism and protectionism which is sometimes found on the far-right.  The other temptation is the mindless multi-lateralism of the left.
<P>
With regard to the first temptation, two events have reshaped America's image of itself since World War II.  First is the recovery and prosperity of the Pacific Rim and Europe in particular.  Protectionist have attempted to use this fact to stir up resentment and fear.
<P>
Second, the Soviet Union collapsed under the weight of its own brutality and broken promises.  Isolationist have tried to use this as an argument that America's international role has ended.
<P>
The goal of both isolationists and protectionists is the same;  to narrow America's focus to domestic concerns, protect our markets and allow a world of strangers to take care of itself.
<P>
But the whole approach is based on the myth that the world economy is a zero-sum game, where every winner must be matched by a loser.
<P>
Fortunately, I think that most Americans and Europeans recognize and understand that the growth and prosperity of a unified Europe is good for America, and the growth and prosperity of the United States is good for Europe.  I was a strong supporter of NAFTA and GATT because I believe they are a vision of the entire world's future--free trade that extends to the Pacific rim and Europe so all can share in new markets and new prosperity from expanding global markets.  Now is the time to link a new trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific trade zone to NAFTA.
<P>
Protectionism in any form undermines efficiency by creating privileged industries and reducing the standard of living of workers and consumers.  Free trade is the best way to promote international development and attack third-work poverty.  Open markets bring benefits to both consumers in developed nations and workers in developing ones and vice versa.
<P>
The second great temptation, which is more common on the left, is for the United States to remain involved in the world, but to pursue a mindless and counter-productive multi-lateralism which turns over the economies of Third World and Eastern European countries to the IMF.  Mexico has been the most disturbing and recent example of the zero-sum approach.
<P>
The crisis in Mexico was not caused by some unexplainable force or unavoidable economic law.  It was caused by an explicit policy decision by the Clinton administration and international financial institutions, a policy of competitive devaluation that is based on the idea that Mexico would be better off by repudiating its debt, devaluing its currency, and dramatically reducing its imports.  The United States and the IMF advised the Mexican Government to devalue the peso, which has led to the institution of wage and price controls, higher taxes, the adoption of a comprehensive austerity, and loss of jobs, wages and pensions.
<P>
But austerity and devaluation are the problem, not the solution.  You can not enrich poor nations by impoverishing their people.  The answer to poverty is economic growth and entrepreneurial capitalism, which flow from the freedom of individuals to work, save, invest, be entrepreneurs and produce new wealth.  The role of government is to protect these freedoms.  This means preserving the value of people's money, not cheating them out of their savings, pensions and wages through so-called competitive devaluation.
<P>
Governments have a moral and pragmatic responsibility to protect, promote, and preserve the value of their currencies.  Argentina's minister of finance, Domingo Cavallo, put it best when he said his currency, the peso, is "a contract between the government and the peso holder.  That contract guarantees that each peso-- as a unit of value that the holder has worked hard to get--will be worth as much tomorrow as it is today.  If the government breaks that contact, it's breaking the law.  The only role of the government in the economy should be to guarantee the integrity of market transactions."  He could have said the same thing about the U.S. Dollar, the Deutsche Mark, the Yen, the Swiss Franc or any other currency.
<P>
It is interesting that ten years ago, when the dollar was a at a peak, the U.S. was advised that the budget deficit was causing the dollar to soar, and thus causing a trade deficit.  Now the dollar has fallen compared to the Yen from 270 to 83, yet the trade deficit has increased.  The conventional wisdom is telling us that our budget deficit causes a weak dollar and thus a trade deficit.  The lesson in this?  There is no connection between exchange rates and budget deficits.  You cannot cure a monetary problem with a fiscal solution.
<P>
A nation's people are its primary source of wealth.  What they need most is honest money and low tax rates to create opportunity--access to capital, ownership, and entrepreneurialism, which create wealth, jobs and enterprises.  Jude Wanniski, author of<I> The Way the World Works</I>, explained it well when he wrote, "The difference between people is the difference in the amount of capital available to them--financial capital or education capital.  Men are the same everywhere in the world, insofar as you give them a shovel to dig a hole with.  They do about as well in Rwanda, Bulgaria, Morristown or Sacramento.  Because we dig with power tools here and with sticks in Rwanda, our real wages are much higher.  If you tax capital too heavily, you are taxing this type of capital, and thus limiting the incomes of people."
<P>
We in the developed nations of the world should use our resources to help foster third-world and former Soviet bloc countries in the skills of market capitalism.  We should help build the institutions that liberate individual enterprise--private property, access to market, access to credit, stable legal structures, and easy incorporation of new businesses.  This is the best hope of developing world and the best definition of true cooperation and compassion for the less developed world.
<P>
The conventional wisdom on the left and the right all too often says the same thing:  that economic recovery, if possible at all, will be painful, hard to endure, and of such duration that not much can be done except inject massive doses of government assistance and IMF austerity.  But this, ladies and gentlemen, is exactly the same thing people said and believed about post-war West Germany.
<P>
Devastated post-war Berlin was the essence of a zero-sum society.  History records that young men fought with senior citizens for food scraps in the ruins and trash bins.  The Reichsmark was all but abandoned and replaced by a so-called "Zigaretten Wirtschaft" or cigarette economy.  A carton of Lucky Strikes became the unit of account, food, construction costs, workers wages . . . just about everything was priced in cigarettes.  The German press speculated about a possible U.S. loan of 50 million cartons of cigarettes to support the worthless Reichsmark.
<P>
People were losing hope that life would ever rise above this bleak level.  In the United States there were worries that democracy itself would fail in Europe if prosperity could not be restored.  And then, suddenly, something happened.
<P>
A finance minister who had studied the classical writings of Smith and Ricardo came to the forefront.  In just a few strokes of incredible political courage and economic vision, Ludwig Erhard changed the course of German history, and thus Western hopes for reconstruction.
<P>
One day in June--the 20th of June, 1948--he reformed the currency by abolishing the Reichsmark and substituting the Deutschemark.  He crushed inflation by tying the new currency to the U.S. Dollar, which, in turn, was tied to the stable exchange rate system worked out at Bretton Woods and thus established the integrity of this new West German numeraire.
<P>
Henry Wallich, a one time U.S. Federal Reserve Board member, in his book<I> The Mainsprings of German Revival</I>, wrote, "The spirit of the country changed overnight.  The gray, hungry and dead-looking figures wandering about the streets in their ever-lasting search for food came to life as, pocketing their 40 D-Marks, they went on their first spending spree."
<P>
On June 22, because inflation had pushed West German people into extremely high tax rates, Erhard indexed the tax brackets, dramatically lowering effective tax rates.  On July 7, he abolished rationing, canceled hundreds of regulations and eliminated wage and price controls, against the advice of the U.S. State Department and the military command.
<P>
According to the history books, within a year, West German workers were eating more and better food than those in austerity-ridden Britain, which had turned to a socialist government and, incidentally, received more Marshall aid money.
<P>
In two years, West Germany's real income increased 40 percent.  By 1952, her exports had risen 60 percent.  Over 12 years, from 1950 to 1962, while the U.S. GNP was increasing by a healthy 50%, West Germany's rose at a rate five times as great--247%.  Within a generation an autocratic nation twice defeated in the century's most destructive wars had become not only a world economic power, but a trusted friend and ally.
<P>
What caused this <I> Wirstchaftswunder-- </I>this economic miracle?  Well, first of all, it was not a miracle at all.  chancellor Adenauer and his Economics Minister, Ludwig Erhard, both said the Marshall plan had little to do with it.  It wasn't some government industrial policy.  It certainly wasn't a world bank or IMF-imposed austerity program.
<P>
Ludwig Erhard did not discover some magic formula or experience a sudden Utopian vision.  He simply, yet profoundly, applied the socially responsible free market prescriptions of classical supply-side economics.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<LI>He established a stable currency and maintained its integrity as a storehouse of value and a unit of account.
<LI>He slashed tariffs and other trade barriers.
<LI>He allowed the markets to work freely in setting prices and wages, and in allocating resources by eliminating, in one bold stroke, all rationing and price controls.
<LI>He dramatically rescued the steeply graduated tax rates on working, saving, investing, and producing.
<LI>He applied orderly principles of law to private property, patents, and contracts.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Erhard's reforms all rested on one fundamental principle of democracy:  that prosperity, wealth, and opportunity can only be created by people acting freely and entrepreneurially--by strengthening the people and their markets and relying on free enterprise--not government planning.
<P>
This is a message for Mexico and, indeed, every nation on earth:  The key to wealth and prosperity is allowing people freedom--freedom to work, to save, to trade, to succeed, and yes, to fail and yet try again.  The ultimate causes of wealth of nations are free people, free trade, and free enterprise.
<P>
This means preserving the value of people's money; not cheating them out of their savings through devaluation.  This will encourage them to save more.
<P>
This means defending their property rights through the rule of law, so the people need not fear the confiscation of the fruits of their labors.  This will encourage them to produce more.
<P>
This means taxing solely to raise revenues for the legitimate needs of the state, not to punish wealth and success to promote so-called egalitarian ends.
<P>
This means preserving the competition of the marketplace at all levels of enterprise, resisting the impulse to protect big business and state enterprise at the expense of young entrepreneurs who ultimately create most new wealth and new jobs.
<P>
These are the lessons we have learned in the West in the last two centuries, beginning with the linkage of Jeffersonian democracy and Adam Smith's economic system of natural liberty.  We have relearned and refined these lessons with Erhard's miracle in Germany, President Reagan's revolution in the United States, Margaret Thatcher's revitalization of Great Britain, Vaclav Klaus' success in the Czech Republic, and in the dramatic achievement of Asian economies.  Once started in motion, ideological momentum is difficult to stop.  Having achieved a victory in one place, it transcends borders and cultures and acquires a life of its own.
<P>
This is the genius of economic freedom from which every nation can benefit, both rich and poor, north and south.  No one succeeds at the expense of another.  Everyone benefits from their neighbor's prosperity.  It is the common ground on which to build a stable international community.  Protectionism yields conflict.  Economic freedom yields cooperation.  We create the conditions for peace throughout the advance of trade.
<P>
And that same freedom provides hope to nations that have lived too long without it.  Poverty is not an immutable condition.  Every nation is richly supplied with the most important natural resource--human creativity.  This is the seminal message of democratic capitalism's triumph:  growth is the product of individual effort, where the link between effort and reward is both preserved and promoted.
<P>
As we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of V-E Day, we should look once again at the 1944 conference of Bretton Woods.  The agreement at Bretton Woods successfully established an international monetary regime and helped promote free and open markets throughout most of the free world.  Ultimately, the agreement was responsible for unprecedented growth, prosperity, and trade.
<P>
Now with the end of the cold war, we have the perfect opportunity to have a new "Bretton Woods" international conference of the leading industrial and developed nations of the world to conclude the work begun at the G-7 in 1985 under Secretary James Baker.
<P>
But before that, the United States must get our own monetary house in order by re-establishing the U.S. Dollar as a reliable numeraire.  It must once again be as good as gold, which will have the effect of lowering interest rates.  As Utah Senator Bob Bennett pointed out, "For every one percent [interest rate] deduction on $4.5 trillion debt, that is $45 billion dollars in annual savings."  Furthermore, the U.S. must reduce the deficit not by raising taxes but through spending restraint and cuts, and tax-rate cuts.  I have been asked by the Republican leadership in Congress to chair a commission to restructure the tax system in the United States.  It is my goal to work toward a flatter, simpler, and fairer code which broadens the tax base and stimulates growth and capital formation.  This would strengthen the U.S. Dollar without requiring higher interest rates.
<P>
We should also immediately expand NAFTA to include Chile and other Latin American countries.  And it is time to establish a trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific free trade agreement that would unite the European common market with a North American and Pacific common market.  We must then invite third-world and developing nations of both Asia, Africa and Eastern Europe to participate in a global free trade initiative to offset the growing protectionism of both the political right and the political left.
<P>
And fourth, restore the IMF to its original purpose, which was to manage the exchange rate system and provide short term balance payments assistance for developing nations.
<P>
Finally, we must remember that there are no limits to growth in our world--just frontiers waiting to be opened and opportunities waiting to be explored.  If the United States encourages those economic pioneers who cross those frontiers--with policies that favor enterprise over planning, sound money over devaluations, growth over austerity--it will play a leading role in the advance of freedom, peace, and prosperity.  It is a role that will not only serve the interests of the United States, but will help unleash the creative ingenuity and vast resources of the rest of the world as well and lead us to the peace and prosperity so long dreamed about by our founders.  We must remember the words of President Ronald Reagan in his 1982 address to the British Parliament:  "We must be staunch in our conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky few, but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings."  What a great challenge for us all to undertake.<P>

<p>
"This is Mike Rosen, KOA, Denver broadcasting live from the studios of The 
Heritage Foundation in Washington."
<P>
Those and similar words were heard frequently by talk-radio listeners around 
the country in 1994, following the opening of Heritage's new broadcast facilities. 
Equipped with state-of-the-art equipment, the studio enables talk-show hosts 
to do live broadcasts from Heritage's Capitol Hill headquarters.
<P>
Heritage already was becoming a "home away from home" for talk show hosts visiting 
the nation's capital, with live broadcasts during the year by Boston's Earl 
Jackson, Seattle's Dave Ross, and Richmond's Blanquita Walsh Cullum, among 
others. The remote broadcast facilities were opened to meet the growing demand. 
<P>

<P>
Heritage's work with talk radio, part of a broader broadcast media program, 
began several years ago - long before most other organizations realized the 
potential impact of this alternative communications medium.  
<P>
During 1994, Heritage experts made hundreds of guest appearances on radio talk 
shows, on  major television news and public affairs shows, and on the America's 
Talking, CNN, CNBC, C-SPAN, and National Empowerment Television (NET) call-in 
shows. Dozens of Heritage lectures and events also were seen on C-SPAN.  
<P>
The work with the broadcast media is just one facet of Heritage's wide-ranging 
communications program. Intended to familiarize political activists, opinion 
leaders, and the broader general public with the positive message of contemporary 
conservatism, the program also includes the Heritage Speakers Bureau, Heritage's 
pioneering "op-ed page" program, and a variety of other activities aimed at 
specialized audiences.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">O</FONT>pinion and <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>ommentary</H3></CENTER>

<P>
The op-ed page program provides Heritage analysts and executives with an opportunity 
to give their views on the important issues of the day without having to go 
through the usual news "filtering" process. During 1994, Heritage bylines appeared 
in hundreds of  U.S. and overseas newspapers, including the Wall Street Journal, 
Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington 
Times,  International Herald Tribune, USA Today, Buffalo News, Charlotte Observer, 
Oklahoma City Oklahoman, Orange County Register, and Pittsburgh Tribune Review. 
  <P>


Heritage also continued its relationship with Knight-Ridder/Tribune News Service, 
one of the largest supplemental newswires in the country, which distributes 
Heritage op-ed page essays every week as part of a <a href="/heritage/commentary/welcome.html">commentary</a> package.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">T</FONT>argeted <FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>ommunications</H3></CENTER>
<P>
While most Heritage public relations activities involve the mass media, targeted 
communications also are important. 
<P>
The Speakers Bureau, for example, helped bring Heritage's conservative message 
to dozens of college campuses and business, professional, and civic organizations 
in 1994. While their primary focus remained  research, writing, and policy, 
Heritage analysts and executives met collectively with thousands of individuals 
around the country who had come to hear them speak. Among the many institutions 
providing Heritage speakers with a platform were the American Association of 
Colleges and Universities, American Society of Association Executives, Chautauqua 
Institution, Close Up Foundation, Colorado State University, and Grove City 
College, where Ed Feulner delivered the 1994 commencement address. Others included 
the Inter-American Defense College, National Petroleum Refiners Association, 
National Youth Leadership Forum, People to People, Rubber Manufacturers Association, 
St. Lawrence University, Texas A&M University, and World Affairs Council of 
Orange County. 
<P>

<P>

In addition to <a href="http://www.townhall.com/">Town Hall</a>, the "interactive" computer network co-owned by 
Heritage and National Review magazine, Heritage in 1994 was included in "Profnet," 
a national computer information network linking U.S. newsrooms with colleges 
and universities and a handful of think tanks around the country.
<P>
Heritage also continued to work closely in 1994 with Westcott Communications, 
a major publicly traded company that provides information and produces workplace 
training videos for corporate managers and executives in a number of specialized 
fields, including health care and financial management.
<P>


And Heritage successfully relaunched the Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific 
Press (WRAPP). The organization, which had existed for several years in the 
1980s, is intended to help provide Washington-based Asian correspondents with 
better access to the Washington policymaking .

<h2><B><i>&quot;Our Nation's Debt Is Sky High Already&quot;</center>
<br>
<center>&quot;More Debt From Universal, Unlimited IRA Tax Deferrals 
Scares Me To Death!&quot;</B></h2>
</center></i>
<hr>
Sound familiar?
<P>
According to the Committee on Ways and Means' Green Book (that
describes their income tax revenue estimates), tax-deductible
contributions to IRAs are considered as &quot;tax expenditures,&quot;
and &quot;...tax expenditures can be viewed as...spending programs.&quot;
<P>
In other words, the taxes deferred by tax-deductible IRAs are
treated by the government as if they were part of a spending program
that increases government debt.
<P>
The government, and many others, claim that these tax-deferred
saving programs are undesirable, because:  (a) government debt
is sky-high already; and (b) sound governance dictates that the
government's deficit and debt must be reduced.
<P>
Any debt, private or government, can finance either fruitless
spending or fruitful enterprise.  For example, a person's first
home mortgage probably sends his or her debt sky-high, but the
debt is collateralized by the home and reflects the borrower's
favorable prospect for repayment of the loan.  Such debt is not
considered fruitless.  Certainly, too, the lender treats the mortgage
as an asset upon which it expects to earn income.
<P>
In much the same way, IRA-related government debt is good, not
bad.  In reality, every penny of government debt arising from
IRAs is offset by the directly-related free-market investments
held within each taxpayer's IRA.  The tax money that wasn't collected
by the government didn't disappear-and it wasn't spent on consumption;
it was invested in income-producing assets, adding to the total
income of the economy, hence to total government tax revenues.
 
<P>
In accordance with law, all of this tax money is actually held
in trust within the IRA for the future payment of taxes and invested
in income-producing assets.  Each taxpayer has a legal liability
to pay his or her taxes upon any IRA withdrawal.  Thus, with every
dollar saved in an IRA, the government always obtains a tax receivable,
a governmental asset, that always matches the taxpayer's liability.
<P>
Certainly, too, if a bank loaned you money for a business and
you put up collateral equal to two to six times the size of the
loan, a bank wouldn't impose a second layer of cost upon you that
required you to pay a percent of the relevant increase in the
equity in your business each year until you paid off your loan
in full.  Such a second layer of cost is analogous to the government's
second layer of tax on saving under the ordinary income tax for
people in the various income tax brackets.  How long do you think
that bank would stay in business unless it had the sovereign power
of government to impose its will?
<P>
As shown in this analysis, with tax-deductible IRAs, the government
can make huge amounts of money by:  (a) not being so quick to
tax a taxpayer's income before he or she can even save and invest
it; and (b) not taxing the returns on that saving each year thereafter.
 Collecting taxes when saving ceases is proper and productive
taxation for the government.
<P>
Clearly, IRA-related government debt does not arise from any government
spending, it arises solely from taxpayers' saving.  Every home
owner with a mortgage knows that his or her liabilities (debt)
have increased-but so have his or her assets.  Thus, debt is not
inherently bad.  Our nation would be far poorer without it.  The
same accounting and economic perspectives are properly analogous
to tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Further, tax-deductible IRAs, in the aggregate and over time,
will create far more tax revenues for the government than can
flow from the suffocating financial and economic effects that
arise from the ordinary income tax on saving.
<P>
Tax-deductible IRAs increase new saving and private capital formation,
thereby creating more jobs and productivity growth.  From this,
our nation's economic fortunes will spiral upward, not spiral
downward, as currently induced by the ordinary income tax treatment
of saving.
<P>
<b>Existing Government Debt &amp; Existing IRA Assets</b>
<P>
Our nation's existing qualified plan assets (the assets of pensions,
profit sharing, 401(k) plans, IRAs, etc.) currently total more
than three trillion dollars.  In reality, these assets, primarily
investments in private enterprises, represent the present-value
of future taxable benefits payable to plan participants over some
future period of time.
<P>
If we assume that, on average, these taxpayers will be in the
30&#177;% tax bracket when benefits are paid, then 30&#177;% of
the $3&#177; trillion of qualified plan assets represent the present-value
of future taxes, or $900&#177; billion.  These mega-billions of
dollars currently held in trust for the payment of future taxes
offset an equal amount of directly-related government debt.  The
additional production that flows from these investments, and the
tax revenues on the additional income that production generates,
means that the government's finances are strengthened by these
savings.
<P>
These billions of tax receivables show up nowhere as assets on
our government's tax books.  That's as if the bank that loaned
mortgage money considered all such loans as spending (or losses)
until each repayment is received in some future year.  
<P>
Government debt arising from tax-deductible IRAs reflects a reservoir
of immense financial strength for our nation.  The dynamic tax
revenue gains for the government from universal IRAs will, in
reality, reduce and eventually eliminate that debt over a period
of time.
<P>
It is also very appropriate to point out that even though current
government tax policy decries tax deductions for IRAs, pensions,
and other tax deferred savings programs, the government simultaneously
casts covetous eyes at the wonderful, tax deferred, free-market
accumulations of assets now held within these plans.  The government
seems capable of ignoring the fact that this major reservoir of
free-market capital wouldn't be there without the tax deductions
and tax deferrals the government abhors.  
<P>
Every taxpayer must be constantly vigilant to protect this reservoir
of jobs creating capital from the social engineers within government
who would prefer, if permitted, to dictate how some, or all, of
these assets are to be invested, and/or who would prefer to tap
this reservoir of wealth by imposing more taxes thereon either
directly or indirectly.
<P>
<I>Tax-deductible, tax deferred, free-market assets are the lifeblood
of our nation.  They must be protected and nourished constantly
and vigorously.</I>

<B><h2><I><center>What's The Cost?</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P>

That question is immediately asked by every member of the Congress
who considers tax legislation.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA legislation is certainly no exception, because the words &quot;universal,&quot;
&quot;unlimited,&quot; and &quot;tax-deductible&quot; invoke the
prospect of a large &quot;cost.&quot;
<P>
Congressional policy makers' thinking in these terms is encouraged
by the treatment of tax provisions like IRAs in the government's
so-called Tax Expenditure Budget.  Estimates prepared by the staff
of the Joint Committee on Taxation of the tax expenditures (i.e.,
&quot;costs,&quot; in the vernacular of Congress) for various
&quot;Income Security&quot; budget functions are shown in the
following table.  By precedent or rule, all members of Congress
use these figures as the basis for their legislative considerations.
<pre>
 				Year &amp; Billions of Dollars 
			----------------------------------------------------	
Net Exclusion of 						Total
Pension Contributions 	1994	1995	1996	1997	1998	'94-'98
&amp; Earnings
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Employer Plans 		55.3 	58.5 	62.0 	65.7 	69.6 	311.1

IRAs			6.2 	6.5 	7.0 	7.5 	8.0 	35.2

Keogh Plans 		3.0 	3.1	3.3 	3.5 	3.7 	16.6

* From Joint Committee Taxation Report
</pre>

The April 22, 1993, Joint Committee on Taxation report states that these
&quot;Tax expenditures are most similar to those direct <I>spending
programs</I> which have no spending limits, and which are available as
entitlements to those who meet the statutory criteria established for the
programs&quot; (emphasis added). Direct spending entitlement programs
include:  Social Security, railroad retirement, federal employees
retirement and insurance, unemployment assistance, Medicare, Medicaid,
veterans hospital care, housing, nutrition, public assistance programs,
etc. <P>

As previously discussed in this analysis, the tax expenditure figures
cited above are not &quot;spendings,&quot; regardless of the label used by
the staff.  And, in no way are net exclusions of pension contributions and
earnings &quot;most similar to direct spending programs&quot; such as
those listed in the paragraph above.  In reality, pension exclusions
result in &quot;tax deferrals&quot; (a government asset) upon which the
government receives a free-market rate of total return. <P>

Over three trillion dollars of &quot;qualified plan&quot; assets are now
held by various qualified plan trusts.  Those assets include the past
&quot;net exclusions,&quot; such as those cited in the table above. 
Because most of these assets were acquired by <I>new</I> saving undertaken
in response to the tax deferral, the various plans' aggregate tax
liability to the government with respect to those assets far exceeds the
directly-related government debt arising from the past net exclusions. 
This is particularly true of employer pension plans that generated huge
amounts of new saving over the years.  Over more recent years, however,
senseless and self-defeating funding constrictions imposed by Congress on
the plans have resulted in cut-backs and the abandonment of plans to the
great detriment of our economy. <P>

Regardless of the dollar magnitude of the &quot;tax expenditure&quot; that
the staff may estimate for universal IRAs, it must be recognized that not
a nickel of that amount is spent on consumption; every bit of it is
invested by the IRA owner in income-producing assets. If the average
taxpayers' tax bracket is 25%, for example, the total sum that's invested
in these IRAs will be four times the alleged tax expenditure.  Most of
that investment will be saving that wouldn't have been undertaken if the
universal IRA tax treatment hadn't been provided.  That's the greatest
thing that could happen to our nation's low rate of private saving.  As a
result thereof, our economy will expand dramatically, thereby providing
more production, more jobs, an increasing standard of living, and more
taxes. <P> In reality, contrary to the government's position that the
above &quot;exclusions&quot; are a cost, they should be viewed as a
working asset invested in free-market enterprise.  Thus, the larger the
aggregate tax deductions, the more positive are the prospective real
economic results.  <I>The government's disastrous perception of the
economic effects of tax-deferred saving faces 180 degrees in the wrong
direction!</I> <P> 

A few years ago a highly respected Washington, D.C., actuary (Paul H.
Jackson, FSA, The Wyatt Company), who specialized in pensions, wrote a
brief analysis of the government's methodology in determining pension tax
expenditures.  This analysis was published in the Newsletter of the
Society of Actuaries.  Mr. Jackson noted that within Congress, tax
expenditure figures are generally accepted as &quot;fact.&quot;  He also
noted that the largest single tax expenditure is the exclusion of pension
contributions, and investment income thereon, from the taxable income of
covered individuals.  Mr. Jackson concluded that &quot;...these tax
expenditure facts are conceptually flawed, arbitrary, and almost useless
for budget purposes.&quot;  He also concluded that &quot;...any tax law
based on such arbitrary and capricious figures can only be good by
accident.&quot; Mr. Jackson hit the nail on the head in precise, actuarial
fashion. 

<P>
<I>It is shocking that our government's fundamental tax policy,
as it relates to the vitally important fiscal element of tax-deferred
saving, rests upon analyses that are aptly described as being
&quot;arbitrary and capricious,&quot; and that produce legislation
that &quot;can only be good by accident.&quot;</I>

<B><h2><I>Congressional Misperceptions About Measuring The Costs Of
Universal, Unlimited, Tax-Deductible IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
<P><blockquote>
 &QUOT;BUT, WE DON'T DO REVENUE ESTIMATES THAT WAY.&QUOT;
<P>
 &QUOT;STAFF SCOREKEEPERS WILL SHOW THAT IRAS PRODUCE HUGE REVENUE
LOSSES.  THUS, THE MEDIA, AND MY CONSTITUENTS, WILL PERCEIVE ME
AS A BIG SPENDER.&QUOT;</blockquote>

<P>

The above remarks are typical Congressional responses (with some
notable exceptions) to the League's position and documentation
that universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are the proper
method for taxing saving.
<P>
Breaking through this mind-set and the policy inertia it inspires
is not easy, but it must be done.  How?
<P>
A determined, persistent, broad-based public attack on these negative
Congressional misperceptions is imperative.  Every taxpayer, every
segment of the media, every business, union, and association,
and every professional person, including economists, actuaries,
accountants, and lawyers, should assume  responsibility for pushing
Congress and the Administration to face up to the extremely serious
fiscal problem of how our nation taxes personal saving.  All of
us must work to persuade Congressional policy makers to legislate
the right kind of tax environment for personal saving.
<P>

Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans are the proper answer
to our nation's low saving dilemma and slow economic growth. These plans
are vital to our personal, family, business, and national prosperity. <P>
<blockquote>
&QUOT;BUT, THE GOVERNMENT WANTS AND NEEDS ITS MONEY NOW.&QUOT;</blockquote>
<P>
Far too often the above comment is used by members of Congress
and others to justify the government's contention that expanding
the tax deferral of saving is not possible, because the government
wants and needs &quot;its&quot; money now.
<P>
The government's money, of course, is extracted from taxpayers'
incomes and savings-the income that workers, savers-investors,
and business entrepreneurs earn as rewards for helping to produce
things people want to buy.  The more heavily government taxes
the income people save, the less saving people undertake, and
the less investment they make in adding to the nation's productivity
and output growth.
<P>
Government, therefore, should weigh these costs of taxing the
income people save-and taxing the income that savings earn-against
its need for tax revenue now.  Government impatience in raking
in tax dollars is extremely costly to the country and, in the
long run, to the government, too.  It must never be forgotten
that the economic strength of government is bound inextricably
with the economic strength of its taxpayers.
<P>
Government patience in collecting tax revenues is particularly
important when it comes to tax-deductible saving.  Until such
saving, unfettered by taxes, is consumed, it performs highly constructive
triple duty by (1) providing investment growth and/or income for
the saver, and (2) providing more capital to create production,
jobs, and profits, all of which (3) generate more taxes for the
government.
<P>
Only when the taxpayer wants to use for consumption some of the
income he or she has saved and invested should that income be
taxed.
<P>
Saving must come first for the government and taxpayer alike.
 Taxes must come last when saving stops.

<TITLE>1994 Annual Report - Marketing -- Heritage</TITLE>

<CENTER><B>Popularizing Conservative Ideas</B></CENTER><P>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 30%>


<P>
On Nov. 8, 1994, a conservative tide swept across America - opening a new chapter 
in the political revolution launched by President Reagan 14 years earlier.
<P>
The White House, national news media, and Washington's liberal establishment 
were surprised by both the depth and the breadth of the conservative victory. 
They were even more surprised, however, by something else: that the voters 
both understood and supported the ideas proposed during the campaign by conservative 
candidates. 
<P>
They shouldn't have been surprised. Many of the specific proposals had been 
developed at The Heritage Foundation, and almost all of them had been time-tested 
in the court of public opinion: in speeches to business and civic groups, in 
congressional Town Hall meetings, in op-ed page articles, and on talk radio. 
Maybe the Washington establishment didn't appreciate the common-sense appeal 
of the conservative policy agenda, but the voters did.
<P>
Since 1973, The Heritage Foundation has served a dual role: both as an idea 
factory and as a product-testing laboratory. The first role - policy research, 
development, and innovation - is the purpose of Heritage's ongoing research 
program. The equally important second role of popularizing and legitimizing 
Heritage Foundation policy prescriptions and the broader conservative vision 
of government is the mandate of Heritage's marketing program. 
<P>
This emphasis on marketing to Congress and the Executive Branch, the national 
and international news media, state government officials, and the business, 
academic, and policy communities is one of the things that makes Heritage different 
from other policy institutes. As a USA Today headline put it in a post-election 
feature about Heritage, "The Think Tank: Foundation bringing vision back to 
the future."
<p>

<P>
On November 21, two weeks after the election, Harvard University's John F. 
Kennedy School of Government announced it had cancelled its "Introduction to 
Congress" class in December. The Ivy League university had held the course 
for newly elected members of Congress for 22 years.  In 1994, there wasn't 
much interest in what the Harvard faculty might have to say. Instead, most 
congressional freshmen attended The Heritage Foundation's orientation program 
in Baltimore.
<P>
The Economist modestly called the change "a sign of the times." Earlier in 
the year, in its Jan. 7, 1994, issue, The Economist had forecast such a shift. 
"In the 1960s it looked as if universities would establish a monopoly over 
the life of the mind, providing policies for politicians, sinecures for writers, 
ideas for journalists and breakthroughs for industrialists." The 1980s, The 
Economist observed, "changed all that." Now, the editors wrote, governments 
in search of advice increasingly look "to think tanks such as the Institute 
of Economic Affairs in Britain and the Heritage Foundation in Washington, rather 
than to Oxford or Harvard." 
<P>

From the beginning, Congress - which has the constitutional authority to pass 
laws, ratify treaties, declare war, and approve spending - has been Heritage's 
primary audience. The government relations staff serves as an institutional 
link between the Heritage research team and the policymaking community, providing 
Congress and the Executive Branch with timely information and policy recommendations 
on matters of current interest.
<P>
<CENTER><H3><FONT SIZE = "+2">C</FONT>andidate <FONT SIZE = "+2">E</FONT>ducation</H3></CENTER>
<P>
With an important national election ahead, Heritage welcomed the 1994 political 
season with its 296-page candidates' briefing book, "Issues '94." The book 
was distributed free of charge to incumbents and challengers alike.  
<P>
Dozens of House and Senate candidates and several gubernatorial candidates, 
including George Pataki, who unseated New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, used the briefing 
book. As one successful congressional challenger, Ron Lewis (R-KY), wrote, 
"Heritage provided the best, most accurate facts and figures that I used in 
my campaign. They were right on target every time."
<P>

<P>

Heritage's efforts to provide policy guidance to future members of the 104th 
Congress didn't cease with the election. Most successful candidates had promised 
to challenge the status quo and cut Washington down to size. The three-day 
orientation conference offered by Heritage and Empower America provided a game 
plan for doing just that, with sessions on family tax relief, federal mandates 
and federalism, farm policy reform, fighting crime, congressional reform, health 
care, foreign policy, welfare reform, rebuilding America's defenses, the environmental 
activists' "green agenda," and cutting government. addition to the many Heritage 
analysts on the program, the list of speakers included Heritage Distinguished 
Fellows <a href="/heritage/staff/bennett.htm">William Bennett</a> and <a href="/heritage/staff/kemp.htm">Jack Kemp</a>, Sen. Malcolm Wallop (R-WY),  Rep. W.J. 
"Billy" Tauzin (D-LA), Virginia Secretary of Natural Resources Becky Norton 
Dunlop, Kemper Financial Services Senior Economist John Silvia, John DiIulio 
of The Brookings Institution, Rep. Cal Dooley (D-CA), former U.S. Ambassador 
to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick, and talk show superstar Rush Limbaugh, 
who was named an "Honorary Member" of the 104th Congress's freshman class. 
<P>

<P>
Seven years of intense, focused effort which included two landmark books and 
dozens of articles, papers, and seminars was rewarded in 1994 as House Republicans 
embraced most of the institutional reforms proposed by Heritage's U.S. Congress 
Assessment Project staff.
<P>
The 1988 Heritage book, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The Imperial Congress</a>," launched the debate. Something 
is terribly wrong with Congress, the book argued, and it needs to be fixed. 
As just one example, the book listed more than a dozen federal laws, including 
the National Labor Relations Act, Fair Labor Standards Act, Minimum Wage Act, 
Civil Rights Act of 1964, Freedom of Information Act, Occupational Safety and 
Health Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, and Ethics in Government Act, 
from which Congress had exempted itself.
<P>
All of the specific reforms approved by Congress on Jan. 4-5, 1995, can be 
found in the pages of "The Imperial Congress," the 1993 Heritage sequel, "<a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/imp.html">The 
Ruling Class</a>," or in the many papers produced in 1994 and prior years by David 
Mason and the "Congress Project" staff. For example, at the top of House Speaker 
Newt Gingrich's list of reforms was a promise, spelled out in the "Contract 
with America," to make "all laws that apply to the rest of the country also 
apply equally to the Congress." The new majority also moved to reduce the number 
of congressional committees and subcommittees, cut committee staff, limit the 
terms of committee chairs, open committee meetings to the public, and eliminate 
the phony "baseline budgeting" scam, which for years had allowed Washington 
to act as if it were cutting spending when it really was increasing it.
<P>

<P>
Heritage's Governors' Forum continued its efforts in 1994 to involve governors 
and state administrators more directly in federal policy decisions affecting 
their states. With the new Congress promising to return many government functions 
to the states, the program in 1995 will increase its emphasis on the concept 
of federalism.
<P>

<P>
Just two years old, the program already is seen as a major national forum. 
California Gov. Pete Wilson, for example, appeared at Heritage just days after 
his come-from-behind reelection. Seen by some as the start of a potential 1996 
presidential bid, his hard-hitting speech addressed the imbalance between state 
and federal government and how state executives can help take back some of 
the powers wrongly assumed by Washington. Other Governors' Forum speakers in 
1994 included former Tennessee Gov. Lamar Alexander, Virginia Gov. George Allen 
Jr., and Mississippi Gov. Kirk Fordice.

<B><h2><I><center>
Does It Really Matter How The Government Estimates The Revenue Gains And Losses From Changes In The Tax 
Laws?</h2></B></I></center>
<hr>
 <P>
Absolutely.  For example, in 1986 the government wanted more tax
revenue, so it effectively increased taxes on commercial real
estate.  Thus, investors' after-tax net rates of return on commercial
real estate were significantly reduced.  Naturally, and as a result,
real estate values and prices came tumbling down, leading to defaults
on mortgages, failed S &amp; Ls, failed banks, and jobs lost.
 Government bailouts (i.e., more taxpayer taxes) followed.
<P>
Every taxpayer has been severely damaged, directly or indirectly,
because of these ill-considered tax increases.  Far more tax revenue
and economic growth was lost (and will be lost) because of these
real estate tax increases than any related revenue gain estimated
by the government in 1986.
<P>
And, of course, there was the luxury tax on boats, enacted in
1990, that was supposed to increase tax revenue.  All it did was
wipe out jobs and lose tax revenue.  Government tax revenue estimators
do not take into account the rational, to-be-expected response
of taxpayers to tax law changes.
<P>
Further, as so clearly demonstrated in this analysis, the government's
revenue estimation methods as applied to tax-deductible saving
create a tax policy that faces 180 degrees in the wrong direction.
 The economic costs to our nation of this gigantic error can be
measured in trillions of dollars.
<P>
Government revenue estimation methodologies are scandalously wrong.
This must be corrected.

<h2><center><I><B>Entitlements</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
So-called &quot;entitlements&quot; are government spending programs
that grow automatically without adequate cost control or constraint.
 Typically, these programs are initiated for modest and humanitarian
reasons.  However, their potential future costs are usually unmeasured,
measured improperly, or ignored.  Further, once established, people
become accustomed to their availability, and the benefits provided
become political magnets for enhancement due to inflation, demographic
changes in the population, and the political power of recipients.
 In short, with the passage of time, they become &quot;entitlements.&quot;
<P>
Three existing entitlement programs-Social Security, Medicare/Medicaid,
and federal welfare benefits-involve huge, ever-increasing costs
that, in aggregate when combined with interest on the national
debt, exceed the government's &quot;discretionary&quot; spending
over which it can, if it wishes, exercise control.  The growth
of these entitlement costs is alarming.
<P>
The funding of entitlement programs can only come from one contributing
source-taxpayers.  When these programs were initiated, the then-existing
contributor/recipient ratio was high (many more taxpayers were
contributors then recipients), and the level of benefits was low.
 With the passage of time, the contributor/recipient ratio has
grown much smaller, and the level of benefits has grown much larger.
 This has created an explosion of ever-increasing costs that are
borne by an ever-diminishing segment of the voter/taxpayer population.
 
<P>
Such costs can only be funded by raising taxes or by increased
governmental borrowing.  Income taxes and payroll taxes typically
transfer the economic values generated by one group of taxpayers
to another group as, for example, when younger people's payroll
taxes are used to fund older people's health care costs and pensions.
 Borrowing to cover these costs unethically passes these costs
to another generation.  
<P>
Regardless of the source of funds (tax or borrowing), these uncontrolled
entitlement spendings extract free-market capital from the marketplace.
 This, in turn, makes the economy progressively weaker, thereby
leading to a political/economic climate that fosters further enhancements
of entitlement programs.  This becomes a gradual, but never-ending,
spiral downward toward economic stagnation, unfair inter-generational
transfer payments via the tax code, and ultimate disaster.
<P>
Changing the way our nation taxes saving so that saving is promoted
and not punished can dramatically change the human/economic dynamics
that lead to these entitlements.  Taxpayers will be far better
able to accumulate assets for their retirement and life's potential
needs for health care and welfare.  Not only will free markets
grow more rapidly, thereby enhancing living standards and employment
growth, the need and pressures for entitlement programs will diminish.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can do wonders by helping
to remove the ever-increasing and divisive cost burden of entitlements
from our nation's shoulders.

<h2><center><I><B>Inertia</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<blockquote>in*er*tia <I>n</I> The tendency of matter to remain at rest, if
at rest, or, if moving, to keep moving in the same direction,
unless affected by some outside force.</blockquote>
<P>
Common sense, as well as sound economic thinking, tells us that
punishing saving by double taxation just doesn't make sense. 
In fact, it's stupid (i.e., foolish; irrational-as, what a stupid
idea).
<P>
If so, why do we, as a nation, do it?  First and foremost, the
answer is that you, yes you, (and I), tend to be content with
bitching, moaning, wringing your hands, and never taking any action
on your own to change the direction of such taxation;  i.e., you
suffer from inertia-as do we all.
<P>
<I>Let it be stated clearly:  no Congressman, no Administration,
and no &quot;staffer&quot; can properly defend the way our government
taxes saving.  So, we, individually and collectively, must assume
the responsibility to take action to force change.</I>
<P>
Every voter/taxpayer must have the gumption to challenge and demand
of their Representative and Senators a clear statement of their
position on S. 929 and H.R. 3179 (a description of the Individual
Investment Account Act is included herein).  This Act is simple
to understand and is positive legislation from every perspective.
 There are, of course, an increasing number of legislative proposals
that include among their objectives the removal of the double
tax on saving.  It is not the specific bill that's so important,
<I>the most important objective is ridding our economy of the
double tax on saving.</I>  The singular advantage of the Individual
Investment Act is that it is simple to understand and simple to
implement after the legislation is enacted.
<P>
There is no valid reason why your Representative and Senators
should not cosponsor S. 929 or H.R. 3179, and other bills that
move in this positive direction.  Strange as it may seem to you
(if you're not a salesman), legislators have to be asked.  No
legislator has the desire to deny his or her constituents (and
himself, or herself) the fruits of personal saving.
<P>
Up to now, most all legislators have been content to follow the
lead of others (principally staff) who proclaim that &quot;there's
a large revenue loss from tax deferred saving,&quot; or &quot;this
legislation is not the way we do it.&quot;   Legislators, by tradition
or inertia tend to merely accept these proclamations as immutable
fact without digging deeper.  
<P>
Every legislator needs your personal push (i.e., outside force,
see above) to start him or her moving in the proper direction
away from his or her own inertia toward swift removal of the double
tax on saving.  S. 929 and H.R. 3179 certainly pave the way to
do the job completely.
<P>
Your personal note (handwritten  is best) is what it takes.  Have
your spouse, friends, family, and associates write letters, too,
in their own style.  Keep a copy, and if you wish, send the League
a copy, too-we'll follow up.  Don't settle for a bland response.
 Insist on &quot;cosponsorship&quot; or a sound reason why not.
 Be persistent.  And, if you need to be, even a pest.  After all,
it's your money and your financial health that's at stake.  And,
you know-you'll win!  And, so will our nation, including your
children and their descendants.
<P>
<I>An unstoppable force will grow from your personal and business
letters, and contacts, as they add their weight to those from
others.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>The Unlocking Of Fringe Benefit Handcuffs</B></I></center>
</h2>

<hr>
<P>
Our nation's economy is rapidly changing character as new businesses
emerge, older businesses down-size, global competition and opportunities
increase, and people become more independent and mobile due to
rapid technology changes.  This has direct and indirect repercussions
on employment practices, including employer-provided fringe benefits.
<P>
The legendary business analyst and writer, Peter Drucker, in a
recent article about existing employer fringe benefit plans, likened
them to the old fashioned &quot;company store&quot; where employees
were bound to employers, via the products, services, and credits
these stores provided.
<P>
Under today's economic conditions in a very competitive national
and global economy, employer fringe benefit plans have often become
the &quot;company store&quot; handcuffs that keep employees from
exploring new areas of employment.  This &quot;locking in&quot;
operates to the detriment of the employees' economic position
in life, as well as to the detriment of the employer and our nation's
economy.  Handcuffs can tie two people together even if both need
release.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can greatly change this
existing pattern of employer-provided fringe benefit plans for
the better.  And, there would be no need for government mandates
or controls.
<P>
For example, an employer could decide (and/or bargain) to replace
some part, or all, of its existing fringe benefit program by diverting
the costs of one or more of these plans into the employees' wages
or salaries.  The employees, as owners of unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs, would receive this welcome wage increase and, in turn, deposit
it within their unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs.
<P>
Using his or her IRA, the individual could purchase fringe benefit-type
coverage(s) to fit his or her particular needs or desires.  By
allowing tax deductions for premiums and/or benefit payments paid
from the IRA, these tax effects could parallel those now found
under employer-sponsored plans.
<P>
Interestingly, the Administration's 1994 &quot;Health Reform Proposal&quot;
included a provision that premium payments made by &quot;self-employed&quot;
persons would be fully tax-deductible.  This is the same approach
that could be used when universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs
are used to replace an employer-provided fringe benefit.
<P>
Consider these advantages of an IRA-based, individualized, fringe
benefit alternative:
<P>
  It enhances an individual employee's personal responsibility
for himself and his family in many ways.  For example, some persons
may choose &quot;high deductibles&quot; and &quot;major medical&quot;
insurance, while self-insuring the less onerous, but administratively
expensive, costs of medical care.
<P>
 Other persons may want or need more or less life insurance than
his or her employer provides.  Some people may choose a long-term
sickness insurance program that's not otherwise available through
the employer.  Alternatively, too, the diverted wages can be saved
in the tax-deductible IRA without replacing the employer-provided
coverage, as might be the case of a young, single employee in
good health.
<P>
 When one considers that a 10%, 20%, 30%, and up, wage increase
can flow from such a basic change in employee benefit plan structures,
it becomes obvious that far more efficient wage/benefits structures
are obtainable without increasing the costs of doing business.
<P>
  In short, the use of unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs as a means
to provide individualized fringe benefits is fiscally sound, very
flexible, and will be very attractive to many employees and employers
alike.
<P>
  Without question, too, the &quot;personal costs/benefits received&quot;
relationship between the IRA owner-buyer and the fringe benefit
provider will greatly enhance claims control and reduce the costs
of coverage.  Spending one's own IRA account money for &quot;coverage&quot;
and &quot;care,&quot; as contrasted with spending from an unlimited
employer or insurer fund, makes a very big &quot;cost control&quot;
difference.
<P>
  Employers may find it desirable to be relieved of the very heavy
burden of choosing, designing, administering, monitoring, and
paying for the plans they now offer.  The employer's overall costs
can be the same, but the diversion of benefit plan costs to wages
can be far more useful to the employee-and the employer.  Certainly,
the employer's &quot;benefit cost&quot; diversion to &quot;wages&quot;
creates a more controllable cost from both the employer and the
user perspective.
<P>
  Clearly, the existing employer-based structure to provide fringe
benefit plans has been stretched to the breaking point in many,
if not most, situations.  Most employers are, after all, in the
business of making products and services, not designing and administering
fringe benefits to fit each employee's particular needs.  This
is true of most all employers regardless of their size.
<P>
  IRA-based fringe benefits do not prohibit employers, unions,
associations, independent providers, such as insurers and Blue
Cross, etc. (or groups thereof), from offering plans to employees,
members, or individuals that will enable the employee (IRA owner)
to select the plan(s) that best fits his or her needs and desires.
 Such sponsored plans will be able to provide the discounts normally
associated with high volume business.
<P>
  Unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-based fringe benefits also help
solve the very serious problem of &quot;benefits portability&quot;
when an employee changes employers, moves geographically, and/or
retires.  Obviously, too, the universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
attributes of an IRA-type plan would greatly facilitate the personal
pre-funding of post-retirement coverages that are so vitally important
to our current and future senior citizens.
<P>
  There will be those in the government and in the private sector
who will claim that employees will wastefully spend the fringe
benefit costs diverted to tax-deductible IRAs.  However, people
need, and should have, the responsibility for their own actions-and
the vast majority of our citizens will welcome this.  There will
always be those who need help, but our localities, private institutions,
and charities are in a far better position to provide that help.
 This will be particularly true when personal saving is released
from the senseless bondage of double taxation.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs create a whole new environment
for imaginative, sound ways in which our citizens can personally
assume more responsibility and opportunity for their own current
and future &quot;financial&quot; and &quot;protection&quot; needs.
 These needs and desires embrace both a &quot;saving&quot; and
&quot;protection&quot; element that can best be decided at a personal
and family level.  And, of course, these needs and desires of
an individual, or family, will undoubtedly change over the years
as circumstances change.  Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRA-type plans that can provide fringe benefits offer the maximum,
sound flexibility to meet these emerging changes from both the
employee's and employer's perspective.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs also provide each employer
with the opportunity to re-think the design of its fringe benefits
programs not only in regards to the company's objectives, but
those of its employees, too.  In contrast, replacing the &quot;company
store&quot; with the &quot;government's store&quot; for health
care coverage is a disastrous retreat from the sound, emerging,
very competitive trends of the future.
<P>
The attractive option of combining universal, unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs with individually selected &quot;saving&quot; and &quot;protection&quot;
alternatives makes absolute sense.

<B><h2><I><center>Pension Plans Can Become Sensible Again</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
IRAs are a form of pension.  Pension plans provide an important
and useful way for people to save.  Unfortunately, the effective
use of pension plans, including IRAs, has been more and more hampered
by one punitive change after another in the income tax laws and
regulations.  Most of these changes have resulted from the existing,
erroneous, self-defeating tax revenue estimation methodologies
of our government.
<P>
It is well-known to all pension plan sponsors, administrators,
advisers, and plan participants that pension plan tax laws, rules,
and regulations have reached the ultimate breaking-point in unfathomable
complexity and government micro-management.
<P>
These complexities are driven by the absurdity of trying to make
existing, outlandish, governmental notions of tax expenditure
revenue estimates of tax-deferred saving apply in the real world
of private enterprise.  It can't be done.
<P>
Billions of dollars are spent every year by the professions, industry,
labor, and government on examinations of the complex, interrelated
pension rules and regulations that are impossible to fathom, even
by those in government who create them or write them.
<P>
All of these complexities become unnecessary if unlimited, tax-deductible
IRAs are available.  Such complexities exist because of:  (1)
the erroneous government notion that tax-deductible IRAs and other
qualified plans cost the government mega-billions of dollars of
lost revenue; and (2) the erroneous government perception that
high-bracket taxpayers are favored economically.
<P>
With universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, employers, unions,
and associations can again arrange their pension plans to fit
their own unique needs and circumstances.  Rather than having
pension plans sponsored by employers, unions, or associations
decline in number, they will increase.  Further, with universal,
unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, portable pensions become a reality.
 
<P>
Pensions of all types (defined benefit, defined contribution,
401(k), profit-sharing, thrift, annuities, etc.) will grow and
be better funded because of the recognition of the enormous contribution
of universal, unlimited, tax-deductible saving to the financial
well-being of our nation, our government, and of our taxpayers,
individually and collectively.
<P>
The absurdity of the ever-tightening governmental constrictions
on defined benefit pension plan funding is clearly evident when
such constrictions make the funding projections of The Pension
Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) ever-more alarming.  These
unfathomable, self-defeating, government-imposed pension plan
complexities are leading employers to abandon their defined benefit
plans to the detriment of the PBGC.  In short, the government
is fostering the abandonment of defined benefit pension plans,
with the net result that needlessly underfunded pension plans
are being dropped into the laps of taxpayers via the PBGC!
<P>
All of this convoluted government-created mess can only be corrected
when it is recognized by Congress and the Administration that
the unlimited tax deferral of saving <I>is not contrary to anyone's
interests,</I> including the government's.  It is the responsibility
of plan providers and plan participants to rise up in anger over
such irrational, self-destructive government.

<h2><center><I><B>Home Ownership And Life Insurance</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
<I>Home Ownership</I>
<P>
Owning one's home has been a major objective for our citizens
and our nation for well over a century.  Not only has this proven
to be of economic value to all, it has helped maintain and nurture
family values that are so important to any strong nation.
<P>
And, as would be expected, home ownership has proven to be the
largest investment made by most individuals during their lifetimes.
<P>
All of this has been fostered by attractive tax laws that permit
a tax deduction for mortgage interest on this investment, as well
as permitting any gain in the value of a home, to be carried forward
without income tax for lengthy periods of time, including no income
tax on any gain upon death.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs can further facilitate
home ownership in a very attractive, sound way from both the taxpayers'
and government's perspective.  For example, such IRAs could be
expanded to include an &quot;IRA/Residence Rollover&quot; provision
such as:
<P>
  Up to $15,000 could be withdrawn from a universal IRA without
any income tax, provided the sum is used for a first-time home
purchase.  Note, however, that the individual's basis in the home
would be reduced in like amount.  Thus, Uncle Sam's tax on this
type of IRA withdrawal is deferred, not lost.
<P>
  Upon the sale of the home, the sale proceeds could be rolled
over into the IRA without any income tax.  Note, however, that
the individual's tax basis on the home (including the $125,000
tax-free amount after age 55) is also rolled over into the IRA.
 Thus, the tax otherwise imposed on the sale proceeds is deferred
and not lost to the government.  In effect, the home seller exchanges
an &quot;unproductive&quot; asset (the home) for &quot;productive&quot;
IRA assets (investments).
<P>
Even though the government's taxes would be deferred via this
primary residence rollover option, the government would make money
on this program.  All withdrawals in excess of tax basis would
eventually be taxed at ordinary income tax rates, and the individual(s)
would be giving up a stepped-up basis at death.
<P>
<I>Life Insurance</I>
<P>
A family that is saving and investing for life's later years is
always subject to the calamity of a premature death.  Investments
in life insurance (either term or cash value) should be allowed
in universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, provided the proceeds
are to be paid into the account, or added to a policy's cash value.
<P>
By fulfilling the family's funding objective, enhanced, tax-deferred
financial resources can be available over ensuing years following
the death of the insured.  These proceeds, like the other account
assets, would be subject to tax upon subsequent withdrawal.

<h2><center><I><B>Family</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>

Personal saving is not just an economic matter for our nation; personal
saving helps build the strong sinews of family life. Family life is, and
should be, the strongest, most cohesive economic force within any nation. 
<P>
Parents, particularly, are always striving to better their lives, in no
small part in order to better help their children and other family
members.  The act of saving creates a storehouse of economic values for
future enjoyment or needs that can smooth and enhance family life. 
<P>
After all, our nation's economic strength and values must always represent
the aggregate economic strengths and values of individuals and their
families, not vice versa. 
<P>
Too often we have seen tax policy mistakenly curtail the individual's and
the family's ability and responsibility to accumulate savings. As a
result, without savings, individuals and families gradually, but
inexorably, become dependent on others or on the state. 
<P>
The ordinary income tax is the classic example of a slow, but
sure, progressive tax abuse of saving.  Other examples include
the misguided imposition of caps and limits on IRAs and on benefit
plans.  Such benefit plans provide advance funding and protection
against economic calamity.
<P>
Plain common sense and the traditional American drive for self-reliance
dictate that it is far better to permit individuals and families
to accumulate the maximum possible tax-deferred savings and investment
they can achieve.  People can better build their own lives and
protections without government interference or dole.  Not only
does this provide more freedom from economic fear, it adds joy,
purpose, and far greater economic health to everyone's life.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs provide each individual,
and his or her family, a far superior way to fulfill those innate
responsibilities to save and invest for their future needs and
desires.  These family needs, desires, and responsibilities are
intertwined among generations stretching over many years and should
not be curtailed by unwise taxation.

<h2><center><I><B>The Social Security Trust Fund And Tax-Deductible 
IRAs</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
The Social Security Trust Fund can be compared to the proverbial
cookie jar into which mega-billions of excess Social Security
taxes are deposited, only to have these mega-billions borrowed
out by the government for the government's current spending, thereby
leaving the cookie jar filled with governmental IOUs.  
<P>
When baby-boomers retire and the so-called trust fund is diminished,
these IOUs must be redeemed in order to pay benefits.  Who must
then pay off these government bonds?-none other than baby boomers,
their children, and their grandchildren.
<P>
Haeworth Robertson, former Chief Actuary of the Social Security
Administration, states that:  
<P>
&quot;The government would have us believe that Social Security
is accumulating huge trust funds that will be used in the 21st
century to help finance the high cost of retirement benefits that
will become payable.  This simply is not true.  The present trust
funds, and probably the future trust funds, are mere window dressing
and have no economic reality.&quot;  (Newsletter of the Society
of Actuaries, September, 1992.)
<P>
Regardless of how Congress lowers Social Security benefits (e.g.,
increasing the normal retirement age to 70 or 75) and/or increases
Social Security taxes (Congress <I>must</I> take one or both of
these steps for Social Security to survive), the financial burden
of Social Security will always rest on the shoulders of the then-existing,
younger work force.  Such &quot;transfer payments&quot; from the
younger generation (and unborn generation) to the older generation
are a way-of-life that can not survive politically nor economically.
<P>
Unlike Social Security, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs are fully
funded by investments in real income-producing assets.  The income
produced by those assets provides the benefits distributed to
the IRA owners, and the taxes on those benefits will more than
equal the compounded amount of the taxes deferred by the deduction
of the owners' contribution to their IRAs.  In contrast with Social
Security, the distribution of IRA benefits does not require taxing
our children's and grandchildren's income.  Universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, as embodied in Individual Investment Accounts,
can and must become the strong financial bastion for current and
future generations.
<P>
 
<P>
The financial soundness of tax-deductible IRAs rests on the solid
rock of free enterprise.  Unlike IRAs, the financial soundness
of Social Security rests upon the power of government to tax,
and to tax again and again.  Such taxation progressively weakens,
not strengthens, our nation and its Social Security promises.
<P>
There is no effective prefunding with Social Security; the system
merely collects and redistributes taxes.  No basic economic growth
is created from Social Security, as is true of tax-deductible
IRAs.  Individual Investment Accounts, as proposed herein, help
create and generate economic self-reliance.  Social Security does
the opposite.

<h2><center><I><B>Wealth</B></I></center>
</h2>
<hr>
<P>
The word &quot;wealth&quot; has many connotations.  Too often,
financial wealth is interpreted negatively, thereby implying that
wealth is not desirable.  Or, that perhaps wealth above some level
is too much.
<P>
Obviously, too, financial &quot;wealth&quot; is easily interpreted,
as they say, in &quot;the eyes of the beholder.&quot;  Great wealth
to one person may be little wealth to another.
<P>
Regardless of personal feelings as to what is &quot;wealth,&quot;
from a financial perspective it is important for everyone to recognize
that savings, regardless of amount, are wealth.  And, having savings,
i.e., wealth, regardless of amount, is good for everyone-the person
who has it, those who use it directly or indirectly, and our nation.
<P>
We all prefer to live in a wealthy nation-and the wealth of a
nation is derived from the wealth of its people-not the other
way around.  The financial wealth of people can only arise from
saving (not consuming) and its fruitful use.  When people borrow,
they borrow someone else's saving.
<P>
Saving, and its growth, produces wealth.  Thus, it makes absolute
sense for governments-via their sovereign power-to encourage private
saving, and its growth, by every person.  Needless to say, for
our government to needlessly punish saving via the ordinary income
tax is crazy, self-defeating, and an abuse of power.
<P>
The growth of wealth invested via private enterprise should have
no bounds-for anyone-as amply demonstrated in this analysis. 
Government misconceptions concerning the taxation of wealth, and
its accumulation, must change-and change promptly-for everyone's
sake, including the government's.  
<P>
And, the accumulation of wealth (or its maintenance) must not
be constrained by notions that wealth existing at death above
some artificially set level must be captured by government (via
estate taxes, etc.), because the wealth is &quot;too high,&quot;
or because of some artificial notion promoted by some economists
of &quot;life-cycle&quot; taxation.  This usually means that if
the government didn't collect enough taxes while you lived, the
government should get the balance when you die.
<P>
From the government's fiscal perspective, with IRA-type saving,
death should be no more of a taxable event than an investment
transaction.  After all, inherited savings, i.e., wealth, will
continue to create production, jobs, rising standards of living,
more taxes, as well as prospective spending power for the owners
thereof.  Progressive estate tax rates applied to saving, like
the ordinary income tax, cut off the government's fiscal nose
to spite its face.
<P>
Universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs avoid estate taxes through
the ongoing deferral of the income taxes on invested wealth. 
In due course, all withdrawals will be taxed at progressive income
tax rates.  This clearly maintains sound tax policy and accumulated
saving.
<P>
Wealth, small or large, is of great value to everyone, directly
and indirectly, including the government.  Certainly, to have
the government snatch away as an additional tax up to 55% of a
person's, or a family's, hard-earned investment growth (wealth)
at the time of death can destroy a lifetime of energetic, productive
work, and/or force individuals and families into nonproductive
(except to avoid the tax) tax avoidance methods.  The rational
taxation of saving, whereby the government maximizes its tax potential,
is to tax saving only when it's consumed.
<P>
<I>Unfortunately, the largest, persistent predator of wealth is
the irrational sovereign power of government.  Eternal vigilance
and diligence is required by each and every voter/taxpayer to
protect their wealth, and to nourish it.</I>

<h2><center><I><B>The Need For Leadership, Initiative, And 
Speed</B></I></center></h2>
<hr>
 <P>
Accountants, actuaries, economists, lawyers, financial officers,
and the leaders of our businesses, unions, associations, and the
media must assume a strong leadership role in forcing our government
to come to grips with its existing budget and revenue estimating
methodologies as they apply to saving.
<P>
Leaders within the private and non-profit sectors of our nation
have failed to seriously address this key issue of &quot;personal
saving&quot; that means so very much to the success of their work
and our nation.
<P>
These individuals, and the institutions that they represent, have
an enormous stake in making certain that remedial legislation
is enacted.
<P>
These people and institutions can have an enormous, positive influence
through personal conversations, meetings, conferences, letters,
newsletters, the media, talk shows, etc.  
<P>
It has been demonstrated in this analysis that universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs will provide, in aggregate and over time,
far more tax revenue for our government than can ever be derived
from the ordinary income tax treatment of saving.  The exciting,
dynamic financial aspects of such IRAs will add solid growth and
economic strength to our nation.
<P>
The existing methods used by the government for measuring the
IRA's impact on tax revenues are totally destructive.  Tax revenues
are shown as losses where, in fact, ever-growing real revenue
gains exist.
<P>
Because revenue estimates by government scorekeepers allege that
tax-deductible IRAs are billion dollar losers, Congress' existing
revenue neutrality requirements require an increase in taxes elsewhere
to offset the alleged loss from tax deducted saving.  Such erroneous
estimates, and related offsets, create fiscal chaos.
<P>
Huge amounts of economic growth have been, and will continue to
be, totally misdirected, curtailed, and wasted unless these existing
revenue estimation methodologies are completely changed.
<P>
Leaders of professions, labor, businesses, and associations must
lead their groups to demand corrective legislation.  Everyone,
including the government, will benefit.

<h2><center><I><B>&quot;Trickle-Down Economics&quot; And &quot;Tax Loopholes
For The Rich&quot;</h2></B></I></center>

<hr>
<P>
Both of the above inflammatory labels have been used to thwart
legislative attempts to improve, expand, and increase the allowable
tax deduction levels of IRAs.  These labels ignore the facts.
<P>
It is correct, of course, that higher-bracket taxpayers also gain
with tax-deductible IRAs.  However, as so clearly shown in this
analysis, this gain is derived solely from the removal of a crushing,
self-defeating, double and triple tax burden on saving that's
imposed by the progressive ordinary income tax.  This tax irrationally
and progressively wipes out the saving accumulations of all taxpayers.
 And, the higher the bracket, the more irrational the second layer
of tax becomes.
<P>
The ordinary income tax should not be applied to saving, because
it is progressively destructive to the government's tax revenues,
as well as the taxpayers' and our nation's wealth.  Under the
ordinary income tax, the higher the tax bracket, the greater the
destruction to all concerned, including the government.
<P>
High-bracket taxpayers should be encouraged to make unlimited,
tax-deducted contributions to IRAs.  Not only does the government
receive far higher tax revenues, the availability of investment
capital for the users of capital (in any tax bracket) is greatly
increased.  This is vital to our nation's economy.
<P>
And, it has been clearly demonstrated in many forums that the
bulk of the benefits derived from increased capital flow to labor.
 The more capital a worker has to work with, the higher is the
worker's productivity, the greater is the demand for his or her
labor, and the higher is his or her real wage rate.  In fact,
if capital doesn't increase more rapidly than labor, productivity,
employment, and real wage rates will not advance.  Increasing
the amount of capital per worker requires reducing the cost of
capital, and that requires reducing the cost of saving.  That's
what tax-deductible IRAs do.  Lowering the cost of capital will
also reduce the cost of government debt.
<P>
Small businesses, entrepreneurs, and job seekers will surely benefit
greatly from capital growth, as will all other taxpayers, both
directly and indirectly.  Without question, the slogans &quot;trickle-down
economics&quot; and &quot;tax loopholes for the rich,&quot; when
applied to universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRAs, are nothing
but complete red herrings.

<center><h2>"IT'S DRUGS, STUPID," ACU SAYS</h2></center>
<p><strong>ALEXANDRIA, VA.</strong>--- "At a time when the latest statistics indicate marijuana use among teen-<br><br>agers is up 37% and as we face a national crisis on drug abuse, Bill Clinton fiddles while Rome <br><br>burns talking about tobacco use," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. <br><br>Keene. "The way the Clinton Administration and its liberal allies portray it, tobacco is the greatest <br><br>scourge affecting children since the dawn of time and nothing short of a full-blown crackdown by <br><br>the Federal government can solve it. But the real problem is drug abuse and all its associated evils, <br><br>and the Clinton Administration has exhibited a scandalous indifference to the appalling increase in <br><br>illegal drug use."
<p>Keene noted that U.S. Department of Health and Human Services statistics released earlier this month show overall drug abuse among teens is up 78% between 1992 and 1995.  Marijuana use by teen-agers is up 37%, LSD use is up 54%, and cocaine use is up 166%.  He also pointed to a second new government report showing hospital emergency room visits resulting from marijuana abuse is up 96%.  Before Clinton took office, teen-age drug abuse had declined for a decade according to a third survey, conducted by <em>USA Today</em>.
<p>"What's really at work here is a cynical attempt to gain political mileage at the expense of addressing the real problem," Keene continued.  "The Administration, knowing it lacks credibility when it comes to waging the real war -- the war on drugs -- thinks it can cover itself with a phony war on tobacco.
<p>"As early as the 1960's and 1970's, the science was conclusive about the hazards of illegal drug use," Keene said. "But the then-youthful liberals who today occupy top positions in Washington, Hollywood and elsewhere ridiculed the dangers of marijuana and rejected society's disdain over 'hard' drugs.  They agitated to decriminalize marijuana cutlivation, possession and use.  They attacked, then as now, conservatives and other advocates of traditional cultural and moral values.  Today, as adults, they minimize and rationalize their own dalliances in the illegal drug scene.  For example, the President did not say that his own marijuana experimentation was wrong because it was illegal, or dangerous, or manifested anti-social behavior -- he excused himself by saying that he 'didn't inhale.'
<p>"No one, not even the tobacco companies, who are clearly on record about it, think it's a good idea for young people to smoke," Keene added.  "But the liberal establishment's election-year hysteria over tobacco is hypocritical in light of its record on illegal drug policy.  After all, the permissive social and political attitudes of liberalism gave birth to the drug culture.  Many liberals seem unwilling to offer more than lip service when it comes to fighting it and belittle those who try -- as former First Lady Nancy Reagan can attest from experience.  Should anyone take this Administration seriously in its 'holy war' against tobacco in light of disturbing reports of illegal drug use among the White House staff? What moral authority does the President -- a cigar smoker -- bring to bear? Why is the Administration bent on expanding government power and imposing new layers of regulation on the American people in this instance while turning a blind eye and deaf ear to the critical problem of illegal drug use?
<p>"The American people should be asking tough questions," Keene concluded. "If the Administration should make a Federal case out of anything, it's national drug policy. Apparently Clinton has none, since the statistics speak for themselves. We therefore urge the Administration to wake up to the real and growing threat of illegal drug abuse and stop offering political sideshows to sidestep its real responsibilities."

<h2>FLAT TAX, SALES TAX, WHATEVER: FOCUS MUST STAY ON<br>
JUNKING CURRENT NIGHTMARISH TAX SYSTEM, ACU SAYS </h2>
</center>

<p>
WASHINGTON, D.C.--- "Some conservatives favor a flat tax, others support a national sales or
value-added tax, still others have different ideas on how best to pay for the legitimate
functions of government. The main thing is, we must not allow differences over those approaches
from causing the tax reform movement to lose sight of the real goal: elimination of the current
Federal income tax non-system, with its enormous bureaucracy, byzantine rules and regulations,
and abuses and outrages. That's why ACU is happy to join forces with those who also recognize
the importance of staying focused on the larger objective," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the
American Conservative Union (ACU), at a "Commitment to Tax Reform" press conference in
Washington, D.C., hosted by Citizens for a Sound Economy.
<P>
     "This year's Tax Freedom Day- - May 7 - - was the latest ever," Keene continued. "When you
add in the hidden costs of government, such as regulations and other expensive burdens,
Americans must labor until July 3 before they're in the clear and able to keep all of what they
work hard to earn. That's an outrage to cause every American's blood to boil. The 105th Congress
cannot allow this level and scope of taxation to continue. The current tax structure is
hopelessly beyond repair and the only sane, fair thing to do is scrap it entirely.
<P>
     "ACU has already launched its own long-term project with the objective of abolishing the
IRS and repealing the 16th Amendment, which authorized the Federal income tax. Yet that does not
mean we cannot join with our friends who argue persuasively for a flat tax in saying with them
that what exists now is a nightmare that must end and that the American people deserve tax
justice," Keene concluded. "The issue is no longer whether or not to end taxation as we know it,
but how soon we will get there. Once we get there, we may find that a flat tax is the way to go,
or that the best option is the national sales tax, or that some other approach is better.
Whatever the outcome, we simply must not lose sight of the objective, we simply must not let
Congress dodge the issue any longer, and we simply must make sure that the American people don't
stop pressing for reform."

<h2>ON TAX FREEDOM DAY, ACU URGES 16TH AMENDMENT REPEAL </h2>
</center>

<p>


 
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "It's Tax Freedom Day. Starting now, Americans can keep what they 
work so hard to earn after having spent the past four months working to pay Uncle Sam's tax 
bill," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. "With this year's Tax 
Freedom Day being the latest ever, the need for comprehensive tax reform has never been greater. 
That's why ACU is making tax reform its top long-term priority." 
<p>    Keene said that a cornerstone of the ACU effort will be a grassroot-oriented lobbying and 
public education campaign to rally support for repeal of the 16th Amendment to the Constitution, 
which instituted the Federal income tax. 
 
 <p>    "Federal spending, the deficit, the national debt, and the growth of government have been 
spiralling out of control for decades," Keene said. "While the current Republican Congress has 
shown more determination to attack those problems than any in modern times, we have a liberal 
President who refuses to break with the past - - he vetoes every important reform and every 
serious attempt to bring needed change to the way Washington does business. Since the surest way 
to stop the big spenders is to not let them get their hands on the money, the current tax system 
has to go. The enormous tax-gathering bureaucracy, the byzantine rules and regulations, and all 
the abuses and outrages that go with it simply cannot be fixed. The slate must be wiped clean by 
repealing the 16th Amendment, and a sane, fair, workable means of paying for the essential 
functions of government should replace it." 
 
 <p>    Keene said ACU's strategy includes national "Town Meetings" on the tax reform issue, 
distribution of hundreds of thousands of citizen petitions to Congress calling for repeal of the 
16th Amendment and abolition of the Internal Revenue Service, direct lobbying of Congress, 
cooperation with public interest groups also interested in tax reform, and other projects. 

<p>     "The issue is no longer whether to drastically reform our tax non-system, but when," 
Keene added, noting that the issue was a major topic among GOP Presidential candidates and 
continues to rank high on the agendas of key Congressional leaders.  
 
 <p>    "ACU is preparing to buckle down for the long haul," Keene concluded. "We know it may 
take a few years for Congress and the states to complete the process of repeal and for a 
national consensus to be reached on a new and better tax system. ACU's job will be to help make 
sure that Washington does the right thing for the taxpayer, and we'll stay on the job for as 
long as it takes." 
 
<p>     ACU, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots-oriented conservative lobbying 
organization. On behalf of its nearly one million members and supporters, it lobbies on a wide 
range of issues before the Congress.

<title>WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?</title>

<h2> WHO'S BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM?<br>  
                    SURPRISE! IT'S TED KENNEDY </h2>
</center>

<p>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "Ted Kennedy built a career out of portraying every problem, however 
minor, as a crisis of mammoth proportions requiring immediate, massive government intervention. 
How ironic, then, that this same Ted Kennedy is the only one standing in the way of further 
Congressional action on S.1028, the health care legislation of which he is the chief 
co-sponsor," said David A. Keene, Chairman of the American Conservative Union (ACU). "Obviously, 
the Senator from Massachusetts isn't the least reluctant to fiddle while Rome burns when it 
suits his liberal political agenda." 
 
<p>     Keene referred to Kennedy's thus-far-successful parliamentary ploy blocking the 
appointment of Senate conferees on S.1028, the Kassebaum-Kennedy health care bill. Kennedy's 
delaying tactic is an attempt to pressure Senate leaders into not adding supporters of Medical 
Savings Accounts (MSAs) to the proposed list of conferees. 
 
<p>     "Kennedy and his fellow ultra-liberals really aren't interested in true reform, which MSAs 
represent," Keene continued. "They only want to give the American people another dose of the 
same old Big Government elixir. They want to maintain government power and control, limit health 
care choices, and micromanage health care decision-making by patients, health care 
professionals, and the private sector. MSAs offer consumer choice, not government control - - 
and that is why the liberals oppose them. 
 
<p>     "In his vendetta against MSAs - - the most promising health care insurance reform idea 
proposed in years - - Kennedy shows he's all too willing to play inside-the-Beltway politics 
with people's health care. This is hypocrisy at its worst. The American people should insist 
that Sen. Kennedy either get on board for true reform, or get out of the way and let the rest of 
the American people's elected representatives deal with this issue promptly," Keene concluded. 
 
<p>     The American Conservative Union, founded in 1964, is the country's oldest grassroots

<h2>AX GAS TAX, ACU SAYS</h2>
</center>

<p>
 
<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "A few months ago, President Clinton admitted that he raised taxes too
much and that it was a mistake. That's all the more reason why he should start making amends
now by supporting the growing movement in Congress to repeal his unnecessary 4.3-cent
gasoline tax. If not, the least he ought to do is make a public commitment not to veto a repeal,"
said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene. 
<P>
     "The current increases in gasoline prices stem from many factors," Keene added, "and as
the marketplace deals with them, prices will eventually decrease - - but only to a point. The
marketplace can't make tax burdens disappear. The public has been forced to get along with less
thanks to Clinton's various tax increases. ACU says it's high time government went on a diet,
and a good place to start is by junking the Clinton gas tax."

<title>ACU Press Release - REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, 
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</title>

<h2>REPUBLICANS SUPPORT TAX LIMITS, <br>
DEMOCRATS STILL BIG SPENDERS</h2>
</center>

<P>
ALEXANDRIA, VA.--- "The tax-and-spend crowd couldnt escape this time," said American Conservative Union (ACU) Chairman David A. Keene, commenting on the tax limitation Constitutional amendment vote in the House of Representatives this week. "This was a real test of who wants to make it harder for the government to get its hands on the peoples money and who is a big spender. By and large, Republicans passed the test and the Democrats failed."
Republicans voted 219 to 24 to support limits on the taxes government takes. Democrats voted for business as usual by a vote of 160 against tax limits and only 16 for tax limits.
<P>
"All it takes is a simple plurality to raise taxes and increase spending," Keene said. "Because its so easy for Congress to spend other peoples money, thats why were in the fiscal mess we face today. If Congress claims to be serious about getting taxation and spending under control, then it should be prepared to vote for serious measures to do that. The Tax Limitation Amendment was just such a measure. Were pleased that it won the support of a majority in the House, but disappointed that it fell short of the necessary two-thirds. 
<P>
"We urge the American people to ask some tough questions of Congressmen who opposed this measure, to find out why they think it should continue to be so easy to tax, spend, run up the deficit and expand the national debt," Keene continued. "They also should ask these politicians, especially Democrats, why they insist on maintaining a tax-and-spend policy so out of control that Congress needs to pass a Taxpayer Bill of Rights. Isnt it more sensible to change that system so that we dont have to pass laws to protect people from it?"
<P>


Keene rejected a chief argument of opponents that limiting the ability to raise taxes means   restricting the ability of Congress to use taxation as one way to help balance the budget and reduce the deficit.
<P>
"Too many tax-and-spend liberals think taxes first, spending cuts last - - if they think of spending cuts at all. If you give politicians easy access to the money, theyre going to spend it and then some. The answer is to cut off the gravy train. Americans already pay plenty in taxes. Even if Democrats and a few Republicans dont get it, the American people do: cut government spending and stop raising taxes. The two go hand in hand. ACU will keep up the pressure and work to make sure that next time, there will indeed be enough votes to enact this important remedy," Keene said.
<P>
ACU, founded in 1964, is the countrys oldest grassroots conservative lobbying organization, with nearly one million members and supporters.

   Bowers v. Hardwick, 106 Sup. Ct. 2841 (1986).  
  By "lower," we do not mean "bad."  The bliss of marriage 
consists in part in the sexual union of spouses.  That union 
is, in the human species, elevated and inspired by the 
rational and moral union that married people enjoy.  A 
lifetime of commitment, chosen and not dictated by 
instinct, sustained by determination in the face of obstacles, 
is the specifically human satisfaction of human sexual 
relations.  In that context, the human family is a reflection 
of the divine nature of man. 
  See Edward J. Erler, "Equal Protection and Personal 
Rights: The Regime of the 'Discrete and Insular Minority,'" 
Georgia Law Review 16:407-444; and Kenneth L. Karst and 
Harold W. Horowitz, "Affirmative Action and Equal 
Protection," Virginia Law Review 60:955-974.
  A national marketing survey indicates that the average 
homosexual enjoys a household income of more than 
$55,400, a figure $23,000 higher than the average American 
household.  Homosexuals are far more likely to hold a 
college degree, and far more likely to work in a professional 
or managerial position than average Americans.  They are 
more than four times as likely to travel overseas, or to earn 
over $100,000 annually.  See "Overcoming a Deep-Rooted 
Reluctance, More Firms Advertise to Gay Community," in 
The Wall Street Journal, July 18, 1991, p. B-1.  
  On the other hand, for a brief clear response to 
homosexuals who try to bend the Bible to support their 
case, see Harry V. Jaffa, Homosexuality and the Natural Law 
(Claremont, California: The Claremont Institute, 1990), p. 
31; for a summary of studies exploding the 10-percent myth,

Billy et al., "The Sexual Behavior of Men in the United 
States," Family Planning Perspectives, March/April 1993, 
pp. 52-60; for an argument that homosexuality is "curable" 
and not etched in genetic stone, see  Mark Hartwig, "Is 
Homosexuality Destiny or Choice?" Focus on the Family 
Citizen, Nov. 16, 1992, pp. 12-14.
  For a complete account, see William Tucker, "Revolt in 
Queens," The American Spectator, February 1993, pp. 26-

  Amendment 2, which received 54 percent of the popular 
vote, read as follows:  "Shall there be an amendment to 
Article II of the Colorado Constitution to prohibit the state 
of Colorado and any of its political subdivisions from 
adopting or enforcing any law or policy which provides that 
homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation or conduct, or 
relationships constitutes or entitles a person to claim any 
minority or protected status, quota preference or 
discrimination?"

  The Federalist, no. 78, Clinton Rossiter, ed. (New York: 
The New American Library, 1961), p. 469.  Alexander 
Hamilton wrote that the "independence of the judges is 
equally requisite to guard the Constitution and the rights of 
individuals";  James Madison, in urging the First Congress of 
the United States to adopt a bill of rights, noted that 
"independent tribunals of justice will consider themselves in 
a peculiar manner the guardians of those rights."  1 Annals 
of Congress (Gales and Seaton, eds., 1834), p. 457.  For the 
Progressive view see J. Allen Smith, The Spirit of American 
Government, pp. 299-300: "In carrying out the original 
intent of the Constitution with reference to property the 
courts have developed and applied the doctrine of vested 
rights-a doctrine which has been used with telling effect for 
the purpose of defeating democratic reforms."
  Robert E. Brown, Charles Beard and the Constitution: A 
Critical Analysis of "An Economic Interpretation of the 
Constitution" (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1956).  
Using the same data that was used by Beard, Brown was able 
to show that as many members of the "predator classes" 
opposed the Constitution as supported it.
  In his essay "On the Jewish Question," Marx had pointed 
out that progressive taxes can be used by the state as an 
effective means to abolish private property:  "when men 
strive to liberate themselves through political emancipation, 
the state can, and must, proceed to abolish and destroy

  In 1927, the Progressive historian Vernon Parrington 
made this remarkable reinterpretation of the American 
Founding: "The substitution of 'pursuit of happiness' for 
'property' [in the Declaration of Independence] marks a 
complete break with the Whiggish doctrine of property 
rights that Locke had bequeathed to the English middle 
class, and the substitution of a broader sociological 
conception; and it was this substitution that gave to the 
document the note of idealism which was to make its appeal 
so perennially human and vital."  In the view of Parrington, 
the radical welfare state had been present in America's most 
authoritative documents from the very beginning!  Main

(According to the California Department of Personnel 
Administration, the state paid $430 in 1992 to Foundation 
Health for HMO coverage for an employee family of three. I 
added $20 because Foundation coverage is more restrictive

was worth $565. (According to HUD, the average one-
bedroom apartment in Los Angeles costs $704 in rent; I 
estimate $60 in utilities for a total of $764; a Section 8 
certificate is worth $764 minus 30% of cash income: $663 X 
30% = $199, and 764 minus 199 is 565.) Thanks to Jennifer

* Editors' Note: The idea for this appendix arose during a 
November 1992 segment of the television interview show, 
"Meet the Press."  Its purpose, like that of Appendix A, is to 
demonstrate that Bible-based religious faith is perfectly 
compatible with the principles and traditions of American 
democracy.  Indeed, it is much more so than the facile 
moral relativism of modern liberals.

   <H1>McNamara's Anniversary Gift to Hanoi</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

<P>
The political leaders of Hanoi were assured a joyful 20th 
Anniversary of their victory over South Vietnam after 
unwrapping a priceless gift.  It was a retrospective book of 
our involvement in Southeast Asia, authored by former 
Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, in which one line 
takes precedence over all others:  . . .We were wrong, 
terribly wrong.

<P>
President Clinton, not unexpectedly, has praised the 
book and commended the courage it took to write it.

<P>
Don't for a moment believe that this is a book of self-
deprecation.  It is, instead, a book in which the author 
misses few opportunities to praise himself, even including 
a picture of a mountain he climbed in Wyoming.  He 
modestly concedes that President Johnson wrote in a letter 
that the President never liked or admired anyone more 
than Robert McNamara.  

<P>
It is written in the same kind of confusion in which he 
served as Secretary of Defense:  one sentence contradicts 
another sentence, one paragraph impugns another 
paragraph, one point is made with strength, and then 
nurtured with weakness.  Those with whom he worked, 
including Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, are criticized 
and complimented all at once.  It appears to be his way of 
covering all bases.  Mr. McNamara even devotes one short 
paragraph in praise of the Americans who gave their lives 
in Vietnam.  (It's on page 333 for those who may easily 
miss it.)

<P>
He further writes  that I do not know to this day 
whether I quit or was fired.  Maybe it was both. Maybe.  
Everything seems to be uncertain.  Nevertheless, when all 
the contradictory points, incidents, and dialogues are put 
aside, McNamara clearly blames President Johnson for 
not accepting much of  McNamara's wisdom.

<P>
The book, by its own omissions, encourages the spread 
of an American amnesia, a disease with which President 
Clinton has already been stricken.  Robert McNamara 
stops his history when he departed his job, thereby 
conveniently leaving out the evidence that we were not 
wrong, terribly wrong in becoming involved, but instead 
that our Congress was wrong, terribly wrong during the 
two-and-one-quarter years after our military came home.  
Those two-and-one-quarter years have been wiped from 
America's memory as our amnesia makes us believe that 
when our troops left, Vietnam fell.

<P>
It was January of 1973 when our military engagement 
ended under the Paris peace accords in which both sides 
agreed to be permitted to make periodic replacement of 
armaments, munitions and war material which have been 
destroyed, damaged, worn out or used up after the cease-
fire, on the basis of piece-for-piece. . . .  North Vietnam 
replaced their losses on a four-to-one ratio rather than 
keeping the agreement of piece-for-piece, and the 94th 
Congress of the United States voted against supplying any 
replacements for South Vietnam's losses, stopping all aid 
of any kind to both Cambodia and South Vietnam, making 
defeat inevitable.  In April of 1975, both nations fell.

<P>
We signed those accords because Chapter Four, 
Article Nine of the agreement states that the South 
Vietnamese people shall decide themselves the political 
future of South Vietnam through genuinely free and 
democratic elections under international supervision.  
Article Eleven stipulates the insurance of the democratic 
liberties of the people; personal freedom, freedom of 
speech, freedom of the press, freedom of meeting, 
freedom of organization, freedom of residence, freedom of 
work.

<P>
None of this is recorded in the McNamara book, nor 
will President Clinton remind the American people of 
those accords when, as expected, he gives diplomatic 
recognition to a government that to this day refuses to 
keep its word on an agreement that was the very reason we 
left Vietnam.

<P>
By McNamara concluding the book where he does 
there is no mention of the horrors that came about when 
the communists won the war.  There is not even a footnote 
recording the over one million fleeing boat people, the 
genocide in Cambodia, or the post-war concentration 
camps in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia.  The morality of 
what we tried to do has been proven by the immorality of 
the victors.

<P>
In the chapter entitled <B>The Lessons of Vietnam</B>, he 
generously sets in print his recommendations for future 
foreign policy.  With the depth of a single piece of saran-
wrap, we are told that we should achieve a nuclear-free 
world in which multilateral decision-making takes place 
within a burden-sharing context, while we assure 
preservation of the global environment.  That should work. 

<P>
It's entirely possible that waiting for Robert McNamara 
to mature may take more time than patience will allow.  It 
is my hope, however, that the time will come when  he 
will review what he wrote in the mid-1990s and conclude 
that his anniversary gift to Hanoi was wrong, terribly 
wrong.

<font size=3><b>The Impact Of The Ordinary Income Tax On Saving<br>
by <a href="/savers/library/tkbio.html">Tom Kelly</a></b></font><br>
<hr>

<b>Executive Summary</center></b>
<P>
The financial strength of taxpayers at all economic levels, as
well as the financial strength of our government and our nation,
is being increasingly eroded year after year by the taxation of
private savings and investment growth.  A change from the ordinary
income tax treatment of saving to an expanded IRA-type tax treatment
of saving would benefit the economy, the taxpayer, and ultimately
the Treasury, too, by promoting higher rates of saving and economic
growth.  An example based on historical market returns on savings
will illustrate this fact.
<P>
Two taxpayers invested $100 of after-tax income in an actual mutual
fund on January 1, 1926.  Sixty-seven years later on 12/31/92
both taxpayers sold their fund.  This sixty-seven year period
included depressions, recessions, wars, and good times, too. 
This period also provides a reasonable illustration of what the
reward to saving might be in the many decades ahead.
<P>
Let's assume that one taxpayer, Larry Lo-bracket, was always in
the 15% tax bracket, and the other, Harry Hi-bracket, was always
in the 50% tax bracket (many, if not most, of those years had
tax brackets exceeding 50%).  On 12/31/92 Larry's $100 investment
was worth $57,708 and Harry's was only worth $9,195.  These compare
with values of $141,940 and $241,296 if Larry's and Harry's income
and investment <I>had not been subjected to the ordinary income
tax.</I>
<P>
In short, the ordinary income tax reduced Larry's otherwise invested
capital by 59% and Harry's by 96%!  Interestingly, Larry Lo-bracket's
loss was <I>four</I> times his tax bracket, and Harry Hi-bracket's
loss was <I>two</I> times his tax bracket!
<P>
In contrast, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, Larry would
have avoided the 15% tax ($17.65) on his income, and, thus, his
investment would have been $117.65.  Harry would have avoided
the 50% tax ($100) on his income, and his investment would have
been $200.00.  These larger investments provide the proper IRA
comparison with a $100 after-tax investment by each taxpayer under
the ordinary income tax.
<P>
Larry's <I>after-tax</I> value under the IRA-type plan on 12/31/92
would have been $120,649, <I>as would have Harry's.</I>  The $120,649
after-tax value for each man equals 85% of the $141,940 untaxed
value for Larry and 50% of the $241,298 untaxed value for Harry
(see above).  Larry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(15%), and Harry's loss due to taxes was equal to his tax bracket
(50%).  This is fair and proper taxation.
<P>
<I>As illustrated, under a tax-deductible IRA-type plan, both
men had the same after-tax value, $120,649, because each man's
out-of-pocket contribution consisted of $100, with the government
deferring its tax, i.e., $17.65 for Larry and $100 for Harry.</I>
<P>
Upon the IRA withdrawal on 12/31/92, the government not only recovered
its full tax deferral ($17.65 for Larry &amp; $100 for Harry),
it also enjoyed the entire untaxed, free-market investment return
on these tax deferred amounts.  While collecting the full free-market
growth on these IRA tax deductions, the government gave up the
yearly taxation of investment return and realized gain that it
would have otherwise collected under the ordinary income tax.
 <I>It is this yearly ordinary income tax on investment return
that punishes saving so harshly, and it is solely this second
layer of tax that is properly removed by tax-deductible IRAs.</I>
<P>
As illustrated above, each $100 of a taxpayer's IRA-type <I>net</I>
saving (i.e., <I>net</I> of the tax that's deferred) will enjoy
the same investment growth from the same investment <I>regardless
of tax bracket</I>.  This is so, because there is no further tax
on the <I>net</I> saving.  In short, this means that all of every
taxpayer's investment return and realized gain derived from <I>net
</I>IRA saving is received totally tax free.  This is sound economics,
as well as sound and fair tax treatment, because every dollar
of private saving adds equal economic value to our nation's success,
regardless of the source of the saving, be it from Larry Lo-bracket
or from Harry Hi-bracket.
<P>
The <I>new</I> saving generated by such a proper reversal of our
nation's existing and punitive ordinary income tax treatment of
saving will be very large and ongoing.
<P>
Clearly, the ordinary income tax destroys each taxpayer's investment
values that would otherwise be available for his or her own future
use.  The ordinary income tax also concurrently destroys the capital
available for the economy as a whole.  After all, capital saved
and invested by each taxpayer is used over and over again by others,
thereby generating more production, more jobs, and more taxes.
<P>
The negative bias of the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
has led to an increasing Congressional awareness that corrective
legislation must take place.  As a result, bipartisan legislation,
the Individual Investment Account Act, S. 929 and H.R. 3179, has
been sponsored in the 103rd Congress by Senator John Breaux (D-LA)
and Representative Jim McCrery (R-LA).  Briefly, this Act establishes
IRA-type accounts that permit-
<UL>
<LI>Unlimited tax deductions for all contributions by any taxpayer.<p>
<LI>No tax on the account's investment return or realized gain.<p>
<LI>No penalty taxes nor forced distributions at any age.  Taxes
are paid solely upon withdrawals.<p>
<LI>No income tax nor estate tax at death.  Beneficiary has benefactor's
tax basis.<p>
<LI>Up to $15,000 of tax-deferred &quot;rollover&quot; for first-time
home buyers.  The tax basis of the home is reduced by the rollover.<p>
<LI>The proceeds from the sale of a primary residence may be rolled
over without tax into the tax-deferred IRA-type account, including
the $125,000 tax-free home sale proceeds after age 55.  The account's
tax basis is increased by the former residence's tax basis and
the $125,000 tax-free proceeds.<p>
<LI>The tax-deductible purchase of life insurance, provided the
proceeds are added to the tax-deferred account.
</UL>
<P>
These universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans without
penalty taxes and forced distributions will create such an upsurge
in new saving that any revenue loss will soon be outweighed by
the tax revenue gains arising from a greatly increased saving
rate.  Such increased saving leads to more investment, more production,
reduced costs of capital, more jobs, a higher standard of living,
and yes-more tax collections from sound economic growth.
<P>
The dynamic economic gains that flow from universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs can be measured in trillions of dollars of
increased GDP (Gross Domestic Product).  And, these GDP gains
translate into net dynamic tax revenue gains vs. the ordinary
income tax.  An appropriate report by the respected economics
consulting firm, Fiscal Associates, and included herein as Appendix
B, forecasts the static and dynamic economic results flowing from
the proposed legislation.
<P>
For example, three years after the adoption of universal, unlimited,
tax-deductible IRAs, a healthier economy would bring in about
$17 billion in new federal tax revenue.  This would offset all
but about $10 billion of static revenue loss, as measured in the
erroneous &quot;tax expenditure&quot; manner utilized by government
analysts.  Within eight years, the real dynamic gains would (a)
fully offset the government's erroneous static revenue losses
and (b)<I> increase most taxpayers' after-tax income by approximately
15% to 20%.</I>  The bulk (85%) of this increase in after-tax
income would flow to taxpayers (including joint returns) with
adjusted gross incomes of under $100,000 per year.
<P>
Further, in a relatively short period of time (years 2000 - 2010),
annual GDP would be $500 billion to $1 trillion higher than otherwise,
thereby creating up to an additional two million more jobs than
otherwise.  Because of faster economic growth, annual tax revenues
would gradually grow each year to 30 billion dollars higher than
otherwise by the year 2010.  By the year 2060, GDP would be $32
trillion higher than otherwise and over 5 million more jobs than
otherwise would be created.
<P>
It is relevant to point out that the government relies upon its
staff-formulated &quot;static&quot; tax expenditure figures when
tax legislation is being considered.  This static tax expenditure
methodology is seriously flawed in that, among other things, it
ignores rational taxpayer reactions to tax law change.
<P>
Moreover, the government's 1995 Budget document admits for the
first time that the present value of its static IRA tax expenditure
figures for 1994 overstates IRA costs by over three times!  Thus,
it can be observed that not only is the government's static method
for measuring revenue loss flawed, the government's own numbers,
even using its own erroneous static method, are three times too
high!  In real life, the more realistic &quot;dynamic&quot; tax
revenue forecasts, as portrayed in this analysis, are superior.
 
<P>
Enacting universal, unlimited, tax-deductible IRA-type plans has
many very favorable, interrelated consequences for taxpayers,
our government, and our nation.  Similarly, there are often-heard
and generally superficial objections to expanding IRA-type plans.
These consequences and objections are addressed individually
and thoroughly in the &quot;perspectives&quot; section of this
analysis.
<P>
<U><I><b><center>Conclusions</I></U></b></center>
<UL>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving and investing
imposes enormous, ever-growing economic losses on our nation.
The net result is an ongoing compounding of economic injury to
savers, workers, users of capital, and the Treasury itself.<p>
<LI>The existing governmental tax revenue estimation methods that
neglect the dynamics of saving, and hence completely mismeasure
the tax revenue impact of tax-deductible IRA-type plans, are a
major driving force of our nation's erroneous tax policy as applied
to saving.<p>
<LI>The government's existing methods of estimating tax revenues
from IRA-type plans must be scrapped in favor of a more accurate
estimating process.<p>
<LI>The next sixty-seven years of savings and investment results
will have economic ups and downs not unlike the past sixty-seven.
Thus, the economic results, as portrayed in this analysis, that
flow from continuing the ordinary income tax treatment of saving
are a reasonable harbinger of a dismal economic future for our
nation if this irrational taxation of saving is not corrected
promptly.  On the other hand, tax-deductible IRA-type saving helps
everyone-including the user of capital, the government, and our
nation-not just the taxpayer.<p>
<LI>IRA-type plans must be improved, expanded, and promoted.<p>
<LI>Rather than limiting and discouraging the use of tax-deductible
IRA-type plans by taxpayers, the government should remove all
tax impediments to these plans and extol their use by everyone.<p>
<LI>The ordinary income tax as applied to saving creates an ever-growing
atrophy of the economic strength of taxpayer/voters, the users
of capital, government, and our nation.  Expanded and improved
tax-deductible IRA-type plans will reverse this economic emaciation
and create sound, robust growth.

   <H1>Hitler vs. The United Nations</H1>
   <h2>Liberty and the Bosnian Conflict</h2>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>

Hitler was born sixty years too early to serve his ambitions.  Had he come to power in the 1990s instead of the 1930s, he would have won.

<p>
In the 1990s he would have been faced with the United Nations organization and the current leadership of the United States, and they would have offered little resistance.  I do not mean to suggest that they would have done nothing:

<p>
The U.N. forces would have stood at the railway stations, monitoring the families that were split apart among screams and tears.  U.N. monitors would also have stationed themselves outside Buchenwald and Dachau to monitor smoke when it was seen coming from the crematoriums.  But their orders would have been not to take a side in the conflict.

<p>
The United States leadership would adamantly oppose any aid to Great Britain on the grounds that it would "Americanize" the war, and the President would reject any weapons going to the underground movements in Europe, saying this would only "cause the death of innocent civilians."

<p>
In the 1990s the U.S. Presidents foreign policy has turned the nation into a Maxi-Switzerland, with his perception of our military as little more than a uniformed Peace Corps.  But its not only the administration.  Prominent voices in the opposition party are saying that engagement in Bosnia would not be in our national interest.  Are they saying the prevention of genocide would not be in the interest of the people of the United States?  And both major political parties concur that we must not send in U.S. ground troops to help the 
victims of Serbian aggression.

<p>
Without the will, our power (if we still have it), means nothing.  Militarily, Rule Number One is never to announce what <i>will not</i> be done.

<p>
The larger tragedy of contemporary times is that the word "peace" is given more importance than the word "liberty."  As is always the case when peace takes precedence over liberty, neither are achieved.  It is only when liberty is paramount that liberty and peace can both be realized.

<p>
President Lincoln could have had peace easily, saving 500,000 American lives.  He could have done that by ordering U.S. troops from Fort Sumter and allowing South Carolina and any other state to secede from the Union.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt could have had peace if on the morning of December 8, 1941 he would have asked Congress, not for a Declaration of War, but for a Declaration of Accommodation with the Axis powers, as an Asian and European War would not be worth the death of one more American.  And we would have had peace.

<p>
President Bush could have had peace in this decade by allowing Sadam Hussein to keep his troops in Kuwait and to allow him entry into Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman.  Surely Sadam Hussein would have sold us oil as he would have needed the dollars.  And there would have been peace.

<p>
In all cases there would have been the peace of the slave for the many, the peace of the master for the few, and the peace of the grave for the rest.

<p>
As President Clinton rejects any troops to protect the Bosnian civilians, he does not rule out 25,000 U.S. troops to safeguard the U.N. forces.  Why does he care more about the uniformed who were misplaced there by the U.N. than about the civilians who were born there--or who went there to be in a U.N. "safe area"?

<p>
What should we do?

<p>
Ignore the U.N.  Lift the arms embargo.  And with or without NATO, bomb all military targets of the Serbs, including all missile deployments, all anti-aircraft sites, all roads, supply lines, bridges, and arms factories, whether in Bosnia or Serbia, all the way to Belgrade with no privileged sanctuaries.  (The lesson we should have learned from the Vietnam war.)  And we should be willing to send in ground troops if necessary after the bombing, and make our willingness known.

<p>
Why should we do this?

<p>
Because were alive at this time.  Our obligation as human beings is to stop the atrocities of which we once said, "Never again."

<p>
But we said that a long time ago.  It was, after all, more than a half century ago that Hitler encountered a difficulty too large for him to overcome. The difficulty was that back then there were leaders in the world who held liberty as the most cherished human right.

What should every schoolchild know about the history of this land of liberty we call America?  The National History Standards Project, sponsored by the National Endowment for the Humanities and the U.S. Education Department, attempted to provide an answer to this
question; however, their report, released in late 1994, contains serious omissions and amusing political correctness.  In response, the Family Research Council prepared <I> Let Freedom Ring!, </I>an outline of U.S. history that avoids political fashion and emphasizes real knowledge of America's past.

   <H1>Transferring the USIA to the Department of Many Umbrellas</H1>
   <H3>By Bruce Herschensohn</H3>

</center>


<p>
The dismemberment of the Soviet Union has brought many in Congress to the conclusion that the United States can close or cut those foreign policy entities that took a lead role in the Cold War.  As a result, the United States Information Agency (USIA) may soon be slated for takeover by the U. S. State Department, with a commensurate and severe cut in the funds of USIA's radio arm, the Voice of America (VOA).  The VOA could then be virtually destroyed by the Chamerlainesque policies of State.  The hallways of the State Department are lined with dripping umbrellas, even when it isn't raining outside.

<p>
Is the USIA and its VOA still valuable with the Soviet Union gone?  Of course it is.  The death of the Soviet Union does not guarantee that democracy is the one and only outlook for Russia and other former Soviet Republics.  Nor does it mean that totalitarians around the world will applaud U.S. policy.  The VOA is the SDI of information.  Its stories about the United States have balanced the movies, rap songs, and gang activities which many citizens of the world would otherwise think consume this nation.  Its truth-telling of world news and events has encouraged the citizens of the world to accept nothing less than liberty.

<p>
On the sixth anniversary of the Tiananman Square massacre, the VOA's transmitters reached tens of millions of people in China despite their government's attempts at jamming it.  Would our State Department be so insistent?

<p>
When the Nobel Peace Prize recipient, Ms. Saw Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma, was released from house arrest this month, she told reporters that during those six years of confinement the VOA was her outside line to the free world.  Everyday at 6:00 PM she stopped everything to listen to its broadcasts.

<p>
The National Spiritual Assembly of Bahai's of the United States officially expressed its appreciation to the VOA for keeping the Teheran regime of Iran aware of America's commitment to the cause of the Bahai's human rights.

<p>
The representative of the Dalai Lama recently contrasted the truth of the VOA to the propaganda from the People's Republic of China media to Tibet.  He wrote, "The Voice of America's Tibetan Language News Service is the only independent source of news for the Tibetan speaking areas of the world."

<p>
What would our State Department say to Cuba, Burma, Iraq, Iran, North Korea, Vietnam, Serbia, and Libya as it directs the Voice of America?  What would it say to Tibet?

<p>
There are areas of the USIA that I believe can be eliminated without risk.  The Fulbright scholarship programs should not be part of the workings of the federal government and the exchange programs should be served by private institutions.  But the USIA's libraries in 130 countries, its publications, its films and television programs and, of course, the Voice of America, are invaluable allies of those who want to know what the United States is all about, and what liberty is all about, and what truth is all about.

<p>
The 104th Congress is magnificently doing what has not been done since the birth of our nation. Its members, like our Founders, are acting against political nature by giving power to the states, the localities, and the people.  James Madison wrote that the federal government's duties "will be exercised principally on external objects," meaning foreign affairs.  The power now being surrendered by our federal government in foreign affairs will, of course, not revert to the states, the localities, and the people, as it will in domestic affairs.  

<p>
If the USIA is stripped of its influence, that power will not go to the people of California, Iowa, Kentucky, Montana, and Delaware.  It will go to Kim Jong Il, Mu'ammar el-Qaddafi, Fidel Castro, Hafez al-Assad, and Deng Xiaoping.

   <H1>Restoring  Conservative  Unity</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn</H3>

</center>

The radical change of the 1994 election was produced by a unity of conservatives as strong as in the days of Reagan.  All the elements of the Reagan coalition functioned together magnificently in the congressional races and a forty-year lock on the Congress was broken.  Economic and social conservatives stood arm in arm.

<p>
Now, that harmony strains and threatens to break.  Last week, a long report on the <i>McNeil-Lehrer News Hour</i> presented a parade of conservatives chastising one another and threatening to break ranks.  Social conservatives threaten to walk away from the coalition if the moral agenda is not given priority.  Economic conservatives claim that religious zealots are attempting to control politics in the name of a faith they do not share.  Of course, the liberal journalist reported all of this with delight.

<p>
The correspondent for <i>McNeil-Lehrer</i> drew the obvious conclusion:  If this division deepens, the chances of the new majority will be ended.  Real reform requires an enduring majority, a majority broadly-based and stable over time. 	

<p>
The warning signs are then apparent, and we can avoid the danger they portend only if we recover the foundation upon which all stable majorities in America must stand.  That foundation lies among the simple truths that were the basis of our country at the beginning.  When our nation stood upon that foundation, no one divided the "economic" from the "social"  issues, and no one fought about the difference between them.

<p>
These simple truths are the central principles of our country.  They address themselves to our status as human beings and citizens, and cover all of our rights and all of our duties. Conservatives should understand that these principles apply just as much and in the same way to the economic as to the social issues, and just as much to the protection of the family as to the defense of private property.  

<p>
These truths receive their finest expression in the Declaration of Independence, where they are described as certain "self evident truths."  They stem from something called "the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God."  What are these truths, and what are these laws?  They have a lot to do with common sense.  They tell us that we are free and equal citizens.  They tell us that we are on the one hand entitled to our liberty and on the other responsible for our own actions.

<p>
First of all, these principles provide the strongest foundation in history for what we now call "economic liberty."  The authors of the Declaration and of the Constitution assert this belief with simple eloquence.  Thomas Jefferson wrote in 1812 that "To take from one, because it is thought his own industry and that of his fathers has acquired too much, in order to spare to others, who...have not, exercised equal industry and skill, is to violate arbitrarily the first principle of association, the guarantee to everyone the free exercise of his industry and the fruits acquired by it."  In the <i>Federalist</i>, James Madison writes that the "chief object of government" is to "protect the different and unequal faculties of acquiring property."

<p>
The right to property is then a sacred right, no less firmly established than the right to speak one's mind or worship God in one's own time and way.  The right to property gives a vital assurance that these other rights can be secured.

<p>
What do these principles say about the importance of moral behavior?  Consider the Virginia Bill of Rights and its assertion "That no free government, or the blessings of liberty, can be preserved to any people, but by a firm adherence to justice, moderation, temperance, frugality, and virtue, and by frequent recurrence to fundamental principles."  

<p>
A conservative movement built upon these ideas would then encourage moral behavior.  It would reform the welfare system for example, because it encourages young women to conceive children out of wedlock.  It would not tax more heavily those who are married than those who are not.  It should support the authority and responsibility of parents over children and the obligations of husband and wife.

<p>
A conservative movement united upon the ideas of the founding would also encourage religion.  George Washington affirmed the importance of religion during his farewell address when he said that "Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports...reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle."  

<p>
A conservative policy on religion would respect the freedom to practice any religion that encourages good citizenship.  It would not supplant the role of religious and other charities in social welfare.  It would encourage prayer in school and upon public occasions.

<p>
A conservative movement united under these policies would act under the principles of our founding.  It would adhere to the Constitution and those higher laws, the laws of nature and of nature's God, upon which that Constitution stands.  

<p>
Such a conservative unity can lead America from its troubles.  Such a unity can be built only by a people who know as well as Jefferson the meaning of their country, and who fight as bravely as Washington for its principles.

Liberal Republicans in the Senate are at it again, doing their best to derail the conservative
revolution -- and if you don't call or write today, they'll get away with it!<p>

Senator Arlen Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, has introduced and passed an appropriations
bill for the Departments of Labor and Health and Human Services that reverses the hard-fought
gains we made during House consideration of the measure last month.  <p>

The bill as it came out of the House was the single most dramatic example of the conservative
revolution at work.  Among other things, the House version of the Labor-HHS appropriations
bill:<p>
<ul>
     <li>Ended welfare for lobbyists by placing new restrictions on taxpayer funding for political
     advocacy groups;<br>
    <li> Terminated funding for the Office of the Surgeon General;<br>
     <li>Ended taxpayer financing of abortions through Medicaid;<br>
     <li>Abolished the liberal Goals 2000 Program;<br>
    <li> Overturned President Clinton's executive order barring the use of striker replacements by
     federal contractors;<br>
    <li> Established tough new restrictions on the regulatory authority of OSHA and the NLRB.<br>
</ul>
But Senator Specter stopped the train in its tracks!<p>

Senator Specter -- who has a lifetime ACU rating of just 39, making him the 4th most liberal
Republican in the Senate -- decided to sabotage the work of his party's members in the House,
and refused to even consider any of these tough legislative riders.<p>

As you read this, the Specter version of the appropriations measure may already have passed the
full Senate -- but it's not over yet, because the two competing versions will still have to be
reconciled in a House-Senate Conference Committee.<p>

Call,  write or fax Senator Specter today, and let him know what you think of his arbitrary and
capricious decision to abandon his party's principles and support higher spending, more
regulation, and other failed liberal policies.<p>

You can reach him at:<br><br>

     SENATOR ARLEN SPECTER<br>
     530 Hart Senate Office Building<br>
     Washington, D.C.  20510-Concord, N.H. 03301<br>
     Phone:  (202) 224-4254   FAX (202) 224-1893<br><br>

Or, if you'd like, email your thoughts directly to the Senator at <a href="mailto:Specter@bizserve.com">Specter@bizserve.com</a>
<p>

Remember, it's not too late to act -- but to have an impact on this debate, you must call or write
Senator Specter today!<p>

Tell him you want him to support the original House-passed language in the Labor-HHS
appropriations bill.  Demand that he do his part to further the progress of the conservative
revolution, and overturn four decades' worth of failed liberal policies.<p>

Call or write Senator Specter TODAY and let him know just you think about his decision to
become a turncoat Republican.<p>

Together, we can fight Senator Specter's plan to let business as usual reign on in Washington. 
We'll keep putting the pressure on him here in Washington, but we need the help of good
conservatives like you to make it work at the grass-roots level.  <p>

So contact Senator Specter TODAY, and we'll be able to get a good, tough Labor-HHS
appropriations bill, like the one they originally passed in the House.<p>


Remember -- Senator Specter is running for President. If he has a campaign office in your state,
call there, too.<p>

   <H1><i>United States v. Lopez</i></H1>
   <h2>Restoring a Constitutionally Limited Government</h2>
   <H3>By Edward J. Erler</H3>

</center>

<p>
For the first time in more than sixty years, the Supreme Court has put restrictions on Congress' 
use of the Commerce Clause.  Under the Constitution, Congress is delegated the exclusive power 
to regulate Commerce with foreign nations, and among the states.  Since the New Deal 
revolution, the Supreme Court has allowed Congress to regulate those purely state and local 
matters that substantially affect commerce between states either directly or indirectly.  


<p>
Accordingly, in <i>Wickard v. Filburn</i> (1942) the Court upheld a fine assessed against a farmer who 
planted 12 acres of wheat in excess of the allotment permitted under the federal Agricultural 
Adjustment Act of 1938, even though the excess wheat was used only for private consumption.  
As the Court noted, the wheat supplied a need of the man who grew it which would otherwise be 
fulfilled by purchases in the open market.  Homegrown wheat in this sense competes with wheat 
in commerce.  


<p>
In the intervening years, the Court has routinely deferred to the judgment of Congress whether 
the regulated activity, although on its face not obviously related to interstate commerce, 
nonetheless substantially affected interstate commerce.  The result has been a tremendous 
expansion of centralized federal power over the states.  


<p>
The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>United States v. Lopez</i> signals that Congress may no 
longer have unlimited discretion to expand its power under the Commerce Clause.


<p>
At issue in <i>Lopez</i> was a challenge to the Gun Free School Zones Act of 1990, which made it a 
federal offense for any individual to possess a firearm at a place that the individual knows is a 
school zone.  Almost all states have laws prohibiting guns in or near schools, and in the Lopez 
case a state indictment was dismissed in order for federal charges to be brought.  


<p>
Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for a 5-4 majority, declared the act unconstitutional because it 
neither regulates a commercial activity nor contains a requirement that the possession be 
connected in any way to interstate commerce.  In oral argument, the government maintained that 
the presence of guns in schools so disrupts the quality of education that economic activities are 
affected.  Future citizens will be less educated and consequently less productive; the cumulative 
affect on the nation's economic well being will thus be  substantial.


<p>
The danger of accepting such a weak causal argument was pointed out by the Chief Justice.  It 
would allow Congress to regulate <i>any</i> activity that it found was related to the economic 
productivity of individual citizens; including family law (marriage, divorce, and child custody).  
Indeed, the Chief Justice rightly concluded that under the Government's theory it would be 
difficult to perceive any limitation on federal power, even in areas such as criminal law 
enforcement or education where states historically have been sovereign.


<p>
The appropriate constitutional argument was detailed in Justice Thomas' incisive concurring 
opinion.  Thomas noted that in adopting the substantial affects test the Court has drifted far from 
the original understanding of the Commerce Clause.  Indeed, taken to its logical extreme, the 
substantial affects test would give Congress police power over all aspects of American life.  


<p>
Thomas notes that the Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence comes close to turning the Tenth 
Amendment on its head.  The Tenth Amendment generally reserves the powers not delegated to 
the federal government to the states or to the people.  This is a confirmation of the fact that the 
Federal Government is limited to the exercise of constitutionally delegated powers or to those 
that are reasonably inferred to be a necessary and proper exercise of delegated powers.  


<p>
As Thomas rightly points out, the Commerce Clause that emerged from the New Deal revolution 
allows Congress to exercise all powers not specifically prohibited, thus reversing the federal 
relationship contemplated by the Framers of the Constitution.  The New Deal interpretation of 
the Commerce Clause was explicitly calculated to allow the federal government to extend and 
magnify the reach of its regulatory powers.  


<p>
<i>Lopez</i> is a welcome reevaluation of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause, and it may 
well presage the beginning of a series of decisions that will reestablish the federal relationship as 
envisioned by the Framers.  The threat posed to the administrative state by the Court's decision 
may be gauged by President Clinton's frantic reaction.  Not only has the President severely 
criticized the <i>Lopez</i> decision, but he has also ordered the Attorney General to find a way around 
the ruling!

   <H1>How to Beat the Supreme Court on School Prayer</H1>
   <H3>By Harry V. Jaffa</H3>

</center>

"We are a religious people, whose institutions presuppose a Supreme Being."

<p>
There is no better way to confirm the truth of the foregoing aphorism of the late Justice William O. Douglas, 
than to take a tour through the state constitutions.  Forty-seven of the fifty states have preambles invoking the 
name of Almighty God.  A joint resolution of the Congress could declare that children in public schools might 
lawfully recite voluntary prayers employing only such acknowledgment of divine power and goodness as is 
present in their own state constitution, or in the constitutions of any of the other states.  When this resolution is 
signed by the President--and it is difficult to imagine any reason to object to it--it could take effect 
immediately.  It is also difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court could take exception to such a resolution.  
To do so would not only put it in direct opposition to the elected branches of government, but also would 
require it, in effect, to declare the state constitutions unconstitutional!


<p>
Consider the perfectly nonsectarian piety embodied in the fundamental laws of the states:

<blockquote><i>We the people of Alabama, in order to establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, and to secure the blessing 
of liberty to ourselves and our posterity, invoking the favor and guidance of Almighty God, do ordain and 
establish the following Constitution and form of government . . .</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>We the people of the State of California, grateful to Almighty God for our freedom, in order to secure and 
perpetuate its blessings, do establish this Constitution.</i>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>The people of Connecticut, acknowledging with gratitude the good providence of God, in having permitted them 
to enjoy a free government . . .</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
This selection should be sufficient to illustrate the consistency in the patterns of all the preambles. Who could 
ask more in a school prayer than to acknowledge that it is through Divine Providence that we enjoy our civil 
and religious liberty, and that we reaffirm our faith in and constant reliance upon God to preserve and 
perpetuate it?


<p>
It is notable that the state constitutions have provisions equivalent to the "no establishment" and "free exercise" clauses of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.  One example that will suffice for present 
purposes is that of California:

<blockquote>
<i>Free exercise and enjoyment of religion without discrimination or preference are guaranteed.  This liberty of conscience does not
excuse acts that are licentious or inconsistent with the peace and safety of the State.  The legislature shall make no law respecting the establishment of religion.</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
From this it is apparent that the people of the states have seen no inconsistency between the guarantees of 
religious freedom in their constitutions, and the expressions of gratitude to God for the enjoyment of that 
freedom in the same constitutions.

<p>
American constitutions whether federal or state, rest ultimately upon the theology of the Declaration of 
Independence.  This fact has been obscured by the domination of a legal positivism which is simply unable to 
understand the relationship between natural and divine law on the one hand, and human law on the other.  Yet 
this relationship was axiomatic for our Founding Fathers.  If however we ask why we have an obligation--that 
is to say, a moral duty--to obey the laws, either of our State, or of the United States, there is only one answer.  
It is because those laws exist "to secure these rights," rights with which we have been "endowed by [our] 
Creator."  Constitutional governments have no other purpose but to render valuable rights whose origin is 
altogether independent of human will, rights which are unalienable because they are fixed eternally in "the laws 
of nature and of nature's God."  Through the ages many governments which did not respect the rights of the 
individual have claimed to be based upon the consent of the governed.  But the consent of the governed 
required by our republican constitutions is derived from the equal and unalienable rights of each human person.


<p>
Legal positivists deny to the Declaration any role in constitutional interpretation.  However, according to the 
United States Code, adopted by the Congress, it is the first of the Organic Laws of the United States.  That this 
is not merely formal or ceremonial is shown by the fact that every enabling act by the Congress for the 
admission of a State to the Union since the Civil War has had the following provision.  


<p>
<blockquote>
<i>The Constitution of the State of ______ shall always be republican in form and shall not be repugnant to the 
Constitution of the United States and the principles of the Declaration of Independence.</i>
</blockquote>


<p>
It can be seen that the rights secured to us by the human law, whether of the states or of the United States, are 
means of implementing antecedent rights whose origin is in a Supreme Being.  It is difficult to imagine how we 
can teach citizenship to future citizens, without inculcating in them an understanding of and a reverence for this 
origin.

<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  There are 13 appropriations bills that fund U.S. government agencies and pro-grams.  These bills are voted on annually, and they originate in the House of Representatives.  During the Clinton administration, federal money has been used directly or indirectly for abortion through various appropriations.  The 104th Congress, however, has the opportunity to delete this funding or restore previous restrictions on tax dollars paying for abortion.  Also, the House Leadership has instructed the appropriations subcommittees to cut funding for programs that have not been "reauthorized" or approved by separate legislative committees.  For example, the Title X family planning program has not been reauthorized since 1985, but it continues to receive funding through the appropriations process.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The chairman of the powerful House Appropriations Committee is Rep. Bob Livingston (R-LA).  However, legislative action takes place first in various Appropriations subcommittees that have jurisdiction over the particular department or programs.  The sub-committee chairman plays a key role and can include the desired language in the subcommittee "mark", or bill.  A subcommittee version goes to the full committee for consideration and then to the House floor.  The key subcommittees and chairmen are:  Labor/HHS/Education (Rep. John Porter [R-Ill.]); Treasury, Postal Service, General Government (Rep. Jim Lightfoot [R-Iowa]); and District of Columbia (Rep. Jim Walsh [R-N.Y.]).
	<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Since the government's new fiscal year begins on October 1, these bills will be in the forefront during the next few months.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  
<P>
<UL> 
<LI>The current Hyde amendment applies only to programs under the jurisdiction of the Department of Health and Human Services, such as Medicaid.  The Hyde language was "expanded" in 1993 to include payment for abortions in the case of rape and incest.  The fiscal year 1995 Labor/HHS bill contained this language.
<P>
<LI>A key issue to be decided will be language introduced by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) that blocks the Clinton administration's interpretation of the "expanded" Hyde language.  Under that interpretation, the state pays for poor women's abortions whenever the abortionist claims the pregnancy resulted from rape or incest.  Many states have stricter policies, allowing payment only in the case where the mother's life is endangered.  Rep. Istook tried to offer this corrective amendment during the "first 100 days" of Congress, but was persuaded not to and was promised a vote later in the year.
<P>
<LI>Also, attempts will be made to cut funding via the National Institutes for Health for human fetal tissue research, human embryo research, and RU-486 research.  Furthermore, Rep. Tom DeLay may offer an amendment to eliminate Title X family planning, which funds Planned Parenthood and distributes contraceptives to teens without parental permission.   The Senate Budget Resolution recommended defunding the Office of Surgeon General.  If the Appropriations Committee follows through, Dr. Henry Foster will have no job as Surgeon General, whether or not he is confirmed by the Senate. 
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 appropriations for Treasury, Postal Service, and General Government did not contain language prohibiting participating health plans from paying for Federal employees' abortions through the Federal Employees Health Benefits (FEHBP) program.  FEHBP provides health care benefits for 9 million federal employees.  The government (taxpayers) pays about 60 percent of the cost and the employee pays the rest.  In previous years, the Smith/Ashbrook amendment had been attached which restricted FEHBP-participating health plans from funding abortion.  This language should be reinstated.
<P>
<LI>The Fiscal Year 1995 District of Columbia appropriations contains a prohibition on the use of  "federal" funds to pay for abortions, which is meaningless, since DC can use "local"  funds.  These funds are commingled with federal funds since DC's funds are appropriated by the U.S. Congress.  Language is needed to ban all congressionally appropriated funds, both "federal" and "local," for abortion on demand in the nation's capital, a city where the number of abortions is comparable to the number of live births.
</UL><P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Majority support should be there for these appropriations bills in the House, but that will not be the case in the Senate.  In the first test vote on abortion in the House on May 24, the pro-life position (an amendment offered to the foreign aid bill by Rep. Chris Smith) prevailed by 59 votes.  President Clinton must sign the appropriations bills if he wants the money to run the government for fiscal year 1996.  

<P>
<LI><B> Prohibit D & X Abortions</B>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To ban a particularly heinous method used to perform late-term "partial birth" abortions carried out on unborn children as early as 20 weeks of gestation and as late as 32 weeks.   
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), Chairman of the House Subcommittee on the Constitution, along with Judiciary Committee Chairman Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will introduce legislation in early June to ban "partial birth" abortions, or as they are more commonly known, "dilation and extraction" or "D & X" abortions.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Subcommittee on the Constitution held a hearing on June 15 which focused on the D & X abortion procedure, fetal pain, and a constitutional analysis of the legislation.   
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  American Medical News, (July 5, 1993) devoted a front-page article to the gruesome D & X abortion procedure.  The article explained the step-by-step procedure.  First, the unborn baby's legs are pulled into the birth canal.  Next, the abortionist delivers the baby's entire body, except for the head.  The abortionist jams scissors into the baby's head, inserts a catheter and sucks the brains out.  The dead baby is then "evacuated."  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  As a starting point, this legislation seeks to build public support for further prohibitions and an ultimate ban on all elective (non-life-of-the-mother) abortions.  While specifically intending to prohibit late-term abortions, this legislation and corresponding Congressional hearings will educate the public about the humanity of the unborn child and the horror of abortion.  Sadly, this basic public education is still greatly needed.  There should be widespread support for this measure, although some will argue that abortion is legal and that this is not a common procedure because late-term abortions are "rare."
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Retain Forced-Abortion Asylum Policy </H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Language included in the pending foreign aid and State Department reauthorization bill (H.R. 1561) would reinstate a Reagan-Bush policy that provided asylum to those who can prove a well-founded fear of persecution for resisting the People's Republic of China's grotesque and coercive population control program. 
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) added this language to the foreign aid bill when it was before the International Operations and Human Rights Subcommittee in May.  Rep. Smith is the subcommittee chairman.  The provision remained intact throughout the full committee's deliberations and became part of the foreign aid bill, known as the American Overseas Interests Act (H.R. 1561), to be considered by the House of Representatives. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Col.) will likely seek to delete this key provision on the House floor when the House resumes consideration of H.R. 1561.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Despite fears by some anti-immigration groups that the number of immigrants entering this country will soar, it is important to note that from 1987 through 1993, when the forced-abortion asylum policy was in effect, less than 200 people per year were granted asylum on these grounds.  This is a humanitarian policy and should be reinstated.  President Clinton revoked this pro-life policy soon after he took office.  This policy has real implications for Chinese families living in the U.S. who face imminent deportation and persecution, if it is not adopted quickly.  On Good Friday (April 14), the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) moved 13 Chinese women to a deportation holding center in Bakersfield, Calif.  Five of these women had fled China after being forced to have abortions.  Others had been forcibly sterilized, or had escaped after being ordered to undergo abortions and/or sterilization.  It appears that their deportation is imminent unless Congress passes H.R. 1561 with the forced-abortion asylum provision intact.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The anti-immigration lobbyists are stirring up some fears, but the fact that a militantly "pro-choice" Member of Congress (Rep. Patricia Schroeder) is their champion undercuts their ability to appeal to the pro-life majority in the House.  Rep. Schroeder will be hard-pressed to explain why she isn't more sensitive to the fact that Chinese women don't have any "choice" about abortion.  However, President Clinton has threatened to veto H.R. 1561 for other reasons, mainly because it significantly cuts foreign aid.  If the House cannot override the veto, Rep. Smith would have to find another vehicle to enact the forced-abortion asylum policy.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $5,000 Adoption Tax Credit </H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to reduce some of the financial obstacles associated with adopting a child.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $5,000 adoption tax credit was a primary component of the House GOP's Contract with America.  The provision -- adapted from Rep. Chris Smith's (R-N.J.) Omnibus Adoption Act, H.R. 1066 -- was passed by the House as part of H.R. 1215, the tax cuts package sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and unveiled before an FRC audience.
<P>
<B> BUDGET RESOLUTIONS</B>:  In order to make the $5,000 adoption tax credit a reality, the provision must be included in the budget for each fiscal year.  The first step in that process is the budget resolution, which serves as a blueprint for the appropriating of funds in the final budget.  The House recently passed an historic budget resolution for fiscal year 1996, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio).  The resolution balances the budget by the year 2002, and includes the $5,000 adoption tax credit in its proposed tax cuts.
<P>
In contrast, the Senate's budget resolution would balance the budget by 2002 but failed to include the adoption tax credit (or any other tax cuts).  Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) tax relief amendment (which included the adoption tax credit) was defeated by a vote of 69-31.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House and Senate versions of the budget resolutions will now be melded together to produce one budget known as reconciliation.  It remains to be seen whether the $5,000-per-child adoption tax credit will be maintained in the final version.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  This provision would make adoption a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing them to receive a tax credit of up to $5,000 for quali-fied adoption expenses, including adoption fees, court costs, and attorney fees, among others.  This provision is important because it reduces the financial obstacles that might otherwise hinder middle- and low-income families from adopting.  [The average cost of an adoption is between $10,000 and $15,000.]  It is also an important step in encouraging the adoption choice -- a choice which benefits the birth mother, the adopted child, and the adoptive parents.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Much depends upon the reconciliation of the two budget resolution versions.  If the Senate and, most especially, the members of the House-Senate conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for the passage of the $5,000 adoption tax credit.
<CENTER><H3> Coercive Abortion Training Threatens Accreditation of Hospitals </H3></CENTER>
<P>
On February 14, 1995 the 23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents expressing moral and/or religious objections to abortion would, presumably, be able to opt out of the abortion training, but common sense suggests that they will face strong pressure to undergo the new "standard" training.  Medical schools with a religious affiliation that oppose abortion would not be required to provide abortion training directly, but they would be required to arrange for such training for those students who do not object.  Many religious medical schools currently reject any affiliation whatsoever with abortion providers.  
<P>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing their accreditation.   However, over the last 20 years, the number of medical schools offering elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In 1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either on a routine or optional basis.  In 1991, 68.8 percent of medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training.  About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or legal reasons. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) plans to offer legislation in June that would reverse this coercive directive.  The legislation would "protect individuals, entities and programs from discrimination on the basis of their refusal to be trained, to train, or to arrange for training in the performance of induced abortion."  Senator Dan Coats (R-Ind.) is prepared to introduce similar legislation in the Senate. 
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House Economic and Educational Opportunities Oversight and Investigations subcommittee examined this issue during a hearing on June 14.  Witnesses included several medical directors of OB/GYN departments at public universities or hospitals who oppose the new requirement and a representative from ACGME.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Congressional action is necessary to reverse this coercive policy.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement (from Medicare and Medicaid) for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified as competent in their specialties.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS:  </B> Rep. Hoekstra's legislation may be attached as an amendment to health care legislation, such as the Health Professions Education Consolidation and Reauthorization Act.

</CENTER><P><CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Disestablishing the U.S. Education Department</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Education has been traditionally -- and constitutionally -- a responsibility of states and localities.  But since the U.S. Education Department was founded in 1979, it has followed the iron law of bureaucracies, seeking to expand its range and influence.  Legislation is needed to take educational decisions from the hands of federal bureaucrats and return them to parents, teachers, and communities.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 24, 1995, the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill was introduced.  This bill's main sponsors are Joe Scarborough (R-Fla.), Steve Chabot (R-Ohio), 
and John Boehner (R-Ohio).  Members of the House Education Task Force are among the cosponsors.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Within one year of passage, this bill would shut down the U.S. Education Department.  Many programs, including Goals 2000, would be repealed, while general funding for elementary/secondary and higher education would be converted to two block grants for the states.  The only stipulation is that 98 percent of a state's block grant be passed on to the local level.  Authorization for the block grants would last just three years, at which time the bill proposes that a tax cut for families replace the block grants.  A few functions of the Department would be transferred to more appropriate agencies:  Impact Aid to the Department of Defense, Indian Education to the Department of the Interior, Civil Rights to the Department of Justice, Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and student loan programs to the Department of Health and Human Services.  The proposal goes beyond talk of shuffling offices and putting a new sign on the door; it takes a serious step towards removing the federal government from our schools.  The proposed tax cut would further reduce the government's influence over education.  Increased revenue for parents would empower them to make more decisions about their children's education.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  President Bill Clinton has already promised the National Education Association (NEA) that he would "remember who put me here."  He will clearly veto legislation that eliminates the NEA's primary representative in the federal government, the Education Department.  However, the executive office cannot authorize expenditures which have not been appropriated by the House.  The House Republican Budget Resolution zeroes out funding for the U.S. Education Department by 2002.  That improves the prospects for the Back to the Basics Education Reform Bill.
<P>


<P>
<CENTER><H3> Getting Back to the Basics:  Repealing Goals 2000</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Ignoring parental pleas for education to get "back to the basics," the 103rd Congress adopted Goals 2000, a program which further centralized education, increased bureau-cracy, and added a host of new non-academic programs.  It was described by supporters as a new pattern for local-state-federal partnership in education.  The debate has now shifted to limiting the federal role in education.  Goals 2000, representing the height of federal intrusiveness into schools, should be the first program to be dismantled.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  On May 10, Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) offered an amendment in 
the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee to repeal Goals 2000.  The committee did not vote on the motion at that time, but Rep. Graham plans to raise the issue again later this year.  That same day, the committee voted in favor of H.R. 1045, a bill to abolish the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC), which was created by 
Goals 2000.  Opportunities Committee chairman Bill Goodling (R-Penn.) is sponsoring the bill. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  H.R. 1045 was introduced on February 24, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The House passed H.R. 1045 soon after the bill was reported out of committee.  Legislation to remove the opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards from the law may be introduced later this summer.  A bill to repeal the whole law should appear later this year.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  NESIC would have functioned much like a national school board by reviewing and certifying state and national standards.  There is a general consensus that this is an inappropriate function for the federal government.  OTL standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing inputs into education, which requires increased spending.  We know that spending does not drive academic performance.  OTL standards should be removed from the law.  However, the Goals 2000 agenda will carry on as long as block grants to states continue.  Education reform at this historic moment calls for a reduction in the role of the federal government in American schools and a return to the traditional role of school:  teaching students the basics like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals 2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation and spending.     
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  H.R. 1045 should see minimal opposition, but the U.S. Education Department will fight fiercely to maintain its new conduit for imposing policy on the local school:  Goals 2000.  But the department is on the defensive.  Gov. George Allen of Virginia has announced that he will not accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  Across the nation, parents are outraged by the implentation of Goals 2000 in their local schools.  The U.S. Education Department's new partnership has turned against them:  it is being attacked from all sides -- federal, state, and local.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Promote Parental Choice in Education </H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  As evidence of the academic failure of our monopoly public school system mounts, legislation is needed to help parents choose a safe, academically successful public, private, religious or home school for their children. 
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) have introduced S. 618, a bill to spend $30 million on 10-20 demonstration projects.  It would allow low-income parents of students in inner-city schools to choose among public, private, and religious schools.  In addition, FRC is considering alternative legislation to grant a tax credit to parents who choose private, religious or home schools or who select a public school different from the one to which their children have been assigned. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  March 24, 1995 (Coats-Lieberman).
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Coats-Lieberman is in committee. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Sens. Coats and Lieberman offered this legislation in the 103rd Congress.  It was narrowly defeated in the Senate last year (52-41).  Their proposal has since gained the interest and support of prominent columnists, such as neoconservative Ben Wattenberg and E.J. Dionne, writer for the liberal Washington Post.  The purpose of the bill is to fund what are called demonstration projects.  Sponsors believe that when poor parents choose schools, the evidence we gain from this experiment will be so positive and so compelling as to clinch the argument for parental choice in education.  Because this bill would benefit low-income, inner-city students, who are disproportionately minority children, its backers believe that the idea will overwhelm the usual liberal case against parental choice.  Advocates of the public school monopoly generally argue that parental choice in education is elitist, that it will "re-segregate" the public schools, that private and religious schools merely "skim off" the best students.  Some pro-family advocates, however, argue that the Coats-Lieberman bill would expand the federal role in education at a time when the goal of dis-establishing the U.S. Education Department is a higher priority.  A better solution at the federal level may be tuition tax credits.  FRC is considering legislation which would allow all parents to retain a portion of their earnings for the purpose of selecting safe, excellent schools for their children.  This legislation would enable parents to select among public, private, religious or home schools.  It would protect the integrity of independent schools since there would be no cash transfer from the government to the schools. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Despite arranging for quality private schools for their own children, Bill Clinton and Al Gore will vigorously oppose parental choice legislation which includes non-public schools.  Coats-Lieberman therefore faces a veto threat.  Tuition tax credit legislation would face a gauntlet of liberal opposition and senators who stubbornly regard any family tax relief as a "giveaway,"  but it could benefit by being referred to a more friendly committee.

<CENTER><H3> Adopt the $500 Per-Child Tax Credit</H3>
</CENTER><P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit is a pro-family measure that would help to relieve some of the tax burden on parents.  It enjoys strong support in the House, but has weaker support in the Senate.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The $500 per-child tax credit was an integral part of the American Dream Restoration Act, the "crown jewel" of the Contract with America, which passed as part of H.R. 1215 (sponsored by Rep. Bill Archer [R-Tex.]).  The credit is non-refundable (meaning that it only reduces taxes; it does not provide cash welfare to those with no tax liability).  This serves to target the bulk of the tax savings to middle-income families in the 15 percent tax bracket.
<P>
The House recently passed its fiscal year 1996 resolution, sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio), to balance the budget by the year 2002, and it includes the $500 per-child credit in its proposed tax cuts.  The Senate's resolution, though it also balances the budget by 2002, included no tax cuts, as Sen. Phil Gramm's (R-Tex.) amendment to add the per-child tax credit to the budget resolution was rejected in the Senate.  It remains to be seen whether or not the $500 per-child tax credit will survive once these budget resolutions are melded into one budget by the two houses.   
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The fate of the $500 per-child tax credit is uncertain.  While Sen. Gramm's amendment to the budget resolution was defeated, Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole has indicated that he intends to secure a significant per-child tax credit in the budget resolution conference committee meeting with the House.  In addition, Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) and Sen. Rod Grams (R-Minn.) have pledged to offer amendments on the Senate floor calling for the $500 per-child tax credit if the Senate Finance Committee, headed by Sen. Robert Packwood (R-Oreg.), continues to balk at offering pro-family tax relief.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  FRC has been calling on Congress to adopt pro-family tax relief for many years.  Today, the average family of four contributes 25 cents on every dollar in income taxes and payroll taxes to the U.S. government, compared to 2 cents on every dollar in 1950.  In light of this, the per-child tax credit is designed to help offset the extraordinary erosion in per-child income tax benefits over the last half-century.  Passage of significant pro-child tax relief should be a top priority in the ensuing months of Congress.  
<P>
Streamlining government spending and permitting families to keep more of their own income -- for things like dental appointments and clothing purchases and electric bills -- benefits both the national economy and the personal economy of families.  Immediate pro-family tax relief should be a part of any government plan to balance the budget and make government more efficient.  In the months to come, it will be interesting to see if the Congress as a whole and the Senate in particular heard Americans last November and will give American families the opportunity to keep more of their own money.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  At this point, the fate of the per-child tax credit is uncertain.  However, if the Senate and, most especially, the members of the conference committee on the budget can be convinced of the importance of pro-family tax cuts, prospects are good for passage of the $500 per-child tax credit.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Broaden IRA Eligibility to Non-Employed Spouses</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  To help alleviate the financial burden on families in which one spouse stays at home.  Legislation to allow expansion of IRA benefits to non-employed spouses would help provide relief for families who choose to have one spouse stay at home and would recognize the important contribution that non-employed spouses make to the income production of employed spouses -- an acknowledgment commonly made in divorce settlements.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Family Reinvestment Act (H.R. 1040), introduced by Rep. Bill Baker (R-Calif.), allows full-time homemakers and wage-earning spouses a deductible IRA contribution 
of up to $2,500 each; this was passed in the House as part of the Contract with America.  (Furthermore, this legislation permits families to borrow from their IRA for education expenses or to buy a home, with the provision that the funds be paid back to the family with interest.)  Similar legislation, the IRA Equity Bill (S. 287), has been introduced in the Senate by Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex) and allows deductible contributions of up to $2,000 by non-employed spouses.  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  It is important that the Senate pass legislation to help relieve the tax burden on families.  The House bill was passed as part of the Contract with America.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Along with the attractive idea of expanding the uses of IRAs to help free-up family finances (e.g., penalty-free withdrawals to cover major housing, education, and health expenses) is the proposal to broaden the eligibility of IRA's to include non-employed spouses.  While broadening the eligibility of IRA's in general would primarily benefit upper-middle- and upper-income taxpayers, a more targeted broadening of the eligibility to non-employed spouses would provide relief primarily to middle-income families with children -- those most in need of pro-family tax relief.  Currently, two-earner couples can claim almost twice the benefits as single-earner couples, penalizing those families who choose to stay home with their children and ignoring the significant contribution the full-time homemaker makes to the income production of the employed spouse.  Passage of legislation to help level the playing field for single-earner families is a key step to providing relief to American families.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle for IRA benefits for non-employed spouses must be won in the Senate, as pro-family House legislation has been passed already.  It is crucial that the Senate give priority to measures that promote pro-family tax relief. 
Support Medical Savings Accounts
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In the ongoing effort to reform health care, it is important to support any positive measures which would make health care more cost-effective for families.  Medical savings accounts, or Medical IRAs, are one such measure.  Making the option of medical savings accounts available to employees and unemployed individuals would encourage more prudent use of health care dollars and promote greater family autonomy in health care decisions.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  Reps. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.) have formulated legislation promoting medical savings accounts.  The proposal would amend the existing tax laws to create cost-effective incentives for employers to offer, and for employees to choose, medical savings accounts.  Rep. Archer expects to introduce his bill in mid-June and has said that many of his colleagues in the House have expressed great interest in cosponsoring such legislation.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The bill is currently being "scored" by the Congressional Budget Office to see what impact, if any, the reform will have on the overall budget, e.g., whether it is budget-neutral,  whether it will save money, or whether it will require the allocation of additional federal funds.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Medical savings accounts (MSAs) are similar to individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in that pre-tax dollars up to a certain limit may be set aside for lower-level medical expenses to be controlled by and used by families.  MSAs usually supplement catastrophic health insurance coverage, helping to cover medical expenses before the insurance deductible is reached.  Because individuals are directly responsible for the use of their health care dollars, MSAs guard against the overutilization of health care services, thereby helping to curb skyrocketing health care costs.  Moreover, individuals reap the rewards of managing their health care dollars wisely and of practicing good habits, for any monies not spent by the end of the year may be kept by the individual as taxable income, or kept in the account for future health care needs.
<P>
MSAs also promote greater autonomy in health care choices.  Because MSA funds may be used toward any medical expenses, including those not expressly covered within the insurance deductible, an individual has more flexibility to choose health services and providers and more portability of coverage (i.e., ability to keep coverage even when changing jobs).
<P>
Furthermore, evidence indicates that MSAs work well.  Golden Rule Insurance company recently conducted a survey of their employees who are covered under MSA plans.  The results show that (1) MSA enrollees saved money and reduced overall health care spending, and that (2) MSA enrollees were highly satisfied with their plan -- fully 88 percent prefer the MSA plan to other health insurance plans they had in the past.
<P> 
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The idea of MSAs is not new; therefore, many members of Congress are already familiar with and support the concept.  MSAs should have a good chance of passage in the 104th Congress, especially considering the fact that MSAs were a key component in many Republicans' health care reform proposals last year.

<CENTER><H3> Implement the Gay Ban</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved with the passage of a law.  Wrong.  The Clinton Administration ignored the law when it wrote the implementing policies and lifted the ban anyway.  Now, the Administration is using the courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a case that will lose in the Supreme Court.  That's why new legislation is imperative.
<P>
Pentagon and Justice Department officials have told FRC that what we thought was an exclusion policy is really an accommodation policy which permits homosexuals to serve.   So far, Congress has ignored this swindle by failing to exercise its constitutional responsibility to enforce military regulations.
<P>
The Pentagon policy that took effect February 28, 1994 differs in several ways from the law it purportedly implements:
<P>
<UL><LI>The law carries the statement, "homosexuality is incompatible with military service."  The Clinton regulations omit it. 
<P>
<LI>The law forbids service by homosexuals.  The Clinton regulations permit service by homosexuals.  At least 15 avowed homosexuals are now serving openly.
<P>
<LI>The law relies on commander discretion to initiate investigations.  But the Clinton regulations create a "criminal-like" standard.  According to Secretary of Defense William Perry, if soldiers attend gay pride parades, frequent gay bars, and possess gay materials, this does not constitute "credible" evidence to initiate an inquiry.
<P>
<LI>Contrary to 200 years of military experience and practice, Clinton's Defense Department no longer acknowledges homosexual behavior as a marker for increased security risk.  Information discovered during a security investigation cannot be used without high-level political permission.
<P>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation at the point of admission and whenever appropriate, the Clinton Administration refuses to do so.</UL>
<P>
In the first court test of the new law, the Clinton Justice Department failed to use key arguments and called no witnesses.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District of New York ignored volumes of case law precedents and struck down the military's "don't ask, don't tell" policy.  The case is<I> Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.
<P>
The Justice Department did not bother to:
<P>
<UL><LI>Dispute biased research and testimony by "expert" pro-homosexual witnesses.
<P>
<LI>Present well-documented physical and psychological problems with homosexuality.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual "lifestyles" and "values" jeopardize morale and unit cohesion.
</UL><P>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP), with senior advisors former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas M. Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert H. Barrow, is lobbying Congress to amend the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.  Should the <I> Able </I>case be heard by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals before the law is changed, irreparable damage may be done.
<P>
FRC's MRP wants the following changes included in the 1996 Act:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to ask all potential recruits whether they are a homosexual or have engaged or intend to engage in homosexual acts.
<P>
<LI>Require the Secretary of Defense to revoke current policy and issue regulations consistent with the law.
</UL><P>
TheDefense Authorization Act will come to a final vote in early August.  Some members want to avoid another debate over homosexuals in the military and will try to torpedo any amend-ments.  However, without legislation the courts will have the final say on an issue which  constitutionally belongs to the Congress.  And the Clinton Administration will continue to keep more homosexuals in the military, thus undermining combat readiness, legal defense of the ban, and the moral fabric of the nation.  The stakes are extremely high.  If the military falls, federal power will be used to validate the rest of the homosexual agenda, including gay "marriage" and adoption of children.
<P>
Senators Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) and Dan Coats (R-Ind.) have both expressed concern and may take legislative action.

<CENTER><H3> Cable Porn</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Some cable TV operators include channels featuring pornographic material in their basic cable subscriptions.  This increases access to pornography, particularly by young people.    
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) introduced the Family Viewing Cable Television Act of 1995 (H.R. 1540) on May 2, 1995.  The bill forbids cable operators from including pornography in basic cable packages.  
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> H.R. 1540 is currently pending before the House Judiciary Committee but no hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Currently, many consumers are forced to accept channels featuring pornography as part of their basic cable package.  This makes it more difficult for them to protect their children.  The bill would secure the right of parents to keep their television safe for family viewing.  It would not outlaw pornographic material on cable television.  Rather, the bill would merely prohibit operators from automatically including it in basic cable packages.  Consumers wishing to have pornographic channels on their cable systems would be free to do so, but they would simply have to request them from their cable company.  
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The bill is facing opposition from industry lobbyists and advocates of unrestricted free speech.  Supporters may offer it as an amendment to another bill if hearings are not scheduled soon.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Promote Porn-Free Technology</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The growth of technology has created many exciting opportunities.  Unfortunately, it is also being used to expand access to pornography.  Many on-line computer networks such as the Internet operate largely unregulated and are a virtual no-man's land where material is exchanged without regard to laws on obscenity and indecency.  Legislation is needed to bring computer networks into compliance with obscenity and pornography laws.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The Communications Decency Act of 1995 (S. 314) introduced by Sen. Jim Exon (D-Neb.)  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  February 1, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> The bill has been incorporated as an amendment to the Telecommunications Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 (S. 652).  The telecommunications bill has been reported out of committee and is awaiting floor action. 
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Communications Decency Act amends current dial-a-porn laws regulating obscenity and indecency to include computer technology.  Without questioning Sen. Exon's intentions, many pro-family groups, including the Family Research Council, fear that the bill in its present form might actually create more problems than it solves.  Computer industry lobbyists have hit Sen. Exon hard, resulting in significant weakening of S. 314 since February.  FRC and other groups are working with Sen. Exon and other senators to develop a strong law that incorporates the original goals of  S. 314.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  FRC will continue to work with Sen. Exon to try to restore S. 314.  Meanwhile, several alternative proposals are in the works.  Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) intends to add an amendment to the telecommunications bill which would instruct Attorney General Janet Reno to "study" the problem of computer porn.  Sen. Leahy's approach is a do-nothing approach which pro-family groups will oppose.  If Sen. Exon's bill does not improve, parents might see help from Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.) or Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) who are working on solutions that are more in line with pro-family concerns.

<CENTER><H3> Military Profits from Pornography</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition for "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of Miller v. California.  At present, the services oppose removing so-called "soft" pornography from exchange shelves because of  the perceived threat of legal action from the American Civil Liberties Union.  
<P>
Obscenity was legally defined by the Supreme Court in the Miller v. California decision.  According to this ruling, something is obscene and therefore unprotected by the First Amendment when it satisfies the following criteria:
<P>
<UL> <LI>Taken as a whole, appeals to a prurient interest in sex.
<P>
<LI>Depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive manner.
<P>
<LI>Taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value.
</UL><P>
These criteria were written to protect freedom of speech and expression.  But there are kinds of speech and expression not protected by the Constitution: slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling "fire" in a crowded theater, copyright violations and child pornography.  The military has determined that certain "soft" pornographic material is protected (not obscene) and should be sold to uniformed patrons in government stores.
<P>
Pornography is sexually explicit material intended to arouse the consumer.  It is addictive and very often leads men to sexual crime.  This fact should persuade military leaders to judge wisely between two competing outcomes: the damage attributable to addictive pornographic material versus an ACLU lawsuit.  For now, the government is more fearful of an ACLU lawsuit.  
<P>
The government has much experience selling addictive merchandise to military patrons.  For example, it has sold alcohol, a potentially addictive substance, to servicemembers for most of the military's 200-year history.  Admittedly, most alcohol users avoid addiction, but enough do become addicts and they cost the services dearly -- productivity losses, personal injury, judicial expenses and property damage.
<P>
Pornographic material is much like alcohol; it is a very powerful stimulant.  The consumer begins with limited exposure -- "soft" pornography sold in military stores.  In some cases a  desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more explicit, more deviant images for the consumer to reach a previous level of sexual stimulation.  Gradually the addict is desensitized to the more explicit material.  Finally, he may act out sexually his pornographic fantasies prompted by the material.  These activities may include compulsive promiscuity, exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, having sex with children, rape, or sadism.
<P>
Serial killer Ted Bundy stated just before his execution for the sexual assault and murder of many women, "You are going to kill me, and that will protect society from me.  But out there are many, many more people who are addicted to pornography, and you are doing nothing about that."  Bundy blames his addiction to pornography for his mental state that led to his murdering as many as 31 women.
<P>
No pending legislation mandates the removal of pornographic materials from military exchange shelves, but President Clinton has the unilateral authority to do so.  Military consumers can purchase the material without the government's help.

<CENTER><H3> Combat Illegitimacy in Welfare Policy</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE:  </B> The current welfare system promotes family breakdown by guaranteeing a right to cash benefits even if one engages in irresponsible conduct.  Moreover, the bureaucratic arrangements that spring up to administer those benefits supplant voluntary organizations that offer real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.  Any legislation that attempts to reform welfare must end the entitlement status of numerous welfare programs, including AFDC cash benefits, and afford states the maximum flexibility to experiment with anti-poverty efforts that impose behavioral requirements (charitable alternatives, in particular).
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  House bill, H.R. 4, "The Personal Responsibility Act."  Senate floor action is expected.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  In March, the House passed The Personal Responsibility Act as part of its Contract with America.  The welfare reform bill will reach the Senate floor later this summer.  While the Senate Finance Committee did vote to eliminate the federal guarantee of cash assistance in favor of a strategy that "block grants" money to the states, the committee bill fails to ensure that illegitimacy remains a prominent focus of the debate on the floor.  The House bill, H.R. 4, included three essential provisions to strengthen families:  a prohibition on cash payments to mothers under age 18 who bear children out of wedlock; a freeze on benefits for mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and incentive bonus payments to states that reduce illegitimacy rates -- without increasing the number of abortions.  While the Senate bill does not include any of the essential provisions that were incorporated in the House bill, at least four senators have indicated that they will fight to restore the focus on family breakdown.  Family groups expect either Senator Bob Dole (R-Kans.) or Senator Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) to lead the  initiative.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot be regarded as a morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to promote such activity by subsidizing it.
<P>
"The task," Charles Murray concludes, is to "neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately, tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else."  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, though not sufficient, to restore the integrity of the family unit.  
<P>
Frances Perkins, chief architect of Franklin Roosevelt's welfare policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member of the Roosevelt Administration, because they rejected that intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  While Congress is almost certain to pass a welfare bill this session, the fate of the illegitimacy provisions is uncertain.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Zero Out Title X</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act was enacted in 1970 as a grant program to fund family planning projects throughout the country.  The program helped to spawn the proliferation of family planning clinics within states, granting federal sanction to the distribution of contraception to unmarried women and to minors without parental consent.  Having received over $193 million from taxpayers last year, funding for this unauthorized and failed program should be eliminated altogether.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Title X of the Public Health Service Act receives its funding through the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes before Congress for a vote every year.  Neither the House nor Senate budget resolutions included a proposal to zero out Title X funding.  However, House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Tex.) has promised to bring an amendment to the House floor to defund Title X if funding is not eliminated in committee.  Sen. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and his state's Congressional colleagues, Reps. Ernest Istook and Steve Largent, are also working to zero out Title X funding.
<P>
<B> STATUS:  </B> Efforts to defund Title X are in progress. The Labor/HHS Appropriations bill will be considered by Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The reasons to defund Title X are numerous.  First of all, Title X should not continue to receive funding because it is an unauthorized program.  Its authorization expired in 1985.  Secondly, Title X is duplicative.  Several other programs such as Medicaid and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant provide family planning to low-income and other targeted populations.  There is no clear basis for the federal government to run a categorical family planning program when state governments have the capability to set health care priorities within the parameters of an alternative block grant.  Finally and most importantly, Title X is a failed program.  Since the inception of Title X, out-of-wedlock births, abortions, and sexually-transmitted diseases have all risen dramatically, especially in the populations Title X is supposed to have targeted.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Expect a huge fight pitting pro-abortion, pro-contraception groups intent on saving Title X against pro-family, pro-life groups working to defund the program.  Because Planned Parenthood receives a good portion of Title X monies, expect them to launch a campaign to save the program.  Outcome of a floor fight is uncertain.
<P>
Another approach, which may or may not prevent a floor battle, could be far more effective.  Overall grant reform may eliminate Title X funding without targeting any specific program.  For example, Congress could pass a law saying that no funds shall be appropriated to any program unless that program is currently authorized.  This is a justifiable reform in light of the efforts to balance the budget and the recently passed law eliminating unfunded federal mandates to states.  Thus, Title X funding might be eliminated on the basis of its unauthorized status.  However, if such grant reform passes, it is probable that pro-abortion members of Congress may try to bring Title X up for reauthorization.  Prospects to successfully reauthorize Title X are slim.  However, without such grant reform, funds could still be appropriated to unauthorized programs.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Derail the AIDS Gravy Train</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The federal government, all told, is spending $7.1 billion on AIDS through several government agencies in fiscal 1995.  The Public Health Service alone spends about $2.9 billion yearly ($91,355 per AIDS death contrasted with $1,060 for every cancer death).  Other federal expenditures come from HUD, Social Security, Veterans Affairs, and the Agency for International Development.  Legislation is needed to bring AIDS spending in line with money spent on other terminal diseases such as cancer.  And AIDS funds should not go toward the promotion of homosexuality in the guise of  "AIDS education."  Time-tested epidemiological responses such as early diagnosis and partner tracing should be employed.
 <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Congress seems prepared to take a business-as-usual approach to AIDS.  On April 3, Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kans.) Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act (S. 641) provides $4.3 billion over the next five years, beginning in fiscal 1996, and allows for "such sums as may be necessary," a budget-busting possibility.  Other sponsors include Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Majority Leader Robert Dole (R-Kans.).  A House version was introduced by Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) on January 4, 1995.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Senate bill was passed out of the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has put a legislative hold on the bill.  No hearings have been scheduled.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Much AIDS money goes to legitimate activities, such as HIV research and care for AIDS victims.  A significant amount, however, goes to politically active groups that promote the radical homosexual agenda.  Congress needs to hold hearings to examine how the money has been used so far.  All funding to groups that promote homosexuality should be cut, leaving more money for groups that deal with AIDS in a medically responsible fashion.  Current AIDS education funding should be terminated, since the money is going toward promotion of condoms and the myth of  "safe sex" instead of documentably successful abstinence education.  And spending formulas should be changed:
<P><OL> 
<LI>Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive benefits.  Formulas based on "AIDS prevalence" distort funding needs, because they count the dead along with the living.  More of the money should go to under-served minority communities.
<P>
<LI>People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they currently live, not where they were diagnosed.  Someone might be diagnosed in a large city but return home elsewhere for care.
<P>
<LI>Means testing for AIDS dollars should be introduced.  Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with those who truly have no other means of payment.</OL>
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Fifty-five senators have signed on as sponsors, but hearings could result in positive changes.  Sen. Dole's role is pivotal if the bill's abuses are to be addressed.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Defund Federal Promotion of Homosexuality</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Clinton Administration mandated AIDS/Awareness Training for all Federal employees.  Some of this training is used to promote homosexuality.  Legislation is needed to defund this training.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS: </B>  S. 25 -- To stop the waste of taxpayer funds on activities by government agencies to encourage their employees or officials to accept homosexuality as a legitimate or normal lifestyle.  Sponsor: Senator Jesse A. Helms (R-N.C.)
<P>
H.R. 862 -- To prohibit the use of Federal funds to promote homosexuality.  Sponsor: Represent-ative Robert K. Dornan (R-Calif.)
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  H.R. 862 -- was introduced February 8, 1995, and was assigned to the Subcommittee for Human Resources and Intergovernmental Affairs of the Government Reform and Oversight Committee. 
<P>
S. 25 --  was introduced January 4, 1995, but is unlikely to be voted on until late summer or 
early fall.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Congressman Dornan's strategy is to amend all appropriations bills to include this language.  H.R. 862 will not likely be passed as a stand-alone bill, and thus, the Senate strategy is likely to be similar.
<P>
<B> OVERVIEW</B>:  President Clinton directed all federal departments to provide HIV/AIDS training.   According to many federal employees, the mandatory training promotes homosexuality and includes unnecessarily graphic explanations.  A Defense Department worker complained that her training included a slide show of  "sex toys" and flavored condoms.  Other workers were lectured that their grandmothers probably had engaged in sodomy as a form of birth control.
<P>
Two supervisors and 41 employees in the Federal Communication Commission's audio services division chose not to attend mandatory "AIDS Awareness Training."  An FCC employee stated, "The classes are basically an adult version of high school sex ed., with the modern-day sensitivity training thrown in."
<P>
Department of Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary created "Walkin' the Talk" AIDS training materials for three-hour, mandatory training sessions.  A memo from the Department's Federal Workplace HIV/AIDS Education Coordinator states, "All employees are required to complete this training."
<P>
The training includes a brief history of HIV and a discussion of symptoms, prevention, and risk reduction.  There also is a discussion of needle-sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing "safer sex" by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic wrap, and latex gloves.  The manual states, "A dental dam 
(a small, square piece of latex) or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal contact.  All types of barriers (condoms, dental dams, and plastic wrap) are effective against HIV transmission only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to finish."
<P>
The Energy Department makes a disclaimer: "HIV is transmitted without regard to gender, age, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, religion, or identification with any group.  For this reason, we avoid referring to high risk groups."  Not identifying "high risk groups" is irresponsible.  The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention HIV/AIDS Surveillance Report shows that at least 87 percent of AIDS victims either contracted the virus from homosexual encounters or by sharing needles.
<P>
Probably the most outrageous example of government-sponsored AIDS training was done for the Forest Service.  It took place in the Forest Service's Tahoe Region on May 6, 1994 and was conducted by a local health official with degrees in sexology, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist (individual who draws blood), and an HIV-positive woman from the community.
<P>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk "homophobic" misconceptions.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when sharing hypodermic needles.
<P>
The Forest Service also has a training booklet entitled, "Valuing Diversity."  Inside the booklet are statements such as: "Fact: Psychological and social influences alone cannot cause homosexuality....Fact: A biological (genetic, hormonal, neurological, other) predisposition toward homosexual, bisexual, or heterosexual orientation is present at birth in all boys and girls."  No source for these "facts" is provided, nor could there be.  So-called genetic studies on homosexuality are flawed and typically conducted by homosexual activists.
<P>
AIDS/HIV awareness training and diversity training have become vehicles for promoting homosexuality in the federal government.

<CENTER><H3> Restore Combat Exemptions for Women</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton administration has removed 250,000 combat exemptions for women.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The Administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness. 
<P>
Secretary of Defense William Perry promises, "Our over-arching goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.  By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility in the development and use of human resources."
<P>
The Clinton Administration has not explained how liberalization of the female assignment policy will accomplish the goal of maintaining "a high-quality, ready and effective force."  According to Mr. Perry, these changes are intended to expand "the opportunities for women in the military."
<P>
The Administration's decisions to end more exemptions for women have no justification in military necessity and will hurt readiness:
<P><UL>
<LI>There is a sufficient number of male recruits, especially now that the military is downsizing.  
<P>
<LI>No new scientific studies refute the findings of the 1992 Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which recommended that "military readiness should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
<P>
<LI>The American people still support a go-slow approach to expanding military roles for women.
<P>
<LI>America's likely adversaries still assign only men to their militaries because they know that national security interests cannot be sacrificed to social experimentation.</UL>
<P>
On October 6, 1994,  Representative Ike Skelton (D-Missouri) of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee on Military Forces and Personnel hosted the only hearing since 1991 to consider assignment policies for women.  Although Mr. Skelton began the hearing by stating, "Women should not serve in direct ground combat," and, "I'm of the opinion that second place does not count on the battlefield," he limited the two-hour hearing to one three-member panel which supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) had asked to hear dissenting views from a panel of commissioners from the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces.  His request was denied.
<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives the Congress the responsibility to "raise and support armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and their assignments.
<P>
The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to reverse the Clinton administration's current course.  No hearings or bills are pending.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Off The Dole: No Taxpayer Support for Special Interests</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  In Washington, DC some of the most intensive lobbying is done by recipients of taxpayers' money.  Using the funds received from awards, grants and contracts, these government-created special interests lobby Congress for continued, and often increased, taxpayer support.  Moreover, many of the programs created are hostile to the values of the citizens whose money is used to fund them.
<P>
<B> BILL AND SPONSORS</B>:  On March 3, 1995, Rep. Robert Dornan (R-Calif.) introduced the Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), which would prohibit recipients of taxpayer money from lobbying for continuation of their funding.  The bill is currently cosponsored by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Rep. Mel Hancock (R-Missouri).  
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  The Integrity in Government Act is currently before the House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The bill is designed to keep taxpayer money out of lobbyists' hands.  It is carefully worded so that it applies only to lobbying for continued support of various programs and agencies.  It does not apply to recipients of entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare.   Nothing in the legislation restricts or interferes with individual citizens' ability to communicate with their elected representatives.  
<P>
The Integrity in Government Act does not have many friends among the special interest groups that are so prevalent in Washington.  Many Members of Congress do not want to support the bill for fear of the money and power of these groups or because they like the idea of taxpayer money being used to lobby Congress for causes they favor.  
 <P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Although no hearings have been scheduled for the bill, supporters say they want to move forward with plans to attach similar legislation to each appropriation and authorization bill that comes up in Congress.  It is believed that attaching such an amendment to each appropriation and authorization will make it more difficult for special interests to oppose efforts at reform.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Stem the Resurgence of Drug Abuse</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to the culture's pro-drug influence, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The Administration's national drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" --  treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress may cut drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership. 
<P>
A nationwide survey by the National Institute of Drug Abuse (NIDA) in 1994 found that annual marijuana use among 8th graders rose from 6.2 percent in 1991 to 13 percent in 1994.  The trend is also evident among 10th (16.5 percent to 30.4 percent) and 12th (36.7 percent to 38.2 percent) graders.  And cocaine, crack, heroin, and LSD use among teenagers is also rising and may soon rival the high rates of the 1970s.
<P>
The largest rise is in marijuana abuse, possibly because it is perceived differently from the "hard" drugs.  Although some young people don't even consider marijuana a "drug,"  Dr. Carlton Turner, former NIDA director and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the University of Mississippi, warns, "There is no other drug used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does."
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala states, "Young people must understand that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous drug that can have acute and hazardous effects."  Over 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana damages brain cells, the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.
<P>
Shalala calls for "strong and comprehensive solutions....Young people must grow up knowing unambiguously that drug use -- including smoking marijuana -- is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.  They must hear this from everyone in their communities -- their parents, their teachers, their employers, their peers, the media -- all of us.  We need anti-drug messages that are every bit as pervasive and strong as the pop culture images that tell our youth drugs are o.k."
<P>
These strong words are not echoed by other Administration officials.  President Clinton has been virtually silent on the topic.  And his national drug strategy focuses on a new philosophy entitled "harm reduction," which provides and supports programs to reduce the danger of drug use-related risks, like HIV infection.  Needle exchange is a key component.  The strategy is geared at changing but not eliminating drug-using behavior, in order to reduce the threat of disease due to drug use.
<P>
Meanwhile, the Administration has cut drug interdiction efforts and increased efforts to treat chronic abusers.  The hope is that having more abusers in treatment will reduce demand -- a step toward ending the plague.
<P>
Unfortunately, the pop culture glamorizes drugs, and there are few alternative cultural icons warning teenagers to "just say no."  Additionally, there is no sign that drug production and distribution are declining.  In fact, there continues to be an ample supply.
<P>
The 104th Congress may cut school-based drug prevention programs believing they don't work.  There are some ineffective programs, but others have good track records and should be kept.  
<P>
The House rescissions bill (H.R. 1158) cut most of the FY 95 drug prevention money.  Pending legislation in the Senate may recover some of the funds.   
<P>
The national drug crisis requires committed parents and community leaders to join forces.  At the national level, leadership such as that provided by President and Mrs. Ronald Reagan is needed to curb the drug glamorization messages and boost effective prevention programs.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Free Public Broadcasting</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Corporation for Public Broadcasting was created in 1967 during Lyndon Johnson's "Great Society" to meet a perceived need for taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial networks.  Congressional authorization for CPB is due to expire at the end of 1996.  The 104th Congress should let authorization expire and decline to appropriate any more taxpayer money for CPB.  Instead of giving more taxpayer support to CPB, Congress should let it thrive on its own, as it has shown it can do.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) sponsored by Rep. John Kasich (R-Ohio) takes the first steps by providing a three-year phase out of funding for CPB.  The resolution passed the House on May 18 by a vote of 238 to 193.  A weaker Senate budget resolution (S. Con. Res. 13) was passed on May 25 by a vote of 57 to 42.  It includes a provision sponsored by Sen. Hank Brown (R-Col.) to bring commercial sponsors to CPB in order to offset possible reductions in taxpayer subsidies.  The Senate resolution includes no explicit cuts in funding and falls short of the goal of privatization.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Budget resolutions in both houses of Congress provide a starting point for privatizing CPB, but more action is needed.  Budget resolutions are only suggestions for how to spend taxpayers' money.  Bills dealing with the appropriation of CPB funds will be making their way through the Congress this summer.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The CPB should be privatized for several reasons.  First, the federal government should not be in the broadcasting business.  The basis for CPB's existence is the assumption that for good television programming to exist, the government must provide it.  This $285.6 million a year, anti-free market philosophy insults the intelligence of the viewing/listening public because it assumes that they won't support good programming.
<P>
Second, CPB has been a regular launching pad for attacks on the family.  Independent Television Service's Television Families, Dottie Gets Spanked, and Terminal USA ridicule traditional families and glorify non-traditional households.  A PBS documentary What Kids Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children as young as 8 years old.  The role of parents in the education of their children as well as the moral and familial ramifications of sexuality are almost invisible.  PBS's Tales of the City and Tongues Untied are offensive and graphic promotions of the homosexual lifestyle.  Both programs contain gratuitous nudity, lewdness and foul language.  Religious bigotry is also common in CPB programming. National Public Radio's The Politics of Bigotry was billed as an "in-depth investigation of the Christian Right."  It was actually an ugly smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment's guarantee of free exercise of religion.
<P>
Finally, in a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars so that the government can run a television network that could survive on its own anyway.  As any family knows, serious budget cutting must start with non-essentials. 
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  Defunding CPB is a priority for conservatives.  But these efforts are being met with stiff opposition from CPB supporters in both parties who argue that opponents are trying to kill "Big Bird."  It is hoped that the merits of privatization will drown out such scare tactics.

<P>
<CENTER><H3> Free the Arts and Humanities: Defund the NEA and NEH</H3></CENTER>
<P>

<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Over the years, a total of more than $5 billion in taxpayer money has gone toward the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities.  These federal agencies disburse millions of dollars each year in grants to institutions and individuals, most of which are not controversial.  But continued revelations of wasteful spending, public sponsorship of blatantly anti-family, anti-Christian, anti-business, pro-feminist and pro-homosexual "scholarly" projects and "art works" may finally motivate Congress to defund the endowments. 
  <P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  The House Budget Resolution (H. Con.Res. 67), which passed 238 to 193 on May 18, provides no funds to either of the endowments.  A separate reauthorization bill, however, sponsored by Rep. Bill Goodling (R-Penn.), passed the Education and Economic Opportunities Committee on May 10.  That bill would phase out NEA and NEH by 1999 and is awaiting floor action.  In the Senate, the budget resolution sponsored by Sen. Pete Domenici (R-Ariz.) would cut the endowments but not phase them out.  Senators Jeffords, Kassebaum, Kennedy, et al. have introduced S. 856, the Arts, Humanities, and Museum Services Act of 1995.  This bill would reauthorize both endowments.  Introduced on May 25, it was referred to the Labor and Human Resources Committee.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  Most legislation on the NEA and NEH seeks to trim funding.  But merely reducing the budgets for the endowments would be breaking faith with American voters who want government to cut back on non-essentials now.  And leaving the endowments bleeding but still very much alive guarantees several years of shrill politicking by subsidy-seeking arts and campus groups.  It also ensures an easier renewal of spending if Congress falls back into 
liberal hands.
<P>
The NEA is budgeted $162.5 million in fiscal 1995 (down $4.5 million from $167 million because of an earlier rescission bill).  NEH is budgeted $172 million (also trimmed by $5 million from $177 million).  The House bill would also place a 5 percent cap on administrative expenses, thus gutting the Washington operations of the endowments, and send 80 percent of the grant money to the state arts councils in block grants.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  An attempt to zero out funds for NEA and NEH failed in the House Education and Economic Opportunities Committee, which settled for the phase-out.  But the House Budget Resolution calls for no funding.  House negotiators will have to choose whether to do the right thing (zero out the agencies) or succumb to pressure from liberal colleagues and the more liberal Senate to retain the agencies in some fashion.  The latter course will earn budget cutters no love from the arts and humanities crowd, and will only ensure more conflict in the years ahead.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3> Religious Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Although the First Amendment to the United States Constitution includes the right to freely exercise religion, the ultra-broad interpretation of the provision prohibiting government from establishing a religion has nearly nullified the free exercise right.  A restorative amendment is needed to return to citizens their full First Amendment rights.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a coalition of congressmen and pro-family groups in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) may cosponsor the amendment.  
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The amendment has not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Before any proposed language is introduced, the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution will hold hearings around the country on the topic of  "Religious Liberties and the Bill of Rights."  The first hearing was scheduled to take place in Washington, DC on June 8, 1995, followed by hearings in Harrisonburg, Va., Oklahoma City, Los Angeles, Tampa Bay, New York City, and Philadelphia.
  <P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The starting point for this legislation was H. J. Res. 424, introduced October 7, 1993, which contained the language discussed in the Senate during the Reagan Administration.  The premises upon which this effort is based include the following:  that a constitutional amendment approach is necessary due to existing court decisions on constitutional grounds; that participation in prayer should not be compelled; and that neither a moment of silence nor government-mandated language is acceptable.  While the language of the amendment is not yet final, it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other religious expression where non-religious expression is permitted, and from discriminating against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  This amendment will see heavy opposition from the ACLU and like-minded groups.  It is unclear whether the "super-majority" (two-thirds) needed for the amendment to pass is possible. 
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Parental Rights Restored</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  Increasingly, parents' efforts to teach their children morals, values, and discipline are frustrated by government bureaucrats who claim a superior role in the development of the child.  A law is needed to restore to parents the right to direct the upbringing of their minor children without governmental interference.

<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) are each drafting legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing of their children. 
<P>
<B> DATE INTRODUCED</B>:  The bills have not yet been introduced.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:   Both bills are on hold while the Family Research Council and other pro-family groups hammer out appropriate language.
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Parental Rights Act is designed primarily as a response to parents' inability to control important aspects of their children's education.  The Act would, for example, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.   However, the Act not only protects parents' rights vis a vis education, but also prohibits government interference with regard to medical decisions for their children, reasonable corporal punishment of their children, and the direction of, or provision for, religious teaching for their children.   Some pro-life groups have some concern that the medical decision provision of the Act would prohibit governmental intervention in cases where parents attempt to coerce a daughter into having an abortion.  Similarly, there is currently some doubt as to whether the Act would indeed provide a counterbalance to privacy arguments against parental consent statutes, as it was originally envisioned.  The concept of statutorily restoring parents' rights is a good one, and, once the wording issues have been resolved, the Act will need support from pro-family citizens.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:	The bills will likely be introduced and debated this term.
<P>

<CENTER><H3> Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism</H3></CENTER>

<P>
<B> OBJECTIVE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation is a federally-funded program created in 1974 to provide poor people with access to expensive legal services.  In actuality, LSC serves as a deep well for anti-family litigation.  Each year hundreds of millions of dollars in legal services are donated to the poor from the private sector.  This $415 million a year pot of gold for the anti-family movement is not needed and should be abolished.
<P>
<B> BILLS AND SPONSORS</B>:  There is no pending legislation dealing narrowly with Legal Services Corporation, but the House and Senate budget resolutions each call for rolling back LSC funding.  Thus, legislation which at least reduces funding of LSC is likely to come out of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees later this year.
<P>
<B> STATUS</B>:  Although there is no current legislation on LSC, pro-family groups, including FRC, are working on strategies for abolishing it.  These efforts include a letter to House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole calling for the defunding of LSC.  In mid-May, Sen. Phil Gramm's Appropriations Subcommittee on Justice, State, the Judiciary and Related Agencies held hearings on LSC.  Sen. Gramm pledged to fight the appropriation of money for LSC in the upcoming appropriations bill.  
<P>
<B> SUMMARY AND RATIONALE</B>:  The Legal Services Corporation has operated for 15 years without Congressional authorization.  Yet it continues to be one of the most powerful weapons in the anti-family arsenal.  LSC has played a major role in expanding abortion, divorce and the homosexual agenda.  It has spent $5 billion since 1974 on outrageous litigation ranging from providing cable TV for prisoners to forcing states to fund sex-change operations.  LSC has been a major combatant against welfare reform.  Supporters of LSC claim that it balances the scales in a system where poor people are at a disadvantage because of the high cost of legal services.  But state and local governments as well as bar associations and individual lawyers already provide a great deal of legal aid to the poor.  Instead of helping poor people, LSC often joins the efforts of well-funded anti-family groups such as the ACLU and the National Organization for Women.  Moreover, LSC lacks oversight.  According to Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) oversight has dropped significantly during the Clinton Administration.  Two years ago over 150 on-site audits took place, compared with fewer than 10 this past year.
<P>
<B> PROSPECTS</B>:  The battle to defund the Legal Services Corporation will be a hard one.  Like many expensive government programs, LSC has appeal because it appears to help people in need.  Supporters will try to play to the public's sympathy for the poor, portraying those who want to cut the program as cruel.  But LSC's 21-year track record of radical anti-family activism will be brought to light during the debate.  Also, the deficit-conscious 104th Congress is more
likely to take a serious look at whether such programs are really necessary.

FRC's staff of public policy experts -- and extramural family experts recommended by FRC -- are frequently called to testify before Congressional committees debating pending legislation or seeking guidance on vital family issues.  FRC also routinely submits unsolicited testimony to House and Senate Committees open to informed public opinion.  Topics range from the mundane and technical to the speculative and controversial.  Congressional testimony represents one of FRC's prime educational functions as a nonprofit organization located in the nation's capital.

   <H1>What Welfare Should Be</H1>
   <H3>By Larry P. Arnn & Thomas G. West </H3>

</center>

What should welfare be twenty-five years from now?  The current system and everything like it should be a faint memory.  In its place should be a system that is local in administration.  This new system must support family and work.  It must respect marriage, disdain illegitimacy, and distinguish the deserving poor from the pretenders.  It must rely in large part upon the initiative of private parties and 
organizations, in other words it must be again a system of charity and not of interest-group driven public policy.  It must be fair and good.

<p>
During the 1960's, 70's, and 80's the public debate over welfare consisted mostly of money talk.  Can we afford welfare?  Who should have to pay for it?  Much, however, has changed over the past decade. Now, thanks to the accumulation of bad experience, and the clear heads of a wise few, we are reaching to the fundamentals.  We see now that a vast treasure of ill targeted relief has bought us only more misery.  We see that the poor have been hurt even more than the tax payer has been bilked.

<p>
Between 1960 and 1990 government welfare spending increased from about $30 billion (measured in 1990 dollars) to $225 billion per year; an increase of 750 percent.  The reasons for this dependency are many and complicated, but consider that in 1992, for example, a welfare mother of two living in California with a Section 8 housing voucher from the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development, had a tax-free equivalent income of $1,817 per month, or $21,804 per year.  This is more than twice the after-tax amount she could have earned at a full-time minimum-wage job.  Why should she work when welfare prices work out of the market?

<p>
The percentage of poor Americans has not been reduced since modern welfare began in the mid-1960s.  On the contrary, these programs have in truth worked against economic growth and opportunity for the poor.  Before the big 1960s increases in welfare spending, the poverty level had actually been <i>declining</i> rapidly.  According to government figures, 35 percent of Americans were poor in 1950.  By 1965, that figure had declined to 14 percent, which is about where it has stubbornly remained ever since.

<p>
The stubborn immobility of the poverty numbers is bad enough, but it is not the worst.  The nature of poverty has changed insidiously.  Prior to the 1960s, most poor Americans were poor because their work brought them a paltry income.  But since the middle of the 60s there has been a sharp and ominous increase of social pathology in urban, welfare-infested communities.  Poverty has increasingly become a problem stemming from a new underclass of able-bodied people who work rarely or not at all.  Many of them, especially males, reject the qualities that most Americans admire:  self-control, sobriety, duty to family, loyalty, courage, fair play, and faith in God.

<p>
The new underclass, mired in government dependency, rejects the ethic of hard work and self-reliance.  Low-paying jobs--where many Americans have traditionally learned the basic skills of showing up on time and getting the job done--are scoffed at.  The underclass regards these jobs as "dead-end" and their pay as "chump change."  For this urban underclass, many of whom have spent care-free years not working, hanging around smoking reefer and drinking 40-ounce beers, the reality of trying to hold down a regular job is too much.  In this world, the drug dealing thug is lionized and the man who sweeps floors is scorned.  Welfare has taught our poor all the wrong lessons.

<p>
If today's welfare policies are not working, what then is the alternative?  Prior to the new, post-1965 approach, America had the most successful poverty program in history.  Two centuries ago, at least 90 percent of Americans were desperately poor by today's standards.  By the 1960s a majority of Americans had moved into the middle class.  The recipe for America's successful 189-year-long poverty program was simple: 
<ol>
<li>Establish free markets and opportunity for all who can work.
<li>Provide strong governmental support for the traditional family and for a morality of self-control, industriousness, and basic decency.
<li>Provide individual support in local communities for the deserving poor (orphans, the elderly, and the disabled), and temporarily for the wayward able who desire to pull themselves out from poverty.
</ol>


<p>
Let us assume that the federal government is acting on the new prevailing intellectual consensus about poverty programs by handing over to states and local governments the authority to set and administer their own assistance programs for the poor.  With that in mind, here are characteristics of programs and ideas that can help in the transition away from the disastrous federal welfare state.

<p>
<ul>
<li><b><i>Political and community leaders should again talk candidly about virtue, vice and shame.</i></b></ul>

<p>
We know destructive and immoral conduct when we see it.  Its carnage is all around us and there is no reason to refrain from pointing out the truth.  One of the most frustrating problems in trying to resolve the current poverty question, as <i>Newsweek</i> pointed out in a cover story last fall, is the fact  that "shame" has all but disappeared from American society.  Thirty years ago, it was considered shameful to be on the government dole.  But beginning in the 60s, as Marvin Olasky points out in <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, the poor were taught by welfare organizers that welfare is "nothing to be ashamed of."  Before that, he says, poor mothers had  "a sense that welfare should be avoided."  But, "the constant repetition of <i>rights</i> got through."  The result was "a changing outlook among many poor and the near poor."  The deceptive notion that there was "dignity" in accepting government aid was widely promulgated in these years.  Accordingly, within a few years a much larger proportion of those eligible for welfare chose to take advantage of it.  

<p>
When the stigma of accepting hand-outs is lost, so then is much of the self-reliant spirit it takes for people to pull themselves out of poverty.  Society must not be afraid to cast shame upon laziness, and leaders must affirm with renewed vigilance the duties and responsibilities of citizenship:  hard work, honesty, duty to family and self-sufficiency.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Understand that fatherlessness is the central social problem of our time.</i></b></ul>

<p>
It is in fact the key to solving poverty and crime problems.  While we know children do better with a father at home, and while it is damaging for a child to grow up without one, an almost incomprehensible disaster happens when an entire generation of young people grows up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or responsible males.  As of  1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, but in certain welfare-infested inner city neighborhoods 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.

<p>
The problem, however, has spread far beyond the inner city.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in which their fathers do not live. . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social problems, from crime to adolescent pregnancy. . . . A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty."  These studies indicate that in married-couple homes as of  1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty; while in single-mother homes a deplorable 66 percent of children lived in poverty.  

<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments usurp a man's traditional role as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner superfluous, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He turns to the masculine world of the streets:  drinking, gang banging, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties that bind men to their children explains much of today's rampant pathology.

<p>
Cash payments to underage girls who decide to have children without bothering to get married put the government in the indefensible position of encouraging reckless sexual behavior and illegitimate births.  Laws supporting family integrity need strengthening.  There should be firm public endorsement of healthy families, consisting of a married father and mother raising their own offspring.  Divorce should be made more difficult; and so-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our children's well-being.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>A serious response to the crime that plagues poor neighborhoods is required forthwith.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the urban quagmire most poor now find themselves trapped in, there is a clear and present need for an efficient system of arrest, prosecution, trial (not plea bargains), rigorous adherence to stiff sentencing, a crackdown on youth violence, and imprisonment for the first violent offense.

<p>
The most pressing purpose of government is to protect life, liberty, and property.  That purpose is subverted daily and pervasively in every major city in America, where flagrant piracy is a way of life.  The law-abiding poor need protection more urgently than the law-abiding middle class, who always have the option of moving to a safer neighborhood.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>The failure of public schools must be acknowledged and repaired.</i></b></ul>  

<p>
In the immediate term, tax credits or vouchers for school expenses would instantly enable the poor to send their children to private schools, something that is an affordable option today only for the middle class and the wealthy.  In the longer term, public schools need radical overhaul.  Control over schools should be returned to local communities, and large numbers of administrative positions should be canceled.

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Private charity must be supported and not supplanted by the government welfare system.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In the current "division of labor" in welfare, private charities provide few "on-line services," which means giving direct help to the needy.  That job is done by government.  Private action is forced to the sidelines, where it spends its time conducting experiments, running model programs, and giving expert advice to the government.  Private charity must be liberated so that it can flourish in America as it once did. We should invest private groups with the responsibility to do the main work in assisting the poor.  

<p>
<ul><li><b><i>Separate the deserving poor from the lazy at the local level--make welfare less generous and 
more burdensome.</i></b></ul>

<p>
In <i>The Tragedy of American Compassion</i>, Olasky describes how local assistance programs in the nineteenth century separated the "idle" from the "truly needy" by using "work tests" to discern the character of those seeking assistance.  Charities and shelters had "wood-yards" attached to their property.  "Transients willing to chop were given two meals and a nights lodging."  Not surprisingly, a commentator in 1894 noted that, "when the managers of a Boston charity attached a wood-yard and announced that relief would be given to no able-bodied man, unless willing to do a certain amount of work, the daily number of applicants fell off at once from one hundred and sixty to forty-nine."  Today, and in the future, of course, the wood-yard would be some variance on "workfare," but the idea remains the same:  To provide basic sustenance consistent with the apostle Paul's common-sense injunction, that able-bodied men who do not work are not entitled to eat.

<p>
The first steps in replacing the welfare mess should focus on turning assistance into a temporary safety-net instead of the entrapping spider web it is today.  For instance, people in dire need whose families cannot help them should have to live in local communal arrangements, with requirements for long hours of work, and  with strict rules of behavior (no overnight guests for the unmarried).  Getting tough on dependency is the only solution.  Benjamin Franklin said of welfare, "I am for doing good to the poor, but I differ in opinion of the means.  I think the best way of doing good to the poor, is not making them easy in poverty, but leading or driving them out of it." 

<p>
America needs to discover again, as we once knew well, that true compassion calls for treating the able-bodied poor as adults with souls rather than as mindless children who will never grow up.

Adopted Children Fare Better than Children in Single Parent 
Households</a><br>
An Article By Gracie S. Hsu

<p>

Since joining the Family Research Council in September 1993, Gracie 
Hsu's research skills -- honed at the Johns Hopkins University -- 
have served as an asset to the work of the pro-family advocacy group's 
policy department.  In her current position as policy analyst, she is 
responsible for managing the Family Research Council's efforts in the 
fields of adolescent sexuality and life issues.  As part of FRC's 
outreach to the academic, media and legislative arenas, Miss Hsu's 
work consists of tracking, analyzing, and writing critical essays on 
new research, policy trends, and legislative initiatives concerning 
teen sexuality and abortion issues. She also represents FRC, 
explaining pro-family policy to audiences from capitol hill to the 
<i>CBS Evening News</i>. Her craftsmanship with the written word is 
a special skill she brings to FRC. As an op-ed writer, Miss Hsu 
(pronounced "Shoe") has been published in the <I>San Diego Union 
Tribune, St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Orange County Register</I>, and 
other leading publications.

<p>

Miss Hsu began her work at the Family Research Council as a research 
assistant for health policy issues during the crucial first phases of 
health care reform.  Her project opposing abortion in health care 
reform contributed to U.S. Senate hearings on the subject. Prior to 
joining the Family Research Council, her research experience included 
work at Johns Hopkins on health issues and at the University of 
California at Los Angeles in a study of urban poverty.

<p>

Work in adolescent issues is also a task to which Miss Hsu comes 
well-prepared.  She served as a student health advocate under the 
University of California's Department of Student Health Services 
from 1990-1991, advising her peers on an individual basis regarding 
their various emotional and physical health concerns.  She also 
gained experience by participating in California's Watts Public 
Library Literacy Program, in which she worked as a tutor for inner 
city youth.

<p>

Miss Hsu graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with College Honors from 
the University of California at Los Angeles, receiving a Bachelor 
of Arts degree in English.  She went on to graduate <I>summa cum 
laude</I> with a Masters of Health Sciences degree from the Johns 
Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore, 
Maryland.

   <H1>Fatherlessness</H1>
   <h2>The Central Social Problem of Our Time</h2>
   <H3>By Tom Lowe</H3>

</center>

<p>
For most of our history, a child growing up in the United States of  America could reasonably expect to grow up with a 
father at home.  Today, he can reasonably expect not to.  Fatherlessness is fast replacing fatherhood.  Never in our nation's 
history have so many men decided to abandon their children.  And never have the effects of that abandonment been felt so 
ubiquitously.


<p>
Divorce; child poverty; youth violence; the failure of education; unsafe neighborhoods; domestic violence; the weakening of 
parental authority--all are most directly attributable to the scourge of fatherlessness.  In his incisive new book <i>Fatherless 
America</i>, David Blankenhorn points out that, "Tonight, about 40 percent of American children will go to sleep in homes in 
which their fathers do not live . . . Fatherlessness," says Blankenhorn, "is the engine driving our most urgent social 
problems."


<p>
Our ancestral understanding of fatherhood, which in many ways was responsible for early American success and survival, is 
under siege.  Men in general, but fathers in particular, are viewed as superfluous--America is now unable to believe in 
fatherhood as an inherent domain of males that absolutely effects the well-being of children and society.  

<p>
A blizzard of statistics and studies confirms the relationship between fatherlessness and child poverty.  In married-couple 
homes as of 1992, 13 percent of all children under the age of six lived in poverty, while in single-mother homes an 
unbearably sad 66 percent of young children lived in poverty.  And consider that in married-couple homes with pre-school 
children, median family income in 1992 was approximately $41,000, while in single mother homes, median income was 
about $9,000.  America cannot address its child poverty problem without first addressing its most powerful determinant--fatherlessness. 


<p>
After protection and provisional responsibility, the central task of fatherhood is cultural conveyance.  As described in the 
Book of Genesis, paternity does not just mean males providing food and shelter for children, it also means that they ensure 
that the child grows up to be a <i>certain type of person</i>.  Biological paternity means producing a child--fatherhood means 
producing an adult.  For boys, the most insidious manifestation of fatherlessness has been juvenile violence, and for girls it 
has been out of wedlock childbearing.  


<p>
Studies show that girls who grow up without fathers are at much greater risk for early sexual activity, adolescent 
childbearing, and divorce.  Among white families, one study finds that "daughters of single parents are 111 percent more 
likely to have children as teenagers, and 164 percent more likely to have a pre-marital birth."


<p>
These studies also confirm that boys who grow up without a father at home are three times as likely to get in trouble with the 
police.  Historian James Q. Wilson reminds us that, "Neighborhood standards may be set by mothers, but they are enforced 
by fathers, or at least by adult males.  Neighborhoods without fathers are neighborhoods without men able and willing to 
confront errant youth, chase threatening gangs. . . The absence of fathers. . . deprives the community of those little platoons 
that informally but often effectively control boys on the street."


<p>
Frighteningly, an entire generation of young people is now growing up in neighborhoods substantially devoid of fathers or 
responsible males.  As of 1994, the illegitimacy rate among blacks was 68 percent, and in certain welfare-infested inner city 
neighborhoods over 80 percent of children are growing up in fatherless homes.  <i>Over 80 Percent.</i>


<p>
The federal welfare system is partly to blame.  Welfare cash payments to out-of-work mothers usurp a man's traditional role 
as provider; they make the struggling male breadwinner unnecessary, emasculating him.  His response is predictable.  He 
turns to the super-masculine world of the streets:  drinking, drugs, male camaraderie and crime.  The dissolution of the ties 
that bind men to their children explains much of the rampant pathology from the city streets to small towns across America.


<p>
What is the solution to fatherlessness?  Laws strengthening the traditional family are part of the answer.  There should be 
firm public endorsement of healthy families, especially in textbooks written for schools.  Divorce should be made more 
difficult.  So-called alternative life-styles should be treated with the contempt they deserve for damaging our childrens well-
being.  State legislatures could reaffirm the value of two-parent families by passing laws to prohibit sperm banks from 
selling sperm to unmarried women.  The tax codes, which are unfriendly, if not downright hostile to families, must be 
changed to promote two-parent families and the raising of children at home.


<p>
As Blankenhorn insists, the most urgent social challenge for America as it heads into the twenty-first century is the re-
creation of fatherhood as a vital social role for males.  Does every child deserve a father?  The current answer in American 
society is "no" or "not necessarily."  The only answer that can save our children's future is an unabashed yes, but today, few 
ideas could be more radical.

   <H1>Imagineering a State Budget</H1>
   <H3>By Tom McClintock</H3>

</center>

In Anaheim, California, the creative technicians at Disneyland use the term, 
"Imagineering" to describe the process of letting their imaginations run wild and then 
trying to engineer fantasy into reality.  In Sacramento, California, the creative politicians 
at the Capitol use the term "budgeting" to describe a similar exercise.  The principal 
difference is that the Disney folks are good at it.

<p>
The Imagineers in Sacramento have once again produced a budget that fantasizes much 
higher revenues than the state will receive, much lower expenditures than the state has 
authorized, with virtually no budget reserve.  Thus, every miscalculation will 
immediately translate into red ink, piling on to the already staggering debt load 
shouldered by California's taxpayers. 

<p>
Since 1990, California's economy has significantly <i>under</i>-performed the rest of the 
nation--dragged down by one of the heaviest tax and regulatory burdens in the country.

<p>
Nevertheless, California's new budget is based on predictions of a miraculous economic 
explosion in 1996, including a 33 percent jump in building permits. 

<p>
Last year, Californias personal income grew only half as fast as the rest of the country, 
but next year, the budget requires an economy growing a 33 percent faster than the 
nation.  Last year, Californias employment grew at only one third the national rate.  Next 
year, it must grow 25 percent faster than the rest of the country.  Taxpayers will make up 
the difference between fantasy and reality.  Meanwhile, the budget counts on a $500 
million federal gift that Washington has not even agreed to give.

<p>
In their defense, Sacramentos Imagineers are quick to point out that the budgets 
economic forecasts are "mid-range estimates, when compared to other forecasters."  
That's an important distinction, since the "other forecasters" they use for comparison have 
been very good at over-estimating the states performance in past years.  Economists like 
Arthur Laffer, who have been consistently correct in predicting Californias economy, are 
far more pessimistic.  Laffer observes that Californias economy now drags along at the 
bottom of national numbers, on its way to becoming "perpetual West Virginia."

<p>
On the expenditure side, the budget is balanced by significant and overdue cuts in social 
welfare spending.  But theres a hitch.  The cuts cant take effect until waivers are granted 
from the federal government, or federal laws are changed.

<p>
Yet the budget assumes these authorizations will soon take effect.  California will run a 
deficit up to $1.5 million every day the authorizations are delayed.  Thats a very likely 
scenario.  The state is still waiting for waivers for cuts made last year.  The same 
imprudence last year added millions of dollars to the deficit.

<p>
In addition, a number of court cases are pending against the state for past fiscal 
gimmicks.  For example, past budget games have shorted the state's pension system of 
nearly $1 billion. Court cases challenging state raids of this nature--which are part of the 
state's structural deficit--are very likely to add $2 billion to the states obligations, yet no 
reserve has been set aside.

<p>
A press release from the budgets author boasts, "Without any gimmicks, tricks, or smoke 
and mirrors, the proposed 1995-96 budget is balanced and even has a small reserve of $41 
million."  "Small" is putting it mildly. It amounts to 95/1000ths of one percent of the 
state general fund.  The Imagineers may not have relied on "smoke and mirrors," but their 
new budget will only fly with ample quantities of faith and trust--and a little of Tinker 
Belles pixie dust.

<p>
The difference between the fantasy of this years state budget and the reality of the states 
ailing economy will be measured by a growing deficit that future taxpayers will bear.  
Meanwhile, the state continues to carry at least $2.5 billion of debt from past years, or 
about $300 per family, which California taxpayers must eventually pay. 

<p>
Kudos to those few legislators who stood in the face of intimidation and pressure to vote 
against this wasteful and irresponsible budget.  The fact that this years budget was 
passed by a bi-partisan vote should not be hailed as a breech in "gridlock".  Instead, 
support for this business-as-usual budget, which will continue to drag California to its 
knees, should be seen for what it is: a sad commentary on the quality of political 
leadership in California.

</center>
The Flat Tax (Dick Armey), The Sales Tax (Bill Archer), The USA (Unlimited
Savings Allowance) Tax (Domenici-Nunn), and The Individual Investment
Account Act (Breaux-McCrery)
<p>

All four revolutionary tax proposals have identical prime objectives:  (1)
totally <i>eliminating</i> the double tax on saving; and (2) greatly
<i>simplifying</i> the tax system.  These objectives are entirely proper
and achievable.  What it takes is sound judgment, good leadership, and the
guts to stop the "hand-wringers" from conjuring up ghosts that drag out
and obfuscates sound analysis and action. 
<P>
Appropriate comments follow.  But first, please recognize that
the League focuses on the taxation of <i>personal saving</i>.
Corporate tax changes, while relevant, are not commented upon herein.
<P>

<b>Flat Tax</b>:<br>  

We applaud it, because it totally removes the double tax on saving.  It
has undeniable attraction via simplicity. It is challenged by some,
because they claim it is less "progressive" than they prefer.  It suffers
due to the prospective elimination of tax deductions for home mortgage
interest, charitable contributions, and certain other embedded, existing
tax provisions. 

<P>
<b>Sales Tax</b>:<br>  

Again getting rid of the double tax on saving is a major attribute.  The
champions of the sales tax stress that it removes the whole income tax
structure and effectively removes the need for any IRS-with its legions of
tax collectors.  Further, the sales tax can be adjusted to correct the
present tax imbalance on foreign imports and exports.  Some commentators
fear that the sales tax will eventually evolve into a value-added tax,
with many levels of taxation that are masked from the public.  The sales
tax concept is simple, but faces a need for public acceptance due to its
perceived regressiveness.  The states, many who rely upon sales taxes, may
fight a national sales tax. 

<P>
<b>Domenici-Nunn (N-D) USA Plan:</b><br>

The centerpiece of the USA Tax is the Unlimited Savings Allowance from
which the new tax system for America's future derives its name" (4/25/95
N-D memo).  This plan has been endorsed by the <i>Washington Post</i>. 
The N-D plan, insofar as the taxation of personal saving is concerned, is
virtually identical to in concept, and is derived from, the Individual
Investment Account Act.<p>

<b>The Individual Investment Account Act (S. 159 and H.R.
328):</b><br> 

Described by knowledgeable economists as ... "one of the boldest, most
imaginative, and most constructive pro-growth tax initiatives in many
years," this plan zeros in solely on the major fault with the existing
income tax system:  the senseless double tax on saving.  <p>

The simple, effective substance of this legislation creates an IRA-type
account for every person into which unlimited, fully tax-deductible
contributions may be made.  All assets accumulate on a tax-free basis. 
There is no penalty tax, nor forced distributions at any age.  There is no
income tax nor estate tax at death, and beneficiaries have the same tax
basis as the benefactor.  All withdrawals are taxed at ordinary income tax
rates.  The net effect of this legislation is, like the other more complex
legislation above, a zero tax on <i>after-tax income </i> that is saved
and invested.  Additionally, this act provides a simple, most desirable
"home and account" rollover procedure that helps people not only purchase
their home, but also sell their home on a sound, tax-deferred "investment
transaction "basis.

decorated athlete during his athletic career, he was inducted
into the State of Utah Sports Hall of Fame in 1985.  He was also
named to Utah State University's All-Century football team in
1993 and was inducted into it's Athletic Hall of Fame in 1994.

<p>

As a concerned professional athlete, Mr. Olsen, and his brothers
Merlin and Orrin, originated and operated the Olsen Brothers All
Sports Camps throughout the western U.S.  He has also initiated
a number of student/athlete enhancement programs to promote athletic
and academic achievement. Mr. Olsen has continued his career
in sports through his work as a color commentator covering college
football on radio and as a member of the NBC TV broadcast support
team covering two Super Bowls and numerous other college and NFL
football games.

In business, Mr. Olsen has more than twenty years experience
in commercial/industrial real estate.  His experience includes
expertise in real estate finance, development, brokerage and investor
equity funding.

<p>

</center>

Just prior to the 104th Congress, Catherine A. Deeds joined the 
Family Research Council in 1994 as a lobbyist to both the U.S. 
Senate and the U.S. House of Representatives. Her responsibilities 
include developing legislative strategy, meeting and working with 
key decision makers on Capitol Hill, and tracking current policy 
developments. With a broad understanding of the legislative 
process, Miss Deeds focuses on specific family issues that 
incorporate her policy skills and background.

<p>

Formerly a Legislative Assistant in 1993 for freshman U.S. 
Congressman Bob Inglis of South Carolina, Miss Deeds followed 
a number of domestic policy issues such as health care, labor, 
veterans, senior citizens, religion, and family.

<p>

Miss Deeds gained key legislative experience with family policy 
issues in several different arenas especially during a political 
appointment in the Bush Administration. In 1992, Miss Deeds 
assisted the management of the Office of the Deputy Assistant 
Secretary for Legislation in the U.S. Department of Health and 
Human Services. She served as a liaison and political appointee 
in the Bush Administration to over two hundred Congressional Offices 
on public health issues.

<p>

On Capitol Hill in 1991, Miss Deeds worked as Policy Analyst for 
the House Republican Study Committee where she performed extensive 
research and writing on issues including health care, civil 
rights, labor, family, and education.

<p>

In 1989, Miss Deeds established her expertise on family issues as 
she served on a House Select Committee on Children, Youth, and 
Families. This position included not only the reporting on various 
topics affecting children and families but also the screening 
of witnesses for Congressional hearings.

<p>

From 1987-1989, Miss Deeds served at Free Congress Research and 
Education Foundation as Managing Editor of the monthly Family 
Protection Report and later, Associate Editor of the twenty-four 
page, monthly Family, Law & Democracy Report.

<p>

Cathy Deeds currently serves on the board of directors at a crisis 
pregnancy center and Advisory Board for American Collegians for 
Life, has volunteered for five campaigns for pro-life candidates, 
and founded the Arlington chapter of the Virginia Society for Human 
Life.

<p>

In 1986, Cathy graduated from Marquette University with a Bachelor of 
Arts in Journalism.

<center><h1>CONGRESS ADVANCES PRO-FAMILY AGENDA</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>F</font>rom defending marriage to fighting to prevent the 
killing of the unborn late in pregnancy to presenting an unprecedented
balanced budget with family tax relief, the 104th Congress took
historic steps for America's families, according to Family Research
Council President Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Missions Met</h3></center>

<p>

To be sure, the 104th Congress did not achieve all of its
objectives.  But the addition of a large group of conservative
freshmen substantially changed the legislative agenda.  These
freshmen apparently had an impact on national policy even before
they took office.  On Nov. 10, 1994 -- two days after the election
that reversed control of Congress -- the Justice Department abandoned
its two-year effort to weaken the interpretation of a child pornography
statute.  According to a new book by former Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders, the election results also prompted the administration
to reverse a decision to provide clean needles to drug addicts.

<p>

The new chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the
Constitution, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.), was in the forefront
of congressional initiatives to defend the traditional definition
of marriage and ban partial-birth abortions.  Canady held very
illuminating hearings in his subcommittee, helping to set the
stage for overwhelming House approval of the Defense of Marriage
Act and the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.

<p>

Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.), the Senate sponsor of the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA), fended off an effort by Sens. Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and others to attach the
Employment Non-Discrimination Act (ENDA) and other pro-homosexual
amendments to DOMA.  The Human Rights Campaign, a major homosexual
rights advocacy group, took credit for developing this amendment
strategy to &quot;derail&quot; the Defense of Marriage Act, which
they alleged was &quot;hate-driven.&quot;  Nickles and Majority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) negotiated an agreement that provided
for a clean vote on DOMA, followed by an up or down vote on Sen.
Kennedy's ENDA proposal.

<p>

An overwhelming majority of senators agreed with the argument
that marriage was not instituted to 'discriminate' against homosexuals,
but rather to unite one man and one woman and provide a strong
foundation for the nurturing of children.  President Clinton signed
DOMA into law at 12:50 a.m. on Sept. 21.  Despite last-minute
phone calls from the president to wavering senators, the Kennedy
homosexual jobs proposal came up one vote short, 49-50.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"THE 104TH CONGRESS<br>
TOOK HISTORIC STEPS."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Congress produced strong majorities in favor of the Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban, but on Sept. 26 the Senate fell eight votes short
of the two-thirds majority necessary to override a veto.
Despite administration objections, Congress did succeed in enacting
five pro-life provisions as amendments to spending bills.  One
of these measures protects medical schools from the loss of federal
funds if they refuse to provide abortion training. Another restores
a limitation on funding of abortions through federal employees'
health insurance programs.

<p>

<center><h3>More Vetoes</h3></center>

<p>

Several new anti-pornography bills were enacted and signed
into law by the president, but they will face difficult battles
in the courts.  Congress passed a balanced budget and family tax
relief package, but it was vetoed.  A modified welfare reform
package was enacted into law after stronger measures were twice
vetoed.

<p>

Line-item veto authority was provided to the president, effective
January 1997.  Vice President Gore suggested on a weekend news
program that this would give the administration leverage to press
Congress to liberalize welfare policies.

<p>

Since every new Congress starts with a clean slate, the policies
enacted during the past two years will be subject to revision
by the next Congress and president.

<p>

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>FDA Checks Parents.</b> House Commerce Committee Chairman
Thomas J. Bliley (R-Va.) recently held hearings into why the FDA
refuses to allow the marketing of an Atlanta mother's drug testing
kit to parents who want to test their children.  FDA regulations
label the kit (a plastic cup and a shipping box) as a &quot;Class
III&quot; medical device, equivalent to an MRI or  pacemaker.
Even though businesses and athletic teams use the same kit, the
FDA claims it &quot;is concerned about issues such as anonymity,
confidentiality, coercion, and family discord.&quot;  Will the
same considerations govern FDA rulings on RU-486?

<p><a name="ex-gay">

<b>Hope for Homosexuals.</b> On Oct. 10, FRC co-sponsored a press
conference for the Second Annual Coming Out of Homosexuality Day
(Oct. 11) and the new support group, Parents, Family and Friends
of Ex-Gays (PFOX).  Hosted by Michael Johnston, a former homosexual
who is HIV-positive, the event was taped for C-SPAN.  FRC Cultural
Studies Director Bob Knight also spoke, along with <I>Lambda Report</I>
editor Peter LaBarbera, the Philadelphia Family Policy Council's
Bill Devlin, Tom and Ann Taylor, who have a homosexual son, and
ex-homosexuals Anthony Falzarano and Jane Boyer.

<p>

<b>Refuge for Abortion Victims.</b> Several immigration provisions
were rolled into the FY 1997 Omnibus Appropriations package, including
a humanitarian measure which allows people fleeing from coercive
abortion policies to seek asylum in the United States.  Effective
immediately, asylum may be granted for up to 1,000 people per
year who have been forcibly aborted or involuntarily sterilized,
or have a well-founded fear of persecution under coercive population
control policies. This restores a similar policy which was effective
under the Reagan and Bush administrations.

<p>

<b>Immigrants and AIDS Treatment.</b> Congress dropped a provision
in its immigration legislation preventing taxpayer-funding of
HIV-AIDS treatment for legal and illegal aliens.  Rep. Lamar Smith
(R-Texas) and Sen. Alan Simpson (R-Wyo.), chairmen of House and
Senate immigration subcommittees, said the change could encourage
&quot;thousands of HIV-infected aliens to seek asylum in the U.S.&quot;
Despite a 1993 law barring admission of HIV-positive immigrants,
earlier this year the White House directed the Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) to consider granting asylum to HIV-positive
individuals.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Elders on Drugs.</b> As Surgeon General, Joycelyn Elders called
for a drug legalization study, favored giving needles to
addicts and advocated marijuana as medicine.  On Oct. 9, she blamed
the new teenage drug epidemic on easy-to-get marijuana and then
said pot &quot;probably causes very little problem to anyone.&quot;
Marijuana can be addictive, damages the immune system, causes
respiratory diseases and mental disorders, and impairs coordination
and judgment.

<p>

<b>Gagging Chaplains.</b> Air Force Reserve chaplain Fr. Vincent
Rigdon has filed a federal lawsuit against the Secretary of Defense
(<I>Rigdon v. Perry</I>) for interfering with his religious liberty
and free speech by issuing a &quot;gag order&quot; that bars religious
leaders from discussing specific legislation in sermons or counseling.
In June, a Pentagon directive to Catholic military chaplains
prohibited them from &quot;participating or urging others to participate&quot;
in a nationwide postcard mailing to Congress which supported a
vote to override the veto of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act.

<p>

<b>Bork's Beatitudes.</b> Will America survive?  Not without
strong churches, says Robert Bork, respected jurist and author
of the controversial new book <I>Slouching Towards Gomorrah: 
Modern Liberalism and American Decline.</I> Bork contends that
the loss of reliable standards of right and wrong has resulted
in a &quot;loss of nerve, which means the community cannot summon
the will to suppress&quot; many social ills such as pornography
and crime. &quot;The Church which ought to be shaping and influencing
culture is instead being influenced by culture,&quot; Bork says.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Insulting Hispanics.</b> Apparently, the Enola Gay controversy
taught the Smithsonian Institute little.  Hispanic Heritage Month,
which ended on Oct. 15, featured Andres Serrano, best known for
his vulgar and anti-Christian art.  (His creations include a crucifix
immersed in a jar of urine.)  The Hispanic community lacks not
for serious artists.  Selecting Serrano &quot;because of the body
of his work&quot; reveals the politically correct values of the
Smithsonian.  Such art merits no taxpayer money.  The real irony
is that Serrano would receive no support if his works glorified
Christian symbols.

<p><a name="pentagon">

<b>PX Porn Challenge.</b> Now that the sale of pornographic materials
at military stores has been prohibited, <I>Penthouse</I> publisher
Bob Guccione is challenging the 1997 Defense Authorization Bill,
claiming it is unconstitutional.  Guccione's magazine alone earned
$1.16 of the $4.6 million in 1995 sales at the Pentagon's worldwide
chain of tax-supported stores.  Mr. Guccione's real gripe with
the new law may be its threat to his revenues.  Getting the U.S.
government out of the porn business has been an accomplishment
10 years in the making.

<p>

<b>BULLETIN --</b> In education news, the CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617)
died with the closing of the 104th Congress.  The issue of job
training reform will most likely be raised again in the 105th
Congress next year.

<h3>Katy Bar The Schoolhouse Door To Parents</h3>

<p>

Parents effectively lose their right to direct the upbringing
of their children when they drop them off at school, according
to one federal court judge.  Earlier this year, Judge Melinda
Harmon, appointed by President Bush, ruled that Katy Independent
School District in Texas did not violate parents' rights by allowing
Child Protective Services to interrogate a student without notifying
his parents, nor by instructing him to lie to his parents about
the incident.

<p>

Take, for example, the case of 6-year-old Jonathan Prevette,
who last month kissed a classmate in Lexington, N.C.  Such incidents
have a long history in schoolyards across America and, until now,
were brushed off as childhood innocence, or reprimanded by teachers
and principals after discussing the situation with parents.  But
this time it was called &quot;sexual harassment.&quot;  The &quot;culprit&quot;
was suspended for a misdemeanor he can't even spell.

<p>

What prompted such a response?  Perhaps it was a nudge from
the U.S. Education Department, which this summer distributed guidelines
urging schools to set up sexual harassment policies.  Schools
were warned that under Title IX &quot;gender equity&quot; provisions
for federally funded programs, they may be held liable for letting
&quot;sexual harassment&quot; among students go unnoticed.

<p>

With even admiring looks now considered &quot;sexual harassment,&quot;
it is no wonder a school would seek cover from lawsuits by laying
down a blanket prohibition against anything remotely affectionate.
Ironically, the very same federal Education Department has promoted
sex education schemes that push condoms and the like on boys and
girls at even younger ages.

<p>

Such cold, heavy-handed responses to children like Jonathan
Prevette will continue if federal court decisions shut parents
out and let a remote and liberal federal education bureaucracy
hand down one-size-fits-all policies.  Embracing parents, on the
other hand, would result in the improved discipline and academics
many schools now seek in vain.

<h3>A Duty to Die?</h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court has accepted two important cases concerning
doctor-aided suicide.  In <I>Glucksburg v. Washington</I>, the
Ninth Circuit federal court &quot;found&quot; a constitutional
&quot;liberty&quot; right for terminally-ill patients to be killed
by their doctors.  Judge Stephen Reinhardt explained that his
reasoning is &quot;identical&quot; to the Supreme Court abortion
cases of <I>Roe v. Wade</I> and <I>Planned Parenthood v. Casey</I>.
These poisonous precedents live on, defending the destruction
of life.

<p>

The other case creates a constitutional right to be killed
by a doctor, not based on &quot;liberty&quot; but &quot;equality.&quot;
The Second Circuit federal court in <I>Vacco v. Quill</I> declared
that the New York law against causing or assisting suicide was
unconstitutional because it discriminates among terminally-ill
people.  According to the court, refusing artificial life support
and getting a lethal injection are equivalent, and since the former
is permitted, the latter may not be prohibited.

<p>

If these decisions are not overturned by the high court,
a &quot;right to die&quot; may soon become a &quot;duty to die&quot;
for those most in need.

<p>

A recent report on the Netherlands euthanasia experience
by Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) provides a compelling context
for the current debate on doctor-assisted suicide in America.
Euthanasia of the terminally ill in the Netherlands has been
expanded since its inception in 1973 to permit the killing of
healthy people experiencing psychological distress.  Voluntary
euthanasia has given way to involuntary euthanasia, called &quot;termination
of the patient without explicit request.&quot;  In 1990, 1,000
people in the Netherlands were killed without their consent, 140
of whom were fully competent.

<p>

FRC is part of a broad coalition of groups urging the Court
to overturn the lower rulings, drafting <I>amicus</I> briefs detailing
the right of society to forbid euthanasia, and recounting the
tragedy of pre-Nazi Germany, where mercy killing was thought to
be the compassionate response to the plight of physically or mentally
disabled people, &quot;life unworthy of life.&quot;  Germany has
learned from its horrific mistakes, and now calls mercy killing
a crime against humanity.  Pray that the Supreme Court will not
sacrifice the lives of the infirm as they have done the lives
of the unborn.

<font size=+2><b><i>An Exercise of Citizenship</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>E</font>veryone needs to belong, to identify with something 
larger than self.  For some it is religion, for some it is a social 
construct, and for virtually all, it is national identity, citizenship, a
precious commodity involving rights, duties, and privileges.
I for one cannot imagine what it would be like to be the fabled
&quot;man without a country&quot; -- a man without citizenship.

<p>

Millions of people have left friends, family and their native
lands to immigrate, often at great personal risk, to the United
States.  Why?  Inscribed on the Statue of Liberty are the words,
&quot;Give me your tired, your poor; your huddled masses yearning
to breathe free. ...&quot;  That's it.  They come here for freedom.
Freedom of opportunity, of religion, from oppression, to raise
their families, to educate their children, to associate with friends
of their choice, and to achieve the American Dream.  They have
come because America is the land of the free.

<p>

Becoming an American involves more than a labeling process.
It implies adopting our language, customs, and national as well
as historical traditions.  It requires swearing allegiance to
the Constitution of the United States, renouncing fidelity to
any foreign state, and expressing willingness to serve this nation
as required by and under the law.

<p>

Recently, however, the process of becoming a U.S. citizen
has been &quot;dumbed down.&quot;  In the last 12 months, according
to published accounts, the Immigration and Naturalization Service
has conducted a full-court press to naturalize more than 1.2 million
new citizens.  Congressional hearings reveal that in the process,
longstanding rules have been bent, the citizenship test has been
simplified, citizenship has been granted to people who could not
speak English and, in many cases, criminal background checks may
have been bypassed.

<p>

Despite denial by the INS, evidence suggests that in at least
one case, hundreds of tests were submitted all of which were completed
in the same handwriting.  Extensive testimony before the Senate
Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration alleges a White House-initiated,
election-year effort to dramatically accelerate the naturalization
of new immigrants prior to Nov. 5.

<p>

The blessings of this land have not been bought cheaply.
Millions have paid the ultimate price while defending our way
of life.  To grant citizenship cheaply to anyone who applies or
for political advantage is an insult to those who have served
this nation.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

"THE BLESSINGS OF THIS<br>
LAND HAVE NOT BEEN<br>
BOUGHT CHEAPLY."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Every American is endowed with the God-given right to life,
liberty and the pursuit of happiness.  Among the privileges are
the freedom to participate in the social, economic, political,
religious and cultural aspects of the community.  No wonder people
around the globe aspire to come to our shores!

<p>

Rights are important, but there are obligations crucial to
the survival of a free society.  Citizenship imposes broad responsibilities
on our nation, our community, our neighbors and our families.
One of the most cherished of these is the obligation to vote.
This democratic republic will survive only if it is truly representative
of all the people, and that requires broad participation in the
political process.

<p>

Sadly, far too few Christians go to the polls.  Abraham Lincoln
believed elections to be so important that he offered furloughs
to soldiers who wanted to vote. Edmund Burke said, &quot;All it
takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.&quot;
Now is not the time for any of us, whatever our heritage, to
lower the standards of good citizenship.  After all, we are men
and women <I>with</I> a country -- a country that needs us more
than ever.

<a name="compact"><center><h1>An American Compact</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>O</font>ne year after the Republican Contract with America, 
FRC President Gary Bauer has written a book in which he announces &quot;A 
Compact with Our Fellow Americans.&quot; Like the GOP Contract,
this Compact is an effort to put down on paper the goals of a movement. 
It follows in the long tradition of &quot;getting it in writing&quot; which 
has characterized our people's history, from Magna Carta to the U.S. 
Constitution.  Like the Contract, too, it contains 10 key items and invites 
supporters to sign on.
<p>
But the Compact differs in that it seeks to go beyond reforms to be enacted 
by Congress. Rather, it emphasizes actions which Americans can take in their 
homes, churches and communities, even if reform is thwarted in Congress. 
The Compact also differs in that any American, regardless of party ties, 
can freely subscribe to it.  The &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; 
touches on what Alexis de Tocqueville called the &quot;habits of the heart&quot;
which define and preserve us as a free people.
<p>
<center><h3>What We Want</h3></center>
<p>
The Compact is part of Gary Bauer's new book, <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams:
A Vision for America</i>. The book is being published this month by Focus 
on the Family. <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is an effort to go directly to 
Americans, to appeal to their hearts, <i>without the reinterpretation and
distortion of the major media</i>. It seeks to answer the question so often 
asked by brusque reporters, but which is also asked with sincerity by many 
of our fellow citizens:  &quot;What do you people want?&quot;
<p>
Bauer states the case for a pro-family America.  He tackles head-on
not only the issues which shape our political choices, but, more importantly, 
those cultural questions, beliefs and actions which determine whether our 
American experiment in ordered liberty will survive at all.  Despite
the facts that we are not at war and that Wall Street's Dow Jones
Index has been daily reaching new highs, most people think our country is 
on the wrong track.
<p>
Bauer recently spoke to this anxiety when he told Dan Rather: &quot;I 
want to see an America where I don't have to worry about date rape when my 
daughter goes out for the first time at college. I want an America where, 
when a young man pledges to love and honor her for the rest of their lives, 
there is a good chance he means it.  I want a country where children come 
first again and where virtue is honored, a place where values matter and 
the American Dream is still real.&quot;
<p>
<i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</i> is not just a policy manual.  It goes behind
today's headlines and tomorrow's talk shows to explore the reasons why 
conservatives defend the family as the fundamental unit of society. It 
describes in detail what this nation would look like if the pro-family
cause were to triumph.  It seeks to summarize the aspirations of families 
and to quell the fears of citizens who have been urged by the polarizing 
media to view &quot;family values&quot; with grave suspicion.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>&quot;MOVE BEYOND<br>
BREAD-ALONE POLITICS...&quot;</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
Even though the book includes over 100 public policy recommendations,
it ultimately resists the temptation to put &quot;our trust in princes,&quot; 
as if the cure for America's ills could be found in Washington. It challenges 
our national leadership to move beyond &quot;bread-alone&quot; politics.  It
includes some thoughtful questions for citizens to ask all candidates
who seek power over us, giving pro-family Americans the chance to shape 
public debate.
<p>
<center><h3>Getting the Word Out</h3></center>
<p>
Look for <i>Our Hopes, Our Dreams: A Vision for America</i> at your local
Christian bookstore, or use the enclosed card to order from us.  Urge your 
neighborhood group, your church, your public library to obtain copies. 
Share them with family and friends who may be sympathetic but skeptical. 
This is a year of decision.  The decisions that are made will shape the world 
our children inherit.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Kinsey's Pedo-File.</b>  U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman (R-Tex.) has introduced
a bill, with over 40 cosponsors, calling for federal investigation into the 
infamous Kinsey sex studies.  The &quot;Child Protection and Ethics in 
Education Act&quot; also calls for a cut-off of federal funds to programs 
that use the Kinsey research uncritically.  Media attention continues
to build regarding Kinsey Institute Director John Bancroft's admission that 
a key table on child sexuality was based on the records of a single pedophile. 
FRC has publicly called on the Institute to identify all of its pedophile 
sources.
<p>
<b>In the Dark.</b> What had originally been slated as a House hearing
to expose &quot;the homosexual agenda in schools&quot; turned into a 
mostly watered-down exercise on &quot;parents, schools and values.&quot; 
The Dec. 5 and 6 hearing drew little media coverage.  Virtually
ignored was shocking testimony by avowed lesbian Claire Connelly of 
Ventura County, California, who gave evidence that millions of taxpayer 
dollars' worth of AIDS programming is being hijacked by homosexual activist
groups. The hearing was held by the House Subcommittee on Oversight
and Investigations.
<p>
<b>Not with My Kid.</b>  A hearing was held in November on the Family
Privacy Protection Act (H.R. 1271), which requires researchers to get 
written parental permission before administering surveys to children. 
FRC's Robert Knight supported the bill in testimony before the Senate 
Committee on Governmental Affairs.  Knight said the law is needed because 
some researchers are prying into family matters and/or asking children 
graphic questions about sex. The FRC video about Alfred Kinsey, <i>The 
Children of Table 34</i>, was submitted to the committee to illustrate 
research run amok.
<p><a name="abortion">
<b>Life Gains.</b> On Dec. 7, the Senate passed the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act, 54-44.  Since the Senate-passed version has been amended slightly, 
a final version still must be approved by the House, possibly by the end of 
January.  After final congressional approval, the bill will go to
President Clinton, who threatens to veto it.  While thousands of Americans 
are calling the White House about this legislation, it is also important to 
educate your neighbors by writing letters to the editor and calling talk 
radio programs.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Slippery Summit.</b> Ever since the 1989 governors' education summit
in Charlottesville, Va., produced the National Education Goals and 
prompted Goals 2000, Americans are rightly suspicious of such gatherings. 
When word got out last summer about a follow-up meeting to recommit to 
the national goals, the ensuing uproar scuttled the meeting. Now a summit 
is scheduled for March 26-27 in Palisades, New York.  Business leaders
have been invited to join governors to discuss opportunities for participation 
in the Goals 2000 school restructuring. Unfortunately, a new partner in a bad 
venture won't improve it.
<p>
<b>Holiday Spirit.</b> On Dec. 19, Andrei Codrescu, a commentator on
National Public Radio's <i>All Things Considered</i>, said this about 
the Christian concept of Rapture: &quot;The evaporation of four
million who believe in this crap would leave the world a better
place.&quot;  The taxpayer-funded NPR issued an apology. The week 
before Christmas, NPR also devoted considerable air time to commentators 
who tried to debunk Christianity.  And it was business as usual over 
at PBS, which re-aired the sexually explicit homosexual series <i>Tales 
of the City</i>.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="npr">
<b>New Allies?</b> While the fate of the GOP's $500 per child tax credit
remains tied up in the budget deadlock, the National Parenting Association 
(NPA), a liberal academic group, has begun to lobby for pro-family tax cuts. 
On Dec. 15, an NPA youth violence task force hosted testimony
from representatives of Promise Keepers, the Christian pro-fatherhood
group that reached 826,000 men in 1995.  Meanwhile, a new Heritage Foundation 
study shows that the Clinton family tax cut covers 23 million fewer children 
than the GOP proposal.
<p>
<b>Maine Rebounds.</b> Pro-family forces have won a big victory in the
Pine Tree State.  For the first time in 20 years, Maine legislators won't 
face homosexual rights legislation in 1996.  An openly lesbian state 
senator withdrew the bill, citing the need for &quot;healing&quot;
on the issue.  But the real reason was the bill's certain defeat.  In 
November, voters narrowly rejected a statewide referendum that would 
have struck down local gay rights laws.  Outspent 10 to one, pro-family 
forces still snagged 47 percent of the vote, sending lawmakers a message.
<p>
<b>Saving Marriages.</b> Divorce reform is gaining momentum in the new
year.  Michigan and Iowa are among states likely to consider bills that 
reintroduce the fault concept in contested cases where children are present. 
Randy Hekman, head of the Michigan Family Forum, a member of the Association 
of State Policy Councils, points out that under current law, &quot;I can 
divorce my wife of 26 years with less difficulty than I can fire a 
secretary I hired last week.&quot;

<p><a name="porn">
<h3>Cyberprogress</h3>
<p>
At the end of 1995, staff members for the House and Senate
conferees on the large telecommunications deregulation bill came to 
agreement on strong pornography restrictions, but only after a series 
of tough negotiations.  Leaving pornography unrestricted in cyberspace 
would be like leaving a loaded gun on a playground.  If the &quot;telecom
bill&quot; is passed, the anti-cyberporn language will help parents protect 
their children by making pornography inaccessible by children.
<p>
Highlights of the cyberporn provisions as negotiated include:
<p><ul>
<li>Use of a court-approved indecency standard, defined in
the bill as an <b>&quot;image or other communication that, in context, 
depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by 
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or 
organs&quot;</b>;
<p>
<li>Indecent communications are available to adults but <b>barred
to children</b>;
<p>
<li>People are liable only for <b>knowing violations</b> of the law;
<p>
<li>Online service providers are not liable for violations beyond areas 
they own or control;
<p>
<li>E-mail privacy laws are left unchanged;
<p>
<li>Those making good faith efforts to keep pornography away
from children have a defense against prosecution.
</ul><p>
Contrary to much of the current rhetoric from civil libertarians,
the anti-cyberporn provisions could not be used to find Shakespeare or 
any other serious work of literature or art to be indecent. Adults with 
common sense do not confuse art and literature with patently offensive
materials which degrade women, harm children, and corrupt men.
Under the indecency standard, the courts will be obliged to evaluate 
material in its proper context.
<p>
A few other provisions of the bill remained unresolved as <i>Watch</i> 
went to press. Congressional leaders should make every effort to conclude 
these matters as soon as possible, so that we do not risk losing the 
opportunity to protect our children from the cultural poison of cyberporn.
<p>
FRC's legal policy director took part in the negotiations leading to 
these provisions.  In the past, telecommunications reform has happened once 
a generation. FRC will continue to monitor this legislation in the days 
to come.

<h3>FRC: Ready and Abel</h3>
<p>
FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) is challenging the Clinton
administration's military personnel policies in the courts.  On Dec. 5, the 
MRP had the rare privilege to make oral arguments before the U.S. Circuit 
Court of Appeals in Richmond, Va., in the case of <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. 
Thomasson is an avowed homosexual who wants the military's ban declared 
unconstitutional.  The MRP defended the law's intended meaning, while
the U.S. Justice Department hid behind the Clinton administration's faulty 
regulations.  A decision is expected in April.
<p>
Last summer, the MRP filed a brief in <i>Abel et al. v. U.S.A.</i>, which
involves six avowedly homosexual service members.  This case was scheduled 
for oral argument in the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Dec. 
19.  That hearing was delayed after a Clinton-appointed judge was reminded 
that he had made a biased comment about the issue.  The hearing was re-set 
for mid-January with a decision expected this spring.  This case will
compete with <i>Thomasson</i> for a high court hearing next year.
<p>
On other fronts, the MRP worked with key members of Congress
to close a loophole in President Clinton's regulations on homosexuals. 
In response to Hill queries, the Pentagon's general counsel wrote a 
memo to the services clarifying Clinton's &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; 
regulations which say that &quot;sexual orientation&quot; is not a bar to 
military service. The memo was necessary because last summer a Navy 
administrative board used the faulty regulations to retain an avowed lesbian 
who promised to avoid homosexual acts.
<p>
Meanwhile, on Dec. 15, the MRP filed a Supreme Court brief in
<i>U.S.A. v. Commonwealth of Virginia</i> (the Virginia Military Institute 
case).  The Clinton administration wants the high court to impose a 
&quot;strict scrutiny&quot; standard which would make all classifications 
by gender very hard to defend legally.  With high court approval, this would 
amount to back-door adoption of the Equal Rights Amendment, reviving old 
debates about everything from the Boy Scouts to unisex bathrooms. It would 
also remove most gender-based exemptions in the military, like women serving
in infantry units.  The FRC brief argues that gender classifications
should be subject to a less exacting standard.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Hope Is a Hand-up</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>J</font>ust before Christmas, Family Research Council hosted 
an important event in Washington.  It was a one-day conference, with 
distinguished speakers like authors Michael Novak and Dr. Marvin
Olasky.  The conference was devoted to the tragedy of poverty, with a 
close look at the tricky question of welfare reform.
<p>
I'm more convinced than ever that we must look with new eyes at
the scale of this tragedy.  It's really not enough to say that certain 
kinds of welfare reform will cause suffering.  We have to come to terms 
with the degree of suffering that is happening right now -- and not just 
suffering from material want, but from the sense of purposelessness that
saps the human spirit.
<p>
Those of us who believe most fiercely in the durability of traditional
values are precisely the ones to stand up now and say that every individual 
has qualities that no welfare system should be allowed to destroy. FRC 
recognizes that the best and most compassionate help comes from
private individuals who build personal relationships and offer
material support simultaneously. A hand-up not a handout. The premise is 
that needy individuals are not &quot;clients,&quot; but fellow human
beings.
<p>
America cannot implement neat, clean, top-down policies that will
jumpstart a network of caring in every community.  Instead, each of us must 
take direct action to heal the hurt -- not at the ballot box, but in our 
neighborhoods and communities as we minister daily to needy individuals.
<p>
One happy byproduct is that our own children, by watching our
example, will grow to appreciate what is great and good.  Even strong 
parents depend on the interplay of thoughtful neighbors to help pattern 
right habits of the heart.
<p>
FRC is taking the initiative to encourage a new ethic of caring
because, I believe, social conservatives are the very people who have the 
idealism and initiative to build up a new network of helping institutions. 
As we have begun to speak out, we have discovered that the scale of the
crisis is an unprecedented opportunity for us to demonstrate, in full 
technicolor action, a fundamental truth:  Traditional values are traditional 
because they are functional.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>TRADITIONAL VALUES<br>
ARE<br>
FUNCTIONAL VALUES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
When nothing else moves the needle, God's ways work.  His love
binds up wounds.  Our service to those who are hurting is one of the most 
obvious means we have at our disposal to let earth know what heaven looks like. 
God's love looks most beautiful, in fact, against a backdrop of despair.
<p>
Dr. Virgil Gulker, founder of Kids Hope USA, tells a story about
one small step in a child's journey to God.  Kids Hope USA aims to link adult 
volunteers in one-to-one relationships with at-risk children. This Christmas 
season, one volunteer took &quot;her child&quot; to see a Christmas pageant
at her church that included a living nativity.  As Mary, Joseph,
and the baby Jesus took their places, the child Amanda turned to her new 
friend and asked with wide eyes, &quot;Is this real?&quot;  The volunteer 
replied, &quot;Oh yes, Amanda, it's very real.&quot;
<p>
That moment almost undoubtedly left a mark on Amanda's soul. In time, 
I suspect, she will be much more likely to regard that scene as real 
because one of God's loving servants was sitting by her side.
<p>

Freshmen members of the House of Representatives are in the media
glare as the budget dispute continues between Congress and the White House. 
The first-termers have been called both &quot;principled citizen 
legislators&quot; and &quot;inflexible extremists.&quot; What's the 
reality?
<p>
Nearly all of the freshmen have strongly endorsed term limits
and committed to do what they think is right, regardless of short-term 
political consequences. They want a balanced budget and tax relief for 
America's families.  Their insistence on these policies led to stronger 
agreements with the Senate than first seemed possible.  They have been 
just as tough in negotiations with the White House.
<p>
Moreover, despite President Clinton's opposition, the freshmen
have helped to restore two abortion limitations that were overturned 
during the last Congress: limits on abortion funding through federal 
health insurance programs and a ban on elective abortions in overseas 
military hospitals.
<p>
Freshmen House members also helped sidetrack a bill to fully fund
the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA).  Their efforts forced the House 
leadership to zero out NEA funding within two years.
<p>
The principles of this freshman class will be further demonstrated
in 1996 as they strive to move parental rights and religious liberties 
legislation through Congress. They are truly making a difference on issues 
vital to pro-family Americans.

<p><hr size=5 noshade><p>
<a name="un"><h2><i>UN:  Bound for Beijing</i></h2></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>rom Sept. 4-15, 1995, the United Nations (UN) will hold
its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.  The United
States will be sending a delegation to the conference -- despite
the objections of pro-familiy advocates.  First Lady Hillary Clinton
was originally slated to attend, but at latest word will not,
due to China's imprisonment of American human rights activist
Harry Wu.
<p>
<center><h3>Bracketing the Family</h3></center>
<p>
This conference purports to advance women's rights.  However,
many pro-family groups, including FRC, oppose the Beijing conference
agenda for the very reason that it denigrates women and families,
reflecting a radical feminist agenda.  For, not only is the conference
being hosted by a country with a long track record of abusing
women (e.g., female infanticide, coercive abortion policies),
but the platform document:
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>"<font size=+3>M</font>OTHER" IS BRACKETED<br>
FOR REPLACEMENT.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<b>Denigrates motherhood and traditional family life.</b> For example,
the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout the
entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed for
change to &quot;household.&quot;  Bracketed sections indicate
that delegates could not agree in advance on the text.  These
sections are to be debated in Beijing.  In addition, the word
&quot;family&quot; almost always appears in a negative context,
i.e., in relation to domestic violence or female oppression.
<p>
<b>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power play.</b>
  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform:  &quot;Inequality in
the public arena can often start within the family when power
relations between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on unequal
power relations also limits women's potential...&quot;  Thus,
rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are never used.
<p>
<b>Leaves the term &quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</b>
 &quot;Gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform
document.  But when asked to define the term, the UN rejected
the suggestion that there are two genders: &quot;male&quot; and
&quot;female.&quot;  The UN also rejected the definition of &quot;gender&quot;
as &quot;the socially-constructed roles which society assigns
to men and women.&quot;  In feminist literature, this definition
means that gender is subject to change and there exists a spectrum
of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual, female
heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual).  Instead,
the UN decided that &quot;gender&quot; was to be understood &quot;in
its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  The definition battle will
be a major focus in Beijing.
<p>
<b>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</b>
 The platform repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling[.]&quot;
 While occasionally mentioning the legal responsibility of parents
for their children, the platform refuses to recognize parental
authority regarding their children's reproductive health.
<p>
<b>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</b>
  In the tradition of previous UN conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen,
the Beijing platform urges governments to &quot;take action to
ensure that women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized
and respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  In fact, the platform elevates
reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating
that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Contact your representative and senators, either in Washington
or at their in-state office.  Tell them to speak out against the
Beijing conference, publicizing its violations of women's fundamental
dignity.

<h3>On The Hill</h3>
<p><a name="issues">
<b>The House Holds.</b> Before adjourning for its August vacation, the
House of Representatives passed two amendments to curb U.S. promotion
of abortion overseas.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) led the fight
to prevent U.S. funding of groups that seek to overturn the anti-abortion
laws of sovereign nations.  The Smith amendments would also deny
U.S. aid to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) if it continues to
participate in China's coercive population control program.  Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) intends to offer the same amendment to S.
908, the State Department authorization bill.
<p>
<b>Pro-Family Sendoff.</b> U.S. delegates to the Beijing Women's Conference
received pro-family instructions from the Senate on August 1.
 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) offered an amendment which
called on the U.S. delegation to promote a representative perspective
on the value of motherhood and the traditional family.  The amendment
also urged the delegates to define &quot;gender&quot; classically,
as in &quot;male and female, the two sexes of the human being.&quot;
 Pro-family delegates and observers participating in pre-conference
negotiations at the UN headquarters in New York were energized
by passage of the resolution.
<p>
<b>Pop Aid Bust.</b> The foreign aid bill passed by the House in July
will make it more difficult for the Clinton Administration to
carry out its population control agenda.  The &quot;development
assistance&quot; account, which has traditionally provided hundreds
of millions of dollars each year for international population
projects, was substantially reduced and a separate account was
dedicated to child survival and disease prevention efforts.  Pro-family
forces will now try to persuade the Senate to go along with the
reduced anti-population money.
<p><a name="alphabet">
<center><h3>The United Nations at Half-Century: A Primer</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he messages of congratulation poured in from all over the
world.   President Truman thanked Almighty God for bringing the
world community so far in its search for peace.  South African
Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts called its Charter &quot;not
a perfect document, by any means . . . But at least it is a good,
practical, workmanlike plan for peace.&quot;  As he presided over
the final vote to create the United Nations, taken on June 25,
1945, Britain's Lord Halifax expressed the hope that the delegates
had taken part &quot;in one of the great moments of history.&quot;
<p>
To carry out its charter, the United Nations has, over time,
created an alphabet soup of commissions and agencies.  Some of
these entities have social and economic missions; others have
military missions.  Recently, peacekeeping activities by UN agencies
in such trouble spots as Somalia (UNISOM), Haiti (UNMIH) and the
former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) have raised serious questions about
the world body's effectiveness and its proper role.  
<p>
The UN has grown with the decolonization of major European
powers and the breakup of the Soviet empire. The major bodies
of the UN have different functions. The UN's annual budget is
$4 billion. The U.S. contribution, according to our Mission to
the UN, is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.  UN documents
are printed  in the five official languages: English, French,
Spanish, Chinese and Russian.   Unless otherwise indicated, the
UN body described below is headquartered in New York.
<p>
<b>The General Assembly.</b>  The largest UN body, the General Assembly
is comprised of 185 member states.  Each member has one vote in
the General Assembly.  The General Assembly has authorized many
of the key UN agencies which have a direct impact on families.
 These include the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the UN Development Fund for Women
(UNIFEM).
<p>
<b>The Secretariat.</b> This body is headed by the Secretary-General,
who reports to the General Assembly.  He supervises executive
functions of the UN.  The Secretary-General has traditionally
been selected from the ranks of the &quot;non-aligned&quot; nations.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) currently serves in the post.
<p>
<b>The Security Council.</b>  The Security Council consists of 15
members.  Five of these -- Russia, China, the U.S., Britain and
France -- have veto powers over council actions.  The Council
is charged with responding to threats to peace.
<p>
<b>The Economic and Social Council.</b>  The 54 members of this
body are elected to terms by the General Assembly.  It is responsible
for UN efforts in the economic and social areas.  It includes
many specialized agencies.  Among them are the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO, Rome), the World Health Organization (WHO,
Geneva), the International Labor Organization (ILO, Geneva), the
very influential International Monetary Fund (IMF, Washington),
the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO), and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO,
Paris). 
<p>
<b>The International Court of Justice (World Court, The Hague,
Netherlands).</b> The 15 judges are elected to nine-year terms by
the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Questions are
decided by majority vote.  All members of the UN are members of
the World Court, as are non-members Switzerland, San Marino and
Liechtenstein.

<center><h2><font size=+3>P</font>OLICY <font size=+3>U</font>PDATE</h2></center>
<p><a name="convention">
<font size=+3><i>The</i></font> United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(UNCRC) was approved by the UN General Assembly on Nov. 20, 1989.
 It was in force on Sept. 2, 1990 after the 20th nation ratified
it.
<p>
The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine
Albright, signed the treaty on Feb. 16, 1995.  President Clinton
has said that the U.S. will spell out its interpretation of the
Convention with a statement of  &quot;reservations and understandings&quot;
that will go to the Senate.
<p>
A treaty becomes law in this country if the U.S. Senate ratifies
it by a two-thirds vote (67 Senators, if all are present).  This
has not yet happened and seems unlikely because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
<p>
In fact, on June 14, Helms introduced S. R. 133.  This resolution
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators are cosponsors.
<p>
As an international treaty, the UNCRC would be co-equal with
federal statutes, and possibly the United States Constitution.
 If the United States were to ratify the treaty as it stands,
it would become not only an international obligation, but also
a domestic obligation potentially regulating the most intimate
details of American family life. 
<p>
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
 Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
 Conceivably, taking a child to church, when he would rather not
go, could be a violation of the child's right to freedom of religion
(Article 14); telling a child to turn off the television could
violate the child's right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information&quot;
(Article 13), and so forth. 
<p>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child is a risk America's
families do not need -- and cannot afford -- to take.
<p><hr><p>
<a name="march"><center><h3>The UN and the Family: Major Documents</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he United Nations was founded in the shadow of the Second
World War, a renewed attempt by the victorious democracies to
establish an international body to safeguard the peace and promote
human rights.  From the beginning, with the drafting of the UN
Charter and related documents such as the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the UN has attempted to give voice to the common
aspirations of the world's people.  Only within the past two decades
has the UN expanded its agenda in ways that pose direct threats
to the traditional family.
<p>
Here are some major landmarks in the history of UN advocacy
regarding marriage and the family:
<p>
<b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</b> Article 16 asserts
the right &quot;to marry and to found a family,&quot; provides
that marriage must be entered into &quot;freely&quot; by the spouses,
and defines the family &quot;as the natural and fundamental group
unit of society . . . entitled to protection by society and the
state.&quot;  The Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly
in 1948.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</b>
 The Covenant, which is in treaty form, promotes special measures
to protect the family, mothers, and children.  Article 10 repeats
the definition of family in the <b>Universal Declaration</b> and calls
for &quot;the widest possible protection and assistance&quot;
to the family. Addresses such issues as family leave and child
labor.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b> Article
23 of the Covenant uses the same definition of family as the <b>Universal
Declaration</b>, and requires nations that have ratified the Covenant
&quot;to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses
as to marriage[.]&quot;
<p>
<b>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.</b> Article 12 introduces language requiring nations
to ensure access to health care, including family planning.  Like
the <b>Universal Declaration</b>, it speaks clearly of &quot;men&quot;
and &quot;women&quot; in these contexts.  Article 16 enumerates
eight specific rights as regards marriage, with emphasis on equality
of rights regarding children and property and the &quot;right
to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of
their children[.]&quot; The United States has not ratified this
Convention.
<p>
<b>International Year of the Family (IYF).</b> First proposed in
1987, the year was actually celebrated in 1994.  In the best modern
UN mode, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali announced that &quot;[t]here
is no single definition of a family.  There is no one model.&quot;
 An IYF document, &quot;The Changing Family Structure,&quot; lumped
together everything from &quot;polygamous&quot; and &quot;community&quot;
families to &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;adoptive&quot; families.
 &quot;Same-sex&quot; families also get equal footing in the document.
<p><hr width=65%><p>
<h3><center>NGO: FRC and the UN</center></h3>
<p>
&quot;NGO&quot; is one of the most commonly heard terms in
UN-speak.  It stands for &quot;Non-Governmental Organization,&quot;
and refers to private associations specifically recognized and
consulted by the United Nations.  Examples include the International
Red Cross, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Planned Parenthood.
 NGOs are first mentioned in the UN Charter of 1945 as important
resources for the General Assembly and the various commissions
it creates to address specific issues.
<p>
NGOs may be international or merely national in scope.  Their
number is large (some 1,500) and growing.  The presence of UN
Headquarters in New York City has given New York-based NGOs a
considerable advantage in lobbying the UN on a daily basis.  Some
NGOs, like WEDO, led by former Congresswoman Bella Abzug and a
major participant in UN conferences on population and the environment,
are almost fully funded by foundation money.  Others are grassroots-oriented.
<p>
NGO status can be permanent or temporary, allowing a group
access to the UN generally or merely to specific conferences.
 The Family Research Council was granted NGO status for the world
population conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1994.  FRC has
also obtained NGO status for Beijing (<i>see earlier article</i>).  This status
does not allow FRC to vote on the Beijing Plan, but it <i>will</i> make
us more effective eyes and ears for the American family.

<center><b><font size=+2><i>What So Proudly We Hail?</i></font></b><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
Americans have historically sacrificed for peace. We went
to war twice in this century for the peace and freedom of Europe.
 Americans fought and died defending the independence of Korea,
Vietnam, Grenada, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Most recently, Americans
have shouldered the burden of famine relief in strife-torn Somalia.
The American people and their government respond generously to
natural disasters. 
<p>
America has taken a leading role in supporting the United
Nations, too.  From 1945 on, the U.S. provided the greater part
of UN funding and support.  President Kennedy defended the world
organization when the Soviets tried to hamstring it with a three-man
troika in place of its single Secretary-General.  That formula
would have guaranteed paralysis -- which is what the Soviets really
wanted.
<p>
Despite this record, the UN has often been a three-ring circus
of anti-Americanism.  The U.S. has regularly been denounced as
&quot;imperialist&quot; and a &quot;war monger&quot; during what
passed for UN debates.  Efforts to empower the nations of the
&quot;South&quot; by levying confiscatory assessments on the free
industrial democracies of the &quot;North&quot; have been popular
among all too many members of the General Assembly.  Third World
delegates have cheered the so-called New World Information Order,
which is nothing more than a dignified name for press muzzling
by tinpot despots. 
<p>
Still, Americans have remained largely willing to tolerate
the UN as an important forum for international discussion.  For
the sake of peace, we have gone the extra mile.  Recent stories
about UN diplomats who have run up thousands of parking violations
in New York City and who have stiffed the Big Apple's merchants
to the tune of millions have struck nerves, however.  No warm
and fuzzy talk of &quot;cultural disparities&quot; should cover
the obvious truth:  a ripoff is a ripoff.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+3>UN E</font><font size=+2>XPANSION</font> 
 <font size=+3>T</font><font size=+2>HREATENS</font><br>
<font size=+3>U.S. S</font><font size=+2>OVEREIGNTY</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
This corruption is far less troubling than the new trend
toward building an army of &quot;blue helmets&quot; to police
the world.  UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has moved
aggressively since the collapse of the Soviet Union to assert
a new doctrine of sovereignty. <i>Sovereignty</i>. That's a key word
and concept.  Americans recognize it better by referring to our
founding document, the Declaration of Independence.  That document
set forth our right to stand &quot;among the powers of the earth&quot;
as a free and equal nation.
<p>
The Secretary General's expansive view of UN authority is
not just an opinion.  The UN fielded only two peacekeeping missions
in its first five years, but it has dispatched the blue helmet
19 times in the past four years.  Many have greater ambitions
still.  Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a communist, is
pushing a worldwide environmental initiative which sees a major
role for the UN.  Former French President Francois Mitterand,
a socialist, advocates the creation of a &quot;UN Legion&quot;
to give military teeth to the UN's resolutions. 
<p>
Veteran liberal Ronnie Dugger would go even further.  He
writes in <i>The New York Times</i> that if the member states are unwilling
or unable to man a UN Legion, the UN should accept volunteers
from the recognized Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  These
private groups are playing an increasing role in UN activities.
 The <i>Rainbow Warrior</i>, the Greenpeace ship that has confronted
whalers and nuclear test personnel, might be the first of a whole
fleet under the Dugger plan.
<p>
All of these suggestions come at a time of growing UN military
focus.  The UN Department of Peacekeeping has expanded from a
staff of 23 to more than 350 today, with a modern &quot;situation
center,&quot; staffed 24 hours a day.  What are the limits to
this mushrooming role?
<p>
As we watch the UN's Beijing Conference on Women, we should
each ask ourselves:  what if an army had the power to enforce
the resolutions passed by these delegates?  Would Americans remain
free and independent? I once considered such questions idle speculation.
 Not anymore.

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that marriage 
is &quot;the foundation of the family and of society, without which there 
would be neither civilization nor progress.&quot;

<p>

Because of its crucial role, marriage has a special status within
the culture and the law.  Its essence -- the joining of one man
and one woman in an exclusive legal, sexual, economic and spiritual
bond with the procreation of children as a desirable and common
result -- had not been seriously challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

<center><h3>Hawaiian Havoc</h3></center>

<p>

Now, a tiny segment of a tiny fraction of the population -- the
homosexual activist community -- is on the verge of radically
redefining marriage and family.  If they succeed, all distinctions
based on sex may fall, and the worst aspects of the rejected Equal
Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals will gain the &quot;right&quot;
to adopt children; schoolchildren will be taught that homosexual
sex is the equivalent of marital love between husband and wife;
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexual relationships;
churches will be pushed outside the civil law; and government
power will be wielded against anyone who holds the biblical view
of homosexuality.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  The
case, <i>Baehr v. Lewin,</i> was brought by three same-sex couples
who charged the state with &quot;discrimination&quot; for not
granting them marriage licenses.  Despite widespread opposition
within Hawaii (recent polls show that 71% of Hawaiians oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;), homosexual activists hope to impose
their agenda through compliant courts.

<p>

Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause calls
for states to honor each other's laws, homosexuals are planning
to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to the mainland
to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  About 25 states now have
efforts underway to protect marriage, and three of them -- Hawaii,
Utah and South Dakota -- have enacted new laws protecting marriage.

<p>

In Washington, a bill is being drafted to bind the federal government
to a &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition of marriage.  Tentatively
titled the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the bill would protect
the military, Social Security,  and all federal agencies from
radical redefinition of wedlock.

<p>

<center><h3>Full Court Press</h3></center>

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several other key cases
involving homosexuality are being decided in the nation's courts.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in a key Colorado
case in which voters had passed a constitutional amendment to
bar any city or county from enacting special rights based on sexual
orientation.  About a dozen cases challenging the military's ban
on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.

<p>

In Georgia, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian
fired from her job at the state attorney general's office after
she announced that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  Bear
in mind that the attorney general is required to defend Georgia's
sodomy law.  In  New York, the state's high court opened adoption
proceedings to homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexual couples,
thus devaluing marriage and jeopardizing children.

TWENTY-FIVE STATES MOVE TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The pattern is clear:  homosexual activists are using the courts
to get what they cannot achieve through democracy.  But the courts
do not operate in a vacuum.  U.S. Supreme Court justices noted
that one factor that affected the <i>Casey</i> decision upholding
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> was the court's public image.  Amherst legal
scholar Hadley Arkes notes that if Americans boldly defend marriage,
the courts may hesitate to radically redefine it.  If the states
pass marriage protection bills, and Congress enacts DOMA, the
judicial assault on traditional morality could falter.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call your Congressman and Senators and ask that they cosponsor
the coming Defense of Marriage Act.  The Capitol Hill switchboard
is 202-225-3121.

<p>

Call state legislators and ask them to support your state's marriage
protection bill, or if there isn't yet such a bill, ask them to
sponsor one.

<p>

Educate yourself about the threat to marriage today -- from mistaken
public policies and cultural decay.  Consult the enclosed reply
card for information on new resources that defend this embattled,
but essential institution.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Border Order.</b>  H.R. 2202 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.),
and two competing Senate bills, Alan Simpson's (R-Wyo.) S. 1394
and Spencer Abraham's (R-Mich.) S. 1535, each seek to reform immigration
policy.  FRC deplores nativist rhetoric and supports provisions
which reflect the following principles:  (1) Illegal immigration
must be halted; America should not reward those whose first act
in this country is to break the law, and (2) America must remain
a country that welcomes legal immigrants, with appropriate safeguards
for our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Red Letter.</b> President Clinton went on record in a Feb.
28 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
saying he will veto the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act when it
reaches his desk.  Mr. Clinton claims the legislation is unacceptable
because it does not protect a woman's life or &quot;health.&quot;
FRC responded by saying, &quot;That President Clinton would veto
a ban on a procedure characterized as four-fifths infanticide
and one-fifth abortion shows his clear disregard for the value
of human life.&quot;

<p><a name="gamble">

<b>Gambling Gambit.</b> On March 5, the House of Representatives
passed legislation to establish the National Gambling Impact and
Policy Commission.  The nine-member commission would conduct a
two-year study and report its findings to states, Congress and
the president. &quot;[T]his legislation creates no new regulations
and imposes no new mandates on gambling or state and local governments,&quot;
said its sponsor, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.).  The sole purpose,
he added, is to help communities make informed decisions on gambling
questions.  Senate consideration is next.

<p>

<b>Healthy Debate.</b> On April 18-19 the Senate will debate
a health insurance reform bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.).  The bill, which President Clinton
supports, does <I>not</I> contain medical savings accounts (MSA's),
and would give Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
the power to ensure that state health insurance plans conform
with the &quot;goals&quot; of the bill, including &quot;comprehensive
coverage.&quot;  A related House bill, sponsored by Rep. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.), is expected to contain MSA's, no new taxes,
and no defined comprehensive benefits package.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Teens and AIDS.</b> A new study released by the White House
advocates more efforts to reduce the spread of AIDS among teenagers.
Twenty-five percent of Americans infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education and HIV testing without parental notice.  Meanwhile,
a House-Senate conference committee on the Ryan White Care Act
reauthorization is deadlocked over an amendment by Reps. Tom Coburn,
M.D. (R-Okla.) and Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) to require AIDS testing
of newborns.  The Clinton administration opposes the requirement.
FRC supports it.

<p><a name="prayer">

<b>Wing and a Prayer.</b> The Department of Transportation is
at odds with a DOT employees' group over whether a prayer and
fellowship group can label homosexual behavior a sin.  The 50-member
Christian organization has waited more than 14 months for official
status because it rejects a &quot;nondiscrimination&quot; clause
that includes sexual orientation.  Group leaders say they welcome
homosexuals, but cannot agree to give them leadership positions
or sanction actions they consider sinful.  Meanwhile, DOT has
already given preferential treatment to GLOBE, the Gay, Lesbian
or Bisexual Employees group.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Court-Assisted Suicide.</b> The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled March 7 that Washington state's ban on assisted
suicide is unconstitutional.  The next day, a Michigan jury acquitted
Dr. Jack Kevorkian on charges of assisting in the suicide of two
individuals, the second time he has been exonerated.  Judge Stephen
Reinhardt, writing for the Ninth Circuit's 8-3 majority, directly
linked the ruling with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the 1973 case that
established abortion on demand.  Decision by Washington state
officials on an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is pending.

<p>

<b>Damsels in Distress.</b> A new Population Reference Bureau
study confirms what Massachusetts and California have already
found:  about two-thirds of births to teenage girls are fathered
by men age 20 or older.  In addition, a 1994 Alan Guttmacher Institute
report found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were
coerced by males an average of six years their senior.  As more
girls grow up without fathers to protect their honor, their search
for a father figure leaves them more vulnerable to predatory males.

<p>

<b>Grave But Stable?</b> Another Population Reference Bureau
report reveals both positive and negative trends among U.S. families.
Good news is that the divorce rate has leveled off, the growth
rate of single-parent families has been halved, and more two-parent
families with children have formed. However, the report also shows
that the U.S. still has the world's highest divorce rate and that
single-parent families are increasing three percent annually.
Census reports such as these sometimes reflect only a change in
demographics, not a genuine attitudinal shift.

<h3>FRC Soldiers On</h3>

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) was present on March 4
in Seattle, Washington when the ACLU and the Clinton Justice Department
once again misrepresented the military's homosexual law.  In the
case of <i>Philips v. Perry</i> which involves a homosexual sailor
who admitted to misconduct, Justice's attorney told a three-judge
appeals court panel that what the military has is a &quot;homosexual
accommodation law.&quot;  In fact, it has always had an exclusion
policy.

<p>

The government cited as evidence the fiction that some homosexual
service members have successfully convinced administrative boards
that being homosexual does not mean that they will engage in
illicit conduct.  At the hearing the ACLU asserted that homosexuals
can legally serve, and then argued that the <i>Philips</i> case
was really about discrimination.  Unbelievably, it took a judge
(a Bush-appointee) to highlight the fact that Philips had admitted
to homosexual sex with &quot;a dozen&quot; men.

<p>

The MRP has participated in five federal appeals court cases.
Most recently, on March 15, it joined the <i>Richtenberg v. Perry</i>
case which involves an Air Force captain who declared himself
a homosexual.  Like the others, he seeks to invalidate the law
and the Pentagon's regulations.  This case may present another
opportunity for the MRP to make oral arguments, as it did last
December in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. The MRP will defend the
underlying law, and the Clinton Justice Department will defend
the faulty &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.

<p>

Two cases soon to be decided, <i>Abel v. U.S.A.</i> and <i>Thomasson</i>,
are competing for the attention of the Supreme Court.  Decisions
in both cases are expected this spring, and one of them will be
appealed to the high court this summer with oral arguments likely
during the court's next term.

<p>

Meanwhile, a new administration could discard Clinton's faulty
&quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; regulations and require the
Justice Department to defend the law before the Supreme Court.
In any event, major news on this issue is only months away.

<h3>Rx for the Drug War</h3>

<p>

On Feb. 15, FRC hosted a national drug abuse prevention strategy
meeting.  Nationally known experts from diverse backgrounds and
regions came together to develop an eight-part action plan.  The
participants agreed:  the drug scourge is getting worse, and something
must be done to reignite grass-roots anti-drug efforts.

<p>

The strategy has a two-part prevention focus:  use of mind/mood-altering
drugs is dangerous to the individual and society, and comprehensive
community-based prevention is the most viable solution to the
drug crisis.

<p>

Drug education must begin at home.  The strategy calls for drug
education resources to be tied to accountability.  Drug abuse
messages must be congruent and consistently broadcast through
every educational setting (homes, schools, workplaces, communities
and media).

<p>

Law enforcement must identify all users and impose consequences
on abuse.  It must also create systematic accountability for funding
and success rates.  Key to the strategy is leadership.  Leaders
at all levels must speak clearly and serve as role models.

<p>

Grass-roots citizen action is vital.  Accountability for drug
abuse prevention must be locally based, and citizen groups must
have power over funds to make their programs work.  The media
must stop glamorizing drugs and provide truthful alternative messages.
The strategy calls for an annual report on media handling of
the drug prevention message.

<p>

Treatment for abusers should be delivered at the point of need
with accountability.  This includes providing appropriate long-term
treatment.  Finally, the strategy calls for reallocating available
drug funds with strict standards.  This year the federal government
will spread $13 billion across 140 programs with little accountability.

<p>

FRC wants the strategy to influence each political party's presidential
platform and all future drug-related legislation.   It provides
a federal model for the drug war that focuses the government on
supply interdiction and passes responsibility and fiscal authority
for prevention and treatment to local communities.

<p>

FRC's short-term goal is to have drug abuse recognized as a national
crisis. America must aim to cut current abuse levels at least
in half by the year 2000.  The long-term goal is the eradication
of drug abuse.

<font size=+2><b><i>Bashers, Bombers and Bigots</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

Several years ago, radical homosexual members of the ACT-UP group
invaded St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and desecrated
the Host.  Millions of Christians around the world believe that
Christ is really present in the sacrament of communion.  America
has had, tragically, anti-Catholic riots in its history.  &quot;Know
Nothing&quot; mobs even dumped one of the stones intended for
the Washington Monument into the Potomac because it had been generously
donated by the pope.  But Act-Up's church invasion set a new low
for efforts to offend the deeply held religious beliefs of a whole
community.

<p>

In suburban Washington, D.C., the Montrose Baptist Church has
twice been the site of suspicious fires.  No one has been charged
with arson, but church members have cited the congregation's strong
pro-life stance and its high profile during the 1992 Maryland
abortion referendum as making it a likely target in liberal Montgomery
County.

<p>

Now we have even more disturbing evidence of hatred in action.
At least 25 black churches have been hit in a new wave of arson
in California and a number of southern states. This form of bigotry
cannot be tolerated. That is why I have joined with a group of
black, Jewish, Catholic and evangelical Christian leaders to call
for prompt hearings by the Judiciary Committees of the House and
Senate.

<p>

The current wave of church bombings began on April 4, 1993.  That
was the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.  The pace of these attacks has picked up since January,
1995.  There is evidence of a pattern here, a pattern that suggests
a conspiracy to violate our civil rights laws. There is every
reason for the federal government to act.

<p>

It does not matter what motivates the haters.  Whether it is a
<i>Hamas</i> suicide bomber who catches Bus No. 18 in Jerusalem,
or a racist who wants to terrorize black Christians peacefully
worshipping here at home, terrorism is evil and we must mobilize
against it.

<center>
<i><font size=+2>WE MUST MOBILIZE AGAINST<br>
TERRORISM.</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

This is also a good time to reassert the real meaning of the First
Amendment. The right of the people to the &quot;free exercise&quot;
of religion is a precious one, bought with the blood of patriots
and martyrs.  Millions of our American ancestors came to this
country seeking this right above all others.

<p>

It does not help the cause of religious tolerance when the federal
government itself treats religion as a suspect classification.
Christian employees of the Federal Aviation Administration are
still finding their request to start a prayer group stiff-armed
by bureaucrats who welcome gay activist groups (see 
<a href="#news"><I>Newswatch</I></a>).

<p>

Moreover, the Clinton administration has recently moved to squelch
tuition assistance which has been provided since 1929 for Americans
serving in Ecuador.  The parents who chose the Alliance Academy,
a Christian school, were evidently pleased with the quality of
education provided and the spiritual and moral guidance their
children received there.  But now, with the opening of a completely
secular private school in Ecuador's capital, Quito, parents have
been told to enroll their kids in this private school or forego
the assistance the U.S. government has long provided.

<p>

Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism and racism have no place in our
sweet land of liberty. Nor does the disdainful view of too many
that religion itself is to be discouraged. As Irving Kristol has
wisely noted:  &quot;The real danger is not from a revived Christianity...but
from an upsurge of antibiblical barbarism that will challenge
Christianity, Judaism and Western Civilization together.&quot;
To which, I say: &quot;Amen!&quot;

<P>
	I am not the kind of guy who normally takes part in feminist "consciousness-raising" efforts.  But I am participating in Take Your Daughter to Work Day today because I have an eight-year-old daughter whose self-esteem matters a great deal to me.
<P>
	For the uninitiated, Take Your Daughter To Work Day is an annual event dreamed up by the Ms. Foundation in response to research showing that girls' self-esteem often plummets during the fragile pre-teen and early adolescent years.  By exposing young girls to successful women in the workplace, organizers hope that girls will learn to think more highly of females in general and of themselves in particular.
<P>
	I have a great day planned for my daughter, Allison.  This morning, I plan to take her by the offices of two women whose job it is to meet regularly with members of Congress and other public officials.  Then, I plan to have her talk with a young woman who just finished graduate school at Johns Hopkins University and is now serving as a health policy analyst.  At lunch, she'll chat with a woman who does some public speaking, and another who crunches numbers in our accounting department.  Finally, in the late afternoon, Allison is scheduled to meet with a woman who used to practice law and now manages a bevy of staff writers.
<P>
	I am sure all of this will be interesting to Allison.  But the time I am most looking forward to is the ride home.  For it is then that I plan to point out to my daughter that some of the exciting tasks carried out by my female colleagues in the workplace are tasks my wife performed in jobs she held prior to motherhood.  She used to meet regularly with congressmen and senators.  She used to do some writing and public speaking.  And she has a Phi Beta Kappa key from hr college days.
<P>
	After I remind my daughter of these things, I plan to turn to her and look her in the eye and say, "Allison, you must be a very special young girl.  Your mother could be using her talents and skills in all sorts of jobs in the workplace, but she has chosen instead to use them at home teaching you.  She must love you very, very much and think you are very, very important."
<P>
	Somehow, I think that at that moment my daughter' self-esteem will rise to a level heretofore unimagined by the organizers of Take Your Daughter to Work Day.  And for that I owe debt of gratitude to my wife, whose esteem-building job as a mother at home rarely receives the public esteem it deserves.
<P>

<center><h1>A NATION MOURNS</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n April 10, President Bill Clinton vetoed the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (PBA).  With a stroke of his pen, Clinton 
continued to authorize abortion on demand, leaving to the abortionist 
the gruesome method of his choice.

<p>

And gruesome it is. In a partial-birth abortion, a child between
five and nine months of gestation is delivered -- all but the head --
and living brain tissue is vacuumed out after the child is stabbed
at the base of the skull with surgical scissors.  A top physician
testified before Congress that babies subjected to this process
most certainly feel pain.  Strangely, if a &quot;mistake&quot;
were made and the child slipped out of the mother, he would be
legally human and fully protected from being killed.

<p>

<center><h3>Broad Support</h3></center>

<p>

The brutality of this technique seemed capable of delivering a
first -- the first federal restriction of abortion since the 1973
<I>Roe v. Wade</I> Supreme Court decision.  In fact, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo.) fought to keep pictorials of the procedure
off the House floor, but the pro-life side carried the day, winning
the votes of House and Senate members who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their careers.  Winning margins in the House were 288-139
and 286-129, and in the Senate, 54-44.

<p>

When the bill went to the White House on Good Friday, it included
an exception allowing the procedure if necessary to save a mother
whose life &quot;is endangered by a physical disorder, illness
or injury.&quot;  The bill also received important symbolic support.
Many national leaders called for the President to approve it,
including liberal columnists and prominent clergy.  Several Catholic
bishops, including two cardinals, endured a soaking rain on April
1 to pray outside the White House.

<p>

When Bill Clinton vetoed the bill, beside him stood five women
who had experienced troubled pregnancies.  The setting was designed
to suggest that PBA had been the only answer to their trauma.

<p>

But it was not even clear that the women beside him had undergone
PBA, according to transcripts of the President's remarks and
media accounts.  The President said, &quot;The emotional power
of the description of the procedure -- which I might add did not
cover the procedure these women had ... was so great ...&quot;
He also cited the bill's omission of an exception for the &quot;health&quot;
of the mother -- a term defined so broadly by the courts that, PBA
supporters say, it means unrestricted abortion.

<p>

<center><h3>Feeling Pain</h3></center>

<p>

Many myths have been reported as fact in the PBA debate.  Among
the cruelest is that anesthesia kills the baby before the procedure
is carried out, a falsehood that, dangerously, only scares many
pregnant mothers needing legitimate surgery.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
MANY MYTHS HAVE BEEN<br>
REPORTED AS FACT.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The decision on whether to attempt an override of the President's
veto rests first with the House leadership.  Since PBA began in
the House, the vetoed bill has been returned there.  If two-thirds
of the House votes to override the veto (a margin previously achieved),
then it would go to the Senate. The initial vote in the Senate
was short of the two-thirds margin needed for adoption.

<p>

The veto comes at a time when recent polls show that more than
two-thirds of Americans support either restrictions on abortion
or an end to PBA altogether.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who know that our nation
has more to offer than abortion,&quot; Family Research Council
President Gary L. Bauer said.  &quot;This is a time for us to
pray for the return of a respect for life, born out of our Judeo-Christian
heritage and honored by our nation's founders.  Our future depends
on it.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Write your member of Congress and two senators and urge them to
continue to press for enactment of the PBA.  Write or call FRC
(1-800-225-4008) and obtain a copy of our free packet (PK033) 
describing the truth about PBA's and the need
for federal legislation.  Thomas Jefferson once said that he trembled
for his country when he reflected that God is just.  A nation
that will not protect children (and mothers) at the very threshold
of birth has reason to tremble -- and to mourn.

<p>

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Omnibus Riders.</b> A new omnibus spending bill (H.R. 3019)
may include several pro-family provisions.  The Coats amendment,
which passed the Senate 63-37, would protect medical schools from
losing federal funds if they ignore an abortion mandate issued
by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 
The mandate requires medical students specializing in obstetrics
to be trained in performing elective abortions.  House and Senate
conferees on the bill are also expected to maintain restrictions
on District of Columbia abortion funding and on international
population assistance to groups that perform elective abortions.

<p>

<b>Health Savings.</b> The House recently passed a health reform
bill (H.R. 3103) by a vote of 267-151.  FRC supported the bill,
which includes 100 percent tax-free medical savings accounts for
families and individuals.  MSA's allow working families to choose
their own doctors and make their own health care spending decisions.
An amendment by Sen. Robert Dole to include MSA's in the Senate
bill, cosponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), was defeated, 52-46, under a veto threat from President
Clinton if MSA's were adopted.

<p>

<b>Et Tu, Newt?</b> House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave a speech
on March 24 endorsing a candlelight AIDS march that benefits pro-homosexual
organizations. Among them are the Whitman-Walker Clinic, which
treats AIDS victims but also runs homosexual activist workshops,
promotes lesbian parenting, and places &quot;safe sex&quot; ads
in a Washington homosexual newspaper that promotes strip clubs
and bathhouses.  The newspaper noted that Gingrich credited Rep.
Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) for asking him to publicize the march.
Gingrich also credited Gunderson's homosexual partner.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fda">

<b>Rubber Stamp.</b> After experimenting on 2,100 pregnant American
women, the Population Council recently filed a petition with
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request approval for
the abortion drug, RU 486. FDA Commissioner David Kessler had
earlier suggested that the FDA would put RU-486 on a fast-track
review process, perhaps approving the drug within six months.
FRC condemns any action by the FDA that would legitimize, for
the first time ever, a drug that would have no other use except
to kill innocent human life.

<p>

<b>Fostering Failure.</b> Dr. Henry Foster, head of a new Presidential
teen pregnancy task force, appeared with several pro-teen contraceptive
advocates at an April 10 Capitol Hill briefing.  The panelists
criticized abstinence-only programs, despite their proven effectiveness
in reducing teenage sexual activity and sexually transmitted diseases.
The panelists stressed instead more vigorous sex education programs,
increased use of contraception, and self-esteem programs. A hand-out
they distributed claimed that &quot;abstinence until marriage&quot;
programs and programs to produce &quot;secondary virginity&quot;
have not been shown to work.

<p>

<b>MIT Saber-Rattling.</b> On March 20, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology faculty task force announced that it wants to open
the college's Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program to
avowed homosexuals.  The task force encourages universities nationwide
to rethink their relationship with the ROTC and their adherence
to its homosexual policy. MIT risks losing $56 million, 16 percent
of its annual research budget, because of a 1996 law that denies
Pentagon dollars to any institution that has an anti-ROTC policy.
Last year, ROTC commissioned 7,200 officers, barely reaching
the Pentagon's goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p><a name="marriage">

<b>States of Matrimony.</b> Kansas has become the fifth state
to enact a law protecting marriage, joining Hawaii, Utah, South
Dakota and Georgia.  Other states are also acting against an expected
Hawaiian court ruling that may legalize homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
licenses, which could then be imposed on other states under the
Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  In Hawaii,
the Senate also voted 24-0 specifically to ban same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; The vote boosts the state's case in the suit 
brought by three homosexual couples that triggered the controversy.

<p>

<b>Ornery.</b> The Republican and Democratic political establishments
were both thwarted by insurgent candidacies in the April 9 Texas
primary runoff.  Former Congressman Ron Paul beat incumbent Republican
Greg Laughlin, a recent party-switcher.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich
was among those who campaigned vigorously for Laughlin. Both
candidates had vied for the support of pro-family activists.  In
the Democratic race for U.S. Senate, school teacher Victor Morales
defeated veteran Congressman John Bryant despite Bryant's support
from former Gov. Ann Richards and labor unions, including the
Texas Federation of Teachers.

<p>

<b>Revisionists Revise.</b> Revisionist historians missed the
U.S. landing on the moon and the presidency of George Washington
in their first, politically correct attempt back in 1994 to devise
national history standards. Now the latest revision, just released,
re-defines the family as &quot;a group of people from whom we receive
love and support.&quot;  The standards also endorse President
Clinton's embattled Goals 2000 plan and, for good measure, put
in a plug for equalized school funding nationwide.  Some conservative
critics were assuaged, but the standards remain a biased political
document.

<h3>Implementing Beijing</h3>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have
children at some point in their lives, the family remained a non-issue
at the 40th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status
of Women (CSW) which met in New York in mid-March.  The CSW is
planning the implementation of the Platform for Action of last
autumn's Beijing Women's Conference.

<p>

There was no statement at the session that the family had
value, no effort to protect or shore it up now that it is under
siege, not even an invocation of the UN's usual definition of
the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot; 

<p>

Most of the meeting revolved about the issues of &quot;women
and poverty&quot; and &quot;women and child and dependent care.&quot;
Noting that women constitute the majority of the world's poor,
the Commission urged governments to undertake education and training
programs and to adopt legislation promoting women's rights to
inheritance, land ownership and political decision-making.  The
&quot;dependent care&quot; debate urged redistribution of responsibilities
in the home and more part-time work, child care services and elder
care.

<p>

The session ended with the adoption of strong resolutions
condemning traffic in women and girls (a growing problem especially
in some developing countries) and wartime violence against civilians.
The Commission also approved the UN's System-Wide Plan of Action
(known as SWIMTEP) for implementing the Beijing Platform, including
its controversial provisions for health and &quot;reproductive
rights,&quot; which many UN advocacy groups hold to include abortion
and contraceptive programs for girls.

<p>

Among the tasks which SWIMTEP assigned regarding reproductive
rights were: a directive for the World Health Organization (WHO),
UNICEF and UNESCO to report on promotion of these rights to the
UN Population Division; a directive to the WHO 
and the UN Fund for Population to provide governments with technical
guidelines on methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives; and a directive to UN agencies to provide special
programs for youth regarding sexual behavior.  (These directives
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.)

<h3>FRC's Day in Court</h3>

<p>

On April 5, FRC received good news from a federal appeals
court in a pace-setting military homosexual case, <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both
the law passed by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations
on homosexuality in the armed forces.

<p>

The full court of 13 judges heard oral argument in December,
including argument presented by FRC's Military Readiness Project.
The MRP had filed two briefs in this case, both of which thoroughly
exposed the administration's failure to implement the law.

<p>

The law Congress passed is very clear:  no homosexuals in
the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the administration from creating
regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only could
serve, but could serve openly in the military.

<p>

In <I>Thomasson,</I> the majority federal judges said, &quot;no
way.&quot; They cited FRC by name as they ruled that the Clinton
regulations on homosexuals are invalid.  The judges declared that
the administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly how the White House was implementing the new
statute.

<p>

Meanwhile,  the MRP was in court April 8 to hear <I>Richenberg
v. Perry</I>, a federal appeals case involving a homosexual Air
Force officer.   Predictably, the government mischaracterized
the law, but for the first time a government lawyer spoke of the
increased risk of AIDS posed by homosexuals serving.

<p>

Government counsel quoted a gay activist, &quot;I didn't
fight all my life to remain celibate&quot; and used an illustration.
If an airman identifies himself as an F16 pilot, can't the military
reasonably infer that he flies?  The counsel said the military
excludes homosexuals for a similar reason.  After all, soldiers
who identify themselves as homosexuals will engage in illicit
behavior. The court in <I>Thomasson</I> found this logic compelling.

<font size=+2><b><i>The &quot;Big Blue&quot; Summit</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>&quot;A</font>t the end of today, give me your badge, your 
desk key and everything that belongs to IBM,&quot; Charlene Mitchell
remembers her manager saying to her.  &quot;Go home and don't
come back.&quot;  Mrs. Mitchell told <I>The Washington Post</I>
how she was &quot;surplused&quot; in 1993 by the computer giant,
known for decades as &quot;Big Blue.&quot;  It was a bitter pill
for Mrs. Mitchell to swallow.  She was the third generation in
her family to work for IBM.

<p>

Charlene Mitchell was just one of 12,500 layoffs by IBM in
the Washington area since 1987.  Nationally, more than 3.2 million
Americans have gotten pink slips from large multinational corporations
over a recent six-year period.  Many layoffs are inevitable, of
course, but controversial firing practices have become &quot;business
as usual&quot; under the leadership of a new crop of corporate
high-rollers.

<p>

IBM's chief, Lou Gerstner, Jr, bluntly told the nation's
governors in 1995 that they should &quot;confront and expel&quot;
anyone they saw as a barrier to achievement of the national education
goals. He invited them to a summit last month at IBM's New York
conference center:  &quot;We'll pull it all together,&quot; he
said.  Pull it he did.  Gerstner ruled discussion of parental
choice out of order, even though he conceded that the &quot;public
education system is broken.&quot;

<p>

Gerstner clashed with Gov. George Allen (R-Va.) behind closed
doors when the conservative opposed national curricula and national
tests.  How could Gerstner force the governors to accept his edicts?
He pointedly reminded them and the press that IBM is already
the largest employer in North Carolina and Vermont.  He enlisted
other corporate bigs into making the same threat: reform our
way or face a hiring boycott of your states.

<p>

It's ironic to be battling over education standards now.
Pro-family conservatives were among the first recruits for the
education reform movement of the 1980's.  We cheered when my boss,
Bill Bennett, called for &quot;Content, Character and Choice.&quot;
We battled the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of American education.
We wanted teachers who can teach and school curricula that emphasize
the basics:  reading, writing, math, history and reliable standards
of right and wrong.  Instead, we've seen the education reform
movement hijacked by people who have given such &quot;triumphs&quot;
as vague, behavioral Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and anti-American
history standards.

<p>

Nobody has greater concern for the future economic success
of America's young graduates than their own parents.  But it's
a mistake to look at education as just a matter of work force
preparation. Education is primarily about family, faith
and freedom.  It must pass on the heritage of Western Civilization.
When we concentrate on basics, when we respect parents' rights
and the authority of locally elected school boards, excellence
will follow.

<p>

One corporate executive at the IBM summit admitted as much.
He described his state of New Hampshire. They still have New
England town meetings to discuss school issues, he said, and parents
are actively engaged in their children's education.  The result:
top scores for New Hampshire kids on national tests, even though
the state spends very little per pupil.

<i><font size=+2>&quot;I LIKE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE<br>
MODEL.&quot;</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

I like the New Hampshire model, not the German model that
is increasingly put forward by Marc Tucker, a liberal education
theorist and close associate of Hillary and Bill Clinton.  In
the same issue of <I>Newsweek</I> (April 8) where Jonathan Alter
touted the German model for education and job training, the magazine's
&quot;Business&quot; section reported a German unemployment rate
twice ours. Mercedes-Benz is building factories outside Germany
for the first time in its history.  There is serious division
in German society -- East-West splits, anti-immigrant violence,
and skinhead, directionless youth.

<p>

We can have excellent schools if we respect parental rights,
institute parental choice and uphold our free institutions.  We
should not try to make our kids over in anyone else's image: 
Let Americans be Americans!

</center>

In 1994, Miss Hansen joined the Family Research Council's Media
Department to facilitate the networking of information between
television, print, and radio contacts and FRC's Policy Experts.
Hansen's communication skills are a factor in FRC's rapidly growing
media presence in Washington, D.C. and nation-wide. 

<p>

Her responsibilities at FRC include handling all broadcast media
requests in the area of news and talk radio as well as planning
outgoing radio tours of FRC policy experts. In addition, Hansen
associates with television and print contacts along with the Director
of Communications in order to clearly present FRC's pro-family
message far and wide. As an effective spokesperson on politics,
policy, and the media, Hansen helps FRC in generating up to a
thousand clips a month and daily broadcast interviews.  

<p>

Hansen also works extensively on the media strategy for FRC's
special projects, such as the &quot;Save Sex&quot; campaign, 
<I>Let Freedom Ring: A Basic Outline of American History</I>, <I>The
Children of Table 34</I> video, and <I>A Family Fourth: Independence
Day and Other Celebrations</I>.

<p>

Hansen's experience includes work in a sports marketing firm
and in the development of athletic ministries. Native of Southern
California, Hansen graduated from Princeton University in 1994
receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.

<p>

&quot;<font size=+3>T</font>he Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful 
antidote to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the 
hands of some injudicious judges.&quot; -- Gary Bauer, FRC president, 
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11, 1996.

<p>

On July 12, the House of Representatives approved the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA) by an overwhelming vote of 342 to 67.
The bill defines marriage for federal purposes as &quot;the union
of a man and a woman as husband and wife.&quot;  It also asserts
the power of Congress to interpret the Full Faith and Credit Clause
of the Constitution to protect the other 49 states if Hawaii legalizes
homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; as expected later this year.

<p>

<center><h3>Senate Action Soon</h3></center>

<p>

As of press time, DOMA was slated for Senate action before the
August 3 recess.  Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has threatened
to attach an amendment to the bill that would grant homosexuals
special workplace protection.  This could kill DOMA, since the
Kennedy amendment is an unacceptable, back-door way of enacting
federal gay rights legislation.  Calls are needed to Capitol Hill
to urge legislators to &quot;pass DOMA pure.&quot;

<p>

The swift consideration of DOMA is testament to the hard work
of thousands of pro-family activists who have pressed Congress
to act.  FRC's government relations staff report that Capitol
Hill has been inundated with calls and letters supporting DOMA.

<p>

On June 24, leaders of 11 state family policy councils allied
with FRC and Focus on the Family spoke in support of DOMA at a
Washington press conference that drew national and regional press
coverage.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"URGE LEGISLATORS TO<br>
PASS DOMA PURE"
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

On July 3, FRC hosted a Capitol Hill briefing on DOMA with eight
experts who analyzed the faulty research on homosexuality and
addressed the importance of traditional marriage in law, culture,
education and adoption.  Speakers included author Dr. Jeffrey
Satinover,  Transformation Ex-Gay Ministry leader Anthony Falzarano,
Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley Arkes, FRC cultural
studies director Robert Knight, social work specialist Brenda
Destro, adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former school principal
and author Linda Page, journalist Peter LaBarbera, and Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Briefing Highlights</h3></center>

<p>

The two-hour briefing ran live on C-SPAN, which repeated it three
times during the next two days.  Millions of Americans learned
facts about homosexuality and the homosexual political agenda
that are routinely omitted from media coverage.  Here are some
excerpts:

<p>

<b>Jeffrey Satinover, M.D.</b>, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child
Psychiatry at Yale:  &quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have
sunk deeply into public sentiment where they exert a powerful
influence in the shaping of public policy as it relates to family,
sexuality and marriage.  1) Homosexuality is genetic, and that
consequently, 2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea
is true, and in fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence
to the contrary.&quot;

<p>

<b>Hadley Arkes</b>: &quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument
that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the
remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but ... they have the
most profound interest...in discrediting the notion that marriage
finds its defining ground in 'nature.'  We can count on the fact
that there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue
by raising a challenge in the court....&quot;

<p>

Anthony Falzarano: &quot;I speak to you today not just as an
observer of this movement, but as one of them.  I am a former
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 until
I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle thinking that there really
wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't realize is that although
I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay.  I
had a choice.... Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle
that initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all
kinds of bondage and eventually will kill us....&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call or write your senators and urge them to keep DOMA
pure -- no amendments.  The Capitol Hill switchboard number is
202-225-3121.  Address:  U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.  20510.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Bill Emerson, RIP.</b>  A strong champion of the sanctity of
life and the family, Rep. Bill Emerson (Mo.) died of cancer June
22.  Emerson was universally admired by his colleagues and popular
with his constituents.  His public career was sparked by service
as a Congressional page at age 16.  The flag-waving families who
lined his funeral route and the members of Congress who paid him
tearful tribute during a July 12 memorial service offered praise
to his memory.  Emerson's quiet service was marked with integrity
and devotion.

<p>

<b>Istook Tries.</b> On July 11, the House passed the 1997 funding
bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education. Defeated: a pro-family amendment offered by Rep.
Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) that would have required written parental
consent before a teenager receives any services, including abortion
referrals, under the Title X federal family planning program.
The House also defeated an attempt by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.)
that would have allowed federally-funded human embryo experiments.
Current law prohibits such research on live human embryos.

<p>

<b>Unaccountable.</b> The House and Senate passed separate health
reform bills last spring with bipartisan support, yet no compromise
has been reached.  Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has been holding
the bill hostage by refusing to let the Senate leadership appoint
conferees.  Kennedy opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs), which
were contained in the House bill but narrowly defeated by the
Senate.  He has vowed to continue stalling until the leadership
appoints a majority of conferees opposed to MSAs. If Kennedy
succeeds, much-needed reforms (in access and ability to keep insurance
when changing jobs) will go by the boards.

<p>

<b>Jubilee Pits.</b> &quot;Come, Holy Spirit&quot; -- with those
words, Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) took the floor of Congress on
June 27 and defended his Christian faith, biblical sexual morality,
and FRC's role in exposing the homosexual &quot;circuit&quot;
party in a federal building in April. Dornan made the remarks
in response to a personal attack by fellow Rep. Steve Gunderson
(R-Wis.).  For a full transcript of Rep. Dornan's remarks as they
were printed in the <I>Congressional Record</I>, call 1-800-225-4008.

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fdabortion">

<b>FDA Variety Store.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Reproductive Drug Advisory Committee
initiated hearings on two new abortion drugs -- hearings not solicited
by a drug manufacturer.  On June 28, the FDA committee decided
that increased dosages of oral contraceptives were &quot;safe&quot;
and &quot;effective&quot; for use as an abortifacient &quot;morning-after
pill.&quot;  Pro-abortion groups urged the FDA to force reluctant
manufacturers to relabel oral contraceptives for post-coital use.
On July 19, the same FDA committee considered approving RU-486
for use in the US.  FRC attended both hearings and  publicly opposed
both FDA actions.

<p>

<b>China MFN.</b> The Clinton administration prevailed in renewing
China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade status for
the coming year.  On June 27, an effort to revoke China's MFN
status failed in the House of Representatives by vote of 141 to
286.  However, the House did pass a second, non-binding resolution
(H. Res. 461 by vote of 411 to 7) which called for hearings and
possible legislation to punish China for its military intimidation
of Taiwan, weapons sales, and human rights abuses.  FRC supports
hearings and opposes MFN for China because of its myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Five-ring Political Circus.</b> The 1996 Olympics in Atlanta
were, sadly, misused to advance the homosexual agenda.  The Olympic
torch run bypassed Cobb County, Georgia, and Greenville County,
South Carolina, because officials there passed resolutions opposing
homosexuality.  The torch was actually hidden in a van and driven
through Greenville County during the night.  Meanwhile, the Clinton
administration lifted the ban on HIV-infected immigrants for the
Olympics, just as was done earlier for the Gay Games in New York.
It's not known whether other infectious diseases got equal opportunity.

<p>

<b>First Advocate.</b> In a first-ever presidential interview
with a homosexual magazine, President Clinton told <I>The Advocate</I>
(June 25) that his administration &quot;has taken more steps than
any previous in bringing the gay and lesbian communities to the
table.&quot;  Los Angeles-based Liberation Publications, which
publishes <I>The Advocate</I>, also owns Alyson Publications,
a Boston-based publisher of <I>Heather Has Two Mommies, Daddy's
Roommate, Daddy's Wedding</I> and books about sado-masochistic
sex with children.  One book gives advice for homosexual pedophiles
on how to avoid prosecution.

<p><a name="marijuana">

<b>MUM's Not the Word.</b> California's &quot;Medical Use of
Marijuana&quot; initiative will appear on the November ballot.
International &quot;decriminalization&quot; promoters who have
bankrolled this initiative claim it will provide &quot;compassionate
use&quot; of marijuana without prescription for people with cancer,
AIDS and glaucoma, but the initiative allows use for &quot;any
other illness&quot; and would virtually legalize possession and
cultivation for anyone, including children.  The federal government
rejects smoking marijuana as a medicine because it has serious
physical and psychological consequences.  Physicians wishing to
prescribe THC, marijuana's active ingredient, have the FDA-approved
drug Marinol.

<h3>FRC: Ready and <i>Abel</i></h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court will decide this September whether to hear the
first challenge to the Pentagon's new ban on homosexuals in the
military.  This appeal was prompted by the high court's recent
ruling that Colorado cannot constitutionally bar &quot;special
rights&quot; laws for homosexuals.

<p>

On July 1, 1996, former Navy Lieutenant Paul Thomasson, who was
discharged for proclaiming, &quot;I am gay,&quot; asked the high
court to hear his case.  He challenged both the law passed by
Congress and the Clinton administration's regulations on homosexuality
in the armed forces.

<p>

Thomasson lost his challenge in both the federal district and
appeals courts.  The appeals court hearing was noteworthy because
it included oral argument presented on behalf of the Family Research
Council.  FRC had filed two briefs in this case, both of which
thoroughly exposed the administration's illegal plans to use the
military to legitimize homosexuality.

<p>

Thomasson's attorney said his appeal decision was influenced by
the high court's <I>Romer v. Evans</I> ruling, which struck
down Colorado's &quot;special rights&quot; amendment.  He claims
that the judicial landscape has improved greatly with <I>Romer</I>.
Writing for the Supreme Court's minority in the <I>Romer</I>
decision, Justice Antonin Scalia said there is &quot;no foundation
in American constitutional law&quot; for the court's ruling.

<p>

It's expected the Clinton Justice Department will favor the appeal
request.  If the court accepts <I>Thomasson</I>, oral arguments
will likely be held this fall with a decision next spring.  The
military's ban should be upheld -- if the Supreme Court relies
on the constitution.

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) has participated in 12
homosexual court cases so far.  Should the <I>Thomasson</I> case
be heard, the MRP will file an amicus brief and ask the high court
for time to make oral argument.

<p>

Meanwhile, also on July 1, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit returned the <I>Abel et al. v. Perry</I> case
to federal district court directing that judge to determine whether
the military can constitutionally exclude soldiers who engage
in homosexual conduct.  The lower court previously ruled that
the First and Fifth Amendment rights of the six service members
in <I>Abel</I> were violated when the military sought to discharge
them based solely on their <I>admission</I> of homosexuality,
without regard to actual conduct.

<h3>Ban the Postcards!</h3>

<p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate and was vetoed by President Clinton on April 10,
1996.  The House will first attempt to override the President's
veto shortly after Labor Day. A two-thirds majority of those
present and voting is required to override.  If the House vote
is successful, the Senate is expected to make an override attempt
shortly thereafter. These are crucial pro-life votes.

<p>

On June 29-30, the nation's Catholic bishops sponsored a massive
pro-life postcard campaign (in local churches) to members of Congress
to urge support for the override.  It is expected that millions
of postcards will flood Capitol Hill in the next month or two.
The House Post Office has reportedly hired extra workers to deal
with the heavy influx of cards.

<p>

The Clinton White House is not waiting for the cards to react,
however. Administration officials at the Pentagon attempted to 
silence Catholic chaplains on military bases by issuing a directive 
forbidding them to mention the postcard campaign in church. They 
claimed it involved &quot;partisan political activity,&quot; a 
claim belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban was 
passed overwhelmingly by bipartisan majorities in both houses of 
Congress.  Many Catholic service members and their families believe 
that they were illegally denied the guidance of their priests and 
bishops on this vital issue. A legal defense fund which specializes 
in religious liberty cases is reportedly planning to file suit on 
behalf of military chaplains who believe that their First Amendment 
rights were violated.

<p>

FRC urges concerned citizens to call on their legislators to override
the veto by talking with them personally, especially at local
&quot;town meetings&quot; during the August congressional recess.
Calls and/or letters to the members' district offices are also
encouraged.  Please continue to educate your friends and neighbors
about partial-birth abortions by writing &quot;letters to the
editor&quot; to local newspapers, participating in radio talk
shows, etc.

<font size=+2><b><i>The Court's Conscientious Dissenter</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>J</font>ustice Antonin Scalia is making a name for himself 
as a conscientious objector to a Supreme Court run amok.  He is heard 
most often from the dissenting side these days, frequently accompanied 
by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas.
His dissents are noteworthy -- some would say notorious.  Justice
Scalia has an uncanny knack for cutting through the majority's
sophistry and sloppy self-justification to make a stunning legal
defense of American tradition, true democracy, plain old common
sense and decency.

<p>

Scalia shines the light of truth on &quot;this most illiberal
Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after
another of the current preferences of the society (and in some
cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society's
law trained elite) into our Basic Law.&quot;  He believes that
it is &quot;no business of the courts (as opposed to the political
branches) to take sides in the cultural war.&quot;  We at FRC
believe the same, and Scalia's measured umbrage is our vicarious
voice.

<p>

In response to special rights gained by the well-funded gay lobby
in several Colorado cities, voters across the state approved a
constitutional amendment that would prevent any person from getting
such legal privileges solely on the basis of their homosexuality.
The Court majority said that the amendment was unconstitutional
because it was obviously born of hatred against gays, despite
what the Coloradans say.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
THE COURT UNASHAMEDLY<br>
OVERSTEPS ITS AUTHORITY.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Scalia retorted that &quot;[t]he Court's portrayal of Coloradans
as a society fallen victim to pointless, hate-filled 'gay-bashing'
is so false as to be comical.&quot;  He also deplored the sinister
effect of the Court's &quot;verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence
to traditional attitudes.&quot;  Scalia charged the majority with
&quot;tak[ing] sides in the culture wars,&quot; specifically,
choosing &quot;the views and values of the lawyer class from which
the Court's Members are drawn&quot; and supporting this choice
&quot;by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine.&quot;

<p>

The Court unashamedly overstepped its authority, he wrote: &quot;Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia took up his pen again in the case challenging the male-only
admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute:  &quot;Since
it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United States
-- the old one -- takes no sides in this educational debate, I
dissent....Today the Court shuts down an institution that has
served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and
distinction for over a century and a half.&quot;  To do that,
it &quot;sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores
the history of our people.&quot;

<p>

In one of the last cases of the term, Justice Scalia rhetorically
shook his head: &quot;The court must be living in another world.
Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution
for a country I do not recognize.&quot;

<p>

Those are stark words from the bench, words befitting the steady
dismantling of legislative prerogatives today's &quot;conservative&quot;
Supreme Court is engaged in.  But Scalia is no doomsayer.  A recent
report of a celebration of his first 10 years on the bench with
his present and former law clerks noted that, despite his angry
dissents, Justice Scalia is a happy man with a sense of hope.
Apparently he knows, as we know, that ours is not in the winning,
but in the trying.

This month marks a departure from the usual format of <i>Washington Watch</i>. While most families are beginning summer vacations from school, Congress is entering the heart of its regular legislative schedule.  This special issue of <i>Watch</i> is designed to bring you up to date on what FRC regards as the most important pro-family policy measures pending on Capitol Hill.
<p>
On the inside pages, you'll find a convenient "scorecard" on the legislative achievements of the 104th Congress.  You may want to keep a copy handy for future reference.  Feel free to duplicate copies of these pages as you see fit for your neighbors or your church.
Bulk copies of this issue of <i>Watch</i> are available on request.  Just dial 1-800-225-4008 for information.
<p>
And remember -- for current pro-family legislative information, updated every Friday, dial FRC at 1-202-783-HOME (a toll call).
<p>
<i>Watch</i> will return in its regular format in July.  In the meantime, drop me a note and let me know how well <i>Washington Watch</i> is serving your need for timely facts and findings about how the family fares in national policy.

<font size=+2><b><i>Dear Reader:</i></b></font>
<p>Late last year, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> asked me to write an essay on what pro-family Americans expected from the new Congress.  I was happy to do so, even though I had to begin my article with a concession.  The concession was this:  the new Congress should keep the promises made in the Republican Contract with America -- most of which involved economic and structural reforms -- then turn to the social agenda:  reversing the breakdown of the family, defunding our grossly mismanaged (and too often simply gross) arts agencies, protecting the sanctity of human life, reforming the education mess.
<p>
In the last four months, the pro-family movement has helped to implement a lot of reforms related to the budget and the economy.  Now it's time to deal with issues related to our families and values.  Patience may be its own reward, but in public policy, too much patience can be poison.  In my two decades in Washington, I have witnessed only a handful of opportunities for progress on a pro-family platform.  We are now in the midst of such an opportunity.  We can move forward and see dramatic policy change to strengthen the family unit morally, socially and economically.
<p>
Or we can see the opposite.  Because just as this opportunity is upon us, so too is there unprecedented danger to the family.  Every parent in America senses this fact.  To read a daily newspaper is to be bombarded with a hail of horrors.  To look at our nation's illegitimacy rate -- and to understand its correlation with youth crime -- is to recognize that America may be just a decade away from an explosion of street violence.  To see the staggering toll of abortions, the pressures on our court system to sanction euthanasia and assisted suicide, and other anti-life trends, is to know that the nation is perilously close to complete dissolution of the Judeo-Christian consensus that has sustained it through the centuries.
<p>
A wise veteran on Capitol Hill put our situation to me bluntly.  For the first time since it has been his job to understand the pulse of the American people, he cannot tell which way this nation is headed.  In the next five years, he said, anything seems possible, from a religious and pro-family renaissance to an utter collapse of traditional values that brings on drug legalization, homosexual marriages, and all-pervasive pornography.  
<p>
Life and death truly have been set before us.  Which way we will choose?  What follows in this special edition of <i>Washington Watch</i> is an effort to lay out an agenda for <i>the way of life</i> -- an American way of life.  My hope is that you will share these pages with your friends, your neighbors and those with whom you attend church.  Each of us has the responsibility to take a clear look at the alternatives that lie before us -- before the window of opportunity is shut.

<p>
<i>Introduction:  The architecture of family freedom is no accident, even if, once upon a time in America, government officials almost instinctively adopted policies to protect family stability and promote civic character.  Today, both deliberate and unintentional assaults upon the family have multiplied.  But the structure of the family is written on the heart of humanity.  Lawmakers can ignore that God-given structure, but they cannot erase it.  Here are ways that the 104th Congress can help to restore family-friendly public policy</i>.
<p>
<a name="life"><center><h3>Restoring the Sanctity of Human Life</h3></center>
<p>
<b>1. The Civil Right to Life.</b> Four members of the House, two Democrats and two Republicans, have introduced constitutional amendments to restore the right to life of children before birth.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has introduced S. 320, the "Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act."  It would put Congress on record as declaring, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion and that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was improperly decided.  It would also bar any federal funding or promotion of abortion, and provide for an expedited right of appeal to the Supreme Court when any abortion restriction is found unconstitutional by a lower court.  These proposals do not merely "modify" the abortion right, they would give protection to unborn children for the first time in 22 years.
<p>
<b>2. Members Against Dismemberment</b>. As a first step toward providing constitutional protection for unborn children, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will offer legislation to ban "partial birth abortions," which involve the heinous D&X procedure performed on unborn children 20-26 weeks of gestation.  Hearings are scheduled this month in the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution.
<p>
<b>3. "Lady Liberty" Means No to Forced Abortions.</b> The Clinton administration has shown blatant disregard for fundamental human rights by overturning previous administrations' asylum policy for families fleeing China's coercive "birth quota" system, with its forced abortions and sterilizations.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) recently attached language to the foreign aid bill (H.R. 1561) to restore the previous policy.  By record vote of  240-181 on the same bill, the House voted to deny U.S. foreign assistance dollars to non-governmental groups that perform or provide abortions, or that lobby other nations to repeal their laws restricting abortion.  The same measure would also require the United Nations Population Fund to end its involvement in China's draconian family planning program -- or lose all U.S. funds.  H.R. 1561 should pass the House as is, and the Senate should agree.
<p>
<b>4. Adopt Adoption Assistance.</b> In an effort to encourage adoption by lowering financial obstacles, the House of Representatives has passed a budget provision which allows taxpayers a $5,000 credit for qualified adoption expenses.  The Senate did not include the adoption assistance measure in their budget measure, passed on May 25.  An amendment offered by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) that included the credit was defeated on May 23 by vote of 69-31.  The differing budgets now go to a House-Senate conference, and FRC will be working to ensure that the adoption credit survives in the final bill.  Adoption is the <i>option of choice</i> for dealing with crisis pregnancy.
<p>
<b>5. No Abortion Mandate</b>. Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) will introduce legislation to prohibit the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) from requiring hospital ob/gyn residency programs (including religious hospitals) to train or refer medical students to perform abortions, lest they lose accreditation.  At stake are federal  Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement dollars.  Subcommittee chairman Hoekstra also scheduled a June 14  hearing in the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee to examine ACGME's coercive policy.
<p>
<a name="education"><center><h3>Empower Parents for Education</h3></center>
<p>
<b>6. Be True to Our Schools.</b> At last, serious efforts are under way to dismantle the U.S. Education Department.  The House budget resolution withdraws funding for the department.  In addition, the House Education Task Force's "Back to the Basics Education Bill" returns authority to the state and local level.  This is a high-priority issue for FRC; action could come in Congress within several months.  The decline in American education parallels the rise of the Department of Education; it's time to test the linkage in reverse.
<p>
<b>7. Be True II.</b> The House has taken one small swipe at Goals 2000, the omnibus education legislation that transferred unprecedented education authority from localities to Washington, D.C.  Last month, the House passed H.R. 1045, which would eliminate NESIC, the equivalent of a national school board set up by the law.  Congress should now repeal <i>all</i> of the intrusive programs instituted by Goals 2000.  Kudos to Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has raised the issue in the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and to Gov. George Allen of Virginia, who has refused to accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  We have to free our children from the control of the national education bureaucrats and their allies at the National Education Association.
<p>
<a name="purse"><center><h3>Protect the Family Purse</h3></center>
<p>
<b>8. Pro-child Tax Credits.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit helps relieve the tax burden on American families.  The House of Representatives has passed a tax bill that includes the $500-per-child credit and has also included it in its budget resolution.  Unfortunately, the credit's fate in the Senate is uncertain:  key Republican senators are raising doubts about the bill, and the Senate budget resolution passed on May 25 omitted it.  The Senate should change course and act to protect the family budget as it works to fix the federal budget.
<p>
<b>9. Don't Forget Health Reform.</b> Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) has drafted legislation, not yet introduced, to change the income tax code to permit individual Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  These MSAs would give individuals and families greater control over their health care decisions, resulting in your family having coverage even if you change jobs, decreased costs, and broadened access to health care services.  FRC has joined a coalition of pro-family groups to promote such legislation.  The effort in 1994 to turn over health care to the government -- socialized medicine -- was defeated.  Sound reform is more critical now than ever.
<p>
<a name="wilderness"><center><h3>Tame the Cultural Wilderness</h3></center>
<p>
<b>10. Ban Homosexuality in Uniform.</b> Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved when Congress passed a reform bill in 1993.  Wrong.  The Clinton administration ignored the text of the law when it wrote the implementing regulations, effectively lifting the ban anyway.  Now the administration is using the federal courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a losing case in the Supreme Court.  New legislation is imperative.  None is pending, but FRC's Military Readiness Project, with senior advisers former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow, is seeking Congressional support for appropriate amendments to the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.
<p>
<b>11. Porn-Free Cable TV.</b> With the encouragement of FRC, Reps. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Chris Smith (R-N.J.) have introduced legislation that would require cable TV operators to provide basic cable packages free of pornography.  Meanwhile, pro-family groups are working on alternatives to Sen. Jim Exon's (D-Neb.) Communications Decency Act of 1995, S. 314.   Exon's bill is a well-intentioned attempt to restrict transmission of pornography via computer, but may actually make it more difficult to prosecute.
<p>
<b>12. Porn-Free PXs</b>. Under current policy, military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether or not it fits the definition of "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of <i>Miller v. California</i>.  The services oppose removing so-called "soft-core" pornography from exchange shelves because of the threat of legal action from the ACLU.  President Clinton has the unilateral authority to remove pornographic material from military stores.  He should do so, and Congress should adopt a resolution urging that action upon him.
<p>
<a name="misguided"><center><h3>Reform Misguided Federal Programs</h3></center>
<p>
<b>13. True Welfare Reform.</b> The full Senate should vote on a measure to restore the anti-illegitimacy provisions that were adopted by the House but then eliminated by the Senate Finance Committee on May 25.  The critical provisions are:  a restriction on federally funded cash benefits for adolescent unwed mothers; a "cap" on benefits  to mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and bonus payments to states that succeed in reducing their illegitimacy rates without increasing the number of abortions.
<p>
<b>14. X Out Title X.</b> Title X of the Public Health Service Act -- a program which funds family planning projects throughout the country -- has been a dismal failure, especially among teenagers.  Since it began in 1970, out-of-wedlock births, pregnancies, and abortions among teenagers have all risen sharply.  Sexually transmitted diseases have multiplied in variety and are on the rebound as well.  Last year, Title X received $194 million in your tax money.  This summer, FRC will work to change that figure to zero.  Planned Parenthood will be poorer, but adolescent well-being should flourish.
<p>
<b>15. Cures, Not Activism.</b> Federal taxpayers spend billions on AIDS through the Ryan White Care Act. Unfortunately, much money now goes to groups promoting homosexuality to school-children through "AIDS education." The Act is the single largest source of funds for homosexual activism. A Washington, D.C., recipient, the Whitman-Walker Clinic, endorses "safe" bathhouse sex (with condoms) and holds gay political seminars. Basic reform is needed.
<p>
<a name="ideas"><center><h3>Other Family-Friendly Ideas</h3></center>
<p>
<b>16. Women at Arms.</b> The Clinton administration has conducted an aggressive campaign to thrust women into military combat.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness.  Congress should convene hearings and prepare legislation that puts readiness first.  If they don't, someday soon your daughter could be drafted.
<p>
<b>17. Off the Dole.</b> The Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), sponsored by Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Cal.), would limit federally funded persons or organizations, such as contractors and advocacy groups, from lobbying Congress for more funding.  It would also prohibit lobbyists from receiving federal funds.  The legislation would not apply to recipients of entitlements and would not restrict the ability of individual citizens to communicate with their elected representatives.
<p>
<b>18. Revitalize Drug Abuse Prevention.</b> Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to a resurgence of pro-drug sentiment in popular culture, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The administration's drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" -- treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress is considering cuts in drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership.  New legislation is needed to address this plague. 
<p>
<b>19. Liberate the Arts.</b> The House passed a budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) on May 18, providing no funds for the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The resolution also ends funding for public television after three years.  A separate bill (H.R. 1557), passed by a House committee on May 10, would phase out the endowments by 1999.  Meanwhile, several senators have introduced S. 856, a bill that would keep the NEA alive.  FRC and other pro-family forces favor total defunding.  Artists need their freedom -- and so do taxpayers.
<p>
<b>20. Restore Religious Rights.</b> Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a congressional coalition in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  The language of the amendment is not yet final, but it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other forms of religious expression wherever non-religious expression is permitted.  The amendment is also likely to ban discrimination against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.  No more second-class status for this First Amendment freedom.
<p>
<b>21. Restore Parental Rights.</b> Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) are working on legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.  Such a law would, for instance, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.  State constitutional amendments to protect parental rights have also been introduced in over half of the states.  Public policy cannot put families first if it does not empower parents.
<p>
<b>22. Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism.</b> Pro-family groups are calling for defunding of the Legal Services Corporation.  The $415 million per year program purports to provide legal services to the poor but often engages in politically motivated legal assaults on the family.  Since 1974, taxpayers have given LSC $5 billion, some of it used for things like obtaining cable TV for prisoners, fighting welfare reform, seeking public abortion funding, and forcing states to fund sex-change operations.

<a name="meaning"><center><h3>The Meaning of Family</h3></center>
<p>
On the grounds of the U.S. Capitol there is a small cluster of crab apple trees, one of the most moving monuments in all of Washington.  The cluster was planted on June 12, 1952 in memory of the Sullivan brothers, five sons of Iowa who died in 1942 during an attack upon the <i>U.S.S. Juneau</i> in the Solomon Islands.
<p>
After this devastating tragedy, the U.S. Navy changed its policy allowing service by family members on the same vessel.  Never again would a single American family lay, simultaneously, so "costly a sacrifice on the altar of freedom." (A. Lincoln)
<p>
In 1942 the contributions of American families -- the meaning of <i>family</i> -- to our nation's well-being and survival were never in question.  Today, as the accompanying <i>Blueprint</i> shows, our nation is at grave risk of forgetting all that the courage and faithfulness of families have given this land.
<p>
As Americans commemorate the family during this month of June -- from  
celebrations honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, to Father's Day -- Congress could give the nation no greater gift than to make pro-family legislation a priority.
<p>
FRC's writers and analysts are working overtime to bring the best family policy analysis to print.  Our recently expanded Government Relations staff is responding to an over-rising tide of requests for information.  Your partnership with us in this effort is essential.  FRC deeply appreciates your prayers and financial support.  If you can remember FRC with an additional gift this month, thank you.  Please use the enclosed reply card.

<a name="budget"><center><h1>KEEPING BUDGET<br>
REFORM ON TRACK</h1></center>
<font size=+3>W</font>hite House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor
George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today
the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully
maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his &quot;no new
taxes&quot; pledge. Today, they decry &quot;a train wreck&quot;
they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. 
<p>
First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996
Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months
paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future
wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.
<p>
House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution
that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut
federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period,
but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton
and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the
proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. 
<p>
<center><h3>Media's False Picture</h3></center>
<p>
Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and
the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget
in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional
Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found
a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that
he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal
also produces <i>$2 trillion in new federal debt</i>.
<p>
Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming
that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They
claim the tax cuts will &quot;explode the deficit,.&quot;  But
more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief is
dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately
three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families
with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families
at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes.
Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition
of the tax package will be very &quot;family friendly.&quot;
<p>
Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending
programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending
is projected to <i>increase at twice the rate of inflation</i>
even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.
 The argument that tax cuts &quot;explode the deficit&quot; is
answered by pointing out that <i>tax revenues</i> actually increased
by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending
increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a
budget surplus today. 
<p>
Not a penny can be spent unless both houses approve. This gives
the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers'
money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal
subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal
activism. Congress has an obligation to use its &quot;power of
the purse&quot; to protect the legitimate interests of the American
family.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>BUDGET "TRAIN WRECK"<br>
WON'T HAMPER ESSENTIAL<br>
SERVICES</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><h3>A Contest of Wills</h3></center>
<p>
Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may get
through October by short-term "continuing resolutions," but by early November,
the Treasury's authority to borrow money will expire.
 Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling. 
If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash will occur. But 
<i>essential services</i> like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social
Security checks will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will
be a great hue and cry from the liberals who see their funds disappearing.
<p>
A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest
groups.  What happens if a few weeks go by and the public
doesn't miss the &quot;services?&quot;  That would provide a very
powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national
debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of
several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a
 liberal &quot;train wreck&quot; to get our country back on track,
that may be a small price to pay.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<a name="porn"><b>Calculating Moves.</b> The cyberporn debate has gone behind closed
doors during Congress' recess.  FRC has participated in several
meetings to work on a package to address this menacing aspect
of exciting new communication technology.  Later this month, Congress
will make final decisions about bill language.  Lawmakers should
stand firm in their commitment to enact strong laws against this
exploitative material, and not be swept in by the liberals' false
promise of &quot;parent-empowering&quot; software.  The software
might help, but it is no more a substitute for strong pornography
laws than bullet-proof vests are a substitute for laws against
homicide.
<p>
<b>Saving Health Care.</b> The Clinton health care plan is dead but the
issue of health care reform is still alive.  Escalating health
care costs are one of the biggest threats to the current system.
Congress is likely to consider  H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps.
William Archer (R-Texas) and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.), to allow
tax-free medical savings accounts in which families or individuals
set up a special account for lower-level health care expenses,
typically around $2,500.  The benefit is the account is tax free,
portable, and can carry over from year to year for future health
needs. HR 1818 has 90 cosponsors. In the Senate, Chuck Grassley
(R-Iowa) has taken the lead in pushing the medical savings account
concept.     
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Quarterback Kemp.</b> The 14-member commission on taxes headed by
former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Jack Kemp, is
expected to give its report to the congresssional Republicans
 in October.  The commission examined a flat tax plan (with no
deductions), a national sales tax, and other proposals to simplify
the tax code.  Pro-family advocates will be especially interested
in how the commission handles tax treatment of families, charitable
contributions, and home ownership.
<p>
<b>New Security Order.</b> President Bill Clinton Aug. 4 signed an Executive
Order barring the federal government from denying security clearances
to homosexuals.  The 13-page order &quot;establishes a uniform
Federal personnel security program&quot; for all federal employees
to include members of the military and commercial contractors.
 It states, &quot;No inference...may be raised solely on the basis
of the sexual orientation of the employee.&quot;  Homosexuality
has long been a red flag for national security officers performing
background investigations  because it is so often linked to known
security risks, such as drug and alcohol abuse, promiscuity and
violence.
<p>
<b>Gay Asylum, Yes. Moms, No.</b> While Mrs. Clinton talked about advancing
women's rights during the Beijing conference, 13 Chinese women
were being imprisoned by the United States and awaiting deportation
back to China. Their crime?  Fleeing China's forced abortion policies.
 Even though these Chinese women will face extreme punishment
in slave labor (Lao Dai) camps or even death if they are returned
to China, Bill Clinton has refused to grant them asylum.  In a
reversal of the Reagan-Bush immigration policy, Clinton declared
that forced abortion was no longer grounds for political asylum.
He has instead extended asylum to homosexuals fleeing &quot;persecution.&quot;
<p>
<a name="polls"><b>Polls Go South.</b> Recent public opinion polling suggests 
that Americans are not altogether pleased with Congress. A <i>Wall Street 
Journal/NBC News</i> poll found that 53 percent of respondents <i>disapprove
</i>of Congress' performance and only 36 percent approve, while
a <i>New York Times/CBS News</i> poll found a 56 percent disapproval
rating and a 31 percent approval rating for Congress.  Interestingly,
however, according to a <i>Times Mirror</i> poll, the Republican
party is ahead of the Democratic party by a greater margin than
when they swept Congress last November -- 50 percent to 43 percent.
 Taken together, these results suggest that Americans are less
satisfied with the pace of change than the direction of change.

<h3>Children's Defense?</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>W</font>hile President Bill Clinton's anti-smoking campaign grabbed
headlines, his administration went to court against a South Carolina
university hospital's very successful mandatory drug testing/treatment
program for pregnant cocaine-addicted women. Mothers who refuse
treatment for themselves and their unborn children would face
arrest and jail time. The program works. Most women stayed drug-free
during their pregnancy. Still, Clinton's aides charged that South
Carolina's program was punitive and violated the addicted mother's
&quot;privacy rights.&quot;  Is the health and well-being of unborn
children less important than those who already born?
<p>
<a name="aids">Then there is the issue of 7,000 deliveries per year in U.S.
to HIV-infected women. About 2,000 of these infants are infected
with HIV. Rep.Tom Coburn (R-Okla.), who is a medical doctor, and
Rep. Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) plan to offer an &quot;infant testing&quot;
amendment to the Ryan White Care Act (H.R. 1872/S. 641) that would
require states -- in order to qualify for federal Ryan White Care
funding -- to pass laws requiring every newborn be tested for the
HIV virus if mother does not (voluntarily) undergo prenatal
testing.  The amendment would require the test results to be told
to mothers, and it also encourages HIV counseling, testing and
treatment of pregnant women.
<p>
According to Dr. Coburn, his amendment is an important step in
combating AIDS.  &quot;In fact, studies have shown that the rate
of transmission of the virus from mothers to children can be reduced
by two-thirds if the drug AZT is administered during pregnancy,
labor and the first six weeks after birth,&quot; Coburn explains,
&quot;Knowing the status of the baby right away would allow treatment
and counseling to begin immediately and prevent an uninformed
mother from transmitting HIV to her baby through breast feeding.&quot;
<p>
Presently, 45 states require up to <i>nine</i> mandatory generic
newborn tests, such as syphilis and hepatitis, but not HIV. As
a public health issue, the incidence of AIDS in infants requires
that common sense become public sense.

<h3>Defending our Defenders</h3>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>RC has filed an <i>amicus curiae</i> (&quot;friend of 
the court&quot;) brief with the U.S. Supreme Court in the &quot;Amendment 2&quot;
case.  Media reports contend that <i>Romer v. Evans</i> will decide
whether the Constitution allows Colorado to &quot;discriminate
against&quot; homosexuals. Wrong. The case is really about
whether the people of Colorado may decide not to grant special
protected legal status to this &quot;class&quot; of persons.
 The Supreme Court justices will hear oral argument in the case
 Oct. 2.    
<p>
<a name="gay">In the military, homosexual servicemen have begun filing lawsuits
to block their discharge.  FRC is working on the following cases:
<ul>
<li>In <i>Philips v. Perry</i>, FRC filed the winning brief calling
for the dismissal of a case filed by a homosexual sailor seeking
to block his discharge.  In the case, Philips admitted past sexual
misconduct and his intention to engage in future misconduct. 
The federal district court dismissed Philip's case, and FRC is
preparing another brief arguing against his appeal.  
<p><li>A federal district court June 9 upheld the military's policy
on homosexuality in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>.  The ruling was
based upon the pre-1993 exclusion policy, not on the Department
of Defense's  (DoD) new &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; regulations.
 This is significant.  The Clinton administration has argued that
its 1993 change in policy was necessary to avoid constitutional
problems, but the Thomasson ruling shows that the &quot;old
rules&quot; were constitutionally sound.  Thomasson has appealed
this ruling to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, and FRC has
filed a brief supporting the constitutionality of the old policy.
</ul><p>
The <i>new</i> DoD regulations were the subject of a challenge
in the case of <i>Able v. U.S..</I> The federal district court
judge in Able ruled that six service members' First and
Fifth Amendment rights were violated when the military sought
to discharge them solely based on their open admission they were
homosexuals, and ruled that the Pentagon was enjoined from discharging
them.  Attorney General Janet Reno has appealed the ruling, but,
given the Justice Department's  lackluster performance so far,
FRC does not anticipate a vigorous effort at the appeals court
level.  FRC has filed an <i>amicus</i> brief setting forth all
of the key arguments for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals
which the Clinton administration has ignored. FRC's efforts have
been undertaken by the Military Readiness Project, a joint task
force of FRC and senior retired military leaders.

by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
School's back. The bumper stickers on buses remind us to be careful
of the youngsters. Time was when accidents going to and from school
were the main worry of parents. No more. Today, we have concerns
about violence and drugs in schools. Many parents are troubled
by efforts in school to undermine the values and beliefs the kids
are taught at home. And, of course, there's OBE. Outcome-based
Education is the latest in a long line of educational fads that
have dumbed down American classrooms. 
<p>
<center><h3>&quot;Re-structuring&quot; SATs</h3></center>
<p>
Now, it seems, even the SATs have been affected. The Scholastic
Aptitude Tests have been  an important measure of how well our
young people are doing.  I remember during my service as President
Reagan's Undersecretary of Education how we pointed to the 85-point 
skid in SAT scores (1960-80) as indisputable proof of educational
decline. We even prodded a sluggish education establishment to
cough  up the extensive data we published as &quot;the Wall Chart.&quot;
That chart demonstrated that many of the states which spent the
least per pupil nonetheless produced students with the highest
scholastic aptitude. Was I unpopular with the bureaucrats!
<p>
Despite a 93 percent spending hike in the 1980s, the education
establishment continued to crank out under-prepared graduates.
So the SATs have been subjected to steady criticism from liberals.
Finally, the College Board has responded. With great fanfare,
education leaders announced that this year's scores were -- UP!
That <I>would</I> be great news except for some inconvenient truths.
First, this is a new and improved SAT test. They call it SAT I,
but its real name should be <i>SAT-lite.</i> It has fewer
questions, but it allows students 30 minutes more to finish. The
designers of SAT-lite have thrown overboard the more challenging
antonyms section, making it easier to score high on the the verbal
portion of the exam. Oh, and it's now OK to use a calculator.
No more unfair advantages to those grinds who memorized their
times tables! 
<p>
Test-makers say  they have changed the SATs in order to keep
up &quot;with what and how students are learning today.&quot;
What and how students learn today is increasingly determined by
President Bill Clinton and Education Secretary Dick Riley under
their ill-conceived &quot;Goals 2000&quot; legislation. Of course,
the College Board disclaims any attempt to dumb down the SATs.
But they are funded by the U.S. Department of Education. We could
hardly expect them to bite the hand that feeds them. With these
new SAT-lite test results, the Clinton administration will be
able to reassure concerned parents: &quot;See, our reforms are
working!&quot;  But this is the same team that called the State
of Ohio on the carpet last year for requiring high school graduates
to pass an eighth grade-level test. The Clinton administration
said those tests might be racially discriminatory.

<center><h3>Excellence the Goal</h3></center>
<p>
Make no mistake: pro-family Americans don't want kids
to fail in school. We believe that a stress on solid academic
basics, giving special needs children the extra help they may
require, is the best way to progress. We believe in competition
and a commitment to excellence. We know that parents are the key
to real education progress. And we think parents should be able
to choose the safe and challenging school that meets their childrens'
needs. We don't believe it helps anyone artificially to try to
build up a child's self-esteem by lowering the standards. Minority
children, as well as special needs kids and rural kids, can achieve.
The pursuit of excellence helps everyone.

<center><h1>THE LEAST OF THESE</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>D</font>oes increased social spending equate with better 
childhoods? For lack of a better answer, both Republicans and Democrats 
have been inclined to say &quot;yes.&quot;  Social spending by the
federal government for children and families has increased dramatically
since 1960, far exceeding the rate of inflation.  Yet, almost
all indicators suggest that child well-being today lags behind
what it was three decades ago.

<p>

Social spending advocates expect government to substitute
for mothers and fathers.  But noted child psychologist Urie Bronfenbrenner
has written that what a child needs more than government programs
is the &quot;irrational emotional attachment&quot; of fiercely
loving parents.

<p>

It's time to acknowledge that government can't buy love for
children any more than money can buy happiness for adults.  What
children really need are a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>Parents, Not Programs</h3></center>

<p>

Rather than winking at government's encroachment on families,
Congress should move quickly to pass pending parental rights legislation
(S. 984; H.R. 1946).  The legislation would neither create new
rights for parents nor repeal child abuse laws that protect children.
The new law would simply protect parents' rights to decide what
is best for their children without excessive interference from
Washington.

<p>

Having affirmed the central importance of parents, government
does sometimes have a role to play in helping parents.  One good
example is &quot;Megan's Law,&quot; which Congress has just passed
and the President has signed.  The new law requires states to
notify local law officials when convicted sex offenders are released
from prison and requires the police to notify the public when
a dangerous sex offender moves into the neighborhood.

<p>

<center><h3>Yes to Adoption</h3></center>

<p>

The community, of course, must step in to provide for children
who have no parents of their own.  But the importance of parents
remains the same -- or is even greater -- for children who are
alone.  The best government can do is to speed these children
into loving homes where loving parents are waiting.

<p>

&quot;The Adoption Promotion and Stability Act of 1996&quot;
(H.R. 3286), passed by the House but not yet by the Senate, offers
hope for vulnerable children currently free to be adopted.  In
the United States alone, there are over 50,000 foster children
awaiting adoption.  Over 20,000 children have been waiting for
a family for years.  The new legislation includes a $5,000 
non-refundable tax credit for qualified adoption expenses (for both 
domestic and international adoptions).  In order to eliminate unnecessary 
waiting periods for minority children in foster care, the legislation
also prohibits the use of racial considerations if they cause
a delay or denial of an adoption placement.

<p>

New adoption incentives will help some children; but Conna
Craig, President of the Institute for Children, argues that only
an overhaul of the foster care system will save children like
John.  A skinny kid who loves baseball, John has been waiting
for a home for nearly all of his 10 years.  Legally free to be
adopted since he was three, John's childhood is fast slipping
away.  He needs policymakers to understand that every child needs
a mom and a dad.

<p>

<center><h3>It Takes a Pro-Family Village</h3></center>

<p>

Even strong two-parent families require strong communities
to help pattern for children right habits of the heart.  When
so many children are languishing without families of their own,
community becomes all the more important.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
STAND FOR CHILDREN?<br>
STAND FOR FAMILIES.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

&quot;The American Community Renewal Act of 1996,&quot; spearheaded
by Republican Congressmen James Talent (Mo.) and J. C. Watts (Okla.),
will strengthen communities more than any government handout
ever could by offering tax incentives for charitable giving, public
housing reform, and an end to government regulations that stifle
economic development in depressed neighborhoods.  By rebuilding
communities, we will strengthen the hands of parents -- and restore
some of childhood's lost innocence.

<p>

It's fair to admit that it takes a village.  Just as long
as we really mean a local &quot;village&quot; that preserves parent
autonomy, instead of a federal fiefdom that chains both children
and families to an all-powerful state.  Standing for children means
standing for families first.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Senate Shake-Up.</b> Robert Dole leaves the Senate on June
11, freeing him of the need to navigate the Senate's procedural
obstacles.  Dole's departure has also set off a chain reaction
of races for top leadership posts in the Senate.  Majority Whip
Trent Lott and Republican Conference Chairman Thad Cochran are
vying to succeed Dole, with most insiders predicting a Lott victory.
GOP Policy Committee Chairman Don Nickles is running unopposed
to succeed Lott in the number two position of Whip.  Both have
advocated limited government, traditional family values, and the
sanctity of life.

<p>

<b>Suicide with Dignity?</b> The House Judiciary Subcommittee
on the Constitution recently held a hearing on assisted suicide.
The hearing followed two new federal circuit court decisions
legalizing &quot;physician-assisted suicide.&quot;  Witnesses
discussed the legal and moral ramifications of the rulings.  The
Ninth Circuit based many of its arguments on the <I>Roe</I> (1973
abortion decision) interpretation of &quot;privacy,&quot; overturning
a law approved by Washington State voters to ban assisted suicide.
The Second Circuit overturned a similar New York law. Several
members of Congress are writing legislation to reverse or restrict
these flawed decisions.

<p>

<b>Aiding Babies.</b> Congress has passed a measure under the
Ryan White Care Act to reduce the transmission of AIDS from pregnant
women to their babies.  The provision promotes voluntary counseling,
testing and treatment for pregnant women and the testing of newborns
for HIV.  Testing of newborns for HIV will be required if states
have not reduced the number of infected infants by 2000.  This
issue had been in deadlock for months because of opposition by
certain homosexual and feminist groups.  They argued that it could
lead to expanded mandatory AIDS testing and infringe on a woman's
&quot;right to privacy.&quot;

<p>

<b>PX Porn.</b> The House of Representatives' 1997 Defense Authorization
Act bans future military sales of pornography.  Last year the
Pentagon sold 12.6 million copies of 219 different pornographic
magazines, earning $4.3 million.  Military customers pay less
than the market price and pay no tax.  Government vending of pornography
sends the message that profiting from material that demeans women
is okay.  But common sense and science show that readily available
porn encourages, rather than discourages, episodes like Tailhook.
Senate action is next.

<p>

<b>Gambling Loses.</b> Pro-family forces, overcoming a well-financed
gambling industry campaign, secured Senate committee passage
of legislation to create a Gambling Impact and Policy Commission
(S. 704) on May 14.  The House passed similar legislation (H.R.
497) on March 5.  The unanimous Senate vote eases the way for
final congressional approval.  The Gambling Commission, which
has been granted subpoena power, will evaluate the industry's
impact on families, businesses and society.  The Commission will
submit recommendations for Congress and the states and will provide
insight into the consequences of legalized gambling.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Bioethical Lapse.</b> President Clinton will soon appoint
15 members to his National Bioethics Advisory Commission.  The
commission's role is to &quot;identify broad principles to govern
the ethical conduct of research.&quot;  A White House office released
a revealing list of potential nominees.  Among the extreme views:
a Harvard Medical School professor who advocates legal changes
in the definition of death so that organs can be harvested for
transplantation before brain death occurs, and a Yale lawyer who
argues that parents who withhold birth control from their adolescent
children commit child neglect.

<p>

<b>Racial Reconciliation.</b> Family Research Council recently
hosted a meeting of African-American leaders in Washington, D.C.,
to discuss projects for racial reconciliation.  Among the goals
of the meeting was to reaffirm FRC's desire to address the specific
needs and concerns of all families, regardless of race or culture.
Participants explored how FRC and other family organizations
can more effectively fulfill the pro-family mission and help to
heal ethnic divisions in modern America.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Sleet, Snow, and Frosty U.S. Attorneys.</b> On May 9, the
U.S. Postal Inspection Service successfully busted a nationwide
child pornography ring, despite the refusal by U.S. Attorney Janet
Napolitano and others to cooperate.  Napolitano, a Clinton appointee,
reportedly refused to authorize a search warrant for the operation
because she felt it improperly targeted homosexual men.  However,
inspectors were able to obtain the search warrant from local authorities.
Senators Bob Dole (R-Kan.) and Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) have asked
Attorney General Janet Reno to investigate Napolitano to determine
whether she wrongly impeded the sting.

<p>

<b>Pro-life Planks.</b> Twelve Catholic and Protestant pro-life
leaders (including Gary Bauer) have signed a public pledge supporting
the current Republican platform language on legal protection for
unborn children.  While most media stories have focused on 
&quot;inside-the-beltway&quot; Republican skirmishes over this language, 
many pro-life Democrats are disturbed about their party's entrenched position 
favoring abortion on demand. Some 40 pro-life House Democrats are urging
party leaders to rewrite the 1996 platform to support at least
some protection of prenatal life.

<h3>FRC: Friend of the Family</h3>

<p>

The battle for pro-family policy is increasingly being fought,
not only in the halls of Congress, but in the courts.  In many
cases, groups opposing pro-family policies take advantage of liberal
courts, avoiding public and congressional debate of controversial
issues.  FRC has filed amicus curiae (&quot;friend of the court&quot;)
briefs in many cases, several of which are highlighted and described
below.

<p>

FRC has been active in defending anti-pornography laws in
cases like <I>ACLU v. Reno</I>.  In this case, FRC acted
as co-counsel defending the Communications Decency Act.  Our brief
defends the constitutionality of the Act, which is designed to
prohibit the knowing distribution of pornography to children.
No matter the outcome, all parties anticipate that the case will
ultimately go to the Supreme Court.

<p>

FRC has also been vocal in pro-life cases around the country.
Most recently, FRC filed an amicus brief in <I>Shenck v. Pro-Choice
Network</I>, a case to be heard in the Supreme Court in October
debating the constitutionality of court-ordered, 15-foot &quot;floating
bubble zones&quot; around patients entering and exiting abortion
clinics.  These &quot;zones&quot; are specifically intended to
prevent peaceful demonstrators from talking to anyone going in
or out of an abortion clinic.

<p>

In <I>United States of America v. Commonwealth of Virginia</I>,
FRC has co-sponsored a brief defending the right of the Virginia
Military Institute to admit males only and to continue receiving
government funds.  This case holds implications for all publicly
supported single-sex schools, whether military or not, across
the country.

<p>

<I>Romer v. Evans</I> (the &quot;Amendment 2&quot; case)
was decided on May 20.  FRC filed an amicus curiae brief asserting
that the Supreme Court of Colorado wrongly negated the people's
right to pass laws that deny special rights to homosexuals.  The
6-3 Supreme Court decision means that pro-family voters are effectively
precluded from winning on this issue at the state level, at least
insofar as a measure binds lower political jurisdictions.

<p>

Melinda Paras, spokeswoman for the National Gay and Lesbian
Task Force, commented that the decision drives a &quot;stake through
the heart&quot; of ballot measures sponsored by pro-family groups.
FRC is examining options for a legislative response to <I>Romer,</I>
and the House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution has
promised to hold hearings.

<h3>Free Needles for Junkies?</h3>

<p>

A major media push is under way, using government reports,
to prove that giving clean needles to drug addicts slows the 
spread of the AIDS virus without encouraging illegal drug use. 
But the evidence is inconclusive and should not be used to 
start dangerous needle give-away programs.

<p>

Two of the three medical doctors on the leading and much-cited
government needle study say that needle exchange programs (NEPs)
&quot;are not the panacea their supporters hope for.&quot; They
favor more drug treatment rather than exchanges.

<p>

A 1993 law permits the government to use federal funds to
support exchanges if they can be scientifically shown to slow
the AIDS virus without increasing drug abuse.  So far, however,
needle studies are problem-plagued.  They rely on self-reporting
by addicts, downplay sexual transmission of the AIDS virus, generally
ignore the impact on communities near exchange sites, trivialize
the drug problem and never measure HIV seroconversion rates, the
only true indication of effectiveness.

<p>

Philip Lee, assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services
and a former needle researcher, has expressed concern that NEPs
&quot;may send a mixed message about drug use.&quot;  There are
75 NEPs now operating in 55 U.S. cities without federal funds.
These programs provide free drug-injecting supplies, condoms,
advice on shooting drugs properly, warnings about bad heroin,
and counseling that sometimes leads to treatment.

<p>

Lee Brown, President Clinton's first drug czar, said he &quot;can
find no compelling reason&quot; to fund NEPs.  Barry McCaffrey,
the nation's new czar, has said, &quot;The problem is not dirty
needles; the problem is heroin addiction.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Our goal should be to eliminate drug abuse,&quot; says
Rep. Charles Rangel (D-N.Y.), &quot;not to find a cleaner, safer
way to do it.&quot;  Dr. James Curtis, director of the Department
of Psychiatry, Harlem Hospital Center, says exchanges are &quot;poor
medicine&quot; and &quot;promote a breakdown in law and order.&quot;

<p>

Although the science is inconclusive, expect AIDS activists
and pro-drug legalization forces to pressure the federal government
to approve funds for NEPs.

<font size=+2><b><i>Renewing Our Vows</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n announcing his support for the just-introduced 
federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana had
this to say:

<p>

&quot;The definition of marriage is not created by politicians
and judges, and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in
our history, our laws, our deepest  moral and religious convictions,
and our nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and
one woman.  This fact can be respected or it can be resented.
But it can't be altered.&quot;

<p>

If someone had told me five years ago that we would find
ourselves in 1996 defending marriage as the union of one man and
one woman, I would have asked him if he wanted me to take him
to my leader -- jokingly, of course.

<p>

Yet this idea of opening marriage to homosexual couples,
which seems more suited to another planet, is stalking the land.
Prompted by an impending court decision in Hawaii, legislators
in more than 30 states are rushing to protect their marriage statutes.
As of this writing, 11 states had enacted marriage protection
laws. 

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

<center><i><font size=+2>
ELEVEN STATES HAVE ACTED TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

At the federal level, the Defense of Marriage Act was introduced
in the House on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob
Barr (R-Ga.) and in the Senate on May 8 by Don Nickles (R-Okla.).
It is being endorsed by a slowly growing list of Congressional
sponsors, but many more are needed -- and swiftly, as the Supreme
Court decision in <I>Romer v. Evans</I> illustrates (<I>See</I> 
&quot;Courtwatch,&quot; page 3).

<p>

This is the most important pro-family legislation in many
years.  If marriage falls, it will begin a domino effect that
will totally redefine families within the law and culture.  For
starters, children will be taught in school that homosexuality
is the moral equivalent of marital love, businesses will be forced
to subsidize homosexual relationships, and churches that uphold
biblical morality will find themselves outside the civil law.

<p>

On Mother's Day, I debated Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) on
<I>This Week With David Brinkley.</I>  I reminded Mr. Frank that
it was fitting that we were discussing this on Mother's Day, since
our celebration of motherhood is one of the most powerful expressions
of just why the idea of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; is so
dopey.  But it is more than dopey; it is dangerous.

<p>

If unelected judges in Hawaii are able to impose their will
on the rest of the nation through the Constitution's Full Faith
and Credit Clause (which compels the states to recognize each
other's licenses and records), then what's safe?  If two men can
marry, why can't three men?  Or two men and a woman?  Or a man
and a boy?

<p>

During our debate, Frank made the usual unfounded charge
that his opponents are motivated by &quot;hatred&quot; and 
&quot;prejudice.&quot; He repeated what has become homosexual activists' 
key argument against DOMA:  it is unnecessary.  Homosexual 
&quot;marriage&quot; is still illegal all over the U.S.  In other words, 
Barney Frank and friends want us to wait for a judicial defeat before we 
take the field in defense of marriage.  I'm sorry, but that's not good
enough. Marriage is the God-given foundation of society, and if
we let it be ruined, our children will rightly hold us responsible.

<p>

During the Battle of Britain, when things looked darkest,
Winston Churchill told the English people to &quot;never give
up.  Never, never, never, never give up.&quot;  Well, friends,
not only won't we give up defending marriage, we cannot give up.
I urge you to call or write your senators and congressman now
and press them to sponsor DOMA. Next Mother's Day, I don't
want to be debating a triumphant Barney Frank and his newly married
&quot;spouse.&quot;

On May 19, the Family Research Council placed a full-page ad in 
<i>The Washington Post</i> with the tag line, "Let's Save Marriage, 
Before the Whole Cake Crumbles." The ad summarized the arguments for 
preserving the institution of marriage as a legally binding 
relationship between one man and one woman. <b>For a copy of the ad,

<li>Pennsylvania faces <B>uproar over unauthorized physical exams</B>.

Parents assert such exams, while not illegal, are inappropriate
without their prior permission.  With the promotion of &quot;school-based

<a name="family"><center><h1>Family Hopes</h1></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the impression left by the recent O.J. Simpson 
trial, a large majority of black Americans support get-tough efforts to combat 
crime.
<p>
According to FRC's newly released Family Issues Survey, 82 percent
of blacks favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals to work while serving their 
sentence.&quot; Seventy-seven percent favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals 
to pay their victims and their victims' families financial compensation for the
pain, suffering, and economic hardship they caused.&quot;  Moreover,
85 percent of blacks favor &quot;requiring criminals to undergo drug tests to show 
that they are drug-free before completing their sentence.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>Choose Life</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC poll, conducted by the Voter/Consumer Research Firm, also
found that:
<p>
<li><b>Adoption is considered the best response -- and abortion the
worst response -- to an unwed pregnancy.</b>
<p>
When asked what is the best response to an unmarried pregnancy,
29 percent choose adoption, 24 percent say marrying the child's father, 11 
percent choose single motherhood, eight percent opt for abortion, and the 
rest either volunteer that &quot;it depends&quot; or say they &quot;don't 
know.&quot; Conversely, when asked which of these options would be worst, 55 
percent say abortion, 13 percent say single motherhood, 12 percent say marrying 
the child's father, and six percent choose adoption.
<p>
<li><b>Most Americans -- including rank-and-file pro-lifers -- strongly
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.</b>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock.&quot; 
Two-thirds (66 percent) say they &quot;strongly&quot; oppose such
increases.  Another 18 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare
benefit increases for illegitimacy. 
<p>
Only 13 percent say these increases are justified. Among those
who &quot;strongly&quot; favor laws against abortion, 70 percent 
&quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap, and another 16 percent 
&quot;somewhat&quot; support this measure.
<p>
<li><b>The religiously devout are more apt to give and volunteer --
and say they would do more if government welfare programs were dramatically 
cut or abolished.</b>
<p>
People who attend worship services at least once a week report
higher levels of giving (97 percent) and volunteering (79 percent) than any 
other demographic group. Frequent churchgoers are also more likely to say they 
would give and volunteer more if &quot;government welfare programs
were cut back dramatically, or abolished.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Even young people think today's popular culture encourages
teen sex, violence and drug use.</b>
<p>
When asked to assess the degree to which today's movies, television,
and music lyrics encourage teenage sex, 63 percent of young Americans say 
&quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Fifty-six percent
offer identical responses to a question about the entertainment
industry's role in encouraging violent crime, and 47 percent say the same 
about pop culture's contribution to alcohol and drug abuse. Moreover, 75 percent 
of Americans aged 18 to 30 either &quot;strongly&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; 
agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in today's movies,
on TV, and in music lyrics do not represent my own views.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Single parents say families need help shielding kids from harmful
cultural influences.</b>
<P>
Only 36 percent of all single parents -- and 33 percent of divorcees
-- say parents can adequately shield children from violent or sexually-explicit 
material by themselves.  Better than 60 percent of single parents agree 
with the statement, &quot;These days, it is too difficult for parents to deal 
with this alone.&quot;  Moreover, 92 percent of all those surveyed say they
do not believe public libraries should make <i>Playboy</i> magazine available 
to children without parental permission.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>FOUR FIFTHS OF AMERICANS<br>
FAVOR FAMILY TAX RELIEF.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<li><b>Most Americans strongly support permanent tax relief for families
raising children.</b>
<p>
Roughly four out of five Americans (79 percent) favor tax relief
for families raising children. Sixty-one percent say they would rather have 
&quot;a permanent tax cut beginning next year&quot; than &quot;a
temporary tax cut beginning this year.&quot;  Only 26 percent
say they would prefer temporary relief immediately.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Partial Victory.</b> Accommodating the request of a majority of senators,
a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was held on the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act (H.R. 1833) on Nov. 17. The bill passed the House by vote of 288-139 
on Nov. 1, drawing the votes of such infrequent supporters of abortion limits 
as Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and freshman Rep.
Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.).  Nurse Brenda Shafer told the Senate
committee that she assisted an Ohio abortionist with several partial-birth 
abortions, but was repulsed and then quit.  Senate floor action is likely 
before Dec. 7.  The Clinton White House continues to signal a veto.
<p><a name="gambling">
<b>Gambling Scourge.</b> Rep. Frank Wolf's bill (H.R. 497) to create
The National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission is gaining momentum. The 
bill, which has broad bipartisan support, does not outlaw, tax, or regulate 
gambling, but recognizes its growing influence. In 1993, Americans
made more trips to casinos than they did to major league ballparks.
 Today, casinos operate in 23 states, and 37 states have lotteries.  Studies 
show that gambling increases public corruption and other criminal activities. 
It cannibalizes legitimate businesses, and government's gambling-related
costs for regulation, lost productivity and family disintegration
outstrip the economic gain.
<p>
<b>Budget Break?</b> The battle between Congress and the White House
moved to the next stage Nov. 19 with an agreement to enact a balanced budget 
within seven years, using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic estimates. 
President Clinton reversed course and agreed to negotiate legislation by Jan. 
1 to achieve the zero deficit goal. Republican concessions on
spending control are likely.   FRC will work hard to keep the
$500-per-child tax credit in the GOP bill, as well as real spending limits 
to avoid leaving our children a legacy of debt.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Playing the Odds.</b> Gambling industry political action committees
(PAC) are influencing legislation such as proposals to tax gambling revenues 
and regulate the American Indian gaming boom.  Gambling is projected to grow 
to an $80-billion-per-year industry this decade. According to the Federal 
Election Commission, PACs gave $321,942 to the major political parties in 
1993-94, and four non-PAC industry gifts totaling $690,000 went to the 
Republican National Committee in 1994. Columnist William Safire warns 
that state-sponsored gambling is a &quot;cancer ravaging society, corrupting 
public officials and becoming the fastest-growing teenage addiction.&quot;
<p>
<b>Murphy Brown Sweeps.</b> According to a new Census Bureau report,
America is experiencing a rise in the number of Murphy Brown-style moms. 
The study, released in early November, shows that the proportion of 
college-educated, never-married women who have given birth has more
than doubled in the past 10 years, while the proportion of young,
single, black women giving birth has dropped. The report also says that 
the illegitimacy rate among all never-married white women rose from 6.7 
percent to 12.9 percent.  The greatest rise in this group was, indeed, among 
women who are managers and professionals.
<p><a name="divorce">
<b>Divorce, American Style.</b> The U.S. divorce rate dropped slightly
in 1994, but <i>The Economist</i> magazine reports that divorce is still more 
common in America than anywhere else in the world. To combat this problem, 
a growing number of pro-family state leaders are working to reform
divorce laws to protect individuals who want to save their marriages
rather than promote the interests of individuals initiating divorce proceedings. 
By a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent, Americans support such reforms, 
according to FRC's newly-released Family Issues Survey.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>FRC Intervenes.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Fourth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals granted a motion Nov. 20 that will permit FRC to present 
oral arguments in a key case involving homosexuals in the military. The 
case <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i> is likely to reach the Supreme Court next 
year. FRC sought to intervene in the appeals court to argue that the
Clinton administration regulations at issue do not faithfully reflect 
Congressional intent and will result in allowing declared homosexuals 
to serve.  Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, will represent 
FRC at the Dec. 5 hearing.
<p>
<b>Young Guns.</b> A quarter of those arrested on weapons charges are
juveniles, and such offenses are the fastest growing crime among adolescents. 
Juvenile weapons cases have grown 86 percent since 1985 to more than 61,000 
arrests last year, and teen gun violence has risen steadily even
though the number of teens has declined.  Weapons offenses include
illegal use, possession, importing or exporting of guns, ammunition and the 
like.  Attorney General Janet Reno warns, &quot;If the last decade's trends 
continue unchecked, juvenile arrests for violent crime will double by the
year 2010.&quot;
<p>
<b>Money Talks.</b> A record turnout of Maine voters narrowly rejected
a proposal on November's ballot to deny special rights to homosexuals.  Four 
hundred thousand voters took part in the 53 to 47 percent outcome.  
Pro-homosexual rights forces spent an unprecedented $1.2 million, 10 times 
more than those who oppose special rights.  Despite the close vote, 
homosexual activists are pushing ahead with their plans to introduce gay rights 
bills into the Maine legislature for the 10th time.  None has passed to date.

<h3>The Bare Non-Necessities</h3>
<p>
Did local schools notice the difference when 89 percent of the
U.S. Education Department's 5,500 employees were sent home as 
&quot;non-essential&quot; federal workers during the recent budget show-down? 
Equally unnoticeable is any improvement resulting from Washington D.C.'s 
recurrent attempts at top-down education reform:  National Education Goals,
the Goals Panel, Goals 2000, the National Standards for U.S. History.  With all 
the rhetoric and frenzy over initiatives with such visionary titles, you'd 
expect to see some results as 1995 draws to a close.
<p>
But when the National Education Goals Panel met in November to provide a 
halftime report on progress toward the eight National Education Goals, set in 
1990 for the year 2000, they could point to no significant improvement. 
&quot;Progress is spotty at best,&quot; said Albert Shanker, President of 
the American Federation of Teachers union.  The panelists urged patience; 
Americans put up $3 million this year to hear the Goals Panel stall for time.
<p>
Americans are growing increasingly impatient with dismal academic
test scores year after year. Recently released results from the 1994 
National Assessment of Educational Progress remain poor: less than a 
third of the students tested were proficient readers; 57 percent of high 
school seniors scored &quot;below basic&quot; in their knowledge of U.S.
history.  Writers of the National Standards for U.S. History released last 
year thought they could improve performance by imposing an official body 
of knowledge.  However, if the 30,000 copies already distributed make their 
way into classrooms, students will continue to know more about Madonna,
whom the standards mention, than they do about Robert E. Lee, whom the standards 
ignore.
<p>
Regrettably, our millions earmarked for education reform over
the past five years have been ill-spent on bureaucracy and systems management. 
Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education, suggested in 1989, &quot;I'd 
give the education reform movement another five years.  If we're not able
to get our schools back to where they were in 1963, after spending
40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare bankruptcy, give the people 
back their money, and let them start their own schools.&quot;  Time's up. We 
want our money back.

<h3>We the Parents</h3>
<p>
FRC has taken its battle for parental rights to the Supreme
Court.  FRC joined forces with the Of the People Foundation and asked the 
high court to hear the case of Massachusetts students and parents who oppose 
a school district's program of condom distribution to junior high and high
school students.  A &quot;friend of the court&quot; petition was
filed on Nov. 15.
<p>
In early 1992 the Falmouth School District adopted a policy
whereby school nurses were instructed to distribute free condoms to students 
as young as 11 years old -- even over their parents' objections.  Condom 
machines were also installed in high school student restrooms. FRC's brief 
argues that the program violates the parents' right to direct the upbringing 
of their children as well as the right to free exercise of religion.
<p>
In 1993, New York's highest court ruled that an identical public school 
condom distribution program violated the right of parents to rear their children 
as they see fit.
<p>
This dispute highlights the need for legislation to acknowledge
and solidify parents' fundamental rights.  To accomplish this, Sen. Charles 
Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) have introduced the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 (H.R. 1946).  The
act establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and
provide for the education and religious teaching of their children, and also 
addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline. Importantly, 
the act allows the government to intervene when it has a compelling interest 
to do so, and has specific allowances for cases of child abuse and neglect.
<p>
Support this much-needed legislation by calling or writing
your representatives today.

<p>
<font size=+3>G</font>en. Colin L. Powell has declined to run for President in 
1996. He has also said that he will not accept the Vice Presidency, though 
time may change this decision. Finally, he is joining the Republican party. 
These are crucial decisions.
<p>
As everyone knows by now, Powell had described himself as 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; on abortion during an interview with ABC's 
Barbara Walters on the eve of his national book tour.  That position, 
combined with the warm reaction to his candidacy among some conservative
leaders in Washington, raised the real possibility that, for the first time 
in two decades, the Republican platform next year would reflect a 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; position on abortion.
<p>
The media response to this prospect, as well as to Powell, was
wild excitement.  From a strict news sense, it's not hard to understand why. 
A Powell candidacy presented historic opportunities: the nomination and 
possible election of the first black American President. Second, a GOP 
abandonment of its pro-life plank would have caused an earthquake
on the American political landscape.  Earthquakes are hard news.
<p>
The Republican Platform calls for a constitutional amendment to provide legal 
protection for the unborn.  It also calls for the appointment of judges who 
respect traditional values and the sanctity of innocent human life.  Has it 
made much difference?  One conservative leader has said that a pro-choice 
president like Powell &quot;could do more to lower the number of abortions 
than a presidential candidate who claims to be pro-life, who supports a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortions, but who does nothing more than pay 
lip-service to the pro-life constituency.&quot;
<p>
Of course, pro-life Americans want no part of this leader's dilemma.
 They prefer a third way: someone, Republican or Democratic, who not only claims 
to be, but is, pro-life, who supports full legal protection for the unborn, 
and who will pay service to that goal in both speech and action.

<center><i><font size=+2>PERSISTENCE ISN'T<br>
ALWAYS APPRECIATED.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
So why are pro-life Americans so often made to feel like skunks at the wedding 
party?  Partly, I'm sure, it's because nothing is more alien to the modern 
American mind than a moral absolute, even when that absolute is the 
overwhelming duty to refrain from taking innocent human life.  Second,
there is the matter of persistence.  It isn't always appreciated.
<p>
In his <i>Lincoln: The War Years</i>, Carl Sandburg retells the story
of a White House reception after Lincoln's Second Inaugural. Frederick 
Douglass, the black anti-slavery leader, tried to enter the White House 
to greet the President.  Guards barred his way.  Douglass eluded them 
and rushed through the door.  He was seized and escorted to a plank that
led outside through a window. Once again on the street, he asked a 
passerby entering the White House to tell Lincoln that &quot;Frederick 
Douglass is detained by officers at the door.&quot;
<p>
Hearing the news, Lincoln invited Douglass into the East Room, and the 
journalist finally greeted the reelected president.  Lincoln told Douglass 
that he had seen him in the crowd listening to his address. &quot;There 
is no man's opinion that I value more than yours,&quot; Lincoln told him, 
&quot;what do you think of it?&quot;  Douglass replied, &quot;Mr. Lincoln, 
it was a sacred effort.&quot;
<p>
In this world of slippery slope relativism, where rights to do
wrong are enshrined among our political commandments, the pro-life cause 
is often treated like an unwelcome guest.  As 1996 approaches, some of 
the political &quot;palace guards&quot; are already trying to show us to the 
window again.  As they do so, we could use a little of the spirit of
Frederick Douglass.  After all, this cause is a sacred effort, too.

</center>

Robert H. Knight examines cutting-edge social issues that affect and 
are affected by cultural values.  Of special interest are federal 
policies relating to arts funding, sex-related topics and education, 
censorship and freedom of expression, as well as the role of public 
interest groups and the media.  Mr. Knight wrote, produced and 
directed the 1994 FRC video documentary about Alfred Kinsey, <I>The 
Children of Table 34.</I>

<p>

Prior to joining FRC, Mr. Knight headed a similar program as Senior 
Fellow for Cultural Policy Studies at the Heritage Foundation.  
That program examined federal policies that undermine the traditional 
values of family sovereignty, religious freedom, property rights, 
individual responsibility and the idea of limited government.

<p>

While at Heritage, Mr. Knight authored studies on the 
<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95a1cu.html">National Endowment for the 
Arts</A>, the U.S. Labor Department's regulatory disputes with the 
Salvation Army, the federal role in early childhood education, and 
the debate over the exemption of women from military combat roles. 
He testified before the U.S. Senate's Labor and Human Resources 
Committee in July 1994 as well as the Presidential Commission on the 
Assignment of Women in the Armed Services in 1992, and was an expert 
witness in the 1993 Colorado legal case dealing with Amendment 2, 
which barred cities from extending special civil rights protections 
based on sexual orientation.  He also testified in January 1995 before 
a House Appropriations subcommittee concerning the Corporation for 
Public Broadcasting and at a CPB public hearing in Washington in 
January 1994.

<p>

Before joining Heritage in September 1990, Mr. Knight was a Media 
Fellow at the Hoover Institution, Stanford University, where he 
researched and began writing a book on cultural relativism.

<p>

Mr. Knight was a news editor and writer with the <I>Los Angeles 
Times</I>, where he worked for seven years prior to his Hoover 
fellowship.  During his 15 years in journalism, Mr. Knight has 
written for <I> The Wall Street Journal, National Review, Chicago 
Tribune, Philadelphia Inquirer, Baltimore Sun, Washington Times, 
San Francisco Chronicle, Orange County Register</I> and other 
publications.  He has appeared on the <i>CBS Evening News, NBC 
Nightly News</i>, ABC's <i>World News Tonight</i>, ABC's 
<i>Nightline</i>, CNN's <i>Crossfire</i>, NPR's <i>All Things 
Considered</i>, CNN's <i>Sonya Live</i>, CNBC'S <i>McLaughlin</i>, 
NBC's <i>A Closer Look</i>, NPR's <i>Fresh Air,</i> a PBS special 
on the arts and other television and radio broadcasts.

<p>

Mr. Knight worked for the <I>Fort Lauderdale News/Sun Sentinel</I> 
as a weekend project coordinator and copy editor, with the 
<I>Maryland Gazette </I>as assistant editor and the <I>Annapolis 
Evening Capital</I> as a reporter, and as a reporter and later 
editor of the <I>Maryland Coast Press</I>.

<p>

Mr. Knight has a Master's degree and a Bachelor of Science degree 
in political science from American University in Washington, D.C.

<p>
<font size=+3>I</font>n a sweeping victory for families, Congress recently 
passed the Telecommunications Act of 1996, including provisions protecting
children from computer pornography.  The Telecom Act extends current
child protection laws to cyberspace, using the court-approved
&quot;indecency&quot; standard to keep patently offensive material
away from minors.  The cyberporn provisions punish only knowing
violations, while preserving existing electronic mail privacy
laws.
<p>
The significance of the new law's computer porn section cannot
be overstated.  It represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity
to set ground rules for the next great communications medium.
Pornographers have been flooding this promising technology, and
the new Telecom Act comes not a moment too soon.
<p>
<center><h3>ACLU Logs In</h3></center>
<p>
The American Civil Liberties Union has filed suit to strike
down the computer pornography section as unconstitutional.  Clearly,
the ACLU is fighting a losing battle.  Time and again, the courts
have upheld the constitutionality of &quot;indecency&quot; restrictions
in other contexts, most recently regarding dial-a-porn services.
FRC will file its own brief in response to the ACLU challenge.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>ACLU FIGHTS A<br>
LOSING BATTLE</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
The battle now shifts to the Clinton administration, whose
resolve in defending the law is questionable.  Last April, President
Clinton voiced concern that children &quot;may be exposed to things
on computer, which in some ways are more powerful, more raw and
more inappropriate than those things from which we protect them
when they walk in a 7-Eleven.&quot;  Clinton declared, &quot;I
do not believe in any way, shape or form that we should be able
to do on e-mail, or through the electronic superhighway anything
beyond what we could elsewhere.  I think the First Amendment has
to be uniform in its application.&quot;
<p>
However, in recent days the Clinton administration has appeared
to retreat from this resolve.  The floundering is reminiscent
of the notorious <I>Knox</I> case, where the administration tried
to weaken the federal child pornography law it was bound to defend.
Although Congress rebuffed that attempt, fear remains that the
administration might try a similar tactic again.
<p>
Objections to the new cyberporn law have less to do with
free speech than with arrogance and greed.  The &quot;online elite&quot;
know that if this new medium is to be truly open to a diverse
community, all members of that community will deserve respect,
including children.  Even with the new law, parents must be ever
vigilant in ensuring that cyberporn remains off-limits to their
children.
<p>
<center><h3>Nixing PX Porn</h3></center>
<p>
FRC continues to fight pornography on other fronts.  Last
month at the Supreme Court, FRC filed a legal brief in <I>Alliance
for Community Media v. F.C.C.</I>, a case challenging the regulation
of pornographic programs on cable television access channels.
The challenged law would simply give private cable operators
the ability to limit indecent programs.  It would relieve operators
of the current law requiring them to show everything, no matter
how offensive. In their lawsuit, the plaintiffs charge that restoring
a cable operator's right to decide against airing indecent programs
amounts to indirect government censorship.  FRC supports the right
of private cable operators to reject &quot;nude talk shows&quot;
and &quot;amateur porn hours&quot; on access channels.  Oral argument
at the Supreme Court was set for Feb. 21.
<p>
Pornography in the military has been another flashpoint.
For years, the U.S. military has been the nation's largest porn
purveyor, stocking military exchanges with tax-free smut worth
millions of dollars.  Not surprisingly, in recent years the military
has been plagued by sexual misconduct and assault.  New Jersey
Rep. Christopher Smith is drafting a bill to prohibit the sale
of pornography at military facilities worldwide.
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Over the last few months, tremendous progress has occurred
in the fight against pornography, thanks largely to grassroots
support.  Your continued involvement will help keep these gains
intact.  Insist that child protection laws apply consistently
to all areas of society, including the Internet.  Urge your members
of Congress to support the pending Smith bill on military porn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p><a name="believers">
<B>Forsaken Brethren.</B>  FRC President Gary Bauer testified
on Feb. 15 before the House Subcommittee on International Operations
and Human Rights regarding anti-Christian persecution overseas.
Bauer testified that this persecution takes many forms, from
harassment of worshippers to, in Ethiopia, actual crucifixion.
Abuses seem to be especially prevalent in certain Moslem countries.
Bauer called for a more coherent response from the U.S. Government
and from U.S. religious leaders:  &quot;How much longer,&quot;
he said, &quot;can we allow persecuted Christians overseas to
call out, 'Why have you forsaken us?'&quot;
<p>
<B>CAREERS Update.</B>  The National Governors Association recently
released a statement urging final passage of the CAREERS bill
(H.R. 1617) within 30 days.  Progress in a House-Senate conference
committee to combine CAREERS with the Senate's Workforce Development
Act (S. 143) has been slow due to major differences between the
bills, which would consolidate job training programs.  The bills'
extensive Labor Market Information System and implementation of
a skill certificate system could threaten workers' economic freedom.
Governors favor consolidation, which gives them more authority
over state job training and economic development.
<p>
<B>Pro-Life Progress.</B> A short-term spending bill signed by
President Clinton on Jan. 26 included three pro-life measures.
They are:  a ban on federal funds for the experimental creation
of human embryos; a ban on federal funding of abortions for prison
inmates, except in the case of rape or life of the mother; and
a compromise restriction on international population funds.  The
compromise will bar funding until July 1 for organizations that
perform or promote abortions overseas, but allow funding thereafter
at reduced levels from 1995 spending.  Pro-life members of Congress
continue to seek permanent restrictions.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<B>Innocent as Charged.</B> After a more than year-long federal
grand jury investigation, the Clinton Justice Department has found
no evidence of a national conspiracy to attack abortion clinics.
However, Attorney General Janet Reno has vowed to continue the
probe, and Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) has called for congressional
hearings on the issue.  Meanwhile, federal and state prosecutors
have used the Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances (FACE) act
to charge two peaceful pro-lifers, sidewalk counselors Carmen
Vazquez and Bobby Riley, with &quot;obstructing&quot; and 
&quot;interfering&quot; with women seeking abortions.
<p>
<B>Drug Fighter.</B> President Clinton has selected a get-tough
soldier to lead our nation's battle against drugs.  During his
State of the Union address, Clinton announced his decision to
tap Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey to replace drug czar Lee Brown,
who is now teaching in Texas.  Gen. McCaffrey is an expert on
narcotics trafficking who returns to Washington from a command
in Panama, where he has overseen U.S. cooperation with Latin American
and Caribbean nations on drug intelligence and interdiction since
February 1994. Drug abuse among American youth con-tinues to
rise.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p><a name="baer">
<B>Baer Backs &quot;Mule.&quot;</B> Federal Judge Harold Baer,
Jr. provoked a firestorm Jan. 24 when he threw out the drug trafficking
conviction of Carol Bayless.  Bayless was driving a car with 80
pounds of cocaine and heroin in the trunk. Two accomplices ran
when police observed them.  Judge Baer,  a Clinton appointee,
said: &quot;Residents in this neighborhood tend to regard police
officers as corrupt, abusive and violent.  Had the men not run
when the cops began to stare at them, it would have been unusual.&quot;
Bayless had confessed to being a regular drug courier (&quot;mule&quot;).
<p>
<B>PC &quot;Volunteers.&quot;</B>  Mandatory voluntarism takes
the spirit out of serving, argue many parents and secondary school
students.  Graduation requirements for &quot;volunteering&quot;
are prompted by Goals 2000, which encourages community service.
But what some programs call service is actually political activism.
Others exclude religious service activities.  The conflict over
mandatory service may soon reach the U.S. Supreme Court if a New
York decision upholding a service requirement is appealed.  Federal
parental rights legislation (S. 984, H.R. 1946) could provide
a remedy by defining parental authority in school matters.
<p>
<B>Army Salvation.</B> An Army wife, Tambra Hartmann, lost her
license to run a home-based day-care service on a military post
because she said grace with the children over meals and played
Christian music.  The children's parents selected the service
in part because it was faith-based.   Last November, the U.S.
Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Army overstepped
its authority and violated the families' First Amendment freedoms.
The Army has changed the regulation to permit faith elements
as long as child-care providers inform parents of that fact before
enrollment.

<h3>Wedding Bans</h3>
<p>
Acting before Hawaiian courts mandate homosexual &quot;marriage,&quot;
which may occur in July, pro-family activists nationwide are working
to protect the definition of marriage.
<p>
In California, the state assembly voted 41 to 31 on Jan.
31 to prohibit the recognition of same-sex relationships as marriage.
A tougher vote is expected in the liberal Senate.  Utah enacted
a law in 1995 that defines marriage as the union of &quot;one
man and one woman&quot; and bars recognition of same-sex nuptials.
Other states considering such measures: Alabama, Alaska, Colorado,
Georgia, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island,
South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia and Washington.  In Maine,
a marriage protection bill was introduced but withdrawn after
a lesbian legislator withdrew her own homosexual rights bill.
In Nebraska, a bill legalizing same-sex marriages has been introduced.
<p>
At the national level, a federal bill is being written to
reinforce the &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition in all
policies, including Social Security and the military.  The tentative
title is the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and a sponsor was
being sought at press time.
<p>
The gravity of the situation cannot be overstated.  If homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; becomes law in Hawaii and is imposed on all
other states through the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution,
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexuality, schoolchildren
will be taught that homosexuality is equivalent to marital sex,
and churches will be pushed into a religious &quot;ghetto,&quot;
where pressure will mount for conformity to civil law.  Redefining
marriage would redefine the family, giving homosexuals an uncontested
&quot;right&quot; to adopt children.
<p>
Citizens can do two things to preserve marriage:  1) contact
your state legislators and urge them to support current legislation
or to introduce a bill protecting marriage; 2) ask your congressman
and U.S. Senators to cosponsor the eventual federal bill.  The
Capitol Hill switchboard number is (202) 225-3121 or (202) 224-3121.

Marriage (513) 733-8908.

<h3>Wobbling on Welfare</h3>
<p>
The promise to &quot;end welfare as we know it&quot; remains
a popular talking point, but on Jan. 9 President Clinton vetoed
the welfare bill passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
The nation's Governors have now advanced their own welfare
reform package, and regrettably they have chosen to abandon serious
attempts to reduce illegitimacy.  The House and Senate agreed
last year to prohibit states from using federal funds to increase
welfare payments to women who bear additional children while on
welfare, but would have allowed states to opt out of the prohibition.
<p>
While erasing the focus on illegitimacy, the Governors proposed
<I>adding</I> an extra $4 billion in child care funding.  Their
recommendation would increase spending on day care 49% more than
current law, without spending a penny on abstinence programs to
help reduce out-of-wedlock births.  The emphasis on child care
is ironic, since the Governors also moved to weaken the work requirements
passed by congressional Republicans.
<p>
In a letter to House colleagues, Congressman Jim Talent (R-Mo.)
argued that the last time Congress adopted a welfare plan proposed
by the Governors, a Democrat from Arkansas rode to the White House
partly on the strength of his pledge to fix the mess.  If the
Congress listens to the Governors' advice this year, it will have
committed itself to spending over half a trillion dollars to subsidize
fatherlessness through cash benefits, day care, job training,
and other services.
<p>
A recent FRC poll shows that three out of four Americans
believe that welfare encourages illegitimacy and, by a ratio of
two to one, that reducing illegitimacy is more important than
merely encouraging single mothers to support themselves.  A hefty
84% of Americans support a family cap, and an overwhelming majority
believe that work requirements should focus last on mothers with
preschool-aged children.  Both provisions would help reduce the
Governors' incentive to capture new federal dollars for child
care -- and would allay our concerns about leaving children, yet
again, at the mercy of public institutions.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Foster Has a Future</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
In his State of the Union Address on Jan. 23, President Clinton
made an appeal to pro-family Americans.  He talked about balancing
the budget, reforming welfare, attacking drug abuse, and reducing
the rate of teen pregnancy, among other things.  For Drug Czar,
the President made a choice American families warmly applauded,
Army Gen. Barry McCaffrey.  Now comes Clinton's Teenage Pregnancy
Czar, and the ovation is over:  Dr. Henry Foster, Planned Parenthood
advocate extraordinaire and failed nominee for Surgeon General,
is back in the saddle.
<p>
Almost a year ago, President Clinton tapped Dr. Foster to
replace Joycelyn Elders as Surgeon General, saying that he wanted
Foster's Nashville-based teen pregnancy program, &quot;I Have
A Future,&quot; replicated throughout the nation.  But part of
the reason Foster was rejected as Surgeon General was that his
program, like all contraceptive-based programs, proved a dismal
failure.  According to an evaluation by the Carnegie Corporation,
a program underwriter, participants in &quot;I Have a Future&quot;
actually had <I>higher</I> rates of sexual activity than those
outside the program.
<p>
This is not the kind of leadership that America wants or
needs to help combat teen pregnancy.  This is not the kind of
program that will help reach the President's stated goal of reducing
the teen pregnancy rate by one-third over the next 10 years. 
And this is surely not the kind of approach that will help our
children grow up to be responsible and mature adults.
<p>
The research is crystal clear.  Teenagers' best safeguard
against having or causing an out-of-wedlock pregnancy is to have
two loving parents involved in their lives.  But it's also important
to create a culture where the values that parents teach their
children are reinforced outside the home.  Several abstinence
programs have done just that, with excellent results.
<p>
For example, only 1.1 percent of participants in the Washington,
D.C.-based <I>Best Friends</I> program became pregnant, as opposed
to 25 percent of other girls in the city.  The abstinence curriculum
<I>Teen-Aid</I> helped to reduce the teen pregnancy rate in Jacksonville,
Florida, by 35 percent just three years after it was implemented.
Examples of other successful abstinence programs abound.
<p>
Tragically, the President has chosen to support ideology
over progress.  The Foster task force has been christened the
&quot;National Campaign to Reduce Teen Pregnancy.&quot;  Reducing
pregnancy among unmarried teens is a laudable goal.  But to reach
it we must have a sustained reversal of the sexual activity that
haunts the young with unprecedented rates of pregnancy, abortion,
disease and emotional heartbreak.  Unfortunately, the Foster
group has already admitted that it intends to promote contraception
rather than abstinence.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>CLINTON CHOOSES IDEOLOGY<br>
OVER PROGRESS</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
While raising children well is a tough job, it's not impossible.
In truth, the teen pregnancy rate has been declining for the
last two years because more teens are choosing abstinence despite
all of the federal projects and cultural pressures promoting the
contrary.  Statistics published by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention show that the drop in teen pregnancy rates reflects
a rising number of teens choosing to abstain from sex.
<p>
The familiar Scripture says, &quot;Train up a child in the
way he should go, and when he is old he will not turn from it.&quot;
(Proverbs 22:6).  Last June the U.S. Senate reviewed Dr. Foster's
credentials and told the President this <I>isn't</I> the way
we should go.  But the President has refused to turn from his
old friend.  So now it appears that Henry Foster has a future
in government.  It's our nation's young people for whom the future
now looks a little bleaker.

<center><h1>TYRANNY IN ROBES</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling 
whose destructive power may rival the infamous <I>Roe v. Wade</I> 
(1973) decision.

<p>

In <I>Romer v.  Evans</I>, the court voted 6-3 to strike
down a voter-approved amendment to Colorado's constitution that
would have prevented homosexuality from being added to civil rights
laws by the state and local governments.  The people of Colorado
had voted for Amendment 2 in response to adoption of homosexual
rights laws in several cities, including Denver and Aspen.  The
amendment took no rights away from homosexuals, merely ensuring
that homosexuality would not receive preferential treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>800,000 Bigots?</h3></center>

<p>

Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, concluded
that the voters were motivated only by &quot;animus&quot; toward
homosexuals, seeking to deny them access to the political process.
In effect, he called more than 800,000 Coloradans &quot;hate-filled
bigots&quot; for withholding a powerful legal weapon from homosexual
activists.

<p>

In a scathing dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the ruling
has &quot;no foundation in American constitutional law and barely
pretends to. ... Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration
of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans ... striking
it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political
will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia noted that under the court's reasoning, polygamists
could demand redress because they are disadvantaged by state laws
prohibiting polygamy.  He asked whether the court had somehow
concluded that polygamy was a greater social harm than homosexuality.
Scalia also noted that the majority had completely ignored the
1986 <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> case, which established that states
can criminalize sodomy.  If states can do that, he wrote, then
surely they can deny &quot;preferential treatment&quot; to a class
that defines itself solely by its willingness to engage in that
behavior.

<p>

Homosexual activists celebrated the <I>Romer</I> ruling.
Conservative activist Paul Weyrich and Colorado for Family Values
President Will Perkins called for impeachment of the six majority
justices, who include Reagan appointee Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor
(Reagan), David Souter (Bush), John Paul Stevens (Ford),  Stephen
Breyer (Clinton) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Clinton).  Other leaders
raised the question of judicial term limits and of activating
Congress' constitutional power to limit which cases the Supreme
Court can rule upon.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"NOT JUDICIAL JUDGMENT,<br>
BUT POLITICAL WILL."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The court did stop short of elevating &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to the same level of protection as race, ethnicity and other traditional
civil rights categories.  But the legal effect may be less than
the cultural effect.  Within hours of the decision, a lesbian
attorney in Florida said the court had ruled that homosexuality
could not be taken into account in child custody cases.  The court
did no such thing, but such broad interpretations can now be expected
to be routinely advanced in homosexuality-related cases.

<p>

<center><h3>Pass DOMA Now</h3></center>

<p>

Citizens who believe in traditional morality and the rule
of law must now rally around the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),
a federal bill that defines marriage as &quot;the union of one
man and one woman as husband and wife&quot; and allows states
to ignore out-of-state marriage licenses issued to homosexual
couples.

<p>

Liberal judges in Hawaii are expected to legalize homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; as early as September, and homosexuals are
preparing to fly to Hawaii, get &quot;married,&quot; and claim
marital status in their home states.  Given the Supreme Court's
usurpation of power in Colorado, passage of DOMA (H.R. 3396) and
(S. 1740) is imperative.  DOMA will reassert the constitutional
authority of Congress, send the courts the message that America
will not surrender to homosexual activists, and secure marriage
against radical redefinition.  So far, 11 states have passed bills
protecting marriage, but DOMA is needed immediately to protect
the federal code and state marriage laws.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call or write your senators and congressman and urge them
to sponsor DOMA, not merely pledge to vote for it.  The Capitol
Hill switchboard is 202-225-3121.  Addresses:  U.S. Senate, Washington,
D.C.  20510; U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 
20515.  Also, ask your state representatives to pass a marriage
protection law at the state level.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Medicare Package.</b> The Medicare trustees issued a report
on June 5 indicating that Medicare Part A (payment for hospital
costs) may become insolvent by 2001.  The Part A trust fund lost
$2.6 billion in 1995.  The trustees recommended that an independent
commission develop a long-term strategy. Congress passed a budget
last year which limited projected increases in Medicare spending
to an annual average of 6.4 percent.  President Clinton vetoed
that plan and insists that Congress enact his more limited proposal.
An election year resolution of this issue is unlikely.

<p>

<b>No Relief in Sight.</b> Family tax relief continues to receive
consideration on Capitol Hill, even as the presidential candidates
float various tax cut plans.  Congressional leaders may include
the child credit in a package with welfare and Medicaid reform,
or include it as part of a separate tax package.  President Clinton
threatens to veto any bill that contains the Republicans' proposed
Medicaid reforms, but it does not appear that he will sign the
tax cuts without comparable cuts in spending.  Sounds like another
&quot;Catch-22&quot; situation.

<p><a name="privacy">

<b>Preventing Predators.</b> The Children's Privacy Protection
and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996 was introduced by Congressman
Bob Franks (R-N.J.) on May 22. The purpose of this bill is to
empower parents to further protect their children from child predators.
The bill would allow parents to learn what information commercial
vendors have obtained about their children, where the information
originated, and where it has been distributed.  People who prey
on children should not be able to purchase, receive, sell, or
in any way handle personal information about children.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>No Federal Cradle.</b> Many news stories on the Stand for
Children rally sponsored by the Children's Defense Fund asked
the same questions FRC raised at a press conference the day before
the event:  Is more spending on failed federal programs really
helping children?  Or are liberal advocacy groups just using children
as props to make one last stand for big government?  FRC argued
that strong parents are still the best advocates for children.
Society's role is to help rebuild healthy communities that strengthen
the hands of those who rock the cradles.

<p>

<b>Dues Under Duress.</b> A new House Republican task force on
labor policy has recommended legislation that would protect union
members from being forced to pay dues to fund partisan politics.
In the 1994 election, 40 percent of union members voted for conservative
candidates while union chiefs generally backed liberals.  Giving
workers an option to restrict their dues to collective bargaining
purposes is an obvious way to protect the integrity of representative
government while protecting workers' interests -- and putting
hard-earned dollars back in the pockets of American workers.

<p>

<b>Justice Denied.</b> Some black youngsters in a Washington,
D.C. suburb were almost denied the chance to see how faith and
hard work can pay off in America.  Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas was publicly disinvited to speak at a student awards ceremony
in early June when a school official threatened to disrupt the
event.  Although the school board ultimately voted to reinvite
Thomas, the whole spectacle sent a troubling message to students,
who, fortunately, ultimately got to hear Thomas's powerful message
of personal virtue and equality before the law.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Globe</h3></center>

<p><a name="beijing">

<b>Costly Habitat.</b> From June 3-14 in Istanbul, Turkey, Habitat
II, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, built
on the anti-family agendas of previous U.N. conferences, this
time focusing on the environmental and economic challenges of
rapid urbanization.  Urging more efforts to implement that agenda,
Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher called for a moratorium
on further U.N. world conferences.  And none too soon.  A recent
General Accounting Office study found that the U.S. Government
spent a whopping $5.9 million on the U.N. Conference on Women
held last September in Beijing, China.

<p>

<b>Rewarding Tyranny.</b> On June 3, President Clinton formally
announced his intention to extend &quot;most favored nation&quot;
(MFN) trade privileges to China.  Unless Congress quickly opposes
Clinton's stand, China will continue to enjoy low tariffs on exports
to the U.S.  FRC opposes extending China's MFN status not only
because the U.S. runs a trade deficit of $34 billion every year
with China, but especially because of China's myriad human rights
abuses, such as forced abortion and sterilization policies, exploitation
of prisoners as slave laborers, and systematic persecution of
Christians.

<p>

<b>Wirth Stumbles.</b> During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing June 4, chairman Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) put two questions
to witness Timothy Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.
Citing Hillary Clinton's speech during the U.N. Beijing conference,
where she strongly denounced sex selection abortion and mandatory
abortion, Helms asked Wirth if the Clinton administration would
support legislation outlawing sex selection abortion in the U.S.
and admitting refugees fleeing China's coercive abortion policies.
Wirth could not answer either question directly, saying there
were &quot;other implications&quot; which needed to be considered.

<h3>Parental Rights Vote Near</h3>

<p>

The recent pro-big-government &quot;Stand for Children&quot;
rally in Washington, D.C. had little in common with the growing
grass-roots parental rights movement, except for its focus on
children.  The Family Research Council's message to rally participants
was that government programs can never provide what children vitally
need -- parents raising them with love and direction.  Which is
to say, parents are irreplaceable.

<p>

With public school officials handing condoms to pre-teens,
it is no wonder that the parental rights movement has captured
the public's attention.  Parents across the country are finding
their voice against intrusive state and federal governments.
At the state level, parents are supporting constitutional amendments
which protect the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children without unwanted government infringement.
At the federal level, parents are supporting the Parental Rights
and Responsibilities Act of 1996 (PRRA), which simply codifies
Supreme Court rulings that parents have a fundamental right to
raise their children which the government must respect.

<p>

That parents, not government, should have the primary responsibility
and authority in raising their children seems beyond dispute.
Yet, the ubiquitous ACLU and their education counterpart, the
National Education Association, have weighed in with heavy protests.
They are fond of presenting hypothetical &quot;horror stories&quot;
of child abuse they claim the PRRA will permit, yet the bill specifically
excludes abusive parents from its protection.

<p>

In contrast to these theoretical concerns, real-life instances
of outrageous government violations of parents rights persist.
If the PRRA were law, parents in Pennsylvania would probably
not have had to file suit against the East Stroudsburg public
school for forcing their sixth-grade daughters to undergo vaginal
examinations without their knowledge or consent and over the tearful
protestations of the girls.  This flagrant usurpation of the right
of parents to make health care decisions for their children would
not be tolerated under the PRRA.  Without it, the Pennsylvania
parents have little certainty of success.

<p>

A vote on the PRRA is expected before August.  Call 202-225-3121
and urge your congressman and senators to vote for the PRRA (H.R.
1946; S. 984).  For information on state initiatives, contact

<h3>Indecent Opinion</h3>

<p>

The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
has ruled against provisions of the Communications Decency Act
(CDA), the first major anti-pornography legislation for cyberspace.
This is a sad defeat with ominous implications for the burgeoning,
new &quot;global community.&quot;  The Clinton Justice Department
will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

<p>

The CDA was passed as part of the Telecommunications Reform
bill in February 1996.  It seeks to protect children from sexually
explicit material on the Internet by prohibiting adults from knowingly
sending or displaying &quot;indecent material&quot; to kids.
It imposes criminal penalties for violation of the law.

<p>

The ACLU and a coalition of liberal groups and on-line service
providers filed the challenge to the CDA in Philadelphia.  A similar
challenge was filed in New York and is still pending.  The Family
Research Council and the National Law Center for Children and
Families submitted 400 pages of legal argument and exhibits on
behalf of anti-pornography groups defending the CDA.  Judge Delores
Sloviter, a Carter appointee, headed the Philadelphia three-judge
panel which heard testimony this spring from ACLU and government
witnesses.

<p>

The CDA uses the time-tested standard of &quot;indecency&quot;
to draw the line between material that is appropriate for adults
but not for children.  &quot;Indecent material&quot; is defined
as material depicting or describing sexual or excretory activities
or organs which, in context, is presented in a patently offensive
manner.  The Supreme Court has ruled that adults have a First
Amendment right to receive indecent material and share it with
other adults, but no right to foist it upon children.  The indecency
standard has protected children in the broadcast television, radio,
and telephone media.

<p>

At closing arguments in Philadelphia, it was clear that the
ACLU was not simply quarreling with this particular law, but was
advocating no restrictions whatsoever on the dissemination of
computer pornography to children.  The Philadelphia court was
openly hostile to the Justice Department and its defense of the
CDA, and its ruling absurdly implies that the advancement of Internet
technology depends upon unfettered exhibition of sexual material
to children.

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>e got a postcard from Air Force Captain Dave Panzera 
the other day.  That's not so unusual, since we receive many calls
and letters from active duty military.  But Captain Panzera's
card came to us from <I>Antarctica.</I>

<p>

That's a dramatic example of how far and wide the
message of FRC is traveling these days.  It's not at all unusual
for us to host meetings with pastors from Southern Africa, champions
of religious liberty from Russia and pro-family leaders from Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.  The international interest in Family
Research Council is a reflection of the global nature of the threat
to the family.

<p>

I always try to give encouragement to our friends from abroad.
They often report feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by a tide of
pornography, drugs, abortion and sexual misconduct.  I share with
our allies some of the expanding array of communications tools
we use to get our message out.  In trying to support them, I find
that <I>I</I> am uplifted. Let me share with you, a regular reader
of <I>Washington Watch,</I> the growing array of devices we have
used in the fight for faith, family and freedom.

<p>

As Americans reduce their reliance on the liberal talking
heads of TV network news, radio has filled the gap.  Sure, there
are the Howard Sterns and Don Imuses, but well-informed pro-family
callers to radio talk shows shatter the media myths about our
movement.  My nickname for conservative programs broadcast from
our nation's capital is &quot;Radio Free Washington.&quot;  I'm
proud that Focus on the Family's news and information feature,
<I>Family News in Focus</I> (FNIF), is broadcast to hundreds of
religious stations every day.  FNIF's Washington bureau, and its
veteran chief, Carl Ramsey, are good neighbors to FRC.

<p>

My daily radio commentary, which bears the same title as
this newsletter, keeps many of you informed of late-breaking
stories and my perspective on the issues.  You can call our FRC
toll-free line at 1-800-225-4008 to obtain a listing of 
participating stations in your community.

<p>

FRC's <I>Legislative Hotline</I> is easily reached by dialing
1-202-783-HOME.  It's available 24 hours a day and is put together
each week (or more frequently as events warrant) by our top-notch
government relations staff.  You can also receive the text of
the <I>Hotline</I> via FAX.  Just call our Government Relations
department at 1-202-393-2100.

<p>

If education is your special interest, <I>Ed Facts</I> is
just for you.  <I>Ed Facts</I> is a weekly fax report available
to citizens for a suggested donation.  It details the latest news
from Washington on issues that affect your kids and their schools.

Our CAN mailing goes out once a month.  Intended for community
impact groups, it contains more in-depth analyses, copies of &quot;op
eds&quot; written by FRC staff, and our latest policy papers.

<p>

FRC's staff includes some intrepid &quot;cybernauts&quot;
who are using the latest technology to make sure we are represented
on the Internet.  Our site is located at: http://www.frc.org.
I confess I'm a bit &quot;low-tech.&quot; My word processor is
located under my hat, and I carry my printer around in my shirt
pocket.  But for those of you who find that the world begins with
a keyboard, our Internet site should please you.

<p>

When David Brinkley's producers called me recently to appear
on <I>This Week,</I> I was pleased (even if I did have to lock
horns with Rep. Barney Frank).  And CBS-TV's <I>Face the Nation</I> 
gave me yet another opportunity to tout the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA).  As gratifying as these major media appearances are,
it's good to know that FRC isn't dependent on others to spread
our message.  We have our own means of getting the word out.
And that word is clearly reaching the ends of the earth.

<title>Gary Bauer's November, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

November 6, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

I know that your first reaction to yesterday's election returns 
is to be disheartened. I found myself recalling the words of Thomas 
Jefferson, who suggested that we should tremble for our country as 
we consider that God is just.

<p>

But, my friends, as people of faith devoted to the family, there must 
be no room in our hearts for demoralization.  It is not just that 
there were many bright spots on Election Day, including the 
strengthening of pro-family forces in Congress.  No, it's the fact 
that we are obliged in conscience to carry on our fight for the family, 
no matter what one day's election returns suggest. The worst thing we 
could do now is to retreat from the public square.  Instead we must 
advance the pro-family banner boldly and without shame.  I have hope 
for the future -- because the truth is on our side, 
the lessons of history are on our side, and, I believe, the will of 
the people is on our side.

<p>

I am not naive.  In the coming year, the principles that unite us -- 
traditional values, the sanctity of human life, smaller government, 
and lower taxes -- will be under political and cultural attack as 
never before. Regarding these threats, I can speak only for me and my 
"house" at the Family Research Council: "We will redouble our efforts to 
speak for your values and to bring the truth to the American people."

<p>

With that in mind, as election day approached, my staff and I put 
together a six-point plan of action.  Today, as the final vote is 
still being tallied we begin to implement this plan, with you at our side.

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family Americans have been too passive -- not <i>too active</i>! -- 
in their approach to public life.  Too often we've waited for our party system 
to produce for us candidates who will subscribe to some portion of our 
world view, candidates who, by design and default, always seem to fail 
us at the finish line.  The truth is, our movement should be producing 
and promoting leaders of its own.  I want you to know that achieving 
this goal is at the top of my personal priorities for the coming year. 
In my capacity as a private citizen, I will be organizing a political 
action committee, which I believe you'll be hearing a lot about in 
the near future.

<p>

<li>Each month 250,000 American homes receive our monthly publication, 
<i>Washington Watch</i>.  With your help, <b>FRC will double the 
circulation of this publication within the next 12 months</b>. Early 
next year <b>FRC will unveil a new and expanded version of <i>Watch</i></b>. 
We must make it our goal <b>to reach every American home in which 
there still burns a spark of love for this land Lincoln called 
"the last, best hope of Earth."</b>

<p>

<li>FRC will launch a youth leadership program here in Washington, 
D.C.  If the family is to survive (my friends, it <i>will</i> survive), 
if religious values are not to be completely routed from the public 
square (my friends, they <i>will</i> not), <b>we must act now to foster a 
new generation of leaders with a profoundly Christian world view.</b> The 
darker this night of cultural amorality becomes, the more youthful 
flames we must light that will kindle hope for our country.

<p>

<li>Our very self-government is at stake when the acts of duly elected 
legislatures, or of the people themselves, to restrict abortion, protect 
parental rights, and safeguard the institution of marriage are trampled 
by our runaway judges.  Judicial tyranny must end.  I pledge to you 
today <b>a sweeping campaign to check and balance our out-of-control 
courts.</b> We must become again a people who insist that <b>no one govern 
us without our consent.</b>

<p>

<li>The power to tax is the power to destroy.  How many of our 
government's destructive schemes would be possible if it did not 
seize nearly 45 cents of every dollar that hardworking families 
earn? There will be no freedom without tax freedom. <b>Today I am 
launching, in partnership with key economic conservative organizations, 
a massive push for across-the-board tax relief.</b> We will begin with 
tax credits for families with children and end the double taxation 
that occurs when government taxes the estates our families have 
shored up over a lifetime of sweat and sacrifice. <b>Our families 
built this capital; the meddling Washington establishment must be 
stopped from hauling it away.</b>

<p>

<li>Early in the new year, FRC will convene a summit of leaders of 
major pro-family groups and religious leaders who share our profound 
concern for the cultural decay now gripping the Western world. We will 
pool ideas and, where possible, resources to provide an effective 
counter to the forces of cultural disintegration.  Our response will be 
as global as the threat we face.  In the coming months and years, it is 
imperative that pro-family groups work together. <b>I pledge my total 
effort to help achieve this goal.</b>

</ul><p>

One final word. I do not view these steps as an ambitious plan. This 
is the <b>minimum</b> we must do to give this generation, and the next 
generation, of American families a fighting chance.  I cannot promise 
you we will succeed at everything we do, but I can promise you that we 
will try as never before. FRC has been positioned -- I pray by 
God's grace -- in the nation's capital to be here for the family at 
such a time as this.

<p>

In the coming days, please consider this plan and let me know if I have 
your support.  Your prayers and encouragement mean so much, and your 
financial support is FRC's very lifeblood.  I know that you are counting 
on the Family Research Council.  We will do everything we can to be worthy 
of the trust you place in us. God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<TITLE> Charles A. Donovan Article</TITLE>

<CENTER><H3> Written Testimony of Charles A. Donovan,<BR>
Senior Policy Adviser<BR>
Submitted on May 2, 1995 to the<BR>
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee,<BR>
Senator Nancy Kassebaum, Chairman</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
MADAM CHAIRMAN, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer the testimony of the Family Research Council on the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States.  The Family Research Council is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to analysis of the impact of public policy on the traditional family.  We place particular emphasis on the ways in which society can preserve and strengthen the two-parent family, and maximize the benefits that stable, intact family structure can confer on this nation's economic vitality, social well-being and spiritual strength.
<P>
     We believe that the position of Surgeon General of the United States now, more than ever, requires an individual who understands these dimensions of public policy.  Evolu- tion of the office of Surgeon General in the past two decades has diminished its direct policy-making and admini- strative role.  Evolution of the nature of many of the public health threats facing this nation today has magnified the importance of the Surgeon General's office in articulat-ing the essentials of healthy behavior.  The intersection of individual health and moral responsibility has never been more obvious.
<P>
     For this reason, it is critical that the office of Surgeon General be occupied by a person who has worked comfortably within that intersection.  That person must possess a clear, and consistently expressed, vision of public health.  He or she must be alive to the profound ethical dimensions of health issues in the late 20th century, and have a proven track record of responding cor-rectly to issues as they arise, not merely riding with the tide of public or professional opinion.  In short, he or she must be a leader, not a follower, intellectually and instinctively true to the highest standards of ethical behavior in medicine.  
<P>
     As a threshold matter, a Surgeon General must know and be able to articulate who he is and what he believes.  From the very beginning, when President Clinton announced his choice of Herny Foster on February 2, this nominee has been unable to articulate from one day to the next a consistent account even of his own career.  At every turn, members of this committee, of our own organization, and of the press have elicited from Dr. Foster and the administration new and revised accounts of various dimensions of his creed and his practice.  To this day, not one of these accounts fully squares with the other.  To this day, not one of these accounts amounts to a full disclosure by the nominee regard-ing his personal involvement in the most wrenching health policy questions of our time.
<P>
     The course of this nomination resembles a tent in spring rain.  Touch its soggy canvas anywhere and more revelations seep through.  It is hard to imagine an individual who has been implicared in more major public health controversies than Dr. Foster.  From the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, to involuntary sterilization of men-tally handicapped women, to the performance of abortions and advocacy of abortion on demand, to distribution of condoms and other birth control devices to children, to the school-based clinic debate, to involvement with radical sex education programs, Dr. Foster has been on the cutting edge -- and nearly always on its wrong side.
<P>
     As this testimony is written, it is impossible to say with assurance that he hasn't <B> always </B>been on the wrong side, because nothing of what is known about Dr. Foster's role in each of these controversies is the result of the nominee's frank and full disclosure.  Everything that is known about them is the result of examination of the nominee's record and repeated questioning of that record by others, our-selves included.  The Administration has been reluctant to take the first step to volunteer accurate information about any of the issues that have placed this nomination in jeopardy.
<P>
     Before discussing those issues in detail, I want to make one final point.  This nomination has not been, and is not being, "Borked."  No one has led an advertising campaign distorting the nominee's record, impugning his character, or implying dreaded, unnamed consequences for the nation if he takes office.  No one has scrolled through a list of his tastes in videos. The debate over this nomination is first and foremost about profoudnly important questions of public policy, and this nomination is in difficulty first and fore-most because the nominee himself has been unable to provide a consistent and accurate account of where he has stood and what he has done regarding these questions.  Even Robert Bork's most vociferous opponents will agree, I think, that he did not leave anyone in doubt about the authenticity of his beliefs.
<P>
     Doubt, on the other hand, is the essence of Dr. Foster's nomination.
<P>
<B> Biographical Omission</B>
<P>
     The difficulty with Dr. Foster's nomination began with the refusal of the White House to share with the public, and with this committee, his basic philosophy.  The biography of Dr. Foster released by the White House mentioned his chron-ological affiliations, but totally ignored his lifelong ties to Planned Parenthood.  That this would be the occasion for controversy can hardly be something the Administration would not recognize.  The <I> Chronicle of Philanthropy </I>has noted on several occasions that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America is among the top 10 most frequently objected to "charities" in the United States.  The <I> Chronicle </I>has reported that no nonprofit in the United States is more commonly eschewed through "restricted" gifts to the nation's United Way agencies.
<P>
     The reasons are simple, and to express them is to belie the White House's claim that Dr. Foster is a "mainstream" nominee.  The nominee claims that he is committed to absti- nence as the primary approach to sex education.  Planned Parenthood has led the ideological and legal assault on abstinence education programs in the United States.  The nominee claims that he desires to make abortion "safe, legal and rare."  But he has served as a "Public Policy Advocate" for the Planned Parenthood Federation during a time when its national leadership had dedicated itself to opening 75 abortion clinics across the United States<I> merely to meet a numerical goal consonant with the 75th anniversary of its founding</I>.
<P>
     Dr. Foster has sought to portray himself as an advocate for the family, and for parent-child communication.  But during his time as an official of Planned Parenthood of Nashville, that organization filed suit against a Tennessee law requiring parental consent for abortion.  Far from being a strict statute, that law provided for a judicial bypass procedure by which teenagers could seek abortions under court auspices without parental involvement.  Such an arrangement was not liberal enough for Planned Parenthood, which has led the national legal fight to exclude parents from involvement with their minor children's abortion decisions.  Again, this is not a mainstream position -- Americans support parental consent for abortion by margins of 2-1 or 3-1.  Parents themselves show an even higher rate of support for such laws.
<P>
     It is possible that Dr. Foster was and is ignorant of these positions taken by organizations with whom he has been associated for nearly two decades.  But it is not likely. Ignorance is a valid defense in some circumstances, but it is not a valid credential for someone who seeks to become the "nation's doctor," and the leader of a national crusade against teenage pregnancy.
<P>
     The American people had a right to know of Dr. Foster's association with this organization and its ideas.  The White House had no right to omit it from the biographical informa-tion it provided the Congress and the nation.
<P>
<B> Tuskegee Institute</B>
<P>
     "Ignorance" is also the nominee's defense against the circumstantial evidence, and the direct testimony of one individual, Dr. Luther McRae, that, as Vice President of the Macon County Medical Society in 1969, Dr. Foster partic-ipated in a Public Health Service briefing on the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments.  It is not in dispute that Dr, Foster spoke out against the experiments in 1972, when they were publicly revealed in media accounts.  It is pre-cisely that public expression of outrage that provoked the reaction of Dr. McRae, who has stated that he is willing to testify to this committee under oath that Dr. Foster was indeed present at the meeting on May 12, 1969 where PHS officials sought the "surrogate informed consent" of the MCMS for continuation of the Tuskegee Study.<P>
     McRae is categorical, and here is what he told Carl Ramsey of Family News in Focus:
<P>
<UL> The most striking thing about it, when
         the news broke . . . I saw on television
         and read in the papers that Dr. Foster 
         was involved in the public outrage about
         the study having been conducted.  And I
         was struck by that, in that I knew he was
         at the meeting . . . I asked myself why
         Henry didn't go ahead and say something at
         the meeting that night in 1969. Because he
         had every opportunity, nobody had a muzzle
         on him.i</UL><P>     McRae is also specific, recalling where Dr. Foster sat.  Moreover, he holds no animus against his colleague and believes -- in contrast to my view -- that he would make an excellent Surgeon General.  This fact lends added weight to his assertion regarding Dr. Foster's knowledge of the Tus-kegee experiment in 1969.
<P>
     Dr. McRae insists that Henry Foster did know about the existence of the experiment.  But it is equally important to recognize that he should have known, and that the May 12 meeting at a restaurant outside Tuskegee was not his only opportunity to inform himself about a PHS study that had been under way for nealry four decades.  First, the study had been described in the medical journals; as an obstetric-ical chief working in a county with one of the nation's highest rates of syphilis (indeed, this was one reason PHS originally chose Macon County as the site of the nontreat-ment study), at perhaps that county's most prominent ob-gy
center, Dr. Foster would have reason to be well read in the literature of venereal disease.
<P>
     Dr. McRae has noted, as does James Jones' account of the Tuskegee experiment, Bad Blood, that PHS officials supplied the Macon County Medical Society with a list of the individuals "participating" in the study, to assure that they would not obtain treatment, particularly antibiotics, by other means from local physicians.ii  Given the "zeal," as Jones puts it, with which PHS officials pursued the cooper- ation of Macon County physicians, it seems unlikely that distribution of this list to the Vice President of the Society's Vice President would be overlooked.<P>    Jones also points out that in 1970the PHS "also reestablished something of its former working relationship with medical personnel at John A. Andrew Hospital."  A representative of PHS, Dr. Joseph G. Caldwell, met with the hospital's administrator and medical director and contracted to have the surviving men's X-rays taken there in the hospital's new facility.  Again, it is possible that the presence of PHS officials, and the conduct of examinations of the syphilitic men, in the facility where he was chief of obstetrics would have entirely escaped the notice of Dr. Foster.  
<P>
     Assuming as much, however, it is hardly a flattering protrayal of Dr. Foster's engagement with public health issues when the most significant events of his time took place in his immediate vicinity, with the cooperation of the Medical Society of which he was Vice President, without his taking cognizance of them.  Such a lapse may not amount to much for a physician who simply desires to continue his work serving the general population; it is a fatal failure of responsibility in an individual who claims to have the ability to serve as the nation's top spokesman on public health.  Dr. Foster says that he did not know of the exper- iments.  The key is that nearly all his colleagues did, that at least one says that he himself did, and that, in any case, he should have known.
<P>
<B> Dr. Foster and Abortion</B>
<P>
     On the issue of abortion, Dr. Foster has taken the fifth.  That is to say, he has taken at least five posi- tions on the number of abortions he has performed or guided to completion.  He has misstated not merely his own involvement in abortion, but inaccurately described the guidelines on medical education under which, he claims, a study of prostaglandin suppositories was conducted during his tenure at Meharry Medical School.  Worse, he has used language in documents officially released by the Department of Health and Human Services that finesses the question of his involvement in abortion.  These finesses put his vera-city not merely in question, but in grave doubt.  
<P>
    Let me summmarize:<P>
<UL> <B> Late January.  </B>A White House official informs<BR>
      Chairman Kassebaum that Dr. Foster had per-<BR>
      formed one abortion during his medical career.<BR>
      ("Foster Says He Performed Abortions,"<I> The Wash-<BR>
      ington Post</I>, Feb. 4, 1995).
<P>
 <B> February 3, 1995.  </B>The Department of Health<BR>
       and Human Services releases a statement by<BR>
       Dr. Foster which states, " I believe that I<BR>
       performed fewer than a dozen pregnancy term-<BR>
       inations." (Statement by Dr. Henry Foster,<BR>
       Nominee for U.S. Surgeon General.)
<P>
 <B> February 6, 1995.  </B>The International Foundation<BR>
       for Genetic Research/Michael Fund releases a<BR>
       transcript, first disputed by the White House<BR>
       but then acknowledged to be genuine, in which<BR>
       Foster states, "I have done a lot of amniocen-<BR>
       tesis and therapeutic abortions, probably near<BR>
       700." (Department of Health, Education and Wel-<BR>
       fare, Office of the Secretary, Ethics Advisory<BR>
       Board, Meeting V, Friday, November 10, 1978<BR>
       Seattle, Washington, p. 180, 197).
<P>
       The Foundation also releases a story from the<BR>
       November 1980 <I> ObGyn News </I>describing an abortion-<BR>
       pill study conducted by Dr. Foster at Meharry on<BR>
       behalf of Upjohn Pharmaceuticals that resulted in<BR>
        59 completed abortions on patients in the trial.     <BR>
<P>
 <B> February 8, 1995.  </B>Appearing on ABC's<I> Nightline</I>,<BR>
        Dr. Foster acknowledges performing 39 abortions, but<BR>
       notes that this does not include any abortions he<BR>
       may have performed before 1973.  Foster tells Kop-<BR>
       pel that this total also does not include the 59<BR>
       abortions carried out under the trial he super-<BR>
       vised, because he did not personally perform them.</UL>
 <P>
     Thus, in little more than a week, Dr. Foster deployed five different versions of his record regarding abortions.<P>
Volatility like this makes the Mexican peso look stable by comparison.  It prompted even the spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Avis LaVelle, to remark, "The next time we utter a number [of Foster's abortions], it won't be based on Dr. Foster's recollec-tions."iii  But if you take a closer look at the February 3 statement released over his name, it appears amply crafted to disguise the information that was released on February 6 by the International Foundation for Genetic Research.<P>     As <I> The Washington Times </I>pointed out on February 7, Dr. Foster's artful February 3 statement offered circumlocu- tions regarding his term as chief of service at Tuskegee and Meharry.  Of the "wide variety of medical procedures and research" performed at both, "all," he wrote, "were in accordance with the law and educational requirements."iv  As the <I> Times </I>observed, "Abortion . . . has been legal for many years, and thus had Dr. Foster performed hundreds of abortions as chief of service - as opposed to acting in his capacity as a private physician - that fact would not have been actually lied about, given the statement's careful wording."
<P>
     The same can be said about the prostaglandin supposi- tory trial, which Dr. Foster was compelled to elaborate upon the following night in his exchange with Ted Koppel.  There he launched the "educational requirements" explanation, citing alleged accreditation requirements as the justifi- cation for seeking grant money to test the abortion suppos- itory for Upjohn.  There are two issues here.  One is the intended evasion by Dr. Foster of a full accounting of his abortion activity in his February 3 statement.  The second is his misunderstanding -- or possible evasion -- regarding the rationale for the prostaglandin trial.
<P>
     As chief of obstetrics at two major medical instituti- tions, Dr. Foster surely should have known that nothing in the then-extant accreditation guidelines from the Accredi-tation Council for Graduate Medical Education required any medical school to offer training in performing abortions, much less to conduct trials of experimental abortion drugs.  In relevant part, the guidelines state that:
<P>
<UL> Resident education [in obstetrics and<BR>
         gynecology] must include, but not neces-<BR>
         sarily be limited to the following:<BR>
<P>
         1. Obstetrics<BR>
         a. The full range of obstetrics, includ-<BR>
            ing high-risk obstetrics and medical<BR>
            and surgical complications of pregnancy.</UL>
<P>
     Arguably this standard could be interpreted as requiring training in the management of complications resulting from botched abortions, although the term "abor-tion" (or any euphemism for it) is nowhere mentioned in the standards.  Even under this reading of the standard, however, it would clearly be unethical for a program to arrange for a botched abortion to give the residents a training opportunity.  Conducting a trial of a new drug (one that never did reach the market) would just as clearly be an unethical way to fulfill such an obligation.
<P>
     But the bottom line is that no such obligation existed in the late 1970s when the trial was conducted, nor does one exist now, when Dr. Foster cites it as justification for Meharry's participation in the Phase 2 trial and uses it as a mask for a major abortion activity he obviously did not want disclosed.  It is only an added insult to common knowl- edge when Foster continues to cite this erroneous account of accreditation requirements to justify a project that was clearly taken on because of Dr. Foster's lifelong commitment to abortion.
<P>
     Finally, it should be pointed out that as of the date of this testimony, March 24, 1995, a complete accounting of Dr. Foster's activity on behalf of abortion is still not in the public record.  He has specifically excluded revelations regarding any abortions he may have performed prior to 1973, when he began his association with Meharry.  His basis for the exclusion is the unavailability of records prior to that date.  Given how well Dr. Foster's "recollections" have served him and the administration on other issues, it's just as well.
<P>
<B> Involuntary Sterilization</B>
<P>
     Dr. Foster's involvement in the possily involuntary sterilization of four mentally handicapped women is the only controversial issue in his background that was placed before the public by action of the White House.  Its discovery, however, was inevitable, as Dr. Foster himself described the prcedures in an article entitled "Removal of the Normal Uterus" in the <I> Southern Medical Journal </I>in 1976.v  Dr. Foster states in the article only that he had "begun to use hysterectomy in patients with severe mental retardation.  Hysterectomy," he noted, "can be done <I>eithe</I>r [emphasis added] for sterilization or to eliminate the menses[.]"vi<P>     Whatever the presumed indication for the procedure, obviously hysterectomy eliminates both fertility and the menses.  This is important because hysterectomy carries significantly higher risks to the mother than the conven-tional means of sterilization (salpingectomy, i.e., removal of the Fallopian tubes).  As Stephen Trombley's valuable history of coercive sterilization makes clear, the United States in the early 1970s experienced a "sterilization explosion."vii  At least part of the impetus for the proce- dure (besides the desire of Planned Parenthood and other population control groups to promote permanent methods of sterilization, particularly on eugenic grounds) was the desire to provide medical students with the opportunity to perform hysterectomies.viii<P>
     This "sterilization explosion" did not go unnoticed or unopposed.  In fact, by 1973 the Health Research Group, affiliated with Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, Inc. had pub-lished a major report on sterilization abuse.  The report documented the sudden rise in sterilization, particularly targeting the indigent, the uneducated and the young, and called for federal regulation, especially to ensure informed consent.
<P>
     This report provided the statistical and anecdotal basis for federal interest in sterilization reform, but as Trombley writes, the report attained its full effect "only after the problem of sterilization abuse was heightened by the personal tragedy of the Relf family."ix<P>     Interestingly, the Relf case took place in Alabama in 1973.  Once again a major public health controversy brewed virtually under Dr. Henry Foster's nose, without his being aware of it, and at a time when had begun to perform hyster- ectomies.  The Relf case deserves a brief synopsis.  A poor balck family living in Montgomery, the Relfs had three daughters, ages 12 to 16.  At the behest of the local family planning service, the three girls were injected with the contraceptive drug Depo-Provera.  In March 1973, the oldest girl, Katie was taken, without her parents' consent, to a family planning clinic, where an IUD was inserted over her objections.
<P>
     A series of events then brought the remaining two girls, along with their mother, to a local hospital, where the mother, unable to read or write, was induced to place an "X" on a document authorizing them, without hr knowledge, to be sterilized.  A subsequent effort by the family planning service to sterilize Katie failed.  
<P>
     That summer, the Relf case came to the attention of Sen. Edward Kennedy, who on July 10, 1973 invited the Relfs to his office.  By happenstance, Sen. Kennedy's committee was at that same time engaged in the hearings on health care and human experimentation spawned by the Tuskegee incident.  The Relfs proceeded to file suit against the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, resulting in a judgment requiring the federal government to issue guidelines providing for the protection of minors from sterilization and for informed consent.
<P>
     Contemporaneous with <I> Relf </I>was the <I> Wyatt </I>case, in which a federal court declared unconstitutional an Alabama law that permitted the sterilization of mentally retarded inmates of state institutions.  Although compulsory steril-ization remained legal in many states during the 1970s, the issues raised by the Health Research Group and debated in the federal courts in Alabama had risen to national prominence two to three years before Dr. Foster's article appeared in<I> the Southern Medical Journal</I>.  Despite this fact, Foster's article makes no mention of these develop- ments, and betrays no awareness of any kind that, even in his own state, he was part of a rapidly dying consensus that such sterilizations as he had "begun" to perform were med- ically and morally unacceptable.
<P>
     As columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote on February 17, the circumstances surrounding these surgical sterilizations (why higher-risk hysterectomies were performed, whether informed consent was obtained, and from whom) involve serious questions.  The apologia that Foster performed only four such sterilizations does not answer these questions; in fact, as Krauthammer notes, "It breyas an obvious discomfort with what Foster did.  It reinforces the sense that the moral climate of the 1970s was not nearly as alien as some pretend and that even in that ancient time surgically sterilizing the retarded was a morally troubling act."x<P>    I only note in passing that Dr. Foster's first account of abortions he performed was one.  Once again, Foster failed to notice a major public health controversy that sprang up largely as a result of incidents just down the road from the institutions he helped to lead.<P><B> I Have a Future</B><P>     The plausibility of Dr. Foster's commitment to abstinence as his first priority in educating young people about sexuality was discussed above.  One example should suffice.
<P>
     In 1987 the Planned Parenthood Federation of America distributed a report written for it by Marie Haviland-James, apparently affiliated with Michigan Planned parenthood.  The report was an ideological assault on "Sex Respect," one of the most venerable abstinence education programs in the United States.  The following account of the Haviland-James report appears in an analysis of sex education programs written and published in 1991:
<P>
<UL> The Haviland-James report provided guidance<BR>
       to Planned parenthood sex educators opposing<BR>
 <I> Sex Respect </I>and seeking its removal from the<BR>
       schools.  The memo urged opponents of <I> Sex <BR>
       Respect </I>to argue that it "violates the separa-<BR>
       tion of church and state" and risks litigation<BR>
       from the American Civil Liberties Union {whose<BR>
       late counsel, Harriet Pilpel, once represented<BR>
       both organizations].  It charged that the pro-<BR>
       gram is faulty because it contained "many refer-<BR>
       ences . . . to a 'spiritual' dimension of sex-<BR>
       uality; contained use of the word 'baby' for<BR>
       fetus"; expressed "bias . . . against people<BR>
       who are sexually active and unmarried"; "com-<BR>
       pared stealing of money continually with con-<BR>
       tinued sexual activity'; contained " a descrip-<BR>
       tion of a woman haunted by guilt"; omitted <BR>
       "pro-choice material"; and, of greatest inter-<BR>
       est, included "unsubstantiated claims" such as<BR>
       "abstinence has future benefits for teens" and<BR>
       "because of the special nature of human sexual-<BR>
       ity, there's no way to have premarital sex <BR>
       without hurting someone."  The memo concluded<BR>
       that <I> Sex Respect </I>"appeals . . . to the lowest <BR>
       common denominator of mentality."xi</UL><P>     Once again, the most chartible interpretation that can be put on Dr. Foster's involvement with an organization that takes this aggressive a stance against abstinence education is that he is wholly unaware of it.  Fortunately, there is more direct evidence of Dr. Foster's approach, which is at best "abstinence-plus," with the abstinence part thrust with embarrassment up his sleeve.
<P>
     The Family Research Council has obtained a copy of the eight-page brochure produced by Foster's "I Have a Future" program to introduce the program.  Over a couple of thousand of words of text, the word "abstinence", or its equivalents is not mentioned once.  The phrase, "delaying the initiation of sexual activity," common in all true abstinence materials, is not mentioned once.  On the other hand, the brochure repeatedly stresses the objective of the program to enhance "contraceptive availability," to address the problem of "poor" "contraceptive practices," and to promote "distribution of contraceptives."xii<P>     Efforts by the Council and the media to obtain a full copy of the "I Have a Future" curriculum have been rebuffed.xiii  If the currciulum is as its sponsors say it is, this reaction to public curioisity is itself curious.  In fact, one would expect that, upon his elevation to Surgeon General, Dr. Foster would proudly promote the "I Have a Future" curriculum as a model abstinence program.  His pride should be just as great before this committee votes.<P><B> Conclusion</B><P>    These are but a few of the issues that attend the nomination of Dr. Herny Foster.  Ther common link is that in 1995, the United States deserves to have in this position of authority an individual with a clear vision of the public health consequences of personal behavior, an abiding commit- ment to marriage and the family, an alertness to the ethical dimensions of today's contemporary controversies in medicine and public policy, an unblemished record of candor and truth-telling to the American people, and a concern for every mother and child.  
<P>
     Henry Foster has shown that he is not that person.

<title>Gary Bauer's July, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

July 12, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

The Bauer family had a close call last month.  An unusually strong
summer thunderstorm ripped through the Washington area, bringing
with it 150-mile-per-hour winds.  To make matters worse, a tornado
touched down on our street, knocking down trees and sending limbs
flying through walls and onto rooftops.  Fortunately, our house
was largely spared, but a neighbor's home was badly damaged.

<p>

My daughter, Elyse, and I were driving home through the storm
when the tornado hit.  I'll never forget the sight as we turned
down our street and saw how the severe weather had rearranged
the familiar objects of our daily lives.  The storm was gone in
a little more than an hour, but it was incredible how quickly
so much raw destruction was wreaked on our community.  Human beings
are no match for the forces of God's Creation.  We were struck
with a sense of awe -- and our hearts were filled with thanks that
the destruction was not worse and that no one was injured or killed.

<p>

That twister wasn't the only storm I encountered last month.
Throughout the month of June, I found myself caught up in a whirlwind
over the Republican Party Platform and the sanctity of human life.
Debate over the GOP's pro-life plank has been going on for years,
but this new storm kicked up suddenly and unexpectedly.  It came
about when Sen. Robert Dole, the certain GOP presidential nominee,
called for the addition of  a &quot;declaration of tolerance&quot;
to the platform, and suggested that it be applied <I>only</I>
to the abortion language.  That current language in the existing
platform says that the unborn child has a fundamental right to
life that cannot be infringed, and calls for a human life amendment
to the Constitution.

<p>

Let me say right up front that Sen. Bob Dole and I have known
each other for years.  I consulted with him last fall, at his
request, before he delivered his speech in Hollywood calling on
the entertainment industry to reverse its tide of sex-and-violence
for profit.  We have collaborated over the years on many other
issues.  A few weeks ago, Jim Dobson and I prayed together with
Bob in his Capitol Hill office.  I consider him a friend, and
I believe he would say the same about me.

<p>

But, in my humble opinion, Bob Dole is wrong about the pro-life
plank. It cannot and should not be changed.  Talk about revising
the plank has been swirling, of course, for months in GOP circles.
Some prominent pro-abortion Republicans, like Govs. Christine
Todd Whitman and Pete Wilson, have insisted on removing it altogether.
To do so would repeat the discussion that took place in the Democratic
party some years ago. The 1992 Democratic Platform endorsed an
abortion on demand philosophy.  A previous statement tolerating
the presence of pro-life Democrats in the party was stripped from
the platform.  As a result, President Clinton has vetoed every
attempt to restrict abortion, including those in the 7th, 8th
and 9th months of pregnancy.

<p>

All during the early summer, I was among a number of pro-life
leaders who were kept abreast of negotiations taking place among
leading Republicans.  After weeks of discussion, an agreement
was reached to include &quot;open door&quot; language in the preamble
to the platform.  That language would only state the obvious:
that the GOP platform stands for a set of principles, and that
not every member of the party agrees with every one of those principles.
The sanctity of human life would not be singled out or in any
other way watered down.  The current pro-life plank, powerful
and unequivocal, would remain as written. No deletions.  No dilutions.

<p>

This solution was acceptable, but within 24 hours Bob Dole himself
overturned it. He used a television interview to declare his
intention to put the tolerance language right in the pro-life
plank. Talk about a twister out of the blue!  This so-called
solution was totally unacceptable, and I said so publicly.  The
sanctity-of-life plank is among a handful of essential statements
in the GOP platform.  To attach &quot;tolerance&quot; language
directly to that plank would signal to the world (and the media
immediately interpreted it this way) that the Republican Party
regards it as one of the least important issues facing the nation,
when in fact the issue goes to the heart of the fundamental purpose
of liberty.

<p>

Just consider the impact of including tolerance language on another
subject, say, taxes:  &quot;We favor tax relief for overworked
Americans, but we recognize that many people disagree with us.&quot;
You would instantly recognize that the party which said this
wasn't serious about cutting taxes.  The same holds true for the
profound question of whether unborn children and their mothers
should be protected from the exploitation of abortions.

<p>

What followed my public criticism of Sen. Dole's proposal was
uncomfortable for both of us.  The senator took me on by name,
and major newspapers were happy to splash the dispute across page
one.  I kept my comments focused on the issues at stake, but it
was an awkward moment for me anyway.  Disputes among friends will
always draw a crowd of spectators.  But this fight, gut-wrenching
as it was, has an upside.  First, I have high hopes that, by the
time you read this, the dispute over the pro-life plank will be
resolved with an agreement that makes it clear that our children
deserve the full protection of the laws of the United States.
Second, this public argument gave me a rare chance to address
the nation on why the sanctity of human life matters so much.

<p>

National Public Radio, as liberal a media outlet as there is,
interviewed me in drive-time, and my comments were carried fairly
and without censorship.  <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Washington
Post</I> and other major papers accurately reported my defense
of our children.  The following weekend, I was invited to appear
on the prestigious CNN public policy show, <I>The Capital Gang.</I>
I was able to tell large segments of the American people what
our nation's abandonment of the sanctity of human life is doing
to the fabric of our society.  All of this came on the heels of
unprecedented media opportunities for the Family Research Council
(FRC), including appearances on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I> 
and <I>Face the Nation</I> and a write-up in <I>Time</I> magazine
featuring our principled stands.

<p>

Since all of this happened, I have heard from many people who
say they don't necessarily agree with FRC on every issue, but
that we give them something to think about.  This is vital to
remember.  Where &quot;tolerance&quot; language goes in the Republican
platform -- whether it's there at all -- isn't just a matter of dotting
&quot;i's&quot; and crossing &quot;t's.&quot;  If an issue isn't
important enough to appear in any party's platform, then it's
not worth a national conversation.  How we address the sanctity
of human life will determine whether this nation endures, or whether
it is torn away forever from the ideals that motivated our Founders.

<p>

Let me take a moment here to thank you.  In the middle of this
hot debate, hundreds of you called, wrote and faxed me your support.
Countless friends prayed for my family and for FRC.  Believe
me, we felt that encouragement.

<p>

My relationship with Washington leaders in both parties, including
Bob Dole, matters very much to me.  But the Family Research Council
is committed to speaking the truth:  on the needs of families,
on neglected children, on coarseness in the culture, on the virtue
deficit, and on the violence corroding our common sense of neighborliness.
We will speak the truth in election years and non-election years.
We will speak up when it pleases our friends, and when it doesn't.
To do otherwise would be to convert this organization into just
one more nest of political hired guns in the nation's capital.
I won't have that.  The issues facing America are bigger and
more enduring than one presidential race.

<p>

You will be happy to know, for example, that we are working with
a courageous band of Democrats in Congress who are struggling
to add &quot;tolerance&quot; language to the 1996 Democratic Platform.
This is &quot;tolerance&quot; language we <b><i>can</i></b> support
because it moves in the opposite direction:  it would say that
there is room in the Democratic party for people who champion
the &quot;little guy&quot; in the womb.  Unfortunately, I am not
optimistic about a change in their platform even though 40 percent
of registered Democrats hold pro-life beliefs.  For nearly a decade
now, the party has turned a deaf ear to their pleas.  Instead,
they have allowed radical feminists, the ACLU and gay rights groups
to turn the party into a vehicle for radical social change.

<p>

As I've emphasized many times before, FRC does not endorse candidates,
but we do work diligently to keep the issues affecting America's
families at center stage.  Toward that end, we will work with
anyone, anywhere, who is genuinely willing to espouse family-friendly
public policy.

<p>

While I'm writing to you, let me give you an update on another
&quot;contest&quot; in which I've been involved.  This is the
competition I proposed last January between two visions:  the
big-government philosophy of Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, <I>It
Takes a Village</I>, and the family-centered ideals of my book,
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This spring, Family Research Council
placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines challenging
the American people to compare the visions in these two books
and to choose the one that best represents their hopes for the
next generation of American children.

<p>

So here are the results to date.  The first lady's publisher
reports that 360,000 copies of <I>It Takes a Village</I> are in
print.  Those figures do not necessarily reflect actual sales.
A similar number of copies of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> have
now been sold, enough to put this little paperback on the Top
Five list of Christian best-sellers for the past three months.
In short, my competition with Mrs. Clinton is neck-and-neck.

<p>

I realize that this has happened only because thousands of faithful
supporters like you have bought multiple copies of <I>Our Hopes,
Our Dreams</I> and shared them with neighbors, friends, and fellow
believers.  I can hardly ask you to do more.  But consider this:
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> was written as a straightforward,
easily understood summary of what has drawn pro-family Americans
into the public policy arena in record numbers.  Can you think
of anyone -- an acquaintance or business associate -- who would benefit
from the couple of hours it takes to read this statement of pro-family
principle?

<p>

If you can, it's easy to use our &quot;800&quot; number to order
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> directly from us.  Better still,
however, you can take a step that will aid a vital voice in your
community and help boost the ranking of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
on the best-seller lists.  Visit your local Christian bookstore
and obtain or order a copy there.  Christian booksellers play
an irreplaceable role in spreading the Word, attracting new Christians
and encouraging &quot;old&quot; ones.  Many of these establishments
exist on a shoestring, and they struggle at this time of year.
Please take a moment to drop by and let them know you appreciate
their presence in your community.

<p>

Have a blessed and enjoyable summer (may it be as storm-free
as possible, too!).  From all of us at Family Research Council,
thank you for your support, and God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. Summers are a great time for families, a time for vacations
and building memories for a lifetime.  The only problem is that
cagey Washington insiders know that grassroots Americans are distracted
from their handling of critical issues. <b><i>This summer, FRC especially
needs your help</i></b>. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) <I>must</I>
be passed before a Hawaiian court acts in August.  The
Partial-Birth Abortion bill <I>must</I> get a powerful vote in
the House this month to override Bill Clinton's veto.  And we
<i>must</i> push for desperately-needed tax relief for families with
children before Congress adjourns for the fall election campaigns.
I hope you will prayerfully consider giving us your financial
support this month.  With your help, I am convinced that we can
stay in the fight and win. Thank you and God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's December, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

December 6, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>It was a great comfort to feel, all during the
last days when affairs looked doubtful, that no matter how things
came out the really important thing was the lovely life I have
with mother and with you children and that compared to this home
life everything else was of small importance from the stand point
of happiness.

<p><ul><ul>

Theodore Roosevelt<br>
from a letter to his son Kermit<br>
1904</i>

</ul></ul></ul></ul>

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

Christmas comes to Washington, D.C., much the
same way it comes to your hometown.  Street lights come on earlier,
stores stay open later, there are smiles on more faces, and bell-ringing
members of the Salvation Army brave the cold and take up their
posts.  Around the city seasonal decorations are hung from every
pillar and post, multi-colored bulbs burn in windows and on trees.
Fervent prayers for safe travel go forth, as we remember Christmases
past and eagerly anticipate the arrival of family members, including
sons and daughters from college or military assignments around
the globe.

<p>

Yes, Christmas comes to Washington as it does
to every other city, but it comes here with a rather peculiar
force.  Partly it's because of the history of our nation's capital,
but even more significantly, I think, it's because of the political
nature of this city.  Throughout most of the year, an air of aggressive
secularity reigns in Washington.  Faith is not absent here, but
it too often takes a backseat to the public business being conducted.
Not so at Christmas-time, however.  As an anonymous writer once
noted about Christmas in Washington, &quot;Officially, the government
of the United States does not celebrate religious holidays.  Unofficially,
of course, it does.&quot;

<p>

That &quot;unofficial&quot; celebration of the
birth of Christ has irresistible power.  The white columns of
government buildings are festooned with wreaths and ribbons.
Christmas trees are lit at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
On the open Ellipse just south of the White House the National
Christmas Tree stands proudly, established by President Calvin
Coolidge and lit every year since 1923.  Each year, thousands
of visitors come to visit the tree and to see the life-sized Nativity
scene that even the Scrooges at the ACLU have been unable to dislodge.

<p>

On one occasion our National Christmas Tree
was nearly darkened -- not by church-and-state lawyers, but by
the nightmare of a nation at war.  On December 7, 1941, Japanese
forces attacked Pearl Harbor.  America entered the war and Nazi
Germany and Fascist Italy declared war upon us.  In those first
days of the conflict blackouts were declared along the East Coast
as American leaders feared the worst.

<p>

In Washington, too, a blackout was ordered.
Our military and the Secret Service compiled a list of actions
they wanted taken to protect the Executive Mansion and the Congress,
including even the repainting of the White House in standard Army
Air Corps camouflage.  President Franklin Roosevelt resisted many
of their recommendations, rightly sensing that they would seriously
depress the indomitable American spirit.  But one security demand
made him bristle the most:  <I>no Christmas Tree on the Ellipse</I>,
the agencies said, <I>it would be too obvious a target</I>.

<p>

But Roosevelt refused to give in, and on Christmas
Eve, 1941, President and Mrs. Roosevelt stood on the south portico
of the White House and threw a switch to light the National Christmas
Tree, as a national radio audience tuned their receivers.  In
the midst of the blackout, the tree provided the only light for
miles around.  Beside the Roosevelts on the portico stood Winston
Churchill, who had traveled secretly to Washington and arrived
only that morning to encourage his American partners.  That night,
the British leader delivered a message that captured the essence
of the symbol Roosevelt was defending in lighting the tree.  Churchill
spoke to (and for) all Americans when he said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Let the children have their night of laughter . . . Let us
grown-ups share . . . in their unstinted pleasures
before we turn again to the stern tasks and the formidable
years that lie before us, resolved that by our sacrifice
and daring these same children shall not be robbed
of their inheritance or denied their right to live in
a free and decent world.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Today, of course, the clouds of war are not
gathered on every side.  But Churchill's words, and the meaning
of Christmas, retain all of their urgency.  Sacrifice and daring
are still needed in this fight, fought with words of persuasion
and prayers of petition, for the right of our children and our
grandchildren to live in a free and decent world.  If I have any
goal at the Family Research Council, it is to continue to frustrate
the Scrooges and the nay-sayers by keeping the lights burning
brightly on the Christmas trees of family, faith and freedom all
throughout this great land.

<p>

Christmas truly is the feast of childhood.
On this holy day, we mark the event where our God in heaven came
to us as a child, with a message that we must come to Him as children
if we want to see His face.  The words of Teddy Roosevelt that
I quoted at the beginning of this letter offer us another reminder
of the meaning of our work in this life.  Teddy was a remarkable
president, but an excellent book about him called <I>A Bully Father</I>
reminds us of the priorities that ruled his life even in the midst
of political turmoil. Teddy Roosevelt placed his family first,
no matter what the season.

<p>

His ardent devotion to conservation led him
to refuse to place a freshly cut Christmas tree in the White House.
But during his White House years he turned a blind eye when his
sons carried a tree up into the residence and hid it in their
closet.  On Christmas morning, his letters to his children reveal,
he rejoiced in the family custom of gathering in his and Edith's
bedroom as the six children romped and peered into their stockings
and opened their presents.  These events recalled for TR &quot;just
such a Christmas&quot; as he had known in his youth, and it was
&quot;just such a Christmas&quot; he endeavored to reproduce exactly
for his own family.

<p>

This Christmas season, I'm sure your family
has its own traditions to relive, customs you seek to renew time
and time again.  It doesn't really seem to matter what they are:
large or small, children remember and treasure each one.  My prayer
is that you will enjoy each and every moment that you have together.

<p>

For my family, Christmas will be particularly
special this year.  For a short while, life once again will be
exactly as it was ... Carol and me coming down the stairs each
morning to find all of our children under our roof.  Our daughter
Elyse will be home from college after a long semester.  She hasn't
chosen a major yet, but increasingly she feels drawn toward political
science and law.  On campus, she really enjoys her involvement
in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.  Our high school sophomore,
Sarah, is learning to drive.  In addition to that excitement,
every Tuesday she and a dozen classmates gather at our house at
6:30 in the morning to pray and share their love for God and His
Son Jesus Christ.  Our son, Zachary, just celebrated his 10th
birthday.  He continues to grow in his faith, while he uses his
God-given talents and abilities to play every sport possible.
His soccer season just ended and basketball practice has already
begun.

<p>

Now that I have filled you in on my family,
it occurs to me that we would like to have an update from you, too. 
A few years ago, I asked readers of my monthly letter to send us
a family picture and tell us about their family.  We still treasure
the pictures and letters we received.  With permission, many of
those letters and the incidents they relate have found a place
in one of our publications, like <I>Reunion</I> or <I>Let Freedom
Ring</I>, or in the military exhibit at our new location in 
Washington.

<p>

If you have a moment -- perhaps while you're
sending out your Christmas cards or in the quieter days after
Christmas -- could you send us an updated photograph and tell
us how your family is doing?  If you haven't written before or
are new to my letters, we're all the more anxious to learn something
about you and your family.  Your photos and letters mean a lot
to all of us at FRC.  They remind us, just as Teddy Roosevelt's
letter to Kermit does, why we're here and whom we represent. They
also remind us that our happiness rests on a foundation that no
one can take away.

<p>

Thank you for all you do in partnership with
us to help build and preserve that &quot;free and decent world&quot;
of which Churchill spoke.  Next month, I'll be writing to share
with you the specific policy steps we will be pursuing with the
105th Congress to help achieve that &quot;world&quot; -- steps
to protect the sanctity of human life, to clean up our polluted
culture, to ease the economic pressures on families, and to promote
education reforms that help ensure that every child hears the
kind of historical truths that are recounted in this letter.

<p>

From all of us at FRC to all of yours, both near
and far, we wish you a peaceful and blessed Christmas.  May God
be with you this holiday season and throughout the coming year.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  End-of-year gifts represent a major portion
of the funds the Family Research Council receives from our supporters.
As you consider the gifts you intend to make this Christmas,
I sincerely hope you will consider FRC worthy of your continued
support.

<title>Gary Bauer's August, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

August 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
he giveth strength. Even the youths shall faint, and be weary; and 
the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord 
shall renew their strength; they shall mount with wings as eagles; 
they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not 
faint.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

<i>- Isaiah 40:29-31</i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

While watching the Olympic games last month, I couldn't help
but recall these poignant words from the prophet Isaiah.  These
verses play a pivotal role in the classic film <I>Chariots of
Fire,</I> the true story of Scottsman, Eric Liddell, an Olympic
runner.  Liddell recites this passage from Scripture at a church
service held on a day he was supposed to run a race in the Paris
Games. <I>Chariots of Fire</I> tells how Liddell, a dedicated
Christian, refused to run on the Sabbath, standing by his personal
conviction in the face of intense pressure from the future King
of England and others.

<p>

Even though my athletic ability won't get me into the Olympics,
I must tell you that these hectic summer months have all of us
at Family Research Council (FRC) running hard.  Time and again,
we are led back to God's promise that He will renew our strength,
that he will enable us to effectively run the race and that His
strength will never fail.  FRC's staff has truly been pressed
to the limit in recent days, and just like Olympic athletes, we
have experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Let me share with you, some of the many hills and hurdles FRC
has encountered.

<p>

This month, the major events requiring our attention are the
conventions of national political parties.  The Republicans met
first in San Diego, followed by the National Taxpayer's Party,
Ross Perot's Reform Party, and finally the Democrats.  The Libertarian
Party has already nominated its presidential candidate.  As a
non-partisan organization, FRC continues to focus its energies
on providing each of these parties with a detailed agenda for
families. As I reported to you last month, FRC has advocated
the pro-family agenda in a wide variety of public forums and we
will continue to do so regardless of  the response we receive
from party leaders and the media elite.

<p>

As you read this, chances are I'll be returning to Washington
after having taken the pro-family message to the GOP Convention
in San Diego.  We have urged each of the nation's political parties
to make America's families a priority.  We want Democrats, Republicans,
and the smaller &quot;third parties&quot; alike, to see &quot;family&quot;
<b><i>not</i></b> in terms of election cycles, but in terms of daily
responsibilities and everyday needs.  We have urged them all to
adopt platforms that strengthen marriage, recognize the sanctity
of human life, cut taxes for families, and to pay increased attention
to the cultural decay undermining our society.

<p>

In San Diego, I addressed a rally at Sea World designed to urge
the GOP to uphold its commitment to the sanctity of life, to lower
taxes on families and to work for economic opportunitiy and growth.
I made our case to convention delegates and to the national media,
who always crowd these events.  In the weeks before the conventions,
my schedule was crammed with appearances on network and cable
talk shows to discuss the issues at stake during this election
year.  Incredibly, FRC was cited more than 1,500 times in the
print media nationwide in June.  Needless to say,  FRC Press Secretary,
Kristi Hamrick and her quality staff are incredibly busy.

<p>

For my part, there was CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; to discuss
the GOP platform plank on abortion, an appearance on &quot;Crossfire&quot;
with former Gov. Carroll Campbell to discuss the presidential
campaign, another visit to the weekly commentary show, &quot;The
Capital Gang,&quot; an interview with Ollie North on his daily
radio show and numerous other media opportunities.

<p>

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, FRC has provided in-depth research
and related resource materials to lawmakers who are concerned
about the attack on traditional marriage. Our recent full page ad in
<I>USA Today</I>, which I described in my June letter, was just 
the opening move in our effort to inform citizens
about the potential impact of an expected court decision in Hawaii.
This decision would recognize same-sex marriages and potentially
impose similar recognition on other states.

<p>

To most Americans, I suspect, the reason that one man/one woman
marriage is so vital to the survival of our society almost goes
without saying.  But in these times, people need regular, convincing
reminders about the fundamentals.  That's why FRC recently hosted
a briefing on Capitol Hill, which gathered together a group of
distinguished scholars, physicians, and public policy experts
to discuss the far reaching implications of  &quot;same sex&quot;
marriage.  The briefing was carried live on C-Span, and was re-aired
several times during the next 24 hours.  As a result, millions
of Americans had the opportunity to join with legislators and
congressional aides to see and hear the powerful testimony that
was presented.

<p>

The arguments against homosexual marriage are convincing and
familiar -- so familiar, in fact, that many of us have forgotten
how to effectively articulate them.  FRC's briefing brought together
people like adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former homosexual
Anthony Falzarano (who now leads Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries
in Washington, D.C.), Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley
Arkes, psychiatrist and former Yale University Fellow, Jeffrey
Satinover, and FRC's own Bob Knight, each of whom drove home the
essential values that are at stake in this debate. <i>(To help
you understand and articulate the arguments, FRC has condensed
this briefing into an hour-long video -- see the enclosed
reply card for information on how to obtain a copy for your church
or action group.)</i>

<p>

One week after the briefing, I found myself in the thick
of things again as I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  Disappointingly,
most of the senators who attended are very liberal and they are
also in favor of allowing same-sex marriages.  Before I testified,
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), a primary opponent of DOMA, used the
hearing to attack the bill.  His central point was that marriage
laws traditionally have been made by the states, and that DOMA
would violate the principle of &quot;federalism,&quot; which says
that Congress will not interfere with the powers of state government.
Unbelievable! Ted Kennedy, quoting &quot;states rights,&quot;
while he has been the major proponent of bigger and bigger government
here in Washington. Maybe cows really can fly!

<p>

Kennedy left before I testified, but as I was finishing my remarks
he returned to the hearing room, so I couldn't resist a jab.
&quot;Senator Kennedy,&quot; I said, &quot;this is the first
time in your career you've made such an outstanding defense of
federalism.&quot;  The usually somber hearing room broke into
raucous laughter, and the liberal senator from Massachusetts sank
back into his chair speechless.  The irony is, DOMA makes a powerful
statement in support of the right of each state to ignore the
radical judicial inventions of other states.  It's true federalism
all the way.

<p>

On the day after my testimony, the full House of Representatives
voted for DOMA 342-67.  This 5-1 margin of victory makes it clear
that DOMA <b><i>is</i></b> mainstream and that the aggressive ambitions
of the homosexual lobby <b><i>are not</i></b>.  In the coming days, FRC
will continue scrambling to help ensure that DOMA passes the Congress
without amendments and goes to the president for signature.  We
intend to do everything we can to send the Hawaii courts -- and liberal
judges everywhere -- a powerful message.

<p>

Here are several other fronts on which FRC has been fighting
for America's families:

<p><ul>

<li>FRC Director of Legal Policy, Cathleen Cleaver, has been in
the thick of the raging debates over computer pornography, cable
porn, and social issues from assisted suicide to religious liberty.
Cathleen played a key role in the recent adoption of the Communications
Decency Act, a bill passed by Congress earlier this year that
will help keep distributors of computer porn away from our children.
A federal court in Philadelphia struck down this law, but Cathleen
has begun work on FRC's legal brief to the Supreme Court, which
is likely to hear the case this fall.

<p>

FRC is also fighting for the right of citizens to offer sidewalk
counseling to women seeking abortions.  Cathleen prepared a brief
to the Supreme Court in the <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network</I>
case and she is working with other lawyers to prepare oral arguments
to be made before the Court. Two major assisted suicide cases
are also getting our attention.  Either one could lead to a landmark
Supreme Court ruling which would protect human life, or put millions
of elderly and handicapped Americans at risk.

<p>

Finally, Cathleen is taking her effective debating skills before
some very tough audiences, and more than holding her own.  This
summer she has debated cable porn with Elliott Mincberg of People
for the American Way. She also locked horns over computer porn
with the government relations director of America On-line (a
longtime lawyer for the porn industry.) The computer porn debate
was shown on C-Span to a national audience.

<p>

<li>Robert Maginnis, FRC Policy Analyst has continued to spearhead
our Military Readiness Project. Bob came to FRC from the U.S. Army,
following his retirement, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
Together with Melissa Wells-Petry, the Armed Forces' acknowledged
expert on the policy banning service in the military by homosexuals,
Bob has guided FRC's work this summer on three major court cases
regarding the ban. One of these cases, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
may soon be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<p>

Bob has been working diligently on the drug issue as well, and
one glance at the trends will tell you how urgent this is.  In
the past three years, drug abuse has spiraled, especially -- and
most disturbingly -- among elementary school-age children using
gateway drugs like marijuana.  Bob recently attended a major
international drug conference in Sweden, and in early August he
met with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug czar,
to lay out FRC's specific concerns.

<p>

<li>Then there's Marty Dannenfelser, FRC Director of Government
Relations, and his excellent staff who have worked long and hard
on the effort to override the Clinton veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban. A vote in Congress, on this issue, is expected
soon after Labor Day. Marty's experienced team also played a
major role in the passage of a new bill which creates a national
commission on gambling, working in conjunction with our friend,
Congressman Frank Wolf (R- Va.).

<p>

<li>FRC has also been blessed to have the talents of Bob Morrison
and Jennifer <i>A</i>. Marshall on education issues, Jennifer
<i>E</i>. Marshall (that middle initial is not a misprint -- the
mail-sorting staff at FRC has its hands full!) on welfare reform
and voluntarism, Ryan Dobson (Jim Dobson's son) on youth issues,
and Steve Knudsen, our new director of state and local affairs,
who helped put together our recent press conference with state
family policy councils to endorse laws barring same-sex marriage.

</ul><p>

These are just a few of the activities that have kept FRC moving
at a sprinter's pace this summer. I wish I could tell you more
about the work of each and every member of our dedicated staff
members in Washington, D.C. and in Holland, Michigan, where our
constituent services and information systems teams are located.
FRC's team is top-notch, and it includes you, our beloved supporters.
Working together, we can make a significant difference in the
future of our country... in the way our families, our children,
and our grandchildren will spend their lives.

<p>

Thank you for all you do to help keep FRC moving forward. Your
involvement in our work is essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. While we've been busy running the race, financial support
for our work has fallen into the typical summer doldrums.  Your
help would give FRC a special boost right now, so please consider
making a contribution if you possibly can. Again, thank you -- and
God bless you.

<title>Gary Bauer's June, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

June 7, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

June is fittingly called &quot;the month of weddings.&quot; 
As the first real warm days of summer finally arrive, skies are
blue, flowers are blooming, and brides and grooms are seemingly
everywhere.  Marriage is never out of season, but I can think
of no better time than the month of June for our nation to reaffirm
the value and meaning of marriage.

<p>

As this letter is written, a reaffirmation of marriage is taking
place all across our land.  You can hear it in the peal of church
bells and read about it in wedding announcements and church bulletins.
You can even see it in brightly decorated cars parading by on
dazzling June days.  But this reaffirmation is taking place in
another way, too.

<p>

In Washington, DC, and in over 30 states, legislators are stepping
forward to make sure that marriage is protected in American law.
My letter is brief this month because the Family Research Council
is in the thick of this essential effort.  The reaffirmation of
traditional marriage is coming <b>just in time</b>.  Even as I
write this, an organized assault is in progress to redefine marriage
to allow men to marry men and women to marry women.

<p>

Let me recap quickly what has happened.  In 1993, the highest
court in Hawaii handed down a shocking decision.  Liberal judges
there said that Hawaii's law limiting marriage to one man and
one woman (similar to laws in every other state) was a form of
sex discrimination -- unless the state could somehow show that it
had a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in reserving marriage to
couples of the opposite sex!  Hawaii is a very liberal state politically,
but this ruling sparked immediate outrage even there.

<p>

Nearly three quarters of Hawaii's citizens told pollsters they
<I>reject</I> making Hawaii a haven for homosexual couples to
&quot;marry.&quot;  In 1994 the Hawaii legislature responded and
passed a law reaffirming that marriage is intended for &quot;man-woman
units&quot; -- not two men or two women.

<p>

Despite the findings of this poll, and subsequent efforts to
convince the courts that Hawaii does have a &quot;compelling interest&quot;
here, most experts believe that traditional marriage in Hawaii
will be struck down -- perhaps as soon as this August.  If that happens,
homosexual couples from every state in the Union are ready to
fly to Hawaii and find &quot;chapels&quot;or Justices of the Peace
to marry them.  They will then return to their home states and
demand recognition of these marriages from their state and local
governments, from their employers, from the courts, from their
churches (and from you)!

<p>

The worst news is that these demands have a good chance of succeeding.
Under what is known as the &quot;Full Faith and Credit&quot;
clause of the U.S. Constitution, each state is required to recognize
the &quot;Public Acts, Records and Judicial Proceedings&quot;
of every other state (Article IV, Section 1).   States that refuse
to recognize these Hawaiian &quot;marriage&quot; licenses as valid
are likely to find themselves being sued in court, with the outcome
uncertain.  Unbelievably, the action of a single court -- or even
a single judge -- in Hawaii could lead to a revolution that undoes
the sanctity of the marriage bond in every corner of the United
States.

<p>

<b>We must not -- and cannot -- allow this to happen!</b> When Hawaii's
Supreme Court ruled in 1993, FRC responded with alerts and issue
papers pointing out the devastating impact that would follow.
We and other groups encouraged states to respond by reaffirming
the traditional definition of marriage to insulate it from attack.
The word has spread rapidly, and a wide coalition of religious
and family groups and legislators of all political persuasions
is currently pushing for marriage protection laws.

<p>

Such laws have now been enacted in at least eleven states, and
more may be signed into law by the time you read this.  In addition,
the Congress of the United States is set to respond to this challenge.
With FRC's help and through the dedicated efforts of legal experts
on Capitol Hill, legislation has been introduced to protect marriage
in federal law.  This legislation is called the Defense of Marriage
Act, or DOMA.  It was introduced in the House of Representatives
on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob  Barr (R-Ga.).
Senate introduction of the legislation followed on May 8 with
Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and Bob Dole (R-Kans.) as co-sponsors.
The respective bill numbers are H.R.3396 and S.1740.

<p>

Make no mistake, this bill is vitally needed.  Sen. Dan Coats
(R-Ind.) issued a powerful statement endorsing the bill and explaining
the importance of marriage.  His quote is worth sharing at length:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage is the institution that civilizes our society by 
humanizing our lives. It is the social, legal and spiritual 
relationship that prepares the next generation for its duties and 
opportunities.  An 1884 decision of the Supreme Court called it 
&quot;the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization.&quot;

<p>

The definition of marriage is not created by politicians and judges, 
and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in our history,
in our laws, our deepest moral and religious convictions, and our 
nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and one woman. 
This fact can be respected or resented, but it can't be altered.

<p>

The institution of marriage is our most valuable cultural inheritance. 
It is our duty -- perhaps our first duty -- to pass it intact to the 
future . . . It is amazing and disturbing that the debate should even 
be necessary.  It is a sign of the times, and an indication of a deep 
moral confusion.  But events have made the definition of traditional 
marriage essential.  The preservation of marriage has become an issue 
of self-preservation for our society.</i>

</blockquote><p>

With Senator Coats' words, the case for marriage rests.
Be assured that the Family Research Council will continue to
work with him and other like-minded legislators in both parties
to secure passage of this bill as soon as possible -- before a final
decision is reached by the Supreme Court in Hawaii.  Americans
need to be heard before our courts intervene and disturb yet another
legal ideal.  Our goal is that DOMA will swiftly reach President
Clinton's desk and that he will have no choice but to sign it
into law.

<p>

<b>The need for passage of this bill could not be more urgent.
On May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state of Colorado's
Amendment 2, which would have blocked special rights for homosexuals.
One leader of the homosexual movement bragged, &quot;This is
a joyous day for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.&quot;</b>

<p>

Please join with us in this effort.  Use the enclosed card, or
call us at 1-800-225-4008, to obtain a free copy of our information
packet on saving the institution of marriage.  Take note of the
enclosed copy of the full-page advertisement we placed in the
May 19 <i>Washington Post</i>.  Feel free to make copies or contact
us to arrange to run this ad in your local newspaper.

<p>

Be assured that your prayers and financial support of the work
of the Family Research Council are what sustain us.  Your involvment
and commitment to FRC will enable us to continue in our efforts
to defend the divine institution of marriage.  As always, thank
you for your friendship, and may God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

Since 1991, Kristi Hamrick has served the Family Research Council 
as director of communications, aggressively taking the pro-family 
message forward both in paid media (advertising) and earned media 
(news).  Mrs. Hamrick manages a broad operation that handles all 
in-coming requests from the news media -- from CNN to <I>The New 
York Times</I> -- and out-going media strategy, developing the 
framework for taking the pro-family message nationwide, via 
television, radio and print, and through such vehicles as op-ed 
articles or policy pieces.

<p>

The news operation at FRC, a pro-family policy and lobbying group, 
works to respond to breaking events and to look ahead at the trends 
that are shaping the American family.  The goal is to influence the 
cultural mindset by taking part in every pro-family debate as it

debates regularly on television, and her appearances include ABC's 
<i>Good Morning America, CBS This Morning</i>, NBC's <i>Today Show, 
The Montel Williams Show, Fox News</i>, CNN's <i>Jesse Jackson Both 
Sides</i> and numerous other CNN programs.  Her articles have appeared 
in <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/hamdoc.html"><I>USA Today</I></a>, 
and she has been quoted nationwide, in publications including the 
<I>New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Washington 
Times, USA Today, Boston Globe</I>, Gannett News, Knight Ridder News, 
and The Associated Press. Her voice can be heard daily on radio 
programs throughout the United States.

<p>

As part of the coordinated FRC effort, Mrs. Hamrick also develops 
media strategies as part of FRC's work in government relations, 
grassroots coalition building, research and policy development, 
corporate and community outreach and publication marketing.

<p>

Before joining FRC in 1991, Mrs. Hamrick worked as press secretary 
in the Hopkins for Governor Campaign.  Mrs. Hamrick was a spokesperson 
for the campaign and directed the media operation for the U.S. 
congressman from Kentucky when he won his primary bid. Earlier in her 
career, Mrs. Hamrick also worked in the press operations of the late 
U.S. Senator John Heinz and Senator Arlen Specter, both of Pennsylvania.

<p>

Most of Mrs. Hamrick's experience is in the media.  In Washington, 
D.C., she was an on-air correspondent for CBN News Washington, D.C. 
Bureau, covering social issues.  In print, Mrs. Hamrick worked for 
<I>The Muncie Star</I>, covering courts, crime and politics, after 
completing a Pulliam Fellowship at <I>The Indianapolis Star</I>. In 
fact, Mrs. Hamrick worked her way through college as a writer and 
journalist.  She continues the crafts of a wordsmith, working on 
occassion as a freelance journalist.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick's extensive speaking experience includes many appearances 
in schools and colleges.  She also taught news writing and advanced 
news writing at Ball State University in Indiana.

<title>Gary Bauer's October, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

October 16, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

<i>Last month, just before the Congress adjourned, the Senate held its 
historic debate on partial-birth abortion.  At the end of an incredible 
day on Capitol Hill, I sat down at 1:00 o'clock in the morning to write 
you this "eyewitness account"</i>:

<p>

It's nearly 1:00 o'clock in the morning as I write this month's letter to 
you. I have just finished an unbelievable 20-hour day in which my emotions 
have run the gamut from exhilaration to deep despair.  The focus of 
today's events was the vote in the United States Senate to overturn 
President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. We lost that 
vote, but in the process we may have taken a giant step toward stopping the 
ongoing tragedy of abortion on demand.  Let me share with you a few excerpts 
from the roller coaster ride I was on today as we spoke the truth about the 
sanctity of human life to the powerful elites here in Washington, D.C.

<p>

My day began on the <i>CBS Morning News</i>, where I debated Kate Michelman 
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.  As is 
usually the case, the morning talk shows only give us four or five minutes 
to present our views on an issue -- this morning was no exception.  I knew 
I had to have my arguments down pat, for there is little time to hesitate 
or reflect when you're sitting in a TV studio under a bank of hot 
lights.  I also knew a sharp debater like Michelman would be sure to 
quickly fill any time I didn't use.

<p>

I often feel frustrated after such a debate because I don't usually get 
enough time to fully express my views or because I don't think of the 
best way to articulate some arguments until the debate is over.  But 
this morning was a "home run."  The CBS anchorwoman was fair, and she 
gave me equal time.  I was able to establish for the millions of people 
watching that partial-birth abortions <i>do</i> occur thousands of times a 
year -- most of them for purely elective reasons rather than because of 
health problems of the mother or her baby.  Kate Michelman presented few 
relevant arguments and seemed unusually low-key.  It had to be tough for 
her to defend the position that it could ever be okay to abort a baby in the 
eighth or ninth month of pregnancy by stabbing it in the back of the head.

<p>

But there was no time to relish the debate victory. I was immediately 
rushed from the CBS studio to attend an extraordinary prayer breakfast 
on Capitol Hill.  Pro-life senators led by Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania 
hosted the gathering to pray that senators' hearts would be touched 
before they voted.  The solemn gathering in that small room included 
some of the real "stars" of the pro-family/pro-life movement -- proven 
crusaders like Chuck Colson and my good friend and colleague Jim Dobson 
of Focus on the Family. We took turns asking God for His wisdom and 
strength for the tough hours of lobbying ahead.  More importantly, we 
prayed that God would have mercy on our country as it slips further 
and further into the culture of death.

<p>

A few minutes after breakfast, the ecumenical group gathered again -- 
this time in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  There 
we participated in a press conference on the upcoming vote.  Fourteen 
pro-life leaders made individual statements before a bank of TV cameras 
and a forest of microphones.  The room was jammed from one wall to the 
other, and the hot TV lights glared down on us all.  We were expecting 
the usual hostility of the liberal Washington media.  But again, 
strangely, there were no real arguments -- no hardball questions. Only 
one reporter even asked a question, and I was given the opportunity to 
answer.  He asked whether I was satisfied with the attention Bob Dole 
had paid to the issue. My response was clear: I told the reporter 
that Bob Dole was not responsible for partial-birth abortions.  I said 
we were here because Bill Clinton had vetoed a bill passed overwhelmingly 
by the Congress to stop these horrible procedures.  I then urged Senator 
Dole in the remaining days of the campaign to emphasize the issue and to 
draw the stark comparison between himself and his opponent so the 
American people could clearly understand their choice.

<p>

After the press conference, we all fanned out on Capitol Hill to buttonhole 
lawmakers.  We met Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania as he got off the 
Capitol subway, and, even though he is usually pro-abortion, we ultimately 
won his vote. A few minutes later, we encountered Senator Joe Biden of 
Delaware, and he ended up voting with us too.  Unfortunately, other senators 
were harder to convince.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas refused to hear 
us out when we appealed to her in the Senate dining room.  She said she 
didn't even think the Senate should be discussing the issue.  My good 
friend Kay James, who is a black American, told Mrs. Kassebaum that she was 
glad that her attitude didn't prevail in our country when slavery was 
being debated over 100 years ago!

<p>

As we walked the halls of the Capitol, the abortion debate was raging on 
the floor of the Senate.  Good friends, senators like Dan Coats of Indiana, 
John Ashcroft of Missouri and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, led the floor debate 
while a hushed gallery of visitors looked on.  The pro-abortion side was 
led by Barbara Boxer of California.

<p>

We sat in the Senate gallery together to watch the proceedings -- myself, 
Dr. Dobson, Kay, Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America, Anthony 
Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and a dozen other 
allies.  As I looked around, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on 
in the minds of tourists from all over America who had brought their 
children there with them.  They seemed subdued, almost shocked, as they 
heard senators describe this terrible procedure.  At one emotional moment, 
one pro-life senator pointed to a picture of a baby and shouted in 
exasperation, "This is not an appendix; this is not a lump of tissue; this 
is a baby!"  Here's what happened next as reported by <i>The Washington 
Post</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in one of 
those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like a stage set, with its 
rich wooden desks somehow too small for the matters at hand, the cry of a 
baby pierced the room, echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway.

<p>

No one mentioned the cry, but for a few seconds no one spoke at all.</i>

</blockquote><p>

No one knows whose baby it was that brought the Senate to silence that day, 
but I can't help but believe that God chose that moment for this child to 
cry and, by so doing, to remind the Senate that "choice" in this case means 
the death of <b>real</b> human beings.

<p>

Soon the voting began.  As I am sure you know by now, our efforts helped 
win a clear majority, but we still fell short of the 66 votes needed to 
overturn Clinton's veto.  It was a tragic day, but even in the midst of 
our disappointment and heartbreak, there were some encouraging developments. 
I am convinced that something is stirring among God's people.  The 
cooperation of a large number of religious leaders from different 
denominations and from all parts of the country was unprecedented.  I'm 
convinced, too, that a new level of coalition building has been achieved 
and that the groundwork has been laid for better communication and 
cooperation in the future.

<p>

As the day wore on, my message was the same in every press interview. I 
told reporter after reporter that America is better than the vote that just 
took place.  I also told them that our nation was founded as a "shining 
city on a hill", that we are a unique experiment in liberty under God 
with rights and responsibilities that come only from Him. And this vote 
to allow the outright killing of nearly-born children through the promotion 
of abortion-on-demand sticks in our throats.  It will never go down easy 
with Americans because it violates every tenet of our founding.  Our 
conscience will not rest easy as long as we continue to allow the sacrifice 
of these children.

<p>

More than ever, I believe our beloved nation is at a crossroads, with the 
question Lincoln posed at Gettysburg still before us. As he stood on 
hallowed ground, he said we were conceived in liberty and asked whether 
"this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure?"

<p>

This is the great question facing our nation as we go into the next century. 
How we resolve the issues of life, family and marriage will determine whether 
America during the next century can still be that "shining city on a hill".

<p>

Even though the hour is late for our country, we must never cease our efforts 
to protect our spiritual heritage.  As God told Solomon, "if my people, who 
are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and 
turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive 
their sin and will heal their land." (II Chronicles 7:14 NIV) We must 
redouble our prayers seeking God's mercy as the elites of our nation look 
farther away from Him. I want you to know that my staff and I are committed 
to do everything in our power to defend the values that have made our 
country great.

<p>

The Family Research Council is here to represent and serve you.  But I have 
to be honest. In recent weeks we haven't been hearing from enough of you. 
We need your encouragement, and your prayers, and we need to know if you 
stand with us in the battle for family, faith and freedom.  We also pray 
that, if you are able, you will choose to help FRC financially, <b>after</b> 
you have met the needs of your family and your church.

<p>

In closing, it's my prayer that God will richly bless you and your family. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. FRC is preparing a special analysis of the upcoming elections 
focusing on how the results will impact you and your family.  To receive

you and may God bless America.

<title>Gary Bauer's May, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

May 15, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

You probably read about the incredible speech Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia delivered at a prayer breakfast in early April at 
the Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson. Scalia delivered 
a stirring defense of the role of Christians in public life. The 
reaction was a prolonged standing ovation. But there was no ovation 
for the speech inside the Washington Beltway, where FRC fights 
every day on behalf of your family, or among America's cultural 
elite.

<p>

&quot;Justice Scalia: Defender of the Faith,&quot; sneered the
headline in the <I>International Herald Tribune.</I>[1]

<p>

The speech &quot;clearly undermines public confidence in [Scalia's]
objectivity regarding religious controversies,&quot;[2] said Barry
Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.

<p>

&quot;This is a disturbing view for a Justice to have,&quot;[3] said
Elliott Mincberg, legal director of Norman Lear's group, People for
the American Way.

<p>

The speech should have set off &quot;alarm bells,&quot;[4] charged
political columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover.

<p>

In a few pockets of liberalism outside the beltway the reaction
was even harsher:

<p>

Humor columnist Art Buchwald fired away: &quot;When a Justice
is hearing a case, no secular person can feel comfortable with
a member of the court who is thinking, 'If this lawyer doesn't
believe in the &quot;burning bush,&quot; he has a serious constitutional
problem.'&quot;[5]

<p>

<I>Des Moines Register</I> writer Donald Kaul, suggested that
Scalia &quot;occupies the outermost reaches of the right of the
court (some days you can only reach him by dogsled).&quot;[6]

<p>

What words could have possibly sparked such -- there's no other word
but <I>scornful</I> -- reactions from so many elements of the working
press? Scalia spoke to the crowd of 650 fellow Americans about the 
difficulty of upholding Christian beliefs, especially a belief in miracles,
in our increasingly secular society. He pointed out that the word
&quot;cretin,&quot; or &quot;fool,&quot; is derived from the French
word for &quot;Christian,&quot; and added:

<p><blockquote>

<i>To be honest about it, that is the view of Christians taken
by modern society. Surely those who adhere to all or most of these 
traditional Christian beliefs are to be regarded as simple-minded.</i>[7]

<p>

The &quot;worldly wise,&quot; he went on:

<p>

<i>just will not have anything to do with miracles . . . [they
assume] that everything from Easter morning to the Ascension had to 
be made up by the groveling enthusiasts</i> (the disciples - ed.) 
<i>as part of their plan to get themselves martyred.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

In the midst of this cynicism, he concluded, &quot;We must pray
to endure the scorn of the sophisticated world.&quot;[9] Justice 
Scalia's prayers came not a moment too soon. Those
who immediately attacked the speech, calling it contrary
to American tradition and inconsistent with his role as a judge,
seemed blissfully unaware that they were only confirming the truth
of what he said.

<p>

One professor of constitutional law at American University in
Washington, D.C., blasted the speech and remarked, &quot;We expect
our Supreme Court justices to be the most secular of our public
servants.&quot;[10] <b><i>We</i></b>? Where in our
Declaration of Independence and Constitution is it written that
judges must be less endowed with a sense of religious conviction
than other officials? The professor could only have been speaking
for that group of Americans who agree with <I>his</I> own expectation.
Most Americans <i>still</i> believe that every citizen, regardless
of their religious belief, is equal before the law. It is that
very equality -- the right of Christians to bring their full convictions
into the public square -- that Justice Scalia, and we at FRC, believe is 
under attack.

<p>

Don't let me leave the impression here that Scalia was without
defenders. Among them was syndicated newspaper columnist Cal Thomas,
who eloquently reminded readers that it was a rather
well-known &quot;public servant,&quot; Abraham Lincoln, who said,
&quot;But for this Book [the Bible], we would not know right from
wrong.&quot;[11]

<p>

Is there a difference between Presidents and Supreme Court Justices
in this regard? Our history and tradition say otherwise. The
Supreme Court begins each day of oral argument with the bailiff
stating, &quot;God save this honorable court.&quot; As you enter
the Supreme Court building, there is, on the right side of
the portico, a statue of Moses holding aloft the tablet of the
Ten Commandments.

<p>

The critics say, &quot;Those are mere symbols, devoid of meaning.&quot;
They believe that Scalia crossed a line that Justices must never 
cross -- expressing his religious faith. But once again, they 
don't know our history! Justices of our Supreme Court have time 
and again pronounced themselves about religious faith in general 
and Christianity in particular.

<p>

John Jay, the first Chief Justice, said in 1777:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers,
and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and the interest, of a 
Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

Imagine any public official saying something similar today! No
Christian leader or politician would echo Jay's observation today,
but the point is, such beliefs were not extraordinary among the
men and women who founded this nation. Daniel Webster is esteemed
as one of the five greatest senators in U.S. history, by resolution
of the Senate.[13] At the bicentennial of the Pilgrims' landing at
Plymouth Rock in 1620, Webster's keynote address included these
words:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Our ancestors established their system of government on morality
and religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot safely be 
trusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor any 
government be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Whatever 
makes men Christians, makes them good citizens.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

In July 1835, when Chief Justice John Marshall died, the Liberty
Bell was rung, sustaining the crack that is one of the keys to
its fame.[15] Are American traditions affronted by the fact that the
Liberty Bell, one of a handful of supposedly secular American
&quot;shrines,&quot; bears the words of Leviticus 25:10: &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof&quot;?
In 1852, Justice John McLean wrote a letter asserting that &quot;Aside
from Revelation, darkness rests upon the world and upon the future.
The Bible has shed a glorious light upon the world.&quot;[16]

<p>

To all of these examples, dozens more could be added, from
Lincoln to McKinley to Coolidge, to TR and FDR, to John F. Kennedy,
to Jimmy Carter, to Ronald Reagan. Candid assertions of the importance
of religious beliefs to democratic institutions transcend partisan
divisions. It was Justice William O. Douglas, perhaps the Supreme
Court's leading liberal for nearly four decades, who wrote
that, &quot;We are a religious people whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;[17]

<p>

In short, what Justice Scalia said is in keeping with
a long line of statements by American jurists and statesmen. But
what about the substance of what he said? Do Christians face any
special level of scorn in modern society? Sadly, I believe they
do. Among the Beltway publications, the liberal <I>Washington Post</I>
published the most hostile appraisal of Scalia's speech. Of course, 
just a few years ago, they printed a front-page story suggesting 
that Christian voters are &quot;poor, uneducated and easily led.&quot;

<p>

Just a few weeks ago, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> printed a cartoon
showing a crucified Bob Dole. A crown of thorns was depicted lacing
his head, with the crown composed of letters spelling out, &quot;Christian
Coalition.&quot;[18] That same paper, on Easter Sunday, refused to
print the regular Johnny Hart comic strip called &quot;B.C.&quot;
because it referred positively to the Resurrection of Christ.
&quot;B.C.&quot; was out, and PC, political correctness, was in!

<p>

Perhaps the real scourges in our society today are reserved for
sincere religious believers <I>of any kind</I>. Consider what
happened to Marian P. MacDonald and Teen Challenge. Marian spent
32 years building an outstanding record as a public school teacher
in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was forced to resign her post
last month under pressure from the school system. The reason?
She invited members of Teen Challenge to one of her health and
physical education classes. Teen Challenge is an extremely effective
drug rehabilitation organization that incorporates religious principles
in its program.

<p>

The visiting teens told MacDonald's class they believed God had
helped them overcome drug abuse, but added, &quot;We are not here
to push our religion off on anybody.&quot; Apparently, that disclaimer
was not enough. The school principal sent a note home to parents
apologizing for the teens' &quot;insensitive comments.&quot; An
investigation followed, and MacDonald was essentially fired.[19] 
Stories like this are all too common.

<p>

I believe that Justice Scalia, whose sense of fairness and level
of scholarship are without match in the federal judiciary, has paid
religion the high compliment of taking it seriously. As I reported
to you last month, Christian convictions <I>are</I> cause for
persecution in many lands around the globe. Bigotry against
Christians in American, by comparison, seems mild; but that bigotry
is real nonetheless. Moreover, the aggressive, secularizing forces
in our nation today are committed to keeping you and me out of 
government, law, and the public debate on all the great issues.

<p>

True religious tolerance <i>is</i> the American way. But Justice
Scalia's critics would have you believe that the sanctity of human
life, traditional marriage, equal access of religious speakers
to the public square, and dozens of other ideas are merely a religious
creed and not the common code of civilization. In a healthy society,
Scalia's articulation of his private thoughts in the setting of
a private prayer breakfast would not have been news. That
they are news at all tells us a great deal about the crisis facing
America today.

<p>

I can assure you that, with your help, the Family Research Council
will continue to speak calmly, but passionately, in behalf of
moral values and true religious liberty. We hold with Daniel Webster
that good Christianity and good citizenship go hand in hand. And
we invite all Americans of goodwill to join with us in honoring
and preserving the values of family, faith and freedom.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. We'd love to hear from you this month. Many of you are already
aware of the &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; included
in my book <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> The Compact is designed
to renew the spirit of cooperation among our citizens. Its final
provision states, &quot;In our personal lives, we promise to honor
the Creator, who made us and endowed us with such unalienable
rights as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We will
practice our faith on a daily basis and will gather with others
to worship regularly. Without resorting to coercion or vilification,
we will encourage faith, and the fruits of faith, in others.&quot;

<p>

Just check the enclosed reply card if you would like a free copy
of the Compact, suitable for framing. Thank you for your support
of our efforts on behalf of America's families and for reading
my letter this month. God bless you.

</center><p>

Early in 1995, Miss Marshall joined the Family Research Council's 
public policy team to contribute her research skills and experience 
in the field of welfare. Her responsibilities as policy analyst 
include tracking, analyzing, and writing about proposed legislation 
on welfare reform. In addition, her analysis and research benefit 
FRC in educating key decision makers in the U.S. Congress and at the 
grass roots nation-wide.

<p>

Through her studies at Rice University, in various internships 
throughout her undergraduate experience, and most recently, at the 
American Enterprise Institute with Charles Murray, Marshall has 
developed a keen understanding of compassionate welfare reform and 
school choice as well as a familiarity with the U.S. Congress and 
the formulation of public policy. 

<p>

Miss Marshall began her career in Washington as an intern in the 
Office of Congressman Tom DeLay in the summer months of 1990 and 
1991. In 1992, she served an extended internship in the White 
House Office of Political Affairs during the critical months of 
the campaign. She moved on to work in the Office of the Deputy 
Convention Manager at the 1992 Republican National Convention, with 
particular responsibility for caucus teams. Since then, she has worked 
in the Houston office of George Bush and, in 1993, in the office of 
the Deputy Executive Director at the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee.

<p>

Through the years, she has volunteered time for local Republican 
party activities and campaigns, both local and Presidential. Her 
campaign experience includes a stint as opposition research 
coordinator for a Congressional candidate in Houston. 

<p>

Native of Texas, Marshall graduated <I>Summa Cum Laude</I> from Rice 
University in 1994 with majors in Policy Studies and English. She is 
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Rice Fellow.

<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95c2dr.html">Legalization of Drugs: 
The Myths and The Facts</a>: an article by Robert L. Maginnis

<p>

After a distinguished career in the U.S. military, Lieutenant 
Colonel Robert (Bob) L. Maginnis, USA Ret., joined the Family 
Research Council in 1994 to handle one of the most difficult 
social problems facing American society and American families 
today -- the crisis of crime.  In addition, Colonel Maginnis' 
skills as an analyst, writer, speaker and team leader will be 
applied to family issues impacted by military/foreign affairs 
policy and cultural issues. Already nationally known as an expert 
on the Pentagon and a spokesman on military issues, Colonel 
Maginnis brings to FRC a broad perspective on today's toughest 
issues.

<p>

In his many roles, Colonel Maginnis has appeared on ABC, NBC and 
CBS evening news shows, CBS "This Morning," "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
Newshour," CNBC "Cal Thomas," CNN's "Crossfire" and "Larry King 
Live" as well as other programs, such as "Donohue," and on numerous 
networks.  He has been quoted many times in newspapers across the 
country from the <I>New York Times</I> to the <I>LA Times</I>.  
His editorial pieces have been published in the <I>Washington 
Times, Orange County Register, Chicago Tribune, The Miami Herald</I> 
and elsewhere. And the colonel has been featured on most major radio 
shows nationwide.

<p>

In July 1993, Colonel Maginnis retired from an assignment in 
the Pentagon where he served as an Inspector General.  He is 
an airborne-ranger infantry officer with an assignment history 
that includes Korea, Germany, Alaska, and several posts in the 
continental United States.  He served in command and staff 
positions in four infantry divisions from platoon to division 
level.  The colonel was the chief for the U.S. Army Infantry 
School's leadership training branch.  He developed curricula, 
taught, participated in leader development research and consulted 
with leaders and soldiers throughout the Army. He is the author of 
more than fifty articles published in professional military 
journals concerning ethics, leadership, and personnel matters 
impacting the military.

<p>

In the last eight months of his military service, Colonel Maginnis 
was a member of the Army's study group examining the homosexual 
ban.  He also was advisor to the Defense Department Military 
Working Group on homosexuals in the military.  In that role, he 
debated the issue in the media as well as speaking in various forums 
-- including testifying before a House subcommittee. Because of his 
expertise, Colonel Maginnis is also, on occasion, a spokesman for 
the Defense Readiness Council, a non-profit organization that led 
the fight to keep the homosexual ban.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis' service in the armed forces was commended with 
the Legion of Merit, the highest peacetime decoration, as well as 
with five meritorious medals and four commendations. Among his over 
fifty letters of commendation is one from former President Jimmy 
Carter who honored the colonel for inventing a laser training 
device, at great savings to the armed forces.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis received his B.S. from the United States Military 
Academy, West Point, New York in 1973 and a M.S. from the Naval 
Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in 1983.  He is also 
a graduate of many military schools, including the Command and 
General Staff College.

<p>

Long active in his community and in many organizations, the colonel 
now coordinates his church's participation in homeless shelters. 
He, his wife and two children live in Northern Virginia.

<title>Gary Bauer's September, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

September 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>Restoring parental rights to their original firm foundation
in U.S. constitutional law is crucial to our overall efforts to
reinvigorate the democratic ideal of citizenship.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

-- from <i><b>FRC's Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</b></i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

A few weeks ago Carol and I drove our oldest daughter, Elyse,
back to college for her second year of studies.  It was wonderful
to have her home for the summer, and saying good-bye was really
hard.  The summer months flew by, reminding us once more how precious
is the time that we have together as a family.  Even though Elyse
attends college only a few hours' drive from our home outside
Washington, D.C. -- close enough for us to see her on some weekends -- 
she's still much farther away than we would prefer.

<p>

Millions of families go through this emotional ritual each September,
and it doesn't really matter that much whether your child is heading
off to college, high school, or to a nearby elementary school
classroom.  Each fall mothers and fathers face the same anxieties
and pressures:  how will my children fare in school?  Will their
teachers recognize their special qualities?  Will teachers honor
and respect their talents and beliefs or will they try to convince
them to &quot;question authority&quot; and reject the values they
have been taught?  What about their classmates?  Will they make
friends?  Will those friends help uphold their faith?  Or will
their faith be weakened?  Or worse, will our children be lead
into trouble?  Is there anyone out there besides us who really
understands the worth of our beloved children?

<p>

Today, questions like these are being asked by every parent and
they unfortunately have a special sharpness to them.  Many of
our nation's schools are no longer the &quot;common ground&quot;
of shared values and aspirations that generations of families
counted on them to be in the past. All too often, today's classrooms
are laboratories for radical ideological experimentation. The
teaching profession has been politicized as never before. Textbooks
and lesson plans routinely foster a liberal world view. Attempts
to isolate, intimidate and confuse religiously inclined students
continue. Violence and illegal drugs are found even in elementary
schools. The &quot;safe sex&quot; philosophy still dominates
sex education.

<p>

I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics on educational decline,
so I won't repeat them here.  The public education establishment
routinely goes out of its way to question the depth of the problem,
but, in the same breath, rushes to endorse the latest reform plan,
a tacit admission that our schools are falling short.  Let me
be especially clear here:  many, if not most, of our teachers
are dedicated educators who are motivated by a love of learning
and of children.  Many, if not most, are disturbed by the same
education fads that distress parents.  Like parents, these teachers
are ill-served by education leaders who are constantly reinventing
the wheel and interfering with what works in real classrooms.

<p>

In fact, the education policy debate of the last few years has
been dominated by the <I>illusion</I> of reform. With every fiber
of their being, the leadership of the nation's massive teachers'
unions, the National Education Association (2.2 million members)
and the American Federation of Teachers (900,000), have opposed
nearly every change in the way our schools are financed and operated.

<p>

Bogus education reform schemes come and go.  Many of them have
impressive-sounding names and a stellar line-up of sponsors.
Desperate for signs of improvement that will give their children
hope, parents are sold various reform packages under such brand
names as Outcome-Based Education, Goals 2000, character education,
mandatory voluntarism, New American Schools and restructuring.
These schemes have different details, but they have at least
two omissions in common:  they leave the basic method of funding
public education untouched, and they leave parents at the margin
of education decision-making.

<p>

The Family Research Council (FRC) is keenly aware of the concerns
expressed by America's families about education, and we are dedicated
to reversing these omissions.  We want parents to control their
education dollars.  We believe that the same hands that rock the
cradle, smooth the fevered brow, set the table, and clothe the
child should direct the funds that educate the child.  The centerpiece
of our campaign for education reform is massive tax relief for
families with children, coupled with genuine parental choice policies
that enable parents to select the school their children will attend.

<p>

Today, more than ever before, I am optimistic about our chances
for success.  School choice plans are gaining momentum and making
headway.  A new study by Harvard's Paul Peterson and Jay P. Greene
at the University of Houston shows that the City of Milwaukee's
parental choice plan has resulted in real academic gains for the
children enrolled in the program.  In August, state courts in
Ohio upheld the constitutionality of a school choice program that
includes religious schools.  Tax credits for families with children
will now be a centerpiece of this year's election debate.

<p>

Most importantly, I'm encouraged that, in the true spirit of
America, parents are not waiting for politicians to respond to
their needs.  They are moving in pioneering numbers to options
like homeschooling, classical education and parent-based education,
which are not so much novelties as rediscoveries of the art of
family-centered teaching and learning.  At the center of all of
this is spiritual renewal, the faith that moves mountains.

<p>

With all of the forces at work in today's education debate, FRC
has developed the <I>Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</I>.
This 64-page booklet is packed with resources to help you through
the coming school year.  Between its covers you'll find:

<p><ul>

<li>A glossary of education jargon -- what do the fancy terms 
<I>really</I> mean?

<p>

<li>Feature articles on major topics like Outcome-Based Education,
the religious rights of students, and parental rights in today's
schools.

<p>

<li>Addresses and phone numbers of key resources for homeschooling
and classical education.

<p>

<li>A reference section containing everything from newsletter sources
to web sites dealing with education issues.

</ul><p>

Our <I>Survival Guide</I> is designed to put a wealth of helpful
information at your fingertips.  It's yours for a donation of
any amount -- please use the enclosed reply card to order your copy
today.

<p>

I had intended this letter to deal solely with education issues,
but drug abuse and educational failure feed off one another.
There is no way to dismiss the disturbing statistics: in the
war against teenage drug abuse, America is in full retreat. A
new federal survey shows that teen drug use has risen 105 percent
since 1992.  The sharp increases span every form of illegal drug.
Use of LSD and other hallucinogens is up 183 percent; cocaine
use, 166 percent (from 1994 to 1995 alone); marijuana, 105 percent.
One of every 10 teenagers has used an illegal drug in the past
month.

<p>

The tragedy here is that these numbers come after a decade of
progress.  By 1992, teen drug use had been driven to its lowest
point in decades.  The reason for that progress was and is easy
to understand. Our nation's policy was direct -- and repeated over
and over again in every forum where young people gather.  It said:
&quot;Drug abuse is wrong, dangerous, and stupid.&quot;  But
then, following a change in the Oval Office, we changed course.

<p>

The flow of anti-drug messages from our nation's capital dried
up.  The Clinton administration cut the office of National Drug
Control Policy some 83 percent.  MTV, and even the networks, began
to produce material that winked at the drug threat, or openly
declared the war on drugs a failure. Leaders in Congress turned
their attention to other issues. Treatment funds were reduced,
and &quot;civil libertarians&quot; ratcheted up their pressure
on highly effective social agencies like Teen Challenge that use
faith-based messages to help teenagers and young adults kick the
habit.

<p>

Let me say something here about the liberal versus conservative
debate about the treatment versus law enforcement approaches to
drug abuse.  In fact, let me say one word about it -- it is a 
<I>fallacy.</I> Both approaches are needed.  Drug abusers need treatment
if they are to re-enter society as productive citizens.  But the
truth is that even the best treatment programs are only partially
successful. Preventing the abuser from taking that first hit,
snort, or injection is crucial.

<p>

Who would propose that we eliminate hospital emergency rooms
to treat automobile accident victims?  No one, of course.  Then
again, who would argue that we eliminate speed limits, safety
belts, guard rails, and the like because, after all, we have emergency
rooms? But that's precisely what advocates of drug legalization
argue! Remember when then-Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders suggested
that problems like crime would be reduced if America legalized
drug use, saying it was time to study this option and rely on
treatment rather than law enforcement?

<p>

Elders, thankfully, is gone, but the legacy of permissiveness
she represented is reflected in what is happening now to our youth.
Last month, my senior adviser for drug issues, retired Army Lieutenant
Colonel Bob Maginnis, met with General Barry McCaffrey, President
Clinton's drug czar.  Gen. McCaffrey is a dedicated man, but he
has his work cut out for him.  FRC offered the general our heartfelt
support and suggested various ways to recapture the initiative.
New efforts to control the flow of drugs through Mexico and out
of Colombia are especially needed.

<p>

Again, we must not settle for illusion.  Attempting to treat
an ever-rising wave of drug-abusing youth will destroy our economy
and bankrupt this nation -- and, worst of all, waste the potential
of thousands of our children. Attempting to reform education
without putting parents back at the center of school decision-making
is doomed to fail as well. As always, on both of these issues,
FRC will continue to fight for the home truths that really matter:
we will work with legislators, government officials -- anyone of
goodwill, regardless of party -- who recognizes the need to strengthen
our education system and to gird our children against the sex-and-drug
culture.

<p>

We would really like to hear from you this month.  Your financial
gifts to FRC provide the lifeblood that enables us to advance
the pro-family cause.  Your prayers and involvement are essential,
too.  The cards and letters we receive provide a tremendous lift
to me and the entire FRC staff.  Because the work we do is both
draining and difficult, being able to associate names and faces
with the cause we are advancing makes our efforts all the more
meaningful.

<p>

Once again, thank you for your faithfulness.  As we continue
to work together, we can move closer to our hope and dream of
family renewal in our beloved nation.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. As our <I>Survival Guide</I> illustrates, FRC is constantly
developing new materials that make the case for family values.
Let me close by mentioning another resource that you've helped
to make a household word: <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This
companion book to the family values debate of 1996 has now reached
a total distribution of nearly 400,000 copies.

<p>

I conceived <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> as a vision for a pro-family
future -- a book that would make the case for our cause to a cross-section
of the American public. Earlier this year, FRC took out paid
advertising posing a challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
had just released her book, <I>It Takes a Village.</I> We asked
the American people to choose between the alternative visions
represented by these books.  I'm pleased to report that, thanks
to support like yours, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> has held its
own in this contest of visions.

<p>

Our original goal was to distribute 1,000,000 copies of <I>Our
Hopes, Our Dreams,</I> and to get them into the hands of people
who may not know just how much today's cultural clash over the
family means to them. If you can help us make one last push to
reach this goal and to spread the pro-family message, please take
this opportunity to do so. The enclosed card has all the information
you need.

Each month, <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/bauer.html">Gary L. 
Bauer</a>, President of the Family Research Council, writes a letter 
to the friends of FRC that highlights a current topic, analyzes a key 
family issue, or describes an ongoing or new activity of the Council. 
These personal letters both describe the FRC President's perspective 
on the most pressing family issues and chronicle the development of 
FRC projects and programs to address those issues. These letters give 
friends of FRC an inside, in-depth look at the Council's work.

<h2>The September Budget Battle: Truth and Consequence </h2><p>
<h3>Pete du Pont</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
When the Congress returns from its recess after Labor Day, the battle 
of the budget will begin in earnest.   <p>
 
While the Congress has adopted a budget resolution providing for a 
balanced budget by 2002, now it must pass legislation implementing 
that budget.  Assuming the appropriations bills follow the resolution, 
and thus reduce spending, what will President Clinton do with them?  
The budget resolution Congress adopted was not subject to a 
Presidential veto, but the appropriations bills are another matter.  
President Clinton could shred the Republican budget by vetoing 
appropriations bills that include more spending cuts than he wants.   <p>
 
But the President is in a box.  The truth is his initial economic 
policy, enacted in 1993 by a single vote in each House, has failed 
badly.  One of the consequences was the election of a Republican 
Congress.  And the consequence of that is very little room for the 
President to maneuver.  <p>
 
In the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to balance the 
federal budget in 5 years.  His first budget proposed to reduce the 
deficit primarily through one of the largest tax increases in U.S. 
history.  Spending cuts in his budget were largely offset by spending 
increases elsewhere. <p>
 
So how has this liberal fiscal policy fared? <p>
 
In 1993, before the Clinton plan was enacted, the budget deficit was 
around $250 billion.  Under the latest budget projections, excluding 
proposed Republican changes, the deficit is projected to rise to $300 
billion per year by 2000. <p>
 
The economic rationale for the Clinton budget plan was that cutting 
the deficit would reduce borrowing pressures, and consequently reduce 
interest rates.  Lower rates would in turn stimulate investment and 
economic growth.  But by the end of April of this year, the prime rate 
charged by banks was 50% higher than in 1993 when the Clinton plan was 
adopted.  Other interest rates from new home mortgages to AAA 
corporate bonds and Treasury bills and bonds were all substantially 
higher as well. <p>
 
Meanwhile, the dollar has collapsed against foreign currencies.  From 
January, 1993 to June of this year, the dollar is down one-third 
against the Japanese yen, almost one-fourth against the Swiss franc, 
and one-eighth against the German mark.  As a result, all Americans 
are poorer because their dollar incomes now buy less of the world's 
goods and services.  This is in sharp contrast to the strong dollar 
policy of the Reagan administration, which led the dollar to soar to 
record levels, making all Americans richer. <p>
 
Real incomes and wages have continued to fall under Clinton's economic 
policies, a trend which started with the tax and regulation increases 
of the Bush Administration. <p>
 
Finally, economic growth has been sluggish.  With the Clinton tax 
increases, the recovery from the recession of 1990-1991 has been the 
weakest post-recession period on record.  Job growth has been half and 
real GDP growth  only about two-thirds the rate of prior recoveries.  
Indeed, in the last full quarter, the economy barely grew at all. <p>
 
Surely the President does not want to return to this sort of fiscal 
policy.  In any event, he cannot, for the Republican Congress will not 
raise taxes.  So the best the administration can do is veto a few 
appropriations bills and hope to keep government as large as he can 
for as long as he can. <p>
 
But remember that the Constitution dealt all the budget cards to the 
Congress.  If the Congress reduces funding for a department, the 
President cannot restore the spending simply by vetoing the 
legislation.  A veto ends all funding for all of the activities of  
the department, until the President signs a Congressionally approved 
bill. <p>
 
Remember, too, that at the end of the current fiscal year on September 
30, the government cannot operate if Congress has not authorized 
spending for the new fiscal year.  Congress can consequently turn off 
the government -- or parts of it -- if the President does not accept 
the Congressional budget.  In the fall, Congress will also have to 
approve an increase in the debt ceiling for deficit borrowing to 
continue, so it holds all the cards here as well. <p>
 
So the Congress leads from strength.  The only real risk is that the 
Republicans will compromise with themselves and hand the President a 
victory he otherwise could not have won. <p>
 
If the Republicans continue to reduce regulation and taxes, 
encouraging both job and real wage growth, and stay on the glide path 
to a balanced budget in seven years, the President will have little 
choice but to sign the appropriations bills and say it was all his 
idea in the first place.<p>

<h2>RNC TALKING POINTS:<br>
TOP TEN REASONS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As conferees from both Houses of Congress meet to reconcile 
differences between the recently passed House and Senate budget 
resolutions, it is important to remember why we must balance the budget 
and what a balanced budget will mean to all of us. We've heard the 
arguments from Bill Clinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress 
about why we can't balance the budget by 2002 and why we can't reduce 
spending. Given the doom and gloom rhetoric coming from their corner, 
many Americans may be wondering why we would want to balance 
the budget at all. Here are ten good reasons: <p>
A balanced budget will reduce the burden of debt on our children. The 
national debt is now $4.8 trillion. A child born today will pay $187,000 
in taxes over his or her lifetime -- just to pay the interest on that debt. 
That's more than $3,500 in taxes every year of their working lives to 
pay for our debt. And if we do nothing, that debt will balloon to nearly $8 
trillion in 15 years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will enable us to return to the American people more 
of their hard-earned tax dollars. Federal taxes as a share of median family 
income have steadily increased from 5% in 1950 to almost 25% today. In 
fact, if the average family today paid the same percentage of their income 
in taxes as their parents did, they would have roughly $10,000 more to 
spend at the end of the year. As we balance the budget, we can reduce the 
tax burden on families (sources: Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute). <p> 
A balanced budget will bring down interest rates. Deficit spending raises 
interest rates as government borrows more. A balanced federal budget 
will result in a drop in interest rates of approximately two percentage 
points or more. This will mean a savings of $37,440 on a $75,000, 30-
year home mortgage. It will mean a savings of $900 on a $15,000 car 
loan. Everything you borrow money for will cost less (source: Joint 
Economic Committee of Congress). <p> 
A balanced budget will increase economic growth. Time magazine 
reports (see attached article) that Roger Brinner, chief economist with the 
forecasting firm of DRI/McGraw-Hill, estimates balancing the budget 
would raise America's yearly output an extra 2.5% over the next 10 years. 
That would mean an average of an extra $1,000 a year for each American 
family. <p>
A balanced budget will create more jobs. Economic growth means more 
jobs, and a balanced budget is estimated to result in 6.1 million more jobs 
over the next ten years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will increase our standard of living. The nonpartisan 
Concord Coalition concludes that without deficit spending and debt, the 
average family income today would be $50,000 instead of $35,000.  
When asked what a balanced budget will mean for most Americans, Alan 
Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress: "I think 
their real incomes and purchasing power of their real incomes would 
significantly improve ... they would look forward to their children doing 
better than they." <p>
A balanced budget will strengthen the American dollar. Clinton's deficits 
have been driving the U.S. dollar to record lows, and the most dramatic 
drop was right after he and the Democrats in Congress defeated the 
balanced budget amendment. The devaluation of our currency ultimately 
leads to a lower standard of living. But the passage of Republican 
bills in Congress to balance the budget has caused the dollar to bounce 
back. As The Washington Post reported 5/19/95, "The U.S. dollar has 
rebounded in foreign exchange markets during the past several weeks, in 
part because of a growing belief among foreign investors that the United 
States is moving to put its economic house in order." <p> 
A balanced budget will ensure that our retirement programs are safe. 
Medicare and Social Security are programs that seniors have paid into all 
their lives, and we must be able to meet our commitments to them. 
Younger people paying into these programs now must also be assured 
that the funds will be there for them when they retire. The only way to 
preserve and protect these programs is to balance the federal budget 
once and for all, so we will always have the necessary resources 
available. As Bob Myers, long-time Chief Actuary of the Social Security 
Administration has said: "If we continue to run federal deficits year after 
year, and if interest payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, we 
will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid the trust funds to 
pay for our current profligacy, or we will print money, dishonestly 
inflating our way out of indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the 
real value of the social security trust funds." <p> 
A balanced budget will allow us to spend money on programs we need, 
rather than interest on the debt. If we do nothing, entitlements and interest 
on the debt will consume all tax revenues in just 17 years. Balancing the 
budget will ensure the federal government has the money it needs to 
defend our country, fund education, build roads and perform other 
necessary and important functions of government (source: Entitlement 
Commission). <p> 
A balanced budget will restore the American Dream. Rising interest rates, 
higher taxes, and stagnant wages are robbing us of the American Dream. 
Since the early 1970s when government spending began to balloon, 
Americans' incomes have stayed flat. In 1993, the first year of 
Clintonomics, median family income declined by $709 (source: U.S. 
Census Bureau). If we balance the federal budget, interest rates 
will drop, taxes can be lowered, and wages will increase. In short, we will 
restore the American Dream for millions of hard-working American 
families.  <p>

<title>Phil Gramm Speech</title>

<center>
<h2>Speech by Phil Gramm</h2><p>
<h3><i>January 1st, 2001</i></h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Any candidate running for President ought to be able to tell you what 
they want America to look like after their programs are in effect.  It is 
particularly fitting that one of the final days of the first term of the 
next president will be January the 1st, 2001 -- the beginning of the new 
millennium.  If you choose me to be your next President, here's the 
America I will work with you to create on that day.<p>
<center><h3>BALANCED BUDGET</center></h3><p>
On January the 1st, 2001, your life will be better and your future will be 
brighter because the federal budget will be balanced.  For the first time in 
over thirty years, the government in Washington will be forced to operate 
in the black and pay its bills.  The  50 cents out of every dollar we save 
that today is siphoned off to pay for government deficit spending will be 
available to build new homes, new farms and new factories; to create new 
jobs, new growth and new opportunity.<p>
Americans will be surprised at the benefits they get when government is 
again forced to live within its means.  In the five years since 1950 when 
the federal government actually balanced the budget, prime interest rates 
averaged 3.5% and mortgage rates averaged 4%.<p>
Owning your own home will again be part of the American dream, and 
today's workers will become tomorrow's small business owners, as 
Americans will again quit their jobs and strike out on their own to start 
their own businesses.<p>
<center><h3>TAXES</center></h3><p>
On January 1, 2001, the federal government will be spending just 18 
cents out of every dollar earned in America, down from 22 cents today.  
What does that mean to you and your family?  It means $3,900 per family 
that will be spent by you rather than by Washington.  Our flat tax will be 
fully in place by January 1, 2001, and you will be able to fill out your tax 
return on a post card.  <p>
By January 1st, 2001, excessive regulations that now add as much as 33% 
to the cost of building jet engines and nearly double the price of new 
vaccines will have been lifted.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, no family farm or small business in America will 
have to be sold to pay inheritance taxes.  When you build up your 
business or farm your family will have it for keeps. <p>
<center><h3>ECONOMY</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, private investment will be at an all-time high.  
More jobs will be created and your family will earn more and keep more 
of what you earn.  With the creative genius of America once more 
unleashed, no spot on the planet will be safe from our commercial 
onslaught. <p>
By January 1st, 2001, French farmers, Japanese semi-conductor 
manufacturers, and German auto makers will be lobbying their 
governments to erect protectionist walls against American goods. And as 
President I will knock down those barriers.  <p>
<center><h3>GOVERNMENT</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, I see an America where our government will be 
doing less, but what it does it will be doing better.  Medicare will be an 
efficient health care delivery system and our seniors will know that the 
government has honored its contract with them.  Medical costs will be 
under control because we will have the right to choose the health care 
plan that best fits our needs, a plan that is competitive and efficient.  
Social Security benefits will be guaranteed and young people will be able 
to invest more in their own private retirement plans and medical savings
accounts.<p>
<center><h3>WELFARE</center></h3><p>
By January the 1st, 2001, able-bodied men and women now riding in the 
welfare wagon will have had to get out of the wagon and help the rest of 
us pull.  We will have stopped giving more and more money to 
encourage people to have more and more children on welfare.  And the 
illegitimacy rate will be falling as fast in the year 2001 as it is rising 
today.  Those who can and should help themselves will be doing it again.  
And they will be learning to love it.  And those who truly need help will 
get it in programs tailored by their own states and run in their own 
communities in partnership with their churches and charitable 
organizations.<p>
<center><h3>CRIME</center></h3><p>
It always makes me mad when I go to my mother's house and see the bars 
she has on her windows.  On January 1st, 2001, those bars will be down.  
My mother will be able to walk around her neighborhood on the darkest 
night and not be afraid, and the people she's afraid of today will have bars 
on their windows.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, your family will be safer because we will be 
grabbing violent criminals by the throat, and the 7% of criminals who 
today commit 70% of the violent crimes will be in jail where they belong.  
We won't be building federal prisons like Holiday Inns anymore.  The 
weight rooms will be gone, so will the color televisions and the air 
conditioning.  Our federal prisons will be mini-industrial parks, where 
prisoners work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.  Prisoners will be working 
during the day to pay for the cost of their incarceration and going to 
school at night. When criminals have served their full sentences they will 
leave prison with the skills they learned working, they will be able to read 
and write and they will be drug-free.  And they won't be eager to go back 
to prison.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, the sound of children playing and people chatting, 
neighbors talking to neighbors, will replace the sound of gunfire and 
sirens in America's cities.  The law will require ten years in prison 
without parole for possessing a firearm during the commission of a 
violent crime or a drug felony, twenty years for discharging it, and when 
a brutal, predatory criminal kills one of our neighbors, he will be put to 
death.  <p>
By January of 2001, we will have begun taking down the metal detectors 
in our schools, and drug dealers will know that if they sell drugs to our 
children, they are going to go to jail for ten years without parole, no 
matter who their daddy is or how society has done them wrong.
<center><h3>EDUCATION</center></h3><p>
America will not have an education President on January 1st, 2001; we 
will have something a lot better.  You will be an education parent again.  
By January 1st, 2001, there will be no federal Department of Education.  
Half of the $32 billion it now spends every year will be back in the hands 
of families in the form of an education tax credit, so that you can invest 
your own money in your own children's education. The other half will go 
back to local school districts so local parents, local teachers, and locally 
elected school board members can again set education policy. There will 
be no federal Goals 2000 -- I will repeal Goals 2000.  Education policy 
will be set by you in your home and in your schools.  <p>
With you in charge of your child's schools, the schools of America will 
for the first time in 50 years be on their way to leading the world in math 
and science, in reading and reasoning.  They will once more teach our 
heritage and our history.  Our children will graduate ready to lead 
America and the world in the high-tech, global economy.  <p>
<center><h3>VALUES</center></h3><p>
By January, 2001, America's forty year experiment with Washington 
imposing values on our people will be a bad but fading memory.  Having 
opposed Bill Clinton's efforts to impose his values on America, I will 
never try to impose my values on you.  There's only one person 
who'sever lived who I would trust to impose values on America.  And 
when He comes back, He won't need government to impose His values.  
In the meantime, we will entrust the formation of values to the American 
family.  The values of our families, refined through each family's own 
faith, will permeate up from our homes, through our neighborhoods and 
our communities to form our nation's values. <p>
And America will be a more virtuous America. When we put families 
first in America again we will love ourselves, our neighbors and our 
country better for it.  Our children will have voluntary prayer in the 
schools again, and every American will have the guaranteed right of 
religious expression.  And putting families first means respecting the 
sanctity of human life.  By January 1st, 2001 the federal government will 
have stopped funding abortion and groups that advocate it.  Federal 
judges will be appointed who will faithfully interpret the Constitution, not 
make it up as they go along.<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS</center></h3><p>
In taking the oath of office, I will place my hand on the Bible and swear 
allegiance to a Constitution that enshrines equal justice under law.  When 
my hand comes off that Bible, I will pick up a pen and by Executive 
Order end quotas and set-asides in the Executive branch of American 
government.  I will veto any bill that requires quotas or set-asides.  I will 
fight for equal and unlimited opportunity for all but there will be special 
privilege for none. <p>
With our best effort, by January, 2001, Martin Luther King's dream that 
men and women in America will be judged not by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character will have come true.  And with a 
strong economy, strong families and pervasive opportunity, we will 
rediscover in America what ordinary people with more opportunity and 
more freedom than any people who have ever lived can accomplish in 
this extraordinary land of ours.<p>
<center><h3>DEFENSE</center></h3><p>
By January of 2001, we will have rebuilt our national defenses and will 
recruit and retain the finest young men and women who have ever worn 
the uniform of this country.  We will provide them with the best training 
and the finest weapons that Americans can build.  We will guarantee that
even in a world where the lion and the lamb are lying down together, 
America will always be the lion.  On January 1st, 2001 nowhere in the 
world will Americans be in combat under U.N. command.  <p>
<center><h3>ELECTION</center></h3><p>
The election for President in 1996 is not just a contest between candidates 
and political parties, it is a choice between two very different visions for 
America's future.  Bill Clinton believes that a brighter future will be won 
with more government.  I believe it will be won with more freedom.<p>
In Bill Clinton's America on January 1, 2001, our federal government 
looks pretty much the way it's looked for the last 40 years-- except it is 
bigger, more expensive, and more powerful.  But we reject that America.  
The test results are in:  big government had 40 years to do the job and it 
failed.<p>
If we are bold enough in defining our vision of an American future 
dominated by freedom and family, Bill Clinton will be remembered as 
the last President of a liberal era when big government arrogantly thought 
it knew best.  Bill Clinton is yesterday's president wedded to yesterday's 
government.  I will be tomorrow's President.  I will lead America back to 
the future to reaffirm, as our founders did, the revolutionary idea that 
ordinary people with freedom and opportunity can decide their own 
destiny and the destiny of the world.<p>
<center><h3>NORMAN ROCKWELL</center></h3><p>
As we ask our people to look up from the crisis of the present and to 
share our vision of what America can be, some will say that our vision 
looks a lot like a Norman Rockwell painting.  And I won't deny it.  But 
should we accept anything less?  After all, Norman Rockwell's paintings 
presented America as we wanted it to be and as we knew it could be.  
And I see Norman Rockwell paintings in the making everywhere in the 
history of our families and in the history of our country.<p>
I can see a Norman Rockwell painting of my wife's family.  Her 
grandfather came to America as an indentured laborer to work in the 
sugar cane fields in Hawaii.  He had no money.  He spoke not one word 
of English.  He didn't know anybody in America.  He came with a dream, 
with a devout faith, and with willing hands.  Twenty-five years later, his 
son, my wife's father, got on a freighter leaving Hawaii to come to the 
mainland with $25 he'd won in an essay contest and the dream of going 
to college.  He came home to Hawaii as an engineer and became the first 
Asian American ever to be an officer of a sugar company in the history of 
Hawaii.  And under President Reagan and President Bush, his daughter, 
my wife, served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, where she oversaw the trading of all commodities and 
commodity futures, including the same cane sugar that her grandfather 
came to America to harvest.  I'm not sure that even Norman Rockwell 
could have captured that story in a painting.  But the only thing 
extraordinary about that story is that there is nothing extraordinary about 
that story.  It's a story of an ordinary family in an extraordinary country. <p>
Neither of my parents graduated from high school, but my mother had a 
dream before I was born that I was going to college.  I resisted.  I failed 
the third, seventh, and ninth grades, but it didn't make any difference to 
my mother. My mother prodded me every step of the way through 
collegeto a Ph.D. in economics because in the America we grew up in, 
mother's dreams did not die easily.  Too many mothers' dreams are dying 
too easily in America today.  And I want our America back.<p>
We have a right to dream great dreams because we're Americans.  If 
American history proves anything, it proves that with leadership and 
courage what we can dream we can do.  <p>
Our founders dreamed they could start the world over again and they did 
it in America.  With God's help we can make our dream, The American 
Dream, a reality.  Now and forever.<p>

<title>Budget Reform</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
Washington Watch<br>
Volume 6, Number 10<br>
September 23, 1995<br>

<h2><center>KEEPING BUDGET REFORM ON TRACK</h2></center><br>

	White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his "no new taxes" pledge. Today, they decry "a train wreck" they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. <p>
	First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996 Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.<p>
	House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period, but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. <p>
	
<h3><center>Media's False Picture</h3></center><br>
	Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal also produces $2 trillion in new federal debt.  <p>
	Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They claim the tax cuts will "explode the deficit,."  But more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief  is dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes. Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition of the tax package will be very "family friendly."<p>
	Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending is projected to increase at twice the rate of inflation even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.  The argument that tax cuts "explode the deficit" is answered by pointing out that tax revenues actually increased by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a budget surplus today. <p>
	Not a penny can be spent unless both houses of Congress approve. This gives the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers' money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal activism. Congress has an obligation to use its "power of the purse" to protect the legitimate interests of the American family.<p>
	
<h3><center>A Contest of Wills <br></h3></center>
	Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may try to get through October by passing "continuing resolutions. But, by early November, the Treasury's authority to borrow will expire.  Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling.  If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash is possible. But essential services like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social Security will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will be a great hue and cry from the liberal interest groups who see their funds disappearing.<p>       
	A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest groups.  What happens if a few weeks or months go by and the public doesn't miss the "services?"  That would provide a very powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a  liberal "train wreck" to get our country back on track, that may be a small price to pay. <p>

<b>Comments:</b><P>

<ul>
"Conservatives often get too caught up in the many proble
ith the was affirmative action is currently implemented, and forget the reason it's there at all.
It is not enough to just get rid of race-based preferences, we must create opportunities for minorities and all of society through pro-growth tax policies.
<br>A negative message of "anti-affirmative" action will get the Republican party
nowhere unless it is backed up with a positive message of hope and opportunities
created."<br><b>Charles, Washington DC</b><P>

"Racial tensions are very real and
the rights of minorities do need to be protected.  Perhaps the affirmative action programs of the past three decades have been helpful in at least weakening
 barriers that existed, especially in the better-paying professions.  We now
e a generation of senior managers, many of whom really believe that they have an
 obligation to ensure that women and minorities are given opportunities for advancement.  <br>Though these programs may have been necessary to help overcome the
barriers of tradition and expectation, they have had incidious effects as we have seen  minorities of mediocre talent promoted to levels of high responsibility.  These unmerited promotions are damaging to the esteem of our institutions
and are as debilitating to those of little merit who are promoted as they are those of great merit who are passed over.  We need to move as quickly as possile
to a color- and sex-blind system of merit.
<br><b>Judy, Vienna, VA</b>

<P>
I believe neither the Republicans nor the Democrats
are serious about ensuring fairness in hiring practices (note the Democrat-controlled Congress's long-standing
policy of exempting themselves from all the affirmative
action laws they have passed over the last 25 years as
well as the Republicans missing the opportunities they
have had over the years to demonstrate any understanding
of racial inequity).<br>
I will hold both parties responsible for the lack of pro-
gress this year and with any increase in racial tensions
or inequity in treatment of all people of any race. <br><b>John, South Charleston</b><P>
 
"I coach the Debate Team at Transylvania University, a member
 of the National Educational Debate Association, and our resolution this semester deals with Affirmative Action. From the massive amount of research my team
has done it is very clear
that Affirmative Action is a joke.  It promotes a very small group of minorities,
 while failing to address the real needs of the very people it is suppossed
help.<br>
It is typical of governmental attempts at solving problems.  It simply does not
work."<br><b>James, Lexington, KY</b><P>


"I hope the March accomplishes its stated goal of helping men
return to their families as better individuals and citizens. <br>I hope that all men who heard about the march take this as a wake up call to them. Too many people in this country are waiting for someone else to fix their problems. I wish that politicians from both parties would realize that they are simply tearing this country further apart by their constant pettiness. Instead of trying to shift the blame from one party to another, they should understand that they are a group.
That is why congress was composed. <BR>
Whether they are Republican or Democrat or Independent, they should be responsible. In a crime, there is an idea of accomplice. In politics, there is no such idea, only men trying to appear to be perfect.
Sorryy to be so winded, I am really getting sick of hearing both sides blame each
er. It makes it difficult to believe anybody.<br><b>Mark, Scottsdale, AZ</b><P> 


Affirmative Action has never affirmed anyone's worth in
 society.  The proof is that achievement of any sort by any of the eligible classes holds no validity, even in their own eyes.  The presence of the possibility that decisions are made based on such superficial standards promotes envy, malice and distrust.<Br>
The MMM, and their threat of lawsuit about the count released by the park service only illustrates the difference between races.  A difference that all the social programs in the world cannot hide.  Although blacks and hispanics now openly
exercise their right to speak about segregation (and territorial control),
only a limited license is granted to whites, and those who try to practice segregation have the fate of Randy Weaver to consider.<br><b>Patty, Chantilly, VA</b><p>

Affirmative action programs were good when they started.
<BR>
Martin Luther King woke americans up to prejudice and the
need for real equality in america. The congress then passed
laws and they were almost immediately grafted and corrupted
The Bumper sticker which says " Crime wouldn't pay if the
Government ran it" is true. We need government to set 
guidelines and make laws, but it is people who must learn
to do right and be just.<BR>
 For Black people to support Farakan
is to turn their backs on the principles that Martin Luther
King fought for. We white Americans need to do the right
thing because it is right not because some muslim demands it.
Islam is in direct opposition to what this country stands for.
Liberals scream separation of church and state and then
rush to support a cult that will divide us and tear down the
advancements we have made. I say we should look to the
real Black leaders, such as Dexter Scott King, and seek to
encourage them and stand firm with Martin Luther Kings'
principle of a truely integrated america.<br><b>Michael, West Palm Beach, FL</b><P>

<h2>Phil Gramm Speech to the Senate</h2><p>			
<h3>104th Congress 1st Session</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this week and next week, we are going to come
down to the moment of truth on two issues. One issue has to do with putting
the Federal Government on a budget like everybody else. The other issue has
to do with fulfilling the Contract With America to let working people keep
more of what they earn. I would like to briefly address both of these subjects.<p>
In the 1994 election, in one of the most remarkable political occurrences
in the postwar period, House Republicans did something that is very unusual
in the political process and that is they set out in plain English what they
promised America they would do if the American people gave them a majority
in the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years.<p>
I would add that while many people have forgotten it, Republican
candidates for the Senate put out a joint statement where virtually every
Republican challenger for the U.S. Senate in the country came to Washington
and released a ''Seven More In '94'' document, where we outlined seven
things we would do if the American people gave us a majority.<p>
   Two of those promised items had to do with balancing the budget and with
letting working people keep more of what they earned. The House of
Representatives has done something even more remarkable than making all these
promises-they have actually done it. The House of Representatives has adopted
the Contract With America. They have adopted 90 percent of the things they
promised to simply vote on. And at the best universities in the land, you
would grade that as an ''A.''<p>
   We are now down to the moment of truth in the U.S. Senate and that moment
of truth basically has to do with whether or not we are going to pass the
Contract With America and whether we can make the tough decisions necessary
in order to do that. To balance the Federal budget over a 7-year period and
at the same time to accommodate the tax cut contained in the Contract With
America will require us, over a 7-year period, to limit the growth in
Federal spending to approximately 3 percent a year.<p>
   Over the last 40 years, Federal spending has grown at 2-1/2 times the
growth of family budgets in America. Over the last 40 years, the Federal
Government has increased its spending 2-1/2 times as fast as the average
family in America has been able to increase its spending. Now what would
America look like if those trends had been reversed? Well, if the average
family in America had seen its budget grow as fast as the Government has
grown for the last 40 years, and the Government's budget had grown only as
fast as the family budget has grown over the last 40 years, the average
family in America today would be earning $ 128,000 a year and the Government
would be approximately one-third its current size.<p>
   I ask my colleagues, if you could choose between the America where the
governments budget grew faster or an America where the family's budget grew
faster-put me down as one who would favor having the average family in
America make $ 128,000 a year and have the Federal Government one-third its
size.<p>
   Here is our dilemma. We have some of our colleagues who say, ''I did not
sign any Contract With America. That was the House of Representatives.'' As
I am fond of saying in our private meetings, that is a subtlety that is lost
on the American people. They do not see this contract as having been a
contract between just the House and the American people. They see it as a
Republican contract. And, quite frankly, it is a Republican contract. It
embodies everything that our party claims to stand for.<p>
   But what I think is important for the Senate is not just that Republican
candidates signed the contract, not just that every House Republican
incumbent who signed the contract was reelected but I think what is
significant to us is that the American people signed that contract when they
gave us a majority in both Houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.<p>
   The question that we are going to have to answer in the next 3 weeks is,
are we willing to limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2 percent a
year so that we can, over a 7-year period, balance the Federal budget and so
that we can let working families keep more of what they earn? I believe that
we can and I believe that we should. I think there are many Republicans in
the Senate who sort of have a problem, in that they have one foot firmly
implanted in the dramatic changes in Government policy that we promised the
American people in 1994, and they have the other foot firmly implanted in the
status quo. And, as those two things have moved further apart, we have had
the predictable result.<p>
   I think it is time for us to choose. I believe in the next 3 weeks we are
going to basically decide whether or not we meant it in November of 1994
when we told the American people that we were going to dramatically change
the way Government does its business. I think the American people are
convinced that we can limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2
percent a year so that we can let families and businesses spend more of what
they earn.<p>
   I know if the President were here, he would say this is a debate about
how much money we are spending on our children; or how much money we are
spending on education; or how much money we are spending on housing or
nutrition.<p>
   But that is not what the debate is about. Everybody in America wants to
spend money on children, housing, education, and nutrition. The debate we
are about to have is not how much money is going to be spent on those
things, but who is going to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats
want Government to go on doing the spending. They want Government spending
to continue to grow 2-1/2 times as fast as the family budget grows.<p>
   I want to put the Federal Government on a diet. I want to slow down the
rate of growth in Government spending so that we can let working families
keep more of their own money to invest in their own children, in their own
businesses, and in their own future.<p>
   This is not a debate about how much money we spend on the things that all
Americans believe we should spend money on. It is a debate about who ought
to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats want the Government to do
the spending. We want the family to do the spending. We know the Government,
and we know the family. And we know the difference.<p>
   Since we are investing in the future of America, I want to invest the
future of America in our families and not in our Government.<p>
   I know that there is a lot of anguish in the Senate, even on our side of
the aisle. But I think it is time to choose. I wanted my colleagues to know
that I am for a budget that does two things: No. 1, over a 7-year period,
limit the growth of Federal spending to about 3 percent a year so we can
balance the budget in 7 years and let our colleagues do something that no
current Member of the Senate, save two, has ever done before; that is, vote
for a real honest-to-God balanced budget. We literally have the power, by
having a 7-year binding budget, to let Members of the Senate vote to stop
talking about balancing the budget and to start doing it.<p>
   Second, in addition to the controls on spending necessary to balance the
budget, I want to limit the growth of spending not to 3 percent a year, but
to 2-1/2 percent a year so that we can let families keep more of what they
earn, so that we can cut the capital gains tax rate, so that we can
eliminate the marriage penalty, so that we can let families have a $ 500 tax
credit per child, so that, rather than having our Government spend our money
for us, we can let working people spend their own money on their own
children and on their own future.<p>
   As we look at this in perspective, let me give you three numbers. In
1950, the average family in America with two little children sent $ 1 out of
every $ 50 it earned to Washington, DC, and thought it was too much. And it
probably was. Today, that family is sending $ 1 out of every $ 4 it earns to
Washington, DC, and if the Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
some people would applaud that prospect, but only because they do not
understand our problems. If Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
and we did not start a single new program nor repeal any existing program, to
pay for the Government that we have already committed to is going to require
that in 20 years $ 1 out of every $ 3 earned by the average family in America
with two children come to Washington, DC, to pay for the Government.<p>
   We are going to have to institute dramatic changes in spending simply to
keep things the way they are. If we are to let working families keep more of
what they earn, we are going to have to institute a dramatic change in
Government policy. Mr. President, I am in favor of a dramatic change in
Government policy. If our Budget Committee does not offer and adopt a budget
that balances the budget and that provides for tax cuts for families and for
job creation, I intend to offer a substitute for that budget. I think we
have to stop cutting deals with America's future. I think we have to stand
up and tell the American people we meant it in November 1994 when we said
you give us a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress and we will
change the policy of American Government.<p>
I think we are now down to a moment of truth. Are we going to fulfill the
commitment we made in that election, or are we basically going to defend the
status quo? The status quo means less opportunity, future jobs, and an
America that is not the America that I want my children and my grandchildren
to have. I am ready to change the status quo. I am ready to cut the growth
in Government spending, not just to balance the budget, but to cut taxes.
And what I want my colleagues to know today is I want to work with the
Budget Committee, I want to work with our leadership. I am hopeful that we
can put together as a party position a budget that balances the budget over
a 7-year period and that mandates tax cuts contained in the contract. But,
if our leadership is not ready to bring that budget forward, if they cannot
muster the courage to control Government spending to make it possible, I
will muster that courage, and will offer a substitute and give my colleagues
the opportunity to join me, and to join America in that process.<p>
   Finally, let me say, Mr. President, I simply want to remind my colleagues
that the Contract With America was in fact signed by House Members, but
there are two additional points. First, it was not distinctly different from
the ''Seven More in '94'' contract that our candidates agreed to here on the
north front of the Capitol. Second, the important part of that contract is
not the fact that the House signed it. The important part of that contract
is that America signed it. The important part of that contract is it was the
document that defined what the 1994 election was all about.<p>
   The question now, the question that will be before us for the next 3
weeks is, Did we simply want to be for dramatic changes in Government at
election time, or are we willing to put our votes where our mouth is? Are we
really more wedded to funding for programs such as public television, or are
we more wedded to letting working people keep more of what they earn? Do we
really believe that Government knows best and that we need not only a $ 1.6
trillion Federal budget but that we need it to grow by 7.5 percent a year
while the family budget is growing at less than half that rate?<p>
   I think that is the decision. I think the answer of every Republican in
the Senate ought to be clear. And that answer ought to be we can change the
status quo, we can limit the growth of Government spending, we can terminate
programs, and we can and will not only balance the budget but let working
families keep more of what they earn to invest in their own children, in
their own businesses and their own future, and that we ought to cut taxes on
American business to provide incentives for people to work, save, and
invest. That is what I am for. I believe that is what America is for.<p>
   I thank the Chair.<p>
I yield the floor.<p>

<H2>President Reagan's First Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Tuesday, January 20th, 1981. <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Hatfield, Mr. Chief Justice, Mr. President, Vice President
Bush, Vice President Mondale, Senator Baker, Speaker O'Neill,
Reverend Moomaw, and my fellow citizens: To a few of us here today,
this is a solemn and most momentous occasion; and yet, in the
history of our Nation, it is a commonplace occurrence. The orderly
transfer of authority as called for in the Constitution routinely
takes place as it has for almost two centuries and few of us stop
to think how unique we really are. In the eyes of many in the
world, this every-4-year ceremony we accept as normal is nothing
less than a miracle.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Mr. President, I want our fellow citizens to know how much you
did to carry on this tradition. By your gracious cooperation in
the transition process, you have shown a watching world that we
are a united people pledged to maintaining a political system
which guarantees individual liberty to a greater degree than any
other, and I thank you and your people for all your help in maintaining
the continuity which is the bulwark of our Republic.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The business of our nation goes forward. These United States are
confronted with an economic affliction of great proportions. We
suffer from the longest and one of the worst sustained inflations
in our national history. It distorts our economic decisions, penalizes
thrift, and crushes the struggling young and the fixed-income
elderly alike. It threatens to shatter the lives of millions of
our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Idle industries have cast workers into unemployment, causing human
misery and personal indignity. Those who do work are denied a
fair return for their labor by a tax system which penalizes successful
achievement and keeps us from maintaining full productivity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But great as our tax burden is, it has not kept pace with public
spending. For decades, we have piled deficit upon deficit, mortgaging
our future and our children's future for the temporary convenience
of the present. To continue this long trend is to guarantee tremendous
social, cultural, political, and economic upheavals.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I, as individuals, can, by borrowing, live beyond our
means, but for only a limited period of time. Why, then, should
we think that collectively, as a nation, we are not bound by that
same limitation?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must act today in order to preserve tomorrow. And let there
be no misunderstanding--we are going to begin to act, beginning
today.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The economic ills we suffer have come upon us over several decades.
They will not go away in days, weeks, or months, but they will
go away. They will go away because we, as Americans, have the
capacity now, as we have had in the past, to do whatever needs
to be done to preserve this last and greatest bastion of freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In this present crisis, government is not the solution to our
problem.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From time to time, we have been tempted to believe that society
has become too complex to be managed by self-rule, that government
by an elite group is superior to government for, by, and of the
people. But if no one among us is capable of governing himself,
then who among us has the capacity to govern someone else? All
of us together, in and out of government, must bear the burden.
The solutions we seek must be equitable, with no one group singled
out to pay a higher price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We hear much of special interest groups. Our concern must be for
a special interest group that has been too long neglected. It
knows no sectional boundaries or ethnic and racial divisions,
and it crosses political party lines. It is made up of men and
women who raise our food, patrol our streets, man our mines and
our factories, teach our children, keep our homes, and heal us
when we are sick--professionals, industrialists, shopkeepers,
clerks, cabbies, and truckdrivers. They are, in short, &quot;We
the people,&quot; this breed called Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this administration's objective will be a healthy, vigorous,
growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all Americans,
with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination. Putting America
back to work means putting all Americans back to work. Ending
inflation means freeing all Americans from the terror of runaway
living costs. All must share in the productive work of this &quot;new
beginning&quot; and all must share in the bounty of a revived
economy. With the idealism and fair play which are the core of
our system and our strength, we can have a strong and prosperous
America at peace with itself and the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So, as we begin, let us take inventory. We are a nation that has
a government--not the other way around. And this makes us special
among the nations of the Earth. Our Government has no power except
that granted it by the people. It is time to check and reverse
the growth of government which shows signs of having grown beyond
the consent of the governed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is my intention to curb the size and influence of the Federal
establishment and to demand recognition of the distinction between
the powers granted to the Federal Government and those reserved
to the States or to the people. All of us need to be reminded
that the Federal Government did not create the States; the States
created the Federal Government.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, so there will be no misunderstanding, it is not my intention
to do away with government. It is, rather, to make it work--work
with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.
Government can and must provide opportunity, not smother it; foster
productivity, not stifle it.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If we look to the answer as to why, for so many years, we achieved
so much, prospered as no other people on Earth, it was because
here, in this land, we unleashed the energy and individual genius
of man to a greater extent than has ever been done before. Freedom
and the dignity of the individual have been more available and
assured here than in any other place on Earth. The price for this
freedom at times has been high, but we have never been unwilling
to pay that price.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is no coincidence that our present troubles parallel and are
proportionate to the intervention and intrusion in our lives that
result from unnecessary and excessive growth of government. It
is time for us to realize that we are too great a nation to limit
ourselves to small dreams. We are not, as some would have us believe,
doomed to an inevitable decline. I do not believe in a fate that
will fall on us no matter what we do. I do believe in a fate that
will fall on us if we do nothing. So, with all the creative energy
at our command, let us begin an era of national renewal. Let us
renew our determination, our courage, and our strength. And let
us renew our faith and our hope.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have every right to dream heroic dreams. Those who say that
we are in a time when there are no heroes just don't know where
to look. You can see heroes every day going in and out of factory
gates. Others, a handful in number, produce enough food to feed
all of us and then the world beyond. You meet heroes across a
counter--and they are on both sides of that counter. There are
entrepreneurs with faith in themselves and faith in an idea who
create new jobs, new wealth and opportunity. They are individuals
and families whose taxes support the Government and whose voluntary
gifts support church, charity, culture, art, and education. Their
patriotism is quiet but deep. Their values sustain our national
life.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have used the words &quot;they&quot; and &quot;their&quot; in
speaking of these heroes. I could say &quot;you&quot; and &quot;your&quot;
because I am addressing the heroes of whom I speak--you, the citizens
of this blessed land. Your dreams, your hopes, your goals are
going to be the dreams, the hopes, and the goals of this administration,
so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We shall reflect the compassion that is so much a part of your
makeup. How can we love our country and not love our countrymen,
and loving them, reach out a hand when they fall, heal them when
they are sick, and provide opportunities to make them self-sufficient
so they will be equal in fact and not just in theory?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Can we solve the problems confronting us? Well, the answer is
an unequivocal and emphatic &quot;yes.&quot; To paraphrase Winston
Churchill, I did not take the oath I have just taken with the
intention of presiding over the dissolution of the world's strongest
economy.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the days ahead I will propose removing the roadblocks that
have slowed our economy and reduced productivity. Steps will be
taken aimed at restoring the balance between the various levels
of government. Progress may be slow--measured in inches and feet,
not miles--but we will progress. Is it time to reawaken this industrial
giant, to get government back within its means, and to lighten
our punitive tax burden. And these will be our first priorities,
and on these principles, there will be no compromise.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
On the eve of our struggle for independence a man who might have
been one of the greatest among the Founding Fathers, Dr. Joseph
Warren, President of the Massachusetts Congress, said to his fellow
Americans, &quot;Our country is in danger, but not to be despaired
of.... On you depend the fortunes of America. You are to decide
the important questions upon which rests the happiness and the
liberty of millions yet unborn. Act worthy of yourselves.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, I believe we, the Americans of today, are ready to act worthy
of ourselves, ready to do what must be done to ensure happiness
and liberty for ourselves, our children and our children's children.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And as we renew ourselves here in our own land, we will be seen
as having greater strength throughout the world. We will again
be the exemplar of freedom and a beacon of hope for those who
do not now have freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
To those neighbors and allies who share our freedom, we will strengthen
our historic ties and assure them of our support and firm commitment.
We will match loyalty with loyalty. We will strive for mutually
beneficial relations. We will not use our friendship to impose
on their sovereignty, for our own sovereignty is not for sale.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As for the enemies of freedom, those who are potential adversaries,
they will be reminded that peace is the highest aspiration of
the American people. We will negotiate for it, sacrifice for it;
we will not surrender for it--now or ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our forbearance should never be misunderstood. Our reluctance
for conflict should not be misjudged as a failure of will. When
action is required to preserve our national security, we will
act. We will maintain sufficient strength to prevail if need be,
knowing that if we do so we have the best chance of never having
to use that strength.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the
arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral
courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries
in today's world do not have. It is a weapon that we as Americans
do have. Let that be understood by those who practice terrorism
and prey upon their neighbors.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am told that tens of thousands of prayer meetings are being
held on this day, and for that I am deeply grateful. We are a
nation under God, and I believe God intended for us to be free.
It would be fitting and good, I think, if on each Inauguration
Day in future years it should be declared a day of prayer.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is the first time in history that this ceremony has been
held, as you have been told, on this West Front of the Capitol.
Standing here, one faces a magnificent vista, opening up on this
city's special beauty and history. At the end of this open mall
are those shrines to the giants on whose shoulders we stand.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Directly in front of me, the monument to a monumental man: George
Washington, Father of our country. A man of humility who came
to greatness reluctantly. He led America out of revolutionary
victory into infant nationhood. Off to one side, the stately memorial
to Thomas Jefferson. The Declaration of Independence flames with
his eloquence.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And then beyond the Reflecting Pool the dignified columns of the
Lincoln Memorial. Whoever would understand in his heart the meaning
of America will find it in the life of Abraham Lincoln.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Beyond those monuments to heroism is the Potomac River, and on
the far shore the sloping hills of Arlington National Cemetery
with its row on row of simple white markers bearing crosses or
Stars of David. They add up to only a tiny fraction of the price
that has been paid for our freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Each one of those markers is a monument to the kinds of hero I
spoke of earlier. Their lives ended in places called Belleau Wood,
The Argonne, Omaha Beach, Salerno and halfway around the world
on Guadalcanal, Tarawa, Pork Chop Hill, the Chosin Reservoir,
and in a hundred rice paddies and jungles of a place called Vietnam.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Under one such marker lies a young man--Martin Treptow--who left
his job in a small town barber shop in 1917 to go to France with
the famed Rainbow Division. There, on the western front, he was
killed trying to carry a message between battalions under heavy
artillery fire.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are told that on his body was found a diary. On the flyleaf
under the heading, &quot;My Pledge,&quot; he had written these
words: &quot;America must win this war. Therefore, I will work,
I will save, I will sacrifice, I will endure, I will fight cheerfully
and do my utmost, as if the issue of the whole struggle depended
on me alone.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crisis we are facing today does not require of us the kind
of sacrifice that Martin Treptow and so many thousands of others
were called upon to make. It does require, however, our best effort,
and our willingness to believe in ourselves and to believe in
our capacity to perform great deeds; to believe that together,
with God's help, we can and will resolve the problems which now
confront us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And, after all, why shouldn't we believe that? We are Americans.
God bless you, and thank you.

<H2>President Reagan's Second Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Monday, January 21st, 1985 <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker
O'Neill, Senator Dole, Reverend Clergy, members of my family and
friends, and my fellow citizens:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one
who, for a time, has been absent--Senator John Stennis.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and welcome back.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is, however, one who is not with us today: Representative
Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night. I wonder if we could
all join in a moment of silent prayer. (Moment of silent prayer.)
Amen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great
honor that you have bestowed on me. I will do my utmost to be
deserving of your trust.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we the
people have celebrated this historic occasion. When the first
President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible,
he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw,
untamed wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union
of 13 States. Today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States.
We have lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid
of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed
to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed. And yet
we stand together as we did two centuries ago.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I took this oath four years ago, I did so in a time of economic
stress. Voices were raised saying we had to look to our past for
the greatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are
not given to looking backward. In this blessed land, there is
always a better tomorrow.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Four years ago, I spoke to you of a new beginning and we have
accomplished that. But in another sense, our new beginning is
a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when,
for the first time in history, government, the people said, was
not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we
the people allow it to have.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
That system has never failed us, but, for a time, we failed the
system. We asked things of government that government was not
equipped to give. We yielded authority to the National Government
that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to
the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us
of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine
that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down
and the number of unemployed increase.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By 1980, we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with
all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent
with an orderly society.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human
progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And we were right to believe that. Tax rates have been reduced,
inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than
ever before in our history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive.
But there are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until
every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity
as our birthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great
Republic, and we'll meet this challenge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These will be years when Americans have restored their confidence
and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work,
and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy
was finally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere
efforts at meaningful arms reduction, rebuilding our defenses,
our economy, and developing new technologies, and helped preserve
peace in a troubled world; when Americans courageously supported
the struggle for liberty, self-government, and free enterprise
throughout the world, and turned the tide of history away from
totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My fellow citizens, our Nation is poised for greatness. We must
do what we know is right and do it with all our might. Let history
say of us, &quot;These were golden years--when the American Revolution
was reborn, when freedom gained new life, when America reached
for her best.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our two-party system has served us well over the years, but never
better than in those times of great challenge when we came together
not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a
common cause.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a
Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group
who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start
the world over again, left us an important lesson. They had become
political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then years
later, when both were retired, and age had softened their anger,
they began to speak to each other again through letters. A bond
was reestablished between those two who had helped create this
government of ours.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence,
they both died. They died on the same day, within a few hours
of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives,
Jefferson wrote: &quot;It carries me back to the times when, beset
with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the
same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right
to self-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some
wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless
... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, with heart and hand, let us stand as one today: One people
under God determined that our future shall be worthy of our past.
As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our
past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women,
by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling
demands of a bloated Federal Establishment. You elected us in
1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don't believe
you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight
months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the
drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress.
We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment;
reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its
interference in people's lives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair, and bring
the rates down for all who work and earn. We must think anew and
move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can
find work; so the least among us shall have an equal chance to
achieve the greatest things--to be heroes who heal our sick, feed
the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world
a better place.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The time has come for a new American emancipation--a great national
drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of
enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends,
together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more
productive, fulfilled and united people, and a stronger America--an
America that will lead the technological revolution, and also
open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature,
music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes,
will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But
an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought
us to a time of reckoning. We have come to a turning point, a
moment for hard decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff
a question, and now I put the same question to all of you: If
not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us
going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget.
We can then begin reducing the national debt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing
government program spending for the next year. Beyond that, we
must take further steps to permanently control Government's power
to tax and spend. We must act now to protect future generations
from Government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax
them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional
for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government
takes in.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have already started returning to the people and to State and
local governments responsibilities better handled by them. Now,
there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social
compassion. But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency
and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged.
And here a growing economy and support from family and community
offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way
of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and,
yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and
made self-sufficient.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And there is another area where the Federal Government can play
a part. As an older American, I remember a time when people of
different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred
and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. There
is no story more heartening in our history than the progress that
we have made toward the &quot;brotherhood of man&quot; that God
intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no turning back
or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant
with opportunity for all our citizens.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let us resolve that we the people will build an American opportunity
society in which all of us--white and black, rich and poor, young
and old--will go forward together arm in arm. Again, let us remember
that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner
of the Earth, we are all Americans pledged to carry on this last,
best hope of man on Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which
we should put on our National Government. Now let me turn to a
task which is the primary responsibility of National Government--the
safety and security of our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer
for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace will not
come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There
are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and
freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest
military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome
offensive weapons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have made progress in restoring our defense capability. But
much remains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor
any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities
to remain free, secure, and at peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost
of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And
this we are trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union.
We are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear
weapons. We seek, instead, to reduce their number. We seek the
total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of
the Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat
of mutual assured destruction; if either resorted to the use of
nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one
who had started it. Is there either logic or morality in believing
that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people,
our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security
shield that would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their
target. It wouldn't kill people, it would destroy weapons. It
wouldn't militarize space, it would help demilitarize the arsenals
of Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet
with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the
world of the threat of nuclear destruction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all
around us. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies
in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march,
and nowhere more so than our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of
the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. People,
worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those
inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is
our best ally.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And it is the world's only hope, to conquer poverty and preserve
peace. Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against
its dark allies of oppression and war. Every victory for human
freedom will be a victory for world peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and
powerful in its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with
our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion,
we look forward to a world rich in possibilities. And all this
because we have worked and acted together, not as members of political
parties, but as Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, we live in a world that is lit by lightning. So much
is changing and will change, but so much endures, and transcends
time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
History is a ribbon, always unfurling; history is a journey. And
as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before
us. We stand together again at the steps of this symbol of our
democracy--or we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't
gotten so cold. Now we are standing inside this symbol of our
democracy. Now we hear again the echoes of our past: a general
falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely
President paces the darkened halls, and ponders his struggle to
preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement
to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the
song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic,
daring, decent, and fair. That's our heritage; that is our song.
We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are
together as of old, as we raise our voices to the God who is the
Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to hold
us close as we fill the world with our sound--sound in unity,
affection, and love--one people under God, dedicated to the dream
of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon
now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and may God bless America.

<TITLE>The Reagan Home Page:President Reagan's Speech at Omaha Beach
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/townhall/background.jpg">

<H2>Address at the U.S.-French Ceremony at Omaha Beach on the
40th Anniversary of D-Day.</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, June 6, 1984. Normandy, France. <HR>

<P>
We stand today at a place of battle, one that 40 years ago saw
and felt the worst of war. Men bled and died here for a few feet
of - or inches of sand, as bullets and shellfire cut through their
ranks. About them, General Omar Bradley later said, &quot;Every
man who set foot on Omaha Beach that day was a hero.&quot;
<P>
Some who survived the battle of June 6, 1944, are here today.
Others who hoped to return never did.
<P>
&quot;Someday, Lis, I'll go back,&quot; said Private First Class
Peter Robert Zannata, of the 37th Engineer Combat Battalion, and
first assault wave to hit Omaha Beach. &quot;I'll go back, and
I'll see it all again. I'll see the beach, the barricades, and
the graves.&quot;
<P>
Those words of Private Zanatta come to us from his daughter, Lisa
Zanatta Henn, in a heart-rending story about the event her father
spoke of so often. &quot;In his words, the Normandy invasion would
change his life forever,&quot; she said. She tells some of his
stories of World War II but says of her father, &quot;the story
to end all stories was D-Day.&quot;
<P>
&quot;He made me feel the fear of being on the boat waiting to
land. I can smell the ocean and feel the sea sickness. I can see
the looks on his fellow soldiers' faces-the fear, the anguish,
the uncertainty of what lay ahead. And when they landed, I can
feel the strength and courage of the men who took those first
steps through the tide to what must have surely looked like instant
death.&quot;
<P>
Private Zannata's daughter wrote to me, &quot;I don't know how
or why I can feel this emptiness, this fear, or this determination,
but I do. Maybe it's the bond I had with my father. All I know
is that it brings tears to my eyes to think about my father as
a 20-year old boy having to face that beach.&quot;
<P>
The anniversary of D-Day was always special to her family. And
like all the families of those who went to war, she describes
how she came to realize her own father's survival was a miracle:
&quot;So many men died. I know that my father watched many of
his friends be killed. I know that he must have died inside a
little each time. But his explanation to me was, `You did what
you had to do, and you kept on going.&quot;
<P>
When men like Private Zannata and all our Allied forces stormed
the beaches of Normandy 40 years ago they came not as conquerors,
but as liberators. When these troops swept across the French countryside
and into the forests of Belgium and Luxembourg they came not to
take, but to return what had been wrongfully seized. When our
forces marched into Germany they came not to prey on a brave and
defeated people, but to nurture the seeds of democracy among those
who yearned to bee free again.
<P>
We salute them today. But, Mr. President [Francois Mitterand of
France], we also salute those who, like yourself, were already
engaging the enemy inside your beloved country-the French Resistance.
Your valiant struggle for France did so much to cripple the enemy
and spur the advance of the armies of liberation. The French Forces
of the Interior will forever personify courage and national spirit.
They will be a timeless inspiration to all who are free and to
all who would be free.
<P>
Today, in their memory, and for all who fought here, we celebrate
the triumph of democracy. We reaffirm the unity of democratic
people who fought a war and then joined with the vanquished in
a firm resolve to keep the peace.
<P>
From a terrible war we learned that unity made us invincible;
now, in peace, that same unity makes us secure. We sought to bring
all freedom-loving nations together in a community dedicated to
the defense and preservation of our sacred values. Our alliance,
forged in the crucible of war, tempered and shaped by the realities
of the post-war world, has succeeded. In Europe, the threat has
been contained, the peace has been kept.
<P>
Today, the living here assembled-officials, veterans, citizens-are
a tribute to what was achieved here 40 years ago. This land is
secure. We are free. These things are worth fighting and dying
for.
<P>
Lisa Zannata Henn began her story by quoting her father, who promised
that he would return to Normandy. She ended with a promise to
her father, who died 8 years ago of cancer: &quot;I'm going there,
Dad, and I'll see the beaches and the barricades and the monuments.
I'll see the graves, and I'll put flowers there just like you
wanted to do. I'll never forget what you went through, Dad, nor
will I let any one else forget. And, Dad, I'll always be proud.&quot;
<P>
Through the words of his loving daughter, who is here with us
today, a D-Day veteran has shown us the meaning of this day far
better than any President can. It is enough to say about Private
Zannata and all the men of honor and courage who fought beside
him four decades ago: We will always remember. We will always
be proud. We will always be prepared, so we may always be free.
<P>
Thank you.

<H2>The Evil Empire</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Reagan's Speech to the House of Commons, June 8, 1982.
<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're approaching the end of a bloody century plagued by a terrible
political invention -- totalitarianism. Optimism comes less easily
today, not because democracy is less vigorous, but because democracy's
enemies have refined their instruments of repression. Yet optimism
is in order because day by day democracy is proving itself to
be a not at all fragile flower. From Stettin on the Baltic to
Varna on the Black Sea, the regimes planted by totalitarianism
have had more than thirty years to establish their legitimacy.
But none -- not one regime -- has yet been able to risk free elections.
Regimes planted by bayonets do not take root.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The strength of the Solidarity movement in Poland demonstrates
the truth told in an underground joke in the Soviet Union. It
is that the Soviet Union would remain a one-party nation even
if an opposition party were permitted because everyone would join
the opposition party....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Historians looking back at our time will note the consistent restraint
and peaceful intentions of the West. They will note that it was
the democracies who refused to use the threat of their nuclear
monopoly in the forties and early fifties for territorial or imperial
gain. Had that nuclear monopoly been in the hands of the Communist
world, the map of Europe--indeed, the world--would look very different
today. And certainly they will note it was not the democracies
that invaded Afghanistan or suppressed Polish Solidarity or used
chemical and toxin warfare in Afghanistan and Southeast Asia.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If history teaches anything, it teaches self-delusion in the face
of unpleasant facts is folly. We see around us today the marks
of our terrible dilemma--predictions of doomsday, antinuclear
demonstrations, an arms race in which the West must, for its own
protection, be an unwilling participant. At the same time we see
totalitarian forces in the world who seek subversion and conflict
around the globe to further their barbarous assault on the human
spirit. What, then, is our course? Must civilization perish in
a hail of fiery atoms? Must freedom wither in a quiet, deadening
accommodation with totalitarian evil?

Sir Winston Churchill refused to accept the inevitability of war
or even that it was imminent. He said, &quot;I do not believe
that Soviet Russia desires war. What they desire is the fruits
of war and the indefinite expansion of their power and doctrines.
But what we have to consider here today while time remains is
the permanent prevention of war and the establishment of conditions
of freedom and democracy as rapidly as possible in all countries.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, this is precisely our mission today: to preserve freedom
as well as peace. It may not be easy to see; but I believe we
live now at a turning point.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In an ironic sense Karl Marx was right. We are witnessing today
a great revolutionary crisis, a crisis where the demands of the
economic order are conflicting directly with those of the political
order. But the crisis is happening not in the free, non-Marxist
West but in the home of Marxism- Leninism, the Soviet Union. It
is the Soviet Union that runs against the tide of history by denying
human freedom and human dignity to its citizens. It also is in
deep economic difficulty. The rate of growth in the national product
has been steadily declining since the fifties and is less than
half of what it was then.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The dimensions of this failure are astounding: a country which
employs one-fifth of its population in agriculture is unable to
feed its own people. Were it not for the private sector, the tiny
private sector tolerated in Soviet agriculture, the country might
be on the brink of famine. These private plots occupy a bare 3
percent of the arable land but account for nearly one-quarter
of Soviet farm output and nearly one-third of meat products and
vegetables. Overcentralized, with little or no incentives, year
after year the Soviet system pours its best resources into the
making of instruments of destruction. The constant shrinkage of
economic growth combined with the growth of military production
is putting a heavy strain on the Soviet people. What we see here
is a political structure that no longer corresponds to its economic
base, a society where productive forced are hampered by political
ones.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The decay of the Soviet experiment should come as no surprise
to us. Wherever the comparisons have been made between free and
closed societies -- West Germany and East Germany, Austria and
Czechoslovakia, Malaysia and Vietnam -- it is the democratic countries
that are prosperous and responsive to the needs of their people.
And one of the simple but overwhelming facts of our time is this:
of all the millions of refugees we've seen in the modern world,
their flight is always away from, not toward the Communist world.
Today on the NATO line, our military forces face east to prevent
a possible invasion. On the other side of the line, the Soviet
forces also face east to prevent their people from leaving.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The hard evidence of totalitarian rule has caused in mankind an
uprising of the intellect and will. Whether it is the growth of
the new schools of economics in America or England or the appearance
of the so-called new philosophers in France, there is one unifying
thread running through the intellectual work of these groups --
rejection of the arbitrary power of the state, the refusal to
subordinate the rights of the individual to the superstate, the
realization that collectivism stifles all the best human impulses....

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Chairman Brezhnev repeatedly has stressed that the competition
of ideas and systems must continue and that this is entirely consistent
with relaxation of tensions and peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, we ask only that these systems begin by living up to their
own constitutions, abiding by their own laws, and complying with
the international obligations they have undertaken. We ask only
for a process, a direction, a basic code of decency, not for an
instant transformation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We cannot ignore the fact that even without our encouragement
there has been and will continue to be repeated explosion against
repression and dictatorships. The Soviet Union itself is not immune
to this reality. Any system is inherently unstable that has no
peaceful means to legitimize its leaders. In such cases, the very
repressiveness of the state ultimately drives people to resist
it, if necessary, by force.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
While we must be cautious about forcing the pace of change, we
must not hesitate to declare our ultimate objectives and to take
concrete actions to move toward them. We must be staunch in our
conviction that freedom is not the sole prerogative of a lucky
few but the inalienable and universal right of all human beings.
So states the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights,
which, among other things, guarantees free elections.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The objective I propose is quite simple to state: to foster the
infrastructure of democracy, the system of a free press, unions,
political parties, universities, which allows a people to choose
their own way to develop their own culture, to reconcile their
own differences through peaceful means.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is not cultural imperialism; it is providing the means for
genuine self-determination and protection for diversity. Democracy
already flourishes in countries with very different cultures and
historical experiences. It would be cultural condescension, or
worse, to say that any people prefer dictatorship to democracy.
Who would voluntarily choose not to have the right to vote, decide
to purchase government propaganda handouts instead of independent
newspapers, prefer government to worker-controlled unions, opt
for land to be owned by the state instead of those who till it,
want government repression of religious liberty, a single political
party instead of a free choice, a rigid cultural orthodoxy instead
of democratic tolerance and diversity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Since 1917 the Soviet Union has given covert political training
and assistance to Marxist-Leninists in many countries. Of course,
it also has promoted the use of violence and subversion by these
same forces. Over the past several decades, West European and
other social democrats, Christian democrats, and leaders have
offered open assistance to fraternal, political, and social institutions
to bring about peaceful and democratic progress. Appropriately,
for a vigorous new democracy, the Federal Republic of Germany's
political foundations have become a major force in this effort.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We in America now intend to take additional steps, as many of
our allies have already done, toward realizing this same goal.
The chairmen and other leaders of the national Republican and
Democratic party organizations are initiating a study with the
bipartisan American Political Foundation to determine how the
United States can best contribute as a nation to the global campaign
for democracy now gathering force. They will have the cooperation
of congressional leaders of both parties, along with representatives
of business, labor, and other major institutions in our society.
I look forward to receiving their recommendations and to working
with these institutions and the Congress in the common task of
strengthening democracy throughout the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is time that we committed ourselves as a nation -- in both
the public and private sectors -- to assisting democratic development....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What I am describing now is a plan and a hope for the long term
-- the march of freedom and democracy which will leave Marxism-Leninism
on the ash heap of history as it has left other tyrannies which
stifle the freedom and muzzle the self-expression of the people.
And that's why we must continue our efforts to strengthen NATO
even as we move forward with our zero-option initiative in the
negotiations on intermediate-range forces and our proposal for
a one-third reduction in strategic ballistic missile warheads.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our military strength is a prerequisite to peace, but let it be
clear we maintain this strength in the hope it will never be used,
for the ultimate determinant in the struggle that's now going
on in the world will not be bombs and rockets but a test of wills
and ideas, a trial of spiritual resolve, the values we hold, the
beliefs we cherish, the ideals to which we are dedicated.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The British people know that, given strong leadership, time, and
a little bit of hope, the forces of good ultimately rally and
triumph over evil. Here among you is the cradle of self-government,
the Mother of Parliaments. Here is the enduring greatness of the
British contribution to mankind, the great civilized ideas: individual
liberty, representative government, and the rule of law under
God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I've often wondered about the shyness of some of us in the West
about standing for these ideals that have done so much to ease
the plight of man and the hardships of our imperfect world. This
reluctance to use those vast resources at our command reminds
me of the elderly lady whose home was bombed in the blitz. As
the rescuers moved about, they found a bottle of brandy she'd
stored behind the staircase, which was all that was left standing.
And since she was barely conscious, one of the workers pulled
the cork to give her a taste of it. She came around immediately
and said, &quot;Here now -- there now, put it back. That's for
emergencies.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, the emergency is upon us. Let us be shy no longer. Let us
go to our strength. Let us offer hope. Let us tell the world that
a new age is not only possible but probable.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
During the dark days of the Second World War, when this island
was incandescent with courage, Winston Churchill exclaimed about
Britain's adversaries, &quot;What kind of people do they think
we are?&quot; Well, Britain's adversaries found out what extraordinary
people the British are. But all the democracies paid a terrible
price for allowing the dictators to underestimate us. We dare
not make that mistake again. So, let us ask ourselves, &quot;What
kind of people do we think we are?&quot; And let us answer, &quot;Free
people, worthy of freedom and determined not only to remain so
but to help others gain their freedom as well.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sir Winston led his people to great victory in war and then lost
an election just as the fruits of victory were about to be enjoyed.
But he left office honorably and, as it turned out, temporarily,
knowing that the liberty of his people was more important than
the fate of any single leader. History recalls his greatness in
ways no dictator will ever know. And he left us a message of hope
for the future, as timely now as when he first uttered it, as
opposition leader in the Commons nearly twenty-seven years ago,
when he said, &quot;When we look back on all the perils through
which we have passed and at the mighty foes that we have laid
low and all the dark and deadly designs that we have frustrated,
why should we fear for our future? We have,&quot; he said, &quot;come
safely through the worst.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, the task I've set forth will long outlive our own generation.
But together, we too have come through the worst. Let us now begin
a major effort to secure the best -- a crusade for freedom that
will engage the faith and fortitude of the next generation. For
the sake of peace and justice, let us move toward a world in which
all people are at last free to determine their own destiny.

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/townhall/background.jpg">
<H2>Statement on the Occasion of the Tenth Anniversary of the
Announcement of the Strategic Defense Initiative</H2>
<HR>

<P>
President Ronald Reagan, March 23rd, 1993. Washington, D.C. <HR>

<P>
Good morning. It's a pleasure to be able to speak to you today
on this tenth anniversary of my announcement of the Strategic
Defense Initiative. Above all I want to thank all of you for the
hard work and perseverance you have shown through the years in
supporting and shaping this very important program. It is as true
today as it was ten years ago that this effort holds the promise
of changing the course of human history, by freeing the world
from the ominous threat of ballistic missile attack. Given the
choice, shouldn't we seek to save lives rather than avenge them?
I think we should. And indeed, now we can.
<P>
Ten years ago when I asked the scientific community to give us
the means of defending against the threat of ballistic missiles,
I said there would be risks, and that results would take time.
Well, I'm proud to say that these scientists and engineers boldly
embraced this challenge, and in only a few short years broke new
technological ground in developing innovative systems capable
of providing effective and affordable defenses against missile
attacks anywhere in the world. It is a tremendous achievement,
worthy of the great scientific accomplishments of this century.
<P>
As you know, however, critics of SDI from the very beginning have
been all too eager to denounce the program (and if it weren't
for George Lucas, maybe we would have been off to a better start).
But over the years, these critics have been disproved time and
time again. Today we know that we can defend ourselves, that the
threats have not disappeared -- many new threats, in fact, are
rapidly emerging -- and that Russia and our European allies have
expressed their desire to cooperate with us in developing a global
system of missile defenses.
<P>
This should be good news. Unfortunately, there is a stubborn contingent
of policy-makers who insist on abiding by the obsolete ABM Treaty
and support only extremely limited missile defenses, or even none
at all. Yet I believe their efforts will not stop the progress
we have made and the progress we have yet to make. The wisdom
of the program we launched a decade ago will prevail, and America
will not remain forever defenseless against ballistic missile
attack.
<P>
Now more than ever it is vital that the United States not back
down from its efforts to develop and deploy strategic defenses.
It is technologically feasible, strategically necessary and morally
imperative. For if our nation and our precious freedoms are worth
defending with the threat of annihilation, we are surely worth
defending by defensive means that ensure our survival.
<P>
Thank you again. God bless you, and may God bless America.

<H2>Reagan's Speech at the 1994 Gala</H2>

<H3>On the Occasion of His 83rd Birthday</H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I can't tell you how thrilled Nancy and I are to be here with
you tonight to celebrate the &quot;forty-fourth anniversary of
my thirty-ninth birthday.&quot; Haley told me he was going to
gather a few friends for dinner tonight, but I had no idea!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Before I get started here, I want to thank my dear friend, Margaret
Thatcher, for being part of yet another important milestone in
my life and for those very kind words.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As most of you know, Margaret and I go back quite a ways. We met
at a time before she became Prime Minister and I became President.
From the moment we met, we discovered that we shared quite similar
views of government and freedom. Margaret ended our first meeting
by telling me, &quot;we must stand together,&quot; and that's
exactly wat we've done in the years since--as friends and as political
allies. Margaret Thatcher is one of the giants of our century.
Her many achievements will be appreciated more and more as time
goes on and history is written. For me, she has been a staunch
ally, my political soulmate, a great visionary and a dear, dear
friend. Thank you, Margaret, for being with us here tonight. I
would also like to convey my personal appreciation to Haley Barbour.
Haley, you and the entire Republican National Committee are doing
and excellent job keeping the heat on the Democrats at both ends
of Pennsylvania Avenue. Haley, back when I hired you to work on
my White House staff, I suspected you might amount to something
someday!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I must say that returning to Washington today really brought back
memories. As our plane headed toward the airport, I looked down
on the White House, and it was just like the good old days...the
South Lawn, the Rose Garden...David Gergen. I looked over a couple
of blocks, and there was the Internal Revenue Service--bigger
than I ever remembered it. When I looked down at the enormous
United States Post Office building I could just see the excitement
on the faces of the bureaucrats--knowing they would soon be managing
our national health care system! Up on Capital Hill, I saw that
big, white dome, bulging with new tax revenues. I instinctively
reached for my veto pen and thought to myself, &quot;Go ahead,
make my day.&quot; You may have seen President Clinton draw his
own veto pen on television just last week. The difference is that
his pen doesn't have any ink in it! Unless, of course, you're
talking about red ink. And we all know the Democrats have plenty
of that!
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All of you have made our day, just by being here. It's a pleasure
to see so many familiar faces and those who work so hard for the
Grand Old Party. Birthdays often serve as the rare moments when
we can pause from the bustle of our daily lives to reflect on
the years that have passed, the accomplishments and people that
have made them special. As I look around this gathering, I am
filled with countless warm and fond memories. Many of you go back
with us as far as my two terms as California Governor. Others
of you are more recent additions to the family.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Regardless of when you came, you have been a big part of our lives.
For that, we are so grateful and feel so blessed.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, as most of you know, I'm not one for looking back, I figure
there will be plenty of time for that when I get old. But rather
what I take from the past, is inspiration for the future. And
what we accomplished during our years in the White House must
never be lost amid the rhetoric of political revisionists.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When we came to Washington on that bright sunny day in January
of 1981, we shared a dream for America. Back then, the reach of
government had become intolerable. It was a time of rampant inflation
and crushing interest rates--when hope was scarce. It was a time
when coldy, ugly walls divided nations and human rights were trampled
in the name of evil and corrupt ideologies. It was a time when
the nuclear arms race was spiraling out of control and a blinding
mistrust stood between East and West. We believed that for the
future of America and the free world, this could not stand. And
together, we insisted that this great nation must once again behave
as such.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In our America, most people still believed in the power of a better
tomorrow. So together we got the government off the backs of the
American people. We created millions of new jobs for Americans
at all income levels. We cut taxes and freed the people from the
shackles of too much government. And, the economy burst loose
in the longest peacetime expansion ever. We brought America back--bigger
and better than ever.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It was a time when America was a bright beacon of hope and freedom
to oppressed people everywhere. The world looked to us--not just
because of our military might--but because of our ideas of liberty
and freedom. And, they knew we were willing to defend and promote
those ideas in every corner of the earth. We rebuilt a demoralized,
underfunded and unappreciated military. And we made it the most
modern and respected force in the world. And who can forget those
so-called &quot;experts&quot; who said our military build-up threatened
a dangerous escalation of tensions? What kind of fool, they asked,
would call the Soviet Union an &quot;evil empire&quot;. But as
events have shown, there was nothing foolish in my prediction
that communism wa destined for the ash-heap of history. After
decades of struggle, and with the help of the bold leadership
of Margaret Thatcher, democracy won the Cold War and the Berlin
Wall came tumbling down.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The world watched with amazement as we put our house in order
and took our rightful place as the most dynamic country in the
world. And I firmly believe that history will record our era as
on of peace and global prosperity.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
However, our task is far from over. Our friends in the other party
will never forgive us for our success and are doing everything
i their power to rewrite history. Listening to the liberals, you'd
think that the 1980s were the worst period since the Great Depression--filled
with greed and despair. Well you and I know better than that.
Although the political landscape has changed, the bold ideas of
the 1980s are alive and well. Republican candidates swept every
major election across the country last year. From New York to
Texas--from New Jersey to my home state of California. And as
a result, it seems that our opponents have finally realized how
unpopular liberalism really is. So now, they're trying to dress
their liberal agenda in a conservative overcoat. After watching
the State of the Union address the other night, I'm reminded of
the old adage that imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.
Only in this case, it's not flattery, but grand larceny--the intellectual
theft of ideas that you and I recognize as our own. Speech delivery
counts for little on the world stage unless you have convictions
and, yes, the vision to see beyond the front row seats. The Democrats
may remember their lines, but how quickly they forget the lessons
of the past. I have witnessed five major wars in my lifetime,
and I know how swiftly storm clouds can gather on a peaceful horizon.
The next time a Saddam Hussein takes over a Kuwait, or North Korea
brandishes a nuclear weapon, will we be ready to respond?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In the end, it all comes down to leadership. That is what this
country is looking for now. It was leadership here at home that
gave us strong American influence abroad and the collapse of imperial
communism. Great nations have responsibilities to lead and we
should always be cautious of those who would lower our profile
because they might just wind up lowering our flag.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, on a serious note, I would like to end by telling
you something Nancy and I have wanted to say to you for a long
time. During our years together here, as you know, things were
always on the move. As soon as we accomplished one objective,
we were quickly on to the next. There was rarely time to celebrate
victory or recall all the people who made it possible.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, one of the benefits of retirement is you get a chance to
reflect back over the years. Since Nancy and I have returned to
California, we've spent many oaccasions looking back at what we
did here and remembering the extraordinary people who worked so
hard to make those great days possible. Ad we've wondered if we
would ever get the chance to thank them. You are those people--those
great individuals who gave so much of yourselves--who sacrificed
and supported us and helped us achieve everything we did. So,
I will conclude tonight by saying that the greatest gift I could
receive on my birthday is to be able to stand before each and
every one of you and convey in the only words I can how grateful
Nancy and I are: thank you for being there--and for being here.
And thank you for making this evening a memory I will cherish
forever. Until we meet again, God bless you, my friends.

<H2>President Reagan's Speech at Pointe de Hoc</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ronald Reagan -- Pointe de Hoc, Normandy, June 6, 1984 (The 40th
anniversary of D-Day) <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We're here to mark that day in history when the Allied peoples
joined in battle to reclaim this continent to liberty. For four
long years, much of Europe had been under a terrible shadow. Free
nations had fallen, Jews cried out in the camps, millions cried
out for liberation. Europe was enslaved, and the world prayed
for its rescue. Here in Normandy the rescue began. Here the Allies
stood and fought against tyranny in a giant undertaking unparalleled
in human history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We stand on a lonely, windswept point on the northern shore of
France. The air is soft, but forty years ago at this moment, the
air was dense with smoke and the cries of men, and the air was
filled with the crack of rifle fire and the roar of cannon. At
dawn, on the morning of the 6th of June 1944, 225 Rangers jumped
off the British landing craft and ran to the bottom of these cliffs.
Their mission was one of the most difficult and daring of the
invasion: to climb these sheer and desolate cliffs and take out
the enemy guns. The Allies had been told that some of the mightiest
of these guns were here and they would be trained on the beaches
to stop the Allied advance.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Rangers looked up and saw the enemy soldiers -- at the edge
of the cliffs shooting down at them with machine-guns and throwing
grenades. And the American Rangers began to climb. They shot rope
ladders over the face of these cliffs and began to pull themselves
up. When one Ranger fell, another would take his place. When one
rope was cut, a Ranger would grab another and begin his climb
again. They climbed, shot back, and held their footing. Soon,
one by one, the Rangers pulled themselves over the top, and in
seizing the firm land at the top of these cliffs, they began to
seize back the continent of Europe. Two hundred and twenty-five
came here. After two days of fighting only ninety could still
bear arms.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Behind me is a memorial that symbolizes the Ranger daggers that
were thrust into the top of these cliffs. And before me are the
men who put them there.

These are the boys of Pointe du Hoc. These are the men who took
the cliffs. These are the champions who helped free a continent.
These are the heroes who helped end a war.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Gentlemen, I look at you and I think of the words of Stephen Spender's
poem. You are men who in your 'lives fought for life...and left
the vivid air signed with your honor'...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Forty summers have passed since the battle that you fought here.
You were young the day you took these cliffs; some of you were
hardly more than boys, with the deepest joys of life before you.
Yet you risked everything here. Why? Why did you do it? What impelled
you to put aside the instinct for self-preservation and risk your
lives to take these cliffs? What inspired all the men of the armies
that met here? We look at you, and somehow we know the answer.
It was faith, and belief; it was loyalty and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The men of Normandy had faith that what they were doing was right,
faith that they fought for all humanity, faith that a just God
would grant them mercy on this beachhead or on the next. It was
the deep knowledge -- and pray God we have not lost it -- that
there is a profound moral difference between the use of force
for liberation and the use of force for conquest. You were here
to liberate, not to conquer, and so you and those others did not
doubt your cause. And you were right not to doubt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You all knew that some things are worth dying for. One's country
is worth dying for, and democracy is worth dying for, because
it's the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised
by man. All of you loved liberty. All of you were willing to fight
tyranny, and you knew the people of your countries were behind
you.

<H2>A Time for Choosing, aka The Speech</H2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I am going to talk of controversial things. I make no apology
for this.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It's time we asked ourselves if we still know the freedoms intended
for us by the Founding Fathers. James Madison said, &quot;We base
all our experiments on the capacity of mankind for self government.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This idea? that government was beholden to the people, that it
had no other source of power is still the newest, most unique
idea in all the long history of man's relation to man. This is
the issue of this election: Whether we believe in our capacity
for self-government or whether we abandon the American Revolution
and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant
capital can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them
ourselves.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I are told we must choose between a left or right, but
I suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There is
only an up or down. Up to man's age-old dream-the maximum of individual
freedom consistent with order or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism.
Regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those
who would sacrifice freedom for security have embarked on this
downward path. Plutarch warned, &quot;The real destroyer of the
liberties of the people is he who spreads among them bounties,
donations and benefits.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The Founding Fathers knew a government can't control the economy
without controlling people. And they knew when a government sets
out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its
purpose. So we have come to a time for choosing.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Public servants say, always with the best of intentions, &quot;What
greater service we could render if only we had a little more money
and a little more power.&quot; But the truth is that outside of
its legitimate function, government does nothing as well or as
economically as the private sector.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Yet any time you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders,
we're denounced as being opposed to their humanitarian goals.
It seems impossible to legitimately debate their solutions with
the assumption that all of us share the desire to help the less
fortunate. They tell us we're always &quot;against,&quot; never
&quot;for&quot; anything.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment
by reason of old age, and to that end we have accepted Social
Security as a step toward meeting the problem. However, we are
against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception
regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism
of the program means that we want to end payments....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are for aiding our allies by sharing our material blessings
with nations which share our fundamental beliefs, but we are against
doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy,
if not socialism, all over the world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We need true tax reform that will at least make a start toward
I restoring for our children the American Dream that wealth is
denied to no one, that each individual has the right to fly as
high as his strength and ability will take him.... But we can
not have such reform while our tax policy is engineered by people
who view the tax as a means of achieving changes in our social
structure....
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Have we the courage and the will to face up to the immorality
and discrimination of the progressive tax, and demand a return
to traditional proportionate taxation? . . . Today in our country
the tax collector's share is 37 cents of -very dollar earned.
Freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our
grasp.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Are you willing to spend time studying the issues, making yourself
aware, and then conveying that information to family and friends?
Will you resist the temptation to get a government handout for
your community? Realize that the doctor's fight against socialized
medicine is your fight. We can't socialize the doctors without
socializing the patients. Recognize that government invasion of
public power is eventually an assault upon your own business.
If some among you fear taking a stand because you are afraid of
reprisals from customers, clients, or even government, recognize
that you are just feeding the crocodile hoping he'll eat you last.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
If all of this seems like a great deal of trouble, think what's
at stake. We are faced with the most evil enemy mankind has known
in his long climb from the swamp to the stars. There can be no
security anywhere in the free world if there is no fiscal and
economic stability within the United States. Those who ask us
to trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state
are architects of a policy of accommodation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
They say the world has become too complex for simple answers.
They are wrong. There are no easy answers, but there are simple
answers. We must have the courage to do what we know is morally
right. Winston Churchill said that &quot;the destiny of man is
not measured by material computation. When great forces are on
the move in the world, we learn we are spirits-not animals.&quot;
And he said, &quot;There is something going on in time and space,
and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells
duty.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
You and I have a rendezvous with destiny. We will preserve for
our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we will
sentence them to take the first step into a thousand years of
darkness. If we fail, at least let our children and our children's
children say of us we justified our brief moment here. We did
all that could be done.

<H2>President Reagan's Speech on The Challenger Disaster</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Ronald Reagan -- Oval Office of the White House, January 28, 1986
<HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Nineteen years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts
in a terrible accident on the ground. But, we've never lost an
astronaut in flight; we've never had a tragedy like this. And
perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the
shuttle; but they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers,
but overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven
heroes: Michael Smith, Dick Scobee, Judith Resnik, Ronald McNair,
Ellison Onizuka, Gregory Jarvis, and Christa McAuliffe. We mourn
their loss as a nation together.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For the families of the seven, we cannot bear, as you do, the
full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss, and we're thinking
about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave,
and they had that special grace, that special spirit that says,
'Give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy.' They had a hunger
to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to
serve, and they did. They served all of us.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle
us. But for twenty-five years the United States space program
has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space,
and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still
pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And I want to say something to the schoolchildren of America who
were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know
it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this
happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery.
It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons.
The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the
brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and
we'll continue to follow them...
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There's a coincidence today. On this day 390 years ago, the great
explorer Sir Francis Drake died aboard ship off the coast of Panama.
In his lifetime the great frontiers were the oceans, and a historian
later said, 'He lived by the sea, died on it, and was buried in
it.' Well, today we can say of the Challenger crew: Their dedication
was, like Drake's, complete.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner
in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor
the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for
the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of
earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

<p>Perhaps you have never given much thought to Christian books.
Up until a few years ago, I didn't either. Oh, I knew Christian
bookstores existed, but I thought they only stocked prayer books
and Bibles -- and after all, I still had my old King James
version. </p>

<p>Was I in for a pleasant surprise when I finally wandered in to
the local store in our town one day. It was during a time in my
life that I was trying to sort through some &quot;excess
baggage&quot; --lingering childhood fears that I had carried into
adulthood, guilt over wrongs done to others, etc. I came across
C.S. Lewis' &quot;Mere Christianity&quot; and realized how
undeveloped my faith in Christ really was. I next bought Neil
Anderson's &quot;The Bondage Breaker&quot;, a wonderful insight
into breaking free from negative, self-destructive thoughts and
fears. I followed that with Lloyd Ogilvie's &quot;The Greatest
Counselor in the World&quot; -- a fresh new look at the Holy
Spirit. Wow! I was hooked! Or rather, the Holy Spirit hooked me. </p>

<p>I was also surprised to learn of the variety of topics covered
by Christian books, like: parenting, marriage, business ethics,
counseling, and even fiction. Most importantly, I came across the
NIV (New International Version) bible and for the first time,
Scripture really spoke to me. What a wonderful and exciting
discovery this continues to be. </p>

<p>Many Christian books would routinely make the New York Times
Bestseller List, except they don't report Christian titles. But
the point is well-taken: Christian books are immensely popular
and according to a Gallop study, represent the fastest growing
segment of the book publishing industry. </p>

<p>It's my hope that you will use CHRISTIANdigest often and share
your discoveries with your family, friends and others. And if you

<h2>The Greatest Counselor ln the World</h2>

<p><b>We need someone who will probe to the nub of the issue, who
has the authority and wisdom to help us see any confusion in our
thinking or distortions in our emotions. This someone not only
needs to lead us to the truth about ourselves and our lives, but
also must possess the strength to empower us to act on what we
know we must do and be. He is the Holy Spirit who is with us.</b>
</p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Lloyd Ogilvie </li>
</ul>

<p>Life is not easy. We only go around once. And for most it's no
merry-go-round ride, but a difficult, bumpy journey. </p>

<p>Problems get us down. Minor problems and sometimes serious
ones. Many of them never seem to go away. We overcome one
obstacle and then get hit by another one with full force. Often
problems pile up. Worry about them saps our strength and
creativity. They accumulate and suddenly too many surface at the
same time. Panic sets in. We wonder how much we can take. We can
take one problem if we can concentrate all our energies on
solving it. But so often our energies are dissipated by other
problems that worsen at the same time. It's difficult to stay up
during financial hard times. Our own health problems or those of
our loved ones make us anxious. Our carefully laid plans get
messed up by human error or carelessness. Foul-ups happen at
work, at home. Then, as if staying afloat wasn't difficult
enough, we feel the undertow of the larger social problems of
violence, racial tensions, and human misery when we turn on the
television news. </p>

<p>We keep waiting for a time when all our problems arc behind
us, so we can really start living. It never comes. The stuff of
life involves facing and solving problems-learning and growing
through them. Who can help us overcome our seemingly endless list
of problems? </p>

<p>OUR URGENT NEED-WHO CAN HELP US? </p>

<p>Many of our biggest problems are wrapped up in people. Often
their need for affirmation and encouragement seems insatiable.
Some are easily hurt, some are competitive, still others need
recognition. We all know the excruciating pain of being
misunderstood by those we love or friends we are trying to help.<br>
</p>

<p>Communication is one of the key challenges in marriage. A wife
said to her husband, &quot;We're passing like ships in the night.
You say you understand what you think I'm saying, but what you
think you are hearing is not what I'm saying!&quot; </p>

<p>And raising children to be mature adults with self-esteem is
an awesome calling. It means riding out the storms of discipline,
rebellion, and anguish. Sibling rivalry keeps many families on
edge, even after the children are adults. </p>

<p>Even in the best of families, there are tensions when aging
parents must be parented by their adult children through the
difficult periods of declining health, nursing care, and an
ever-increasing need for attention and time. </p>

<p>At work, we can trace most problems back to someone who's the
cause. Communication breaks down and so does efficiency. I met an
office manager at the end of a stressful day who exclaimed,
&quot;People and computers! I'm ready to throw out both!&quot; </p>

<p>Among our friends, we all have people with the, &quot;What
have you done for me lately?&quot; attitude. Then there are those
who are facing real difficulties and we long to help bear the
burdens they are carrying. It would be great if we could meet
everyone's needs! </p>

<p>In the church, there are times when fellow Christians get on
our nerves. Every church has its share of difficult people who
want to be served rather than to serve. There are unmet ego needs
at the heart of many squabbles that keep the church from being
the beloved community Jesus intended. </p>

<p>We wish we could see beneath the surface of people, understand
their insecurities, and know what to say and do. Simply keeping
our relationships in order is a full-time job, with overtime
required most every day, even many nights. We wonder if we have
what it takes to deal with needy, demanding, frustrating people.
A lot of the time we're sure we don't have the patience and
endurance required. Who can help us find the love we need when we
feel like we just don't have any more to give? </p>

<p>But not all of us are externalizers who readily identify other
people as our problems. Some of us are internalizers who feel
that our most formidable problems are with the person who lives
inside our own skin. The externalizer tends to blame others; the
internalizer blames himself or herself. If there is a problem,
internalizers usually assume they caused it. A syndrome of low
self-esteem, multiplied by memories of failures and mistakes,
equals a deep sense of inadequacy. </p>

<p>Internalizers have a very active inner child, to use a term
coined by psychology and the recovery movement. The same fears we
had as children influence our adult lives. If we sensed as
children that love and approval were dependent on our
performance, we place similar conditions on ourselves in
adulthood. The fears of our growing years become the settled
condition of our attitudes toward ourselves. Fears of punishment,
rejection, and alienation linger into adulthood. </p>

<p>There are three people living inside of internalizers-the
ideal self, the performing self, and the punitive self. The
punitive self often dominates by heaping blame for ineptness on
the performing self and ridicule for the possibility of ever
achieving on the ideal self. A pervading sense of guilt results.
Guilt is a feeling of self-judgment. It's conditioned approval of
ourselves, our capacity for self-evaluation gone sour. Sometimes
it's rooted in specific memories of failure, but more often it's
a floating dis-ease caused by dis-grace -- uneasiness fostered by
a lack of gracious acceptance of ourselves. It's the restless
disapproval of ourselves that thrashes about in us looking for
tangible evidence of our shortcomings. </p>

<p>A friend of mine who is an internalizer received a call from
his boss setting up an appointment to talk over a problem. My
friend immediately assumed that he had either caused some problem
or was the problem. He spent three anguishing days before the
time of the appointment. When he did meet with the boss, he was
greatly relieved to learn that the problem was related to a
production schedule in the plant where he worked. Concluding the
conference, his boss said, &quot;I'm really glad I have a person
like you to tackle and solve this problem.&quot; </p>

<p>Later my friend said to me, &quot;When I think of all the
worry and anxiety of those three days waiting for that
appointment, I kick myself around the block for assuming I was
the problem!&quot; Notice how quickly my friend shifted from
thinking he was the problem to punishing himself for the way he
reacted. He was not able to enjoy the affirmation his boss had
given him. Instead, he was critical of himself for expecting the
worst. </p>

<p>A woman with whom I was having a conversation persisted in
giving herself a tongue-lashing for some failures. &quot;You
know, I sound just like my mother. I guess I've taken over where
she left off.&quot; My response was, &quot;Are you always this
hard on yourself? She said, &quot;Well, someone has to keep me in
line! </p>

<p>Then I think of a man who always internalizes problems when
they surface in his marriage. His wife says, &quot;I wish he
wasn't so quick to blame himself. He says, 'I'm sorry,' before we
have a chance to talk out what went wrong. Point of fact, most
often we're both to blame, but we never get to the real issue. He
runs for cover by assuming the guilt and escapes any real
responsibility for working out a solution.&quot; </p>

<p>Internalizers miss a lot of the joy of living. Who can infuse
the esteem and confidence needed to stop worrying and start
living? </p>

<p>Decisions stare all of us in the face as well. Seemingly
insignificant daily decisions about the expenditure of our time,
energy, and money can have long-range implications. Crossroad
decisions about our careers, crucial moves, and lifestyle choices
force us to think about where we are headed and the quality of
person we want to be. Moral and social issues test our integrity.
We struggle to clarify our goals distracted by a cacophony of
voices suggesting a thousand different directions. Some previous
decisions soberly remind us that the margin of error is high. The
risks make us very cautious. Sometimes we get bogged down and
muddle through life, deciding not to decide but then paying the
consequences. We long to have 20/20 hindsight to learn from the
past. Most of all, we wish we had better discernment about what's
best for our lives and for those for whom we are responsible,
especially loved ones in our care. We yearn to have someone share
the burden with us and lead us to make the right decisions. But
who has enough wisdom to do that? Whom can we trust? </p>

<p>Along with people problems and tough decisions, life also
dishes out disappointments. Little ones hassle our daily
happiness and peace of mind. Big ones hamper our long-range hopes
for the future. In one week recently, I talked to people who
represented the broad spectrum of human disappointments. A man
expressed his anguish at being bypassed for a position he'd
worked hard to be awarded. Only two people at the office
disagreed with his assessment: the boss and his fellow employee
who got the promotion. A woman battled with disappointment over
her two children who, as yet, shared neither her beliefs nor her
values. A man expressed his exasperation over his son who turned
down the opportunity to follow in his footsteps and take over the
family business. An actress who had achieved some measure of fame
and success confessed her disappointment that she had not had a
chance to work for several years. A man who also is out of work
shared his growing anxiety and diminished self-esteem. People who
had debilitating illnesses talked about their disappointment over
their physical limitations. A woman sobbed out the pain over her
broken relationship with her husband. </p>

<p>&quot;Quite a week!&quot; you say. And yet, people are
enduring disappointments all around us. The Scottish poet Robert
Burns was right, If each man's internal care were written on his
brow, those who have our envy, would have our pity now.&quot; All
of us, at times, are disappointed. </p>

<p>When life doesn't turn out the way we've planned, we tend to
get discouraged and angry. When the anger builds up inside, we
feel depressed and are not sure what to do about it. Where can we
turn to receive comfort and counsel in our hour of trial? </p>

<p>Even in the midst of a busy life surrounded by people, often
we feel quite lonely. Does anyone really care about me? We are
anxious about trying to do the best we can with what we have and
receiving recognition for it. Fear of failure often racks us,
especially when we face new challenges and responsibilities at
work and at home. An even greater fear of rejection keeps our
exterior highly polished, while --at the same time -- we hide
what's really going on inside. Can we trust anyone to understand
our deepest fears and insecurities? </p>

<p>All of this can happen to good people, religious people,
church people, who discover that life is difficult. There's an
aching need for strength, courage, and confidence. Inner
certainty and serenity are lacking. Religion begins to wear thin.
Vibrant hope starts to dim. Something important is missing. But
to whom shall we go to find the missing piece of the puzzle? </p>

<p>We need someone to listen and understand -- someone who will
allow us to talk until we know what we are trying to say. And we
need someone who will probe to the nub of the issue, who has the
authority and wisdom to help us see any confusion in our thinking
or distortions in our emotions. This someone not only needs to
lead us to the truth about ourselves and our lives, but also must
possess the strength to empower us to act on what we know we must
do and be. Above all, we need someone who has the power to heal
our past memories, sharpen our vision of what is best for our
future, and catch us up in a purpose beyond ourselves -- one
that's big enough to fire our imaginations and give ultimate
meaning and lasting joy to daily living. </p>

<p>That's a tall order. No friend, psychiatrist, psychologist,
pastor, or spiritual advisor can meet all of these
qualifications. But they may help lead us to the One Who has all
these gifts. He alone has the omniscience, omnipresence, and
omnipotence to be the kind of counselor we need. He can help us
with our problems, relationships, and decisions for He knows
everything. He is with us always, for He never sleeps. He has all
power to give us strength and courage, for He is the Holy Spirit
with us and wants to live within us. </p>

<p>THE GREATEST COUNSELOR IN THE WORLD </p>

<p>The Holy Spirit is the greatest Counselor in the world. The
word &quot;counselor&quot; may not be the first word that comes
to your mind when you think of the Holy Spirit. For many, the
Holy Spirit is the least known and understood Person of the
Trinity. For others, He is associated almost exclusively with
Pentecost, the gift of tongues, or the charismatic church. And
for some, the Holy Spirit is the subject of dispute about when He
is received, what is the evidence of His presence in the life of
a Christian, and customs that have emerged to celebrate His
presence in contemporary worship in some churches. </p>

<p>But to a growing number of Christians around the world today,
the Holy Spirit is known and praised by the name Jesus used to
declare what the Spirit would be in the lives of His disciples
after Pentecost. The Greek word is Parakletos, a cornucopian word
overflowing with inspiring implications. It is translated as
Comforter in the King James, Helper in the New King James, and
Counselor in the Revised Standard Version and the New
International Version. </p>

<p>We can appreciate more fully the ministry of the Holy Spirit
as our Counselor when we understand the use of this propitious
name Parakletos. The Greek word is rich in meaning. It was
associated with courts of law and signifies one who is the
counsel for the defense, one who pleads on behalf of another. In
a broader sense, it identifies one who stands by a person's side
or one who is ready to aid a soldier in battle. </p>

<p><i>And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
Counselor to be with you forever-the Spirit of truth.... He lives
with you and wiIl be in you. John 14:16-17, NIV</i><br>
</p>

<p>Now consider how the word was used for Christ Himself. The
apostle John writes,<br>
<br>
<i>&quot;We have an Advocate (Parakletos) with the Father, Jesus
Christ the righteous. And He Himself is the propitiation
(hilasmos -- the means whereby sin is remitted) for our sins, and
not for ours only but also for the whole world&quot; (I John
2:1-2). </i><br>
<br>
John knew this to be true from Jesus' own self-identification to
the disciples, then in the apostle's personal witness of the
death of Christ, and, most of all, in his own experience of the
risen Lord through the Holy Spirit. Christ pleads our case before
the Father on the basis of His sacrifice on the cross. When we
believe in Christ and His atoning death for us, He is our
Advocate before the Father, claiming the same love for us as the
Father has for Him. Incredible! In that light, next consider
Christ's words about the Holy Spirit spoken in the Upper Room on
the night before He was crucified. He promised another Advocate. <br>
<i>&quot;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another
Counselor to be with you forever-the Spirit of truth.... He lives
with you and will be in you&quot; (John 14:16-17, NIV).</i> <br>
</p>

<p>The word &quot;another&quot; needs underlining. The Greek word
used is allos, another of the same kind, not heteros, meaning
another of a different kind. Then Jesus went on with this
mind-stretching promise, &quot;I will not leave you orphans; I
will come to you&quot; and further, <br>
<i>&quot;At that day you will know that I am in My Father and you
in Me and I in you&quot; (John 14:18, 20).</i> In light of the
unity of the Persons of the Trinity, we can press on to
understand and experience the particular ministry of the Holy
Spirit as our Counselor in the stresses and strains as well as
the opportunities and challenges of daily living. </p>

<p>WHAT A DIFFERENCE THE SPIRIT MAKES </p>

<p>Allow me to share my own experience of the Spirit as
Counselor. It began many years ago while I was a postgraduate
student at the University Edinburgh. I had lived a few years as a
Christian with firm trust in Christ as my Lord and Savior before
I realized the power to live the Christian life. I did my best to
be an orthodox believer with evangelical fervor. Seldom a day
passed without Bible study and prayer. I shared my faith and
tried to be a faithful disciple. With a crusader's zeal, I
entered into battles for social justice. </p>

<p>The problem, however, was that I was trying to live for Christ
rather than empowered by Him through the Holy Spirit. My problem
was pride: I wanted to be a good Christian on my own steam. This
led to a dishonest duality: I was a polished Christian on the
outside; inside I felt empty, unsure, and insecure. And I tried
all the harder to keep the exterior shining bright, so no one
else would know. That came across to others as arrogance or, at
the very least, pretentious piety. </p>

<p>Needing to be right, I defended my decisions with
stubbornness. Insecure, I became all the more determined to
control my life and the people around me. That brought tensions
in my marriage. I'll never forget the day my wife, Mary Jane,
said, &quot;Lloyd, you're trying so hard. You talk about love
more than anyone I know, but I don't feel love from you.&quot; </p>

<p>In sharing my faith, so often I had the words without the
music. The biblical orthodoxy was there, but seldom was there a
personal illustration of what the Gospel was doing for me. My
least favorite verse was, <i>&quot;We have this treasure in
earthen vessels that the excellence of the power may be of God
and not of us&quot; (2 Corinthians 4:7).</i> I wanted to hold the
treasure in a silver vessel, excellent in my pure theology and
what I thought was exemplary discipleship. </p>

<p>Keeping up the image of victorious Christian living became
very exhausting, particularly when I faded. A pervading tension
inside finally brought me to the breaking point. I searched the
message of Christ in the New Testament for an answer, all the
while crying out, &quot;Lord, help me!&quot; </p>

<p>Alone on a retreat, I felt led to John, chapters 14 through
16, about the promise of the Holy Spirit. Paul's word to the
Ephesians, &quot;Be filled with the Spirit&quot; (Ephesians
5:18), resounded in my mind as well. In the long hours of
silence, the Lord seemed to keep saying, &quot;Lloyd, the Holy
Spirit led you to Me, now let Me lead you to the Holy Spirit.
You're adrift. Lift the sails of your mind and heart. Let Me fill
them with the wind of the Spirit. You need daily power, guidance,
wisdom, and vision. Most of all, you need to allow Me to love
you, to heal the insecurities from childhood and the memories of
past failures. Stop trying to control Me. Instead, let Me control
you. Don't be afraid of losing Me by being filled constantly with
the Holy Spirit. We are one! In being filled with Him, you will
know Me better than ever before. The energy you've squandered on
trying to be adequate, He will multiply beyond your imagination,
so you can glorify and serve Me.&quot; </p>

<p>The Lord had put His finger on a raw nerve. My pride, yes, but
something more. In my passion to be a disciple, I feared that
opening myself to the Holy Spirit was somehow disloyalty to
Christ. My faith was rooted in the historical Christ, His death
and victorious resurrection alone. With everything within me, I
had tried to serve the risen, reigning Christ. That was the
problem. Everything within me had run out. My tank was running on
empty. </p>

<p>So there I sat during my solitary retreat feeling the same
emotions of panic experienced by the disciples in the Upper Room
after the crucifixion and resurrection, but before Pentecost.
Like them, the Master's words, It is to your advantage that I go
away; for if I do not go away, the Helper (Counselor) will not
come to you; but if I depart, I will send Him to you&quot; (John
16:7), were discomforting. Yet, as I pondered their meaning, I
realized that was exactly what was happening to me. Christ was
saying that He was pulling me away from my limited stage of
growth, so He could pull me on to a new and exciting experience
of Himself though the power of the Holy Spirit. Words I'd read in
G. Campbell Morgan's commentary on Acts came thundering to mind
with reassuring force: &quot;Thirty minutes after Pentecost, the
disciples knew more Of Christ than they had learned through three
years of following Him as Jesus of Nazareth.&quot; Was that true?
I wondered. I felt gripped by the desire to find out for myself. </p>

<p>I got down on my knees. &quot;Lord Jesus,&quot; I prayed,
&quot;I know I could not have believed in You without the gift of
faith from the Holy Spirit. But, since then, I've given little
thought to the Holy Spirit. Now You have shown me that You and He
are one, through Him You can live in me. He will empower me to
serve You. I confess that I've feared losing control. That's
absurd. I've already lost control trying to be Your disciple on
my own energy. </p>

<p>&quot;With the same earnestness that I confessed my faith in
You, Christ, I confess my trust in, and need for, the Holy
Spirit. I ask to be filled with the Holy Spirit and make a
covenant to keep allowing Him to fill me. Lord, as the Holy
Spirit led me to You, now lead me to Him so I can glorify You and
serve You with authentic power and not my limited and now
depleted strength. Lord, I need the Holy Spirit, I want the Holy
Spirit, I yield myself to the Holy Spirit.&quot; </p>

<p>While still on my knees, I felt a palpable surge of power
throbbing in my body. A warmth flooded my whole being. A sense of
peace, security, and well-being invaded my turbulent heart and
mind. I felt loved and cherished. Then an indomitable will to
press on captured my own will. I was ready to live again, really
for the first time. </p>

<p>The difference this experience made in my life, marriage, and
ministry was startling, first to me, and then to those around me.
Morgan was right: the Holy Spirit did free me to know, love, and
serve Christ better than ever before! </p>

<p>&quot;Why do I feel the way I do?&quot; cries the troubled
person. Typically, he or she wants to put the blame on something
or someone else. &quot;It's my wife. She's the one who makes me
feel this way. Or, &quot;It's all my husband's fault...... My job
isn't satisfying me, or &quot;My friends are disappointing,&quot;
or &quot;My children are a disappointment. &quot; Some people
blame their problems on their church. They find fault with their
pastor, complain that the people aren't friendly enough or that
everybody else in the world is a hypocrite.</p>

<p>There's something in all of our lives we'd like to change.
Nobody's life circumstances are perfect. But what are we telling
ourselves about these circumstances?</p>

<p>A few years ago a man we'll call Jerry was a wreck of a man.
He was a Christian and had believed in God most of his life. Now,
however, after 15 years of marriage, he was forced to live alone,
separated from his family and facing a divorce he didn't want. He
thought it was the end of the world. He was really miserable. He
spent many evenings trying to anesthetize his painful feelings
with liquor. He was so unhappy he wanted to die because he just
couldn't see any other way out of such sad circumstances.</p>

<p>Finally, he decided to see a Christian psychotherapist for
help. Once in therapy, he gradually began to see that his life
didn't have to be over. He stopped thinking about taking his own
life, and his faith in God began to stretch. He started thinking
of God as a giver of good. He came to know Him in a new
dimension, and little by little, his life changed.</p>

<p>He explained it this way. &quot;One day while I sat groveling
in my sorrows, I listened to the words I had been telling myself,
things like, 'Oh, what's the use? I'm all alone. Nobody loves me
or cares about me. Nobody wants to be with me. I'm rejected and
useless . Suddenly I was shocked. I thought, What am I telling
myself anyhow?' &quot;</p>

<p>Jerry questioned his self-talk. He recognized something
radically wrong with what he had been telling himself and
realized his depression was not due to his impending divorce, but
what he was telling himself about it.</p>

<p>As a result he began to change the sentences he said to
himself. This took some hard work and determination on his part.
It wasn't easy at first, but because he refused to be a
&quot;chump&quot; to a pack of self-destroying lies, he taught
himself to confess the truth.</p>

<p>He also stopped drinking completely. He argued with the
destructive sentences he had been telling himself. &quot;Just
because I'm alone doesn't mean I have to be lonely!&quot; he
said. He told himself the truth and used his situation as an
opportunity to celebrate, enjoy and revel in the presence of the
Lord Jesus Christ in his life.</p>

<p>His circumstances hadn't changed, but what he told himself
about the circumstances changed He discovered that he had been
telling himself a lot of lies, straight from the devil.</p>

<p>Three steps to becoming the happy person you were meant to be
are:</p>

<p>1. Locate your misbelief. (Jerry realized that he was telling
himself lies.)</p>

<p>2. Remove them. (He argued against them. &quot;I am not
lonely! &quot;)</p>

<p>3. Replace misbelief with the truth. (&quot;It's nonsense to
say I'm unlovable and useless. I'm loved with an everlasting love
by the God of the universe. In Him, I have countless talents and
uses and I am infinitely valuable to Him.)</p>

<p>Jerry learned that being alone could actually be an exciting
experience with the Lord. If he had hung on to his ridiculous
misbeliefs, he might have gone to his grave in gloom and misery
long ago. Happily, he recovered completely and now leads a
wonderfully fulfilled life. He will never again suffer the
self-destructive anguish he was duped by once. When he learned to
see the truth about himself, he also learned to argue and get rid
of the lies that would have destroyed him.</p>

<p>TRUTH: WHAT IS IT?</p>

<p>Many philosophers and thinkers through the ages have been
fascinated by the idea of truth, what it is and what it means in
our lives.</p>

<p>One of these people was a man named Rene Descartes. He was a
devout Roman Catholic who lived at the beginning of the
seventeenth century. He made a name for himself by trying to
discover clear and indubitable truth.</p>

<p>Descartes was fed up with the never-ending arguments among
philosophers and decided to put an end to their disagreements
forever.</p>

<p>In order to find some truth which would be so unquestionable
that no one could doubt it, Descartes decided to start at the
point of'his own doubt of things. He systematically doubted all
that he could possibly doubt. In doubting everything imaginable,
he told himself he was thinking. Then he reasoned, since he was
thinking, he had to be.</p>

<p>Thus emerged his famous words, &quot;I think, therefore I am. </p>

<p>Descartes had finally discovered what he considered an
indubitable truth: He believed the most important thing about
truth was to arrive at it. The trouble with his proposition is
that it doesn't tell us much about how to lieu or be happy with
that truth.</p>

<p>Marcus Aurelius was another thinking man. He was emperor of
Rome about 150 years after Christ, and he too was concerned with
the truth. Marcus Aurelius was a stoic ruler and noted as one of
the most high-minded and conscientious of all the Roman emperors.
He had many failings, one of them his dislike for Christians; but
in spite of this sorrowful indiscretion, he pursued a quest for
truth. In his book Meditations, he shares an earth-shaking
discovery, one that can make a difference in the way we live
today.</p>

<p>Marcus Aurelius saw that human emotion is not just a product
of chance circumstances, but is determined by the way people
think.</p>

<p>Where Descartes said, &quot;I think, therefore I am,&quot;
Marcus Aurelius might have said, &quot;I think in order to
determine the way I am.&quot;</p>

<p>Precisely.</p>

<p>In the book of Proverbs in the Bible, it reads, As a man
thinketh in his heart, so is he. I In exploring this and other
scriptural references pertaining to the importance of right
thinking, we discover the Bible solidly teaches that man's
feelings, passions and behavior are subject to and conditioned by
the way he thinks.</p>

<p>Marcus Aurelius had unearthed a truth whose fullness he could
not wholly appreciate because he did not know the Lord Jesus
Christ who said, &quot;I am the Truth.&quot; </p>

<p>As human beings we are not doomed to a cold, emotionless,
machine-like existence. We are creatures throbbing with mental,
emotional and physical energy. Once we yank out the
irrationalities and lies from our thoughts and replace them with
the truth, we can lead satisfying, rich and fulfilling emotional
lives.</p>

<p>These irrationalities are not always easy to label. Most of
what we tell ourselves is not in word form. Our thoughts are
often images or attitudes without words attached to them. You may
feel uncomfortable and isolated in crowded places but never
actually put these feelings into words. You may be fearful of a
thing and avoid it without really knowing what's going on in your
belief system at all.</p>

<p>But how do we change? How do we make contact with what's
really going on within us?</p>

<p>&quot;Doctor,&quot; a patient will weep, &quot;I think the
root of my problem goes back to my childhood!&quot; How often we
hear this statement!</p>

<p>Our culture, intinctured with Freudian philosophy, has nearly
made it mandatory to believe that no one can be healed
psychologically without exploring the past in detail and in
depth.</p>

<p>It is not, however, events either past or present which make
us feel the way we feel, but our interpretation of those events.</p>

<p>Our feelings are not caused by the circumstances of our long
lost childhood or the circumstances of the present. Our feelings
are caused by what we tell ourselves about our circumstances,
whether in words or in attitudes.</p>

<p>What we tell ourselves can be either (1) truth or (2) lie.</p>

<p>If you tell yourself untruths or lies, you will believe
untruths and lies. If you tell yourself you're a dumb jerk who
can't do anything right, you'll believe it. If you believe
something, you'll act as though you believe it.</p>

<p>That's why your beliefs and misbeliefs are the most important
factors of your mental and emotional life.</p>

<p>MISBELIEFS</p>

<p>What are misbeliefs?</p>

<p>The word misbelief is an important word. In fact, it's the
most appropriate label we can think of for some of the ridiculous
things we tell ourselves. The amount of suffering we experience
due to sustained bouts of negative thinking and battered emotions
is outrageous.</p>

<p>Misbeliefs are the direct cause of emotional turmoil,
maladaptive behavior and most so-called &quot;mental
illness.&quot; Misbeliefs are the cause of the destructive
behavior people persist in engaging in even when they are fully
aware that it is harmful to them (such as overeating, smoking,
lying, drunkenness, stealing or adultery).</p>

<p>Misbeliefs generally appear as truth to the person repeating
them to himself. They might even seem to be true to an untrained
counselor. That is partly because they often do contain some
shred of truth, and partly because the sufferer has never
examined or questioned these erroneous assumptions. But, please
understand, the misbeliefs we tell ourselves are directly from
the pit of hell. They are hand engraved and delivered by the
devil himself. He is very clever in dishing out misbeliefs. He
doesn't want to risk being discovered so he always appears as if
the lie he is telling us is true.</p>

<p>Words like, &quot;Oh, I can't do anything right. I'm always
making mistakes&quot; are good examples. You'll believe these
lies when you've just made a mistake.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I can't do anything right&quot; is a misbelief
statement. If you believe words like that, you are believing a
lie.</p>

<p>Martin Luther, teaching the meaning of the sixth petition of
the Lord's Prayer (&quot;Lead us not into temptation&quot;)
wrote: &quot;We pray in this petition that God would guard and
keep us lest the devil, the world, and our flesh lead us into
misbelief, despair and other great shame and vice.&quot; The
consequences of misbelief do lead to despair and other
&quot;great shame and vice.&quot;</p>

<p>Think for a moment about the things you tell yourself. If you
tell yourself your mother-in-law hates you or the guy next door
is a rotten neighbor and a no-good so-and-so, what will you be
influenced by? You'll believe what you tell yourself. Therefore,
you'll treat your mother-in-law as a personal enemy and you'll
treat your neighbor exactly like a no-good soand-so.</p>

<p>More than likely your mother-in-law and neighbor gave you some
reason to tell yourself those things about them, so you can feel
justified with your self-talk. But you're a victim of misbelief.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>The Apostle James shows us where destructive self-talk comes
from. &quot;This [superficial] wisdom is not such as comes down
from above, but is earthly, unspiritual [animal], even
devilish.&quot; :1 Negative and distorted statements which a
person repeats to himself come from the devil. Your flesh accepts
them without question and then, like spoiled, rotting food, these
words of mental poison create painful emotional aches and pains.</p>

<p>This diet of deadly toxins will kill you, according to Saint
Paul. He says to set &quot;the mind on the flesh . is death.
&quot;4 If you continue to tell yourself distorted statements,
you're going to have negative feelings and you're going to engage
in negative behavior.</p>

<p>Persistent painful feelings are contrary to God's will.</p>

<p>God does not want His children to suffer depression, worry and
intractable anger.</p>

<p>Did you know God wants us to be able to control our feelings
and actions?</p>

<p>We can do it when we get rid of our misbeliefs and start
paying attention to our self-talk.</p>

<p>A client named Bob sits in the therapist's office for his
sixth therapy session. He fidgets with his hands as he talks.
&quot;It's getting so I feel tense and knotted up most of the
time,&quot; he tells the therapist. &quot;I've prayed about it,
and I know the Bible says we aren't supposed to be nervous about
things, but I can't seem to help myself. It's getting
worse.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You feel tense all the time?&quot; asks the therapist.</p>

<p>Bob frowns. &quot;All the time. Sometimes it's worse than at
other times. I go to church but that doesn't help. Last Sunday
morning in church I could hardly stand it. I wanted to run
out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why didn't you get up and leave?&quot;</p>

<p>Bob is surprised at the question. &quot;I couldn't do that!
Everybody would stare.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And suppose they did stare? Can stares hurt you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'd think I was crazy or backslidden. Oh, I could
never just walk out of church.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But you said you could hardly stand it. Do you mean that
because you were with people, you felt you had to stay
there?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, of course. I mean, they'd think something was
wrong with me if I just got up and walked out.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Would that be so bad?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, what if they knew what was going on inside me?
What if they found out how tense and upset I am most of the time?
I'm always afraid people will find out how uptight I am.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What if they did know some of your inner feelings?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;They'd think I was a kook, maybe. Or maybe I'm not a
good Christian. After all, Christians are supposed to be happy
and calm.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let me ask you something, Bob. If you had a friend who
was</p>

<p>having tense and nervous feelings, would you call him a kook
or a terrible Christian?&quot;</p>

<p>Bob shifts his weight, glances at the floor. &quot;Of course
not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You seem to think that what others think of you is more
important than your own feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>Bob is quiet for a moment and then says, &quot;I do want
everyone to think well of me. I want to be liked, do what people
admire.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Let's examine what you've told me so far and see where
the misbeliefs are.&quot;</p>

<p>Bob shakes his head up and down. &quot;I can see one for
sure.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The misbelief that everybody should like and appreciate
me. If they don't, it would be just awful.&quot;</p>

<p>Bob made a huge discovery that day. He discovered how
important the words are that he tells himself. These words, or
our self-talk, are what we listen to in order to hear our
misbeliefs.</p>

<p>One of Bob's misbeliefs was that in order for him to be happy,
he had to know he was acceptable to people and liked by them.</p>

<p>Misbelief.- &quot;I must please people. My actions must not
cause others to disapprove of me in any way. If someone
disapproved of me, it would be intolerable.&quot;</p>

<p>This string of related misbeliefs causes anxiety and an
endless source of pain.</p>

<p>Truth: The Christian doesn't have to strive for the approval
of everyone around him.</p>

<p>Bob needed to understand that the people he was worried about
pleasing actually had no power to hurt him, even if they weren't
pleased with him. He learned that very rarely do people get as
upset with us as we imagine them to be. He was able to make
dramatic changes in his thinking when he at last realized that
the actual consequences of disapproval could never cause as much
despair and anguish as his misbelief caused him. He also realized
that it was God's approval that was most important.</p>

<p>Bob was one of the fortunate ones. He didn't land in a
hospital or become dependent upon various drugs. He was able to
take control himself.</p>

<p>You are the controller of your happiness and your unhappiness.</p>

<p>You'll be on the road to freedom when you take the first step
and identify your misbeliefs for what they are. Learn how to
recognize them and put them in their place as lies of the devil.</p>

<p>&quot;You will know the truth, and the truth will set you
free&quot; 5 is a promise of Jesus. Let the truth expose your
misbeliefs for what they are!</p>

<p>You can be free from such ugly feelings as bitterness,
oppression, depression, anxiety, resentment, anger,
over-suspiciousness and hypersensitivity. You can learn
self-control and have fun while you're doing it.</p>

<p>In emotional and mental health, what you believe is all
important. It makes a difference what you believe. Other people,
circumstances, events and material things are not what make you
happy. What you believe about these things is what makes you
happy or unhappy.</p>

<p>If you believe it would be horrible if nobody talks to you at
a dinner party, your mental and emotional self will react
accordingly. Getting ready for the party you feel tense; on the
way to the party you're feeling anxious. Once there you're
sweating and uncomfortable. Your every impulse is to find someone
to talk to, to be a part of things, to be liked. You wonder why
you're so nervous. You may excuse your feelings by telling
yourself, &quot;Oh, those parties aren't for me. I'm basically a
shy person.&quot;</p>

<p>Do you see how misbeliefs cause us to deny ourselves pleasure
as well as the good blessings of life in Christ?</p>

<p>The misbelief in the above are:</p>

<p>1. It will be horrible if nobody talks to me at social
gatherings (or if I don't know the people).</p>

<p>2. It's terrible to feel self-conscious and nervous.</p>

<p>The truth is:</p>

<p>1. I can enjoy myself wherever I go, and I do not need to have
someone to talk to in order to have a good time.</p>

<p>2. Feelings of self-consciousness won't kill me. It's all
right to experience these feelings.</p>

<p>Discomfort never killed anyone, but our misbeliefs tell us
that discomfort is terrible, awful, wretched, horrible, when in
fact, although not a lot of fun, it can be endurable.</p>

<p>What you think and belieue determines how you feel and what
you do. It is our endeavor to change the fundamental negative
misbeliefs in you to the point where you will energetically and
actively set about to get rid of them-permanently.</p>

<p>If you are a counselor, you can help people by helping them
discover their misbeliefs. You can watch lives change and blossom
before your eyes as people shunt their misbeliefs and actively
inject the truth into their lives.</p>

<p>The question now is, do we really want to be happy?</p>

<h2>A Gentle Thunder</h2>

<p><b>How far do you want God to go in getting your attention?
Don&#146;t answer too quickly. Give it some thought. What if God
moved you to another land? (As he did Abraham.) What if he called
you out of retirement? (Remember Moses?) How about the voice of
an angel or the bowel of a fish? (A la Gideon and Jonah.) How
about a promotion (like Daniel&#146;s) or a demotion (like
Samson&#146;s)? God does what it takes to get our attention.
It&#146;s the message of the Bible. It&#146;s the message of this
book: the relentless pursuit of God. </b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Max Lucado</li>
</ul>

<p>I WOULD LIKE to confess a fall. I've kept it secret long
enough. I can't deny the stumble; nor can I dismiss the truth. I
fell. There were witnesses to my slip. They can tell you.
Graciously, they have told no one. Out of concern for my
reputation, they kept the event a secret. But it has been a
secret long enough. The time has come for my mistake to be
shared. </p>

<p>I lost my footing at a family camp.</p>

<p>My daughters and I chose to climb a wall-a simulated rock
climb. The wall is made of wood with occasional rock-shaped
fingerholds bolted into the surface. For safety, the climber
wears a harness around his waist. The harness is attached to a
rope that runs up through a pulley and then down into the hands
of a guide who secures it as the climber climbs. </p>

<p>I gave it a go. What's a fifty-foot wall for a middle-aged
author? I gave the guide the &quot;thumbs-up&quot; and began. The
first half of the trip I did well. About midway, however, I began
to get tired. These hands and feet are not accustomed to
climbing. </p>

<p>With about twenty feet left to go, I honestly began to wonder
if I would make it. I gave serious thought to telling the guide
just to pull me up the rest of the way. My fingers were sore, and
my legs were starting to tremble, and I was regretting every Big
Mac I'd ever eaten, but the thought of surrender was lost in the
cheers of my daughters who were already on the top. </p>

<p>&quot;Come on, Dad. You can make it!&quot; </p>

<p>So I gave it all I had. But all I had was not enough. My feet
slipped, my hands slipped, and down I fell. I fell hard. But I
didn't fall far. My guide had a firm hold on the rope. Because he
was alert and because he was strong, my tumble lasted only a
couple of seconds. I bounced and swung in the harness, suspended
in midair. Everyone watching let out a sigh, and I gulped and
resumed the climb. </p>

<p>Guess what I did when I made it to the top? Do you think I
boasted? Do you think I bragged about conquering the wall? No
way. I looked down at the one who kept me from falling.
&quot;Thanks, pal,&quot; I told him. I didn't pat myself on the
back or raise my fist in triumph. I didn't ask everybody if
they'd seen what I did. I did the only thing that was right; I
said thanks to the one who held me. </p>

<p>Would that all my tumbles were so simple. So brief. So
harmless. They haven't been. I've been known to let go of much
more than imitation rocks. I've let go of promises and
convictions. There have been times when my fingers slipped off
the very stones of truth I treasure. And I can't tell you how
many times I've expected to hit the bottom only to find myself
suspended in midair, secured by a pair of nail-pierced hands. </p>

<p>&quot;Try again,&quot; he urges. And so I resume. </p>

<p>You and I are on a great climb. The wall is high, and the
stakes are higher. You took your first step the day you confessed
Christ as the Son of God. He gave you his harness-the Holy
Spirit. In your hands he placed a rope-his Word. </p>

<p>Your first steps were confident and strong, but with the
journey came weariness, and with the height came fear. You lost
your footing. You lost your focus. You lost your grip, and you
fell. For a moment, which seemed like forever, you tumbled
wildly. Out of control. Out of self-control. Disoriented.
Dislodged. Falling. </p>

<p>But then the rope tightened, and the tumble ceased. You hung
in the harness and found it to be strong. You grasped the rope
and found it to be true. You looked at your guide and found Jesus
securing your soul. With a sheepish confession, you smiled at him
and he smiled at you, and the journey resumed. </p>

<p>Now you are wiser. You have learned to go slowly. You are
careful. You are cautious, but you are also confident. You trust
the rope. You rely on the harness. And though you can't see your
guide, you know him. You know he is strong. You know he is able
to keep you from falling. </p>

<p>And you know you are only a few more steps from the top. So
whatever you do, don't quit. Though your falls are great, his
strength is greater. You will make it. You will see the summit.
You will stand at the top. And when you get there, the first
thing you'll do is join with all the others who have made the
climb and sing this verse: </p>

<p>&quot;To him who is able to keep you from falling and to
present you before his glorious presence without fault and with
great joy to the only God our Savior be glory, majesty, power and
authority, through Jesus Christ our Lord, before all ages, now
and forevermore! Amen&quot; (Jude 24 NIV). </p>

<p><b>A Cinderella Story:The God Who Gave His Beauty Away</b> </p>

<p>GOD BETWEEN TWO thieves. Exactly the place he wants to be. </p>

<p>Three men on three crosses, a well-known scene. Even casual
students of Christ are acquainted with the trio on Skull's Hill.
We've pondered their sufferings and sketched their faces and
analyzed their words. But let's imagine this scene from another
perspective. Rather than stand on ground level and look up, let's
stand at the throne of God and look down. What does God see? What
is the perspective of heaven? Does God see the timber and nails?
Does God witness the tom flesh and spilt blood? Can heaven hear
the mallet slam and the voices cry? </p>

<p>Certainly. But God sees much more. He sees his Son surrounded
by sin and two thieves covered with sin. A shadow hangs over
their spirits. The crowd cringes at the sight of the blood on
their skin, but heaven laments over the darkness of their hearts.
Earth pities the con&#31;dition of their bodies. Heaven weeps
over the condition of their souls. </p>

<p>I wonder if we can understand the impact our sin has in
heaven. We get a clue in Revelation 3: 16 when Jesus threatens to
spit the lukewarm church out of his mouth. The verb literally
means &quot;to vomit.&quot; Their sin, excuse the phrase, made
God want to puke. Their acts caused him, not just distaste, but
disgust. </p>

<p>Haven't you felt the same? Haven't you witnessed the horror of
a human act and wanted to throw up? On last night's news
broadcast the story was told of a ten-year-old boy who'd been
allegedly set afire by his father. The man had stuffed tissue
down his son's T-shirt, covered the boy with lighter fluid, and
set him aflame. Why? Because the boy had taken some of the
father's food stamps. </p>

<p>Doesn't such a story disgust you? Make you angry? And if we,
who are also sinners, have such a reaction, how much more should
a holy God? After all, it is his law being broken. His children
being abused. His word being ignored. </p>

<p>His holiness being insulted. </p>

<p>The question is not, &quot;Couldn't God overlook sin?&quot;
The question instead is, &quot;How in the world is forgiveness an
option?&quot; The question is not why God finds it difficult to
forgive, but how he finds it possible to do so at all.' </p>

<p>From God's angle the tragedy of these men was not that they
were about to die, but that they were dying with unresolved sin.
They were leaving this earth hostile to God, defiant of his
truth, and resistant to his call. &quot;When people's thinking is
controlled by the sinful self, they are against God&quot; (Rom.
8:7). Sin is not an unfortunate slip or a regrettable act; it is
a posture of defiance against a holy God. Such is what heaven
sees. </p>

<p>The figure on the center cross, however, has no such shadow of
sin. &quot;When he lived on earth, he was tempted in every way
that we are, but he did not sin&quot; (Heb. 4: I 5). Stainless.
Selfless. Even on a sinner's cross Jesus' holiness illuminates
heaven. </p>

<p>The first criminal reads the sign that announces Jesus as the
king of the Jews. He hears Jesus pray for those who kill him.
Something about the presence of the carpenter convinces him he's
in the presence of a king. </p>

<p>The other crook has a different opinion. &quot;Aren't you the
Christ? Then save yourself and us&quot; (Luke 23:39). You'd think
a man near death would use his energy for something other than
slander. Not this one. The shadow over his heart is so thick,
even in pain he mocks. </p>

<p>Suddenly someone tells him, &quot;You should fear God!&quot;
It's the voice of the first criminal. &quot;We are ... getting
what we deserve for what we did. But this man has done nothing
wrong&quot; (Luke 23:4I). </p>

<p>Finally someone is defending Jesus. Peter fled. The disciples
hid. The Jews accused. Pilate washed his hands. Many could have
spoken on behalf of Jesus, but none did. Until now. Kind words
from the lips of a thief. He makes his request. &quot;Jesus,
remember me when you come into your kingdom&quot; (Luke 23:42).</p>

<p>The Savior turns his heavy head toward the prodigal child and
promises, &quot;I tell you the truth, today you will be with me
in paradise&quot; (Luke 23:43). </p>

<p>To those at the foot of the cross, the dialogue was curious.
But to those at the foot of the throne, the dialogue was
outrageous. They couldn't imagine it. How could the thief come to
paradise? How could a soul speckled by sin go to heaven? How
could a sinner be saved? They were about to see. </p>

<p>Did an angel move, did a demon stir as they witnessed the
answering of the prayer? The sins of the thief (and all us
thieves!) leave him and go to Jesus. Tiny specks at first, then
large flakes, and finally layers of filth. Every evil thought.
Each vile deed. The thief's ravings. His cursings. His greed. His
sin. All now covering Jesus Christ. What nauseates God now covers
his son. </p>

<p>At the same instant, the purity of Jesus lifts and covers the
dying thief A sheet of radiance is wrapped around his soul. As
the father robed the prodigal, so now Christ robes the thief. Not
just with a clean coat but with Jesus himself &quot;Baptized into
union with him, you have all put on Christ as a garment&quot;
(Gal. 3:27 NEB). </p>

<p>The One with no sin becomes sin-filled. The one sin-filled
becomes sinless. </p>

<p>It is eternity&#146;s most bizarre exchange. Paul explained it
like this: &quot;Christ took away the curse the law put on us. He
changed places with us and put himself under that curse&quot;
(Gal- 3: I 3). </p>

<p>When he sees sin, a just God must either inflict punishment or
assume it. God chose the latter. On the cross &quot;God was in
Christ, making peace between the world and himself&quot; (2Cor-
5:19). </p>

<p>1 know John says that Jesus was carrying his own cross as he
walked up the hill, but he wasn't. He was carrying ours. The only
reason he carried the cross was for us thieves and crooks.
&quot;Christ had no sin, but God made him become sin so that in
Christ we could become right with God&quot; (2 Cor- 5:21). It
wasn't his death he died; it was ours. It wasn't his sin he
became; it was ours. </p>

<p>A beautiful illustration of this came my way, even as I was
writing this chapter. In between the composition of the two
paragraphs above, I received a call from a friend named Kenny. He
and his family had just returned from Disney World. &quot;I saw a
sight I'll never forget,&quot; he said. &quot;I want you to know
about it.&quot; </p>

<p>He and his family were inside Cinderella's castle. It was
packed with kids and parents. Suddenly all the children rushed to
one side. Had it been a boat, the castle would have tipped over.
Cinderella had entered. </p>

<p>Cinderella. The pristine princess. Kenny said she was
perfectly typecast. A gorgeous young girl with each hair in
place, flawless skin, and a beaming smile. She stood waist-deep
in a garden of kids, each wanting to touch and be touched. </p>

<p>For some reason Kenny turned and looked toward the other side
of the castle. It was now vacant except for a boy maybe seven or
eight years old. His age was hard to determine because of the
disfigurement of his body. Dwarfed in height, face deformed, he
stood watching quietly and wistfully, holding the hand of an
older brother.</p>

<p>Don't you know what he wanted? He wanted to be with the
children. He longed to be in the middle of the kids reaching for
Cinderella, calling her name. But can't you feel his fear, fear
of yet another rejection? Fear of being taunted again, mocked
again? </p>

<p>Don't you wish Cinderella would go to him? Guess what? She
did! </p>

<p>She noticed the little boy. She immediately began walking in
his direction. Politely but firmly inching through the crowd of
children, she finally broke free. She walked quickly across the
floor, knelt at eye level with the stunned little boy, and placed
a kiss on his face. </p>

<p>&quot;I thought you would appreciate the story,&quot; Kenny
told me. I did. It reminded me of the one you and I have been
studying. The names are different, but isn't the story almost the
same? Rather than a princess of Disney, we've been considering
the Prince of Peace. Rather than a boy in a castle, we've looked
at a thief on a cross. In both cases a gift was given. In both
cases love was shared. In both cases the lovely one performed a
gesture beyond words. </p>

<p>But Jesus did more than Cinderella. Oh, so much more. </p>

<p>Cinderella gave only a kiss. When she stood to leave, she took
her beauty with her. The boy was still deformed. What if
Cinderella had done what Jesus did? What if she'd assumed his
state? What if she had somehow given him her beauty and taken on
his disfigurement? </p>

<p>That's what Jesus did. </p>

<p>&quot;He took our suffering on him and felt our pain for
us.... He was wounded for the wrong we did; he was crushed for
the evil we did. The punishment, which made us well, was given to
him, and we are healed because of his wounds&quot; (Isa- 53:4-5).
</p>

<p>Make no mistake:<br>
Jesus gave more than a kiss-he gave his beauty.<br>
He paid more than a visit-he paid for our mistakes.<br>
He took more than a minute-he took away our sin.<br>
</p>

<p><b>Is it possible to know, in this life, where you will spend
eternity? In this concise and powerful book, Erwin Lutzer -
senior pastor of Moody Memorial Church in Chicago- explains why
you can know, even now, where you will be after death. He insists
that many who expect to enter heaven will discover that they were
sadly mistaken. But it is not too late for those who are still
living to choose the right path - and know it!</b></p>

<p><b>Lutzer addresses questions such as:</b></p>

<p><b>- How perfect do you have to be to get into heaven?</b></p>

<p><b>-Will the gift of salvation be taken away if you commit a
serious sin?</b></p>

<p><b>-Is it presumptuous to be sure about your eternal future?</b></p>

<p><b>No matter how much you know about the Gospel, this
compelling book will provide a radical understanding of
God&#146;s grace and power. This book is for you!</b></p>

</ul>

<p>Five minutes after you die you will either have had your first
glimpse of heaven with its euphoria and bliss or your first
genuine experience of unrelenting horror and regret. Either way,
your future will be irrevocably fixed and eternally unchangeable.</p>

<p>In those first moments, you will be more alive than you ever
have been. Vivid memories of your friends and your life on planet
earth will be mingled with a daunting anticipation of eternity.
You will have had your first direct glimpse of Christ or your
first encounter with evil as you have never known it. And it will
be too late to change your address.</p>

<p>Two contrasting scenarios come to mind. One is the
self-assured rich man who died and went to hades, where Christ
said he &quot;lifted up his eyes, being in torment&quot; (Luke
16:23). All of his faculties were intact: he could see, feel,
hear, and remember his life on earth. And even today as you read
this book, he is still fully conscious, knowing there is no way
out of his predicament.</p>

<p>The other picture is of the crucified thief to whom the dying
Christ said, &quot;Truly I say to you, today you shall be with Me
in Paradise&quot; (Luke 23:43). All of his faculties were intact
too; and today he still enjoys the presence of Christ in
Paradise.</p>

<p>Would you be surprised if I were to tell you that Christ
taught that more people were en route to agony than destined for
ecstasy? More will be in conscious anguish than in rapturous joy.</p>

<p>Is it possible for us to know in this life where we will spend
eternity? Some think not, insisting that about all we can do is
hope for the best and count on the mercy of God. After all, we
are sinners, and God is holy. There are, the argument goes, too
many unknowns, too many hidden premises, too many opinions.
&quot;Besides,&quot; said one man, &quot;I can wait to be
surprised!&quot;</p>

<p>On the other hand, it would seem strange indeed if God were to
keep us wondering, suspended somewhere between a flickering hope
and a persistent doubt. If He is our heavenly Father as Christ
taught, we would expect that such crucial information would be
revealed to us. Thanks be, it has been.</p>

<p>Many good people will join the rich man in hades, not because
they are rich but because they are good and are depending on
their own goodness to save them. For all their sincerity, they
will find themselves on the wrong side of heaven's door. Or
perhaps they are counting on the mercy of God, not knowing that
it is given only to those who meet an important requirement.</p>

<p>No doubt some surprises await all of us five minutes after we
die; but it is much better to be surprised about the
indescribable glories of heaven than the indescribable agonies of
hell.</p>

<p>Be wrong about social security; be wrong about baseball; be
wrong about your career choice; but don't be wrong about where
you will spend eternity.</p>

<p>This book will lead you on a journey. We will discover why we
can know, even now, where we will be after we have said our last
words and breathed our last breath.</p>

<p>With your Bible in one hand, and your doubts and questions in
the other, let us begin our journey.<br>

<p><b>It&#146;s almost inevitable-what we think and feel about
our parents shapes our view of God. Our childhood and even adult
relationships with our parents form our expectations of how God
will treat us. At their best, parents paint for us a limited
portrait of a loving God. The human shortcomings of all parents,
though, can distort that portrait. We form false views of God
that bring confusion. Wariness. Perhaps even deep wounds that
ravage trust. The Embrace of God shows how we can put away our
misconceptions of God and receive His warm embrace.<br>
</b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Dr. Lloyd Erickson</li>
</ul>

<p>Omnipresence. You've probably heard the word. You might even
know what it means. It's a term theologians use to describe God's
ability to be &quot;present everywhere simultaneously.&quot;</p>

<p>But what does that mean in practical terms? How does that
concept impact your daily life? In the next few chapters we will
profile this distinctive trait of Heavenly Father.</p>

<p>Please remember: Embrace is not a critique of human parenting.
We readily acknowledge that we are all imperfect parents. Rather
than inducing guilt, I hope to encourage greater understanding of
the beauty of God's character and to Promote spiritual growth.</p>

<p>As we walk together through this book, I need you to know
something. I will be sharing many experiences from my work as a
clinical psychologist. Be assured that I value my clients far too
much to compromise their privacy. Besides, I could never break
confidentiality. But these good people have taught me so much
about Heavenly Father. I need to share it with you. So I've
changed the names and nonessential details. What you will read is
the essence of what I have learned from their stories.</p>

<p>Let's take a look at the father who is too busy. (We could use
the term mother, but I will use father since that's the model
Jesus used.)</p>

<p>Too busy. This father may even be home much of the time. But
he is wrapped up in his own interests and pursuits. He's paying
the bills,adding a room on the house, bowling in the league,
drinking with the guys, browsing the Internet, working overtime
at the plant, completing a job at the office, or even doing the
work of the church.</p>

<p>You know the scene. Probably all too well! This father just
doesn't make time to truly give of himself to his sons and
daughters.</p>

<p>Recently the Smith family came to my office for an assessment
of their problems. The parents had recently married. Both brought
to this relationship children from previous marriages. This was a
family in need of blending.</p>

<p>The identified patient was the fourteen-year-old son of Mr.
Smith. Rob was acting out his frustrations. Mr. Smith made it
clear that he wanted to solve the problem with medication. You,
too, have probably dreamed of a magic pill that would make your
children behave!</p>

<p>As the assessment concluded, I told Mr. Smith in private that,
in my professional opinion, medication was not the answer. I
recommended that Mr. Smith spend some special time with Rob. Rob
seemed to need his father-especially at this time. He needed to
be assured that his father was still there for him. And I
recommended that the entire family become involved in family
therapy.</p>

<p>But Mr. Smith insisted on medication. I arranged for a
consultation with the psychiatrist on our team. She agreed that
medication would be an inappropriate treatment. So the family did
begin therapy. Unfortunately, Mr. Smith seldom came. He was busy</p>

<p>playing golf with his friends,</p>

<p>showing off his new Corvette,</p>

<p>visiting with his buddies, or</p>

<p>any of a dozen other activities.</p>

<p>This, I learned, was typical of Mr. Smith. He was seldom at
home either. This left the new Mrs. Smith caring for her children
and his children. That didn't make her very happy. It was putting
a great strain on the marriage.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Mr. Smith continued to be too busy for his
family. His most recent tactic was attempting to find a
residential treatment center for Rob. He thought if he could get
Rob out of the house-get rid of Rob-his problems would be over.
All of this in spite of the recommendations of two doctors who
clearly told Mr. Smith that what Rob needed was his father. Rob
needed to feel loved. With all the recent changes, Rob needed the
assurance that he was still important to his father. The
prognosis for this family is fair at best, because Mr. Smith
continues to be too busy for his children.</p>

<p>Were your parents ever too busy for you? Were there times when
you really needed them and they weren't there for You? Jesus
understands that situation. On at least one occasion even Joseph
and Mary were preoccupied parents.</p>

<p>You will remember the story. At age twelve, Jesus made the
annual trip to Jerusalem with his parents. As the Passover feast
progressed, Mary and Joseph got caught up in the festivities.
They worshipped at the temple. They socialized with with old
friends. They ate delicious food. They visited with family they
hadn't seen for a year. They enjoyed the break from their hard
work in Nazareth. But eventually the celebrating came to an end.
The couple started the journey home.</p>

<p>But there was a problem. In their busyness they forgot Jesus.
A day's journey toward Nazareth and they realized that Jesus
wasn't in their traveling party. Can you ' imagine their
desperate thoughts as they retraced their dusty steps? What have
we done? We were so busy that we lost our son. No, we've lost
God's Son. We've lost the Messiah!</p>

<p>For three days they were separated from Jesus. Like most
parents, Mary and Joseph were relieved to find their son. And,
like most parents, they blamed their son for getting lost.
&quot;His mother said to him, 'Son, why have you treated us like
this? Your father and I have been anxiously searching for
you&quot;' (Luke 2:48, NIV).</p>

<p>Yes, Jesus understands what it is like to have preoccupied
parents.</p>

<p>Have you ever thought that your Heavenly Father is too busy
for you? Be honest. Has that thought ever troubled you?</p>

<p>He's &quot;Chairman of the Board.&quot; He has a lot to do up
there. There are a million and one things calling for His
attention. He has an entire universe to run. He has a million
prayers to answer. And many people have more painful problems
than I do. Think of the most recent earthquake victims, the
latest war refugees, and people without shelter and food.</p>

<p>Listen, friend, to this precious truth. The relationship
between you and your Heavenly Father is unique. It&#146;s as
though there were not another person on the earth. It's as though
there were not another soul in the universe. Because He is who He
is, you don't have to share His attention with anyone. You are
His special child. That's one of the benefits of having an
omnipresent Father.</p>

<p>&quot;This is the confidence we have in approaching God: that
if we ask anything according to his We&#146;ll, he hears us. And
if we know that he hears us-whatever we ask-we know that we have
what we asked of him&quot; (1 John 5:14-15, NIV).</p>

<p>Is your Heavenly Father too busy for you? No way. Not a
chance. You may be too busy for Him, but your Heavenly Father is
never too busy for you. Look at what your Father tells you
through His Son. &quot;Lo, I am with you alway,even unto the end
of the world&quot; (Matthew 28:20, KJV).</p>

<p>Is the world still here? If you are reading this, we can
assume that it is. Then your Heavenly Father is still with you.</p>

<p>Years ago I knew a pastor in Canada named Lawton Lowe. He
loved this passage. He thought it was written especially for him.
The King James Version you just read says, &quot;Lo, I am with
you.&quot; Lawton's spelling wasn't terrific. He thought it said,
&quot;Lowe, I am with you.&quot; Isn't that beautiful?</p>

<p>A personal promise of God's presence.</p>

<p>Taking the cue from Pastor Lowe, I can hear my Heavenly Father
saying, &quot;Lloyd, I am with you always.&quot; Or, &quot;Lloyd,
I am always with you.&quot;</p>

<p>Why don't you try it? Put your name in the verse. It could
sound strange at first. But I think you'll grow to like it. Go
ahead. The message 's intended for you. just as it was intended
for Jesus' first followers. So say it. Claim it. Believe it.</p>

<p>&quot;(Your name) , I am with you. I am with you always. I am
always with you. I am with you even to the end world. Amen.&quot;
Amen!</p>

<p>You have a Father who is never too busy for you. He will
always be with you. He just told you so-personally!</p>

<h2>From Dad With Love</h2>

<p><b>Many fathers consider themselves far beyond the tragic
stories of abuse reported in the news. They would never harm or
neglect their children. But through their absence and other
subtle actions, they communicate a similar message. It doesnt
take violent outbursts to tell someone that he or she is
worthless. We can do it through silence and by withholding
compliments and praise. Often the problem stems from our
expectations.</b> </p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Chuck Aycock and Dave Veerman </li>
</ul>

<p>I (DAVE) was 18 and about to embark on a new stage of
life-college. Mom and Dad had driven me to the campus and had
helped me get settled in the dorm. The next day I would leave for
football camp. The time had come for them to leave ... for me to
be on my own. We didn't voice all of our feelings, but we knew
that things would never be the same. Mom gave me her usual warm
hug, kiss, and assurance of her love before she got in the
station wagon. I walked back around the car and, for an awkward
moment, stood alone in the street with Dad-father and son, man to
man. Then he spoke words that I win always remember: &quot;Thanks
for being a good son and for being such a good example for your
brothers and sister&quot; His eyes filled with tears; he shook my
hand; he got behind the wheel; and he drove away. </p>

<p>That experience is forever etched in my memory because of the
powerful words of affirmation and the emotion with which they
were spoken. Dad carefully guarded his feelings -- seldom had I
seen him cry. And yet he told me, with tears, that I was good. Of
course there had been many affirming words along the way-about
sports, music, even grades-but those meant the most. </p>

<p>When we affirm our children, we assure them that they are all
right, and we help build their self-esteem. Affirmation goes one
step beyond acceptance; it says, &quot;You're good!&quot; </p>

<p>Unfortunately, contemporary society is replete with examples
of neglect and abuse. Pick up today's paper-you'll find a story
or two. More and more children are growing up in homes where the
only contact with their parents is negative. </p>

<p>Typical communication includes phrases such as: &quot;You
kid-can't you do anything right?&quot; and &quot;You idiot!&quot;
Through the string of expletives, the message is heard loud and
clear: &quot;You are no good-worthless!&quot; </p>

<p>Children have become expendable, marriages are not for life
(only till -things get tough), and being married isn't fun.
Parents abuse children because they themselves were hurt and
abused. They arrived on the parental scene with no good
techniques or models, unsure how to pass on values to children
when they had not been valued. </p>

<p>In sharp contrast stands Jesus. Remember? He called the
children to him and said, &quot;Let the little children come to
me, and do not hinder them, for the kingdom of God belongs to
such as these. I tell you the truth, anyone who will not receive
the kingdom of God like a little child will never enter it&quot;
(Luke 18:16-17, NIV). </p>

<p>Jesus made children feel welcome, and he validated their
simple faith in him as Savior. Then he presented them as examples
of the only way to receive the kingdom of God. </p>

<p>EXPECTATIONS OF CHILDREN </p>

<p>Many fathers consider themselves far beyond the tragic stories
of abuse reported in the news. They would never harm or neglect
their children. But through their absence and other subtle
actions, they communicate a similar message. It doesn't take
violent outbursts to tell someone that he or she is worthless. We
can do it through silence and by withholding compliments and
praise. </p>

<p>Often the problem stems from our expectations. </p>

<p>Russell Lund amassed a family fortune through his dealings in
oil, gas, and real estate. He made his family name renowned
throughout Minneapolis and St. Paul through a chain of upscale
grocery stores. </p>

<p>With all of the affluence and success, however, Lund's only
child, Russell Jr., floundered in life. Friends said that he was
intimidated by his father's shadow and could never measure up to
his father's expectations. As a young man, Russell Jr. took no
interest in the family business. Instead, he concentrated on his
hobbies-aviation and amateur radio -- two areas where he found
acceptance and worth. </p>

<p>Although we might have expected him to act differently with
his own children, Russell continued the pattern set by his
father. He was described by those who knew him as an often
distant and unemotional husband and father. His passions in life
kept him away from his children and home, physically and
mentally. Russell Jr.'s life ended tragically-he took his own
life in a hospital room after having been accused of murdering
his estranged wife of 24 years and her boyfriend. </p>

<p>Don't you wonder how approachable Russell Lund, Sr. was to his
son growing up? Could Russell Jr.. talk to his dad? Could he
explain to his father how he felt about life? Did they spend much
time together? </p>

<p>Evidently, Russell Jr. felt as though he never could please
his dad. He always fell short of his father's expectations. </p>

<p>What do you expect of your children? Are your expectations
realistic? Remember, there's a difference between encouraging
them to do their best and holding standards that are impossible
to achieve. </p>

<p><i>Children need parents. They need to be loved. They need to
be needed. They want to know that we care enough about them to
give them some of that most precious commodity time. We all must
examine our schedules and see just how much of our undivided
attention Is dedicated to our children. There are times when we
should let nothing else, mentally or physically, come between us
and our child. It is only by spending time with our children that
we really get to know them.</i> </p>

<p><i>--William Swindell</i> </p>

<p>The highest prize in professional football is the NFL
championship-winning the Super Bowl. For most owners, coaches,
players, and fans, anything less is failure. So every year, only
those associated with one football team, the champions, feel
satisfied. The rest are losers. That's ridiculous, of course, but
it's typical for Americans in many arenas. We want to be number
one, and anything less is unacceptable. So we have pageants,
bowls, cups, Emmys, Grammys, Oscars, Neilson, Arbitron, top 40,
all-American, all-state, all-conference, honor rolls, Pulitzers,
and on and on. </p>

<p>Parents sometimes project these cultural expectations on their
kids-if they're not &quot;number one,&quot; they're failures. </p>

<p>Instead, we should let our children know that second, third,
fourth, honorable mention, and even &quot;participant&quot; are
good too, as long as they've worked hard and done their best. And
even when they haven't worked hard and they have done far less
than they should have, we should affirm them as valuable persons.
Their value is not based on their performance. </p>

<p>In the last chapter we discussed unconditional acceptance.
This is where affirmation begins. Our children must know and feel
that we love them 'just the way they are; that is, they don't
have to change or perform to earn our love. Then, secure in their
relationship with Mom and Dad, they can build their identity. </p>

<p>FEELING WANTED </p>

<p>One important part of acceptance is the feeling of being
wanted. Not only does Dad accept his son for who he is, but Dad
really wants to spend time with his boy. It's great knowing that
someone wants to be with you and will even seek you out. And it
hurts to see someone avoid you or simply tolerate you. </p>

<p>I (Dave) spend a lot of time with junior-high young people, at
church and at the local middle school through Campus Life/JV.
Often, early adolescents seem to be invisible in church. High
schoolers often have a full-time youth minister to tend to their
needs, and everyone likes working with the little kids. But
Junior highers fall in the middle they're at the awkward age
where they are growing and changing rapidly. They're just not
cute anymore. I find that they really respond to an adult who
welcomes them, who wants to spend time with them. They feel good,
all right, OK, affirmed. </p>

<p>It takes work to make sure your children have access to you
and your heart. Sometimes we seem too busy; sometimes we're not
in the mood; at other times, the kids are a pain and we'd rather
shut them out. Welcoming our children doesn't Just happen. It
takes resolve and work to move beyond good intentions. Does your
son feel like an interruption? Or does he know that you really
want to be with him? Does your daughter feel like an intruder? Or
does she see you changing your schedule to spend time with her? </p>

<p>Over the years, I (Chuck) have tried several methods for
staying approachable to my sons. Some worked and some didn't. One
of the more effective ideas helped build their sense of worth and
cost me only a quarter. When each boy turned 12, my wife and I
marked it as a special event in their lives. One part of this
rite of passage was to give the boy a quarter and a personal
pledge. As I handed him the quarter, I said, &quot;This quarter
will get you to me anytime, anywhere. My secretary has been
instructed to put you through to me whenever you call. Regardless
of the meeting I'm involved in, you can have my attention. And
I'll accept your collect call, regardless of where I am at the
time.&quot; </p>

<p>I tried to choose a memorable setting for the quarter
ceremony. For my oldest son, I chose a beach along Lake Michigan,
one of his favorite places. Over the years each son took
advantage of my offer and called about five or six times. They
accepted the trust that I gave them and used it. </p>

<p>A larger benefit that I didn't see at the time was the gift of
value and worth they received by my being accessible to them
individually at their times of need. They felt wanted. Recently
my youngest son told me how much that gift had meant to him. He
mentioned that he had told several of his classmates at the time
about the quarter his dad had just given him. But he also said
that just one week ago, he had shared the story with a friend.
Needless to say, his words brought a lump to my throat and tears
to my eyes. I didn't have the privilege of that kind of
affirmation when I was his age, and I'm grateful he has this
heritage. </p>

<p>A child feels rejected by an absent or an emotionally
inaccessible father. This inevitably breeds resentment and
hostility. Several studies point to the same conclusions: absent
fathers contribute to their child's low motivation for
achievement, inability to defer immediate gratification for later
rewards, low self-esteem, and susceptibility to group influence
and juvenile delinquency. </p>

<p>In 1981, Armand N. Nicholi of the Harvard Medical School and
Massachusetts General Hospital predicted that if the
absent-father trend continued, the quality of family life would
continue to deteriorate, producing a society with a higher
incidence of mental illness than ever before. This illness would
be characterized primarily by lack of self-control. Second,
crimes of violence would increase, including violence within the
family. The suicide rate would continue to rise, and we would
continue to witness changes in the expression of sexual impulses.
</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Dr. Nicholl's predictions were very accurate.
In every category, the results have been even worse than
expected. The future looks even more troubled if we can't reach
dads with a positive model for fathering. </p>

<p>As we discussed in chapter 4, be available to your kids. And
whether you're home or away, be approachable. Let your children
feel wanted. </p>

<p>FEELING APPRECIATED </p>

<p>Many churches use &quot;Affirmation Cards' &quot; Placed in
the pew racks or on a table in the foyer, these cards encourage
affirmation. Someone could write a thank-you note to the soloist
for her special number. Another person might express gratitude to
a Sunday school teacher for his faithful service. Someone else
might say how much he appreciated an individual for her bright
smile and positive attitude. If you've ever received a card like
that, you know how good it feels. You feel noticed, complimented,
appreciated, affirmed. </p>

<p><i>My dad God blesses us before we leave for school. Mom says
he watches us walk to the school out the window until he can't
see us anymore. She says he gets tears in his eyes almost every
time.</i> </p>

<p><i>--Third-grade student</i> </p>

<p>We're not suggesting that you send your kids cards all the
time, although at times that would be a good idea. The point is
simply that we should look for those ways; that is, we should try
to catch our kids doing things right and then tell them so!
&quot;Thanks for setting the table. It looks great!&quot; &quot;I
really appreciate the way you do your chores around the house
without being told.&quot; &quot;You have a great sense of
humor!&quot; &quot;You really feel strongly about things that
some people don't even think about. That's a gift.&quot;
&quot;You're special!&quot; </p>

<p>We can communicate our appreciation in many ways. </p>

<p>Expressing appreciation also includes how we show our
affection. Probably your kids know that you love them, especially
if you've told them. But do they think you like them? There's a
difference. Love sort of comes with the territory. Kids think,
&quot;Of course you love me. You're my dad-that's your 'job </p>

<p>We've stressed many times already that an effective way to
communicate love and &quot;like&quot; is by spending time with
our kids. But another powerful way to show affection is through
touch. According to medical studies, people who are touched
frequently tend to have fewer illnesses, recover from sickness
faster, and live longer. Babies who are given a lot of physical
affection tend to show more rapid intellectual development than
those who have been deprived. </p>

<p>&quot;Skin hunger,&quot; the lack of physical contact, has a
number of unhealthy results. Think back to the Romanian orphans
shown on TV when the Communist government in Romania was
overthrown. Their tiny bodies were ravaged by poor physical care
and hunger, but emotionally they were also malnourished because
they hadn't been touched or held. </p>

<p>Children need to be touched. In fact, some who lack physical
affection will misbehave 'just so they'll be touched through
spanking. This lesson was forcefully brought home to me (Chuck)
when Brian was eight years old. It was one of those situations in
which all the discipline tools in the kit had been used and the
only one left was spanking. One of Brian's friends had come to
the house and was waiting for him outside. After the spanking and
our time of talking through the incident, Brian went out to his
friend. Several days later, Brian told me that the subject of
spanking had come up with that friend. Jeff had said &quot;I wish
my dad would spank me.&quot; Brian had been surprised: he didn't
know there were any kids who never got spanked when they needed
it. So he had asked Jeff why he would say that. Jeff had
answered: &quot;Your dad loves you. My dad doesn't spank me even
when I do something really bad. I don't think my dad loves me
very much.&quot; </p>

<p>Other research indicates that a father's active affection
toward his children is the most important factor in shaping their
sexual identity-for both boys and girls. The affectionate father
is most likely to foster normal, heterosexual development in his
sons. The lack of appropriate and affectionate touch during youth
often leads to sexual promiscuity in adulthood. Girls with
affectionate fathers are much less likely to become boy crazy in
order to satisfy their need to be touched. </p>

<p>Guidelines for Touching </p>

<p>1. Affection should begin with your wife. Your children will
benefit from seeing you kissing, hugging, holding hands, and
touching Mom. And incidentally, mothers who give the most
affection to their children tend to be those who receive lots of
it from their husbands. </p>

<p>2. Touching is critical for infants. It's easiest at this
stage to find ways to touch: holding, rocking, playing, bathing,
and diaper changing are just a few. Be a participant, not a
spectator. Dads who refuse to change diapers miss golden
opportunities to bond with their children. Child rearing should
be a team effort by Mom and Dad from start to finish. </p>

<p>3. School-age kids enjoy physical play. Get down on the floor
and wrestle with them, or engage in a tickling spree. You could
snuggle up together to read, brush hair, give back rubs, etc.
Also, ritual affections, such as bedtime kisses and good-bye
hugs, give a sense of security to a child. </p>

<p>These suggestions may seem elementary, but many dads have no
idea of what they can and should do. A TV special sponsored by
the National Center for Fathering featured a short segment in
which a father was wrestling on the floor with three of his
children. After seeing this, a man called to say that he had
never seen a father wrestle with his kids. Then he asked if that
was acceptable behavior for today's father. The answer is yes! </p>

<p>4. Boys need affection too. Adolescents, especially boys, may
be reluctant to show or receive physical affection from Mom and
Dad, but they still need it. Usually you can be creative or work
out a compromise. For example, you might say, &quot;I need a hug
from you.&quot; Or you might agree just to touch him on the
shoulder or shake hands when in public. It is very unfortunate
that, in our culture, men are trained not to express their
feelings or to touch their children. Yet in the world of sports
we can give &quot;high fives,&quot; arms around the neck, and
hugs. Watch the celebration after a hockey or soccer goal! </p>

<p>Hugging and displaying any affection was not part of my
(Chuck's) heritage. My home broke apart through a bitter divorce
when I was a sophomore in high school. My father abandoned us,
ending what little involvement he had had in my life. Thus my
childhood did nothing positive to prepare me for fathering.
Through God's grace, a surrogate father came into my life when I
was 14, and I was able to catch a glimpse of how a father should
act toward his children. Until then I hadn't even known that
fathers gave anything to their kids-I can't remember my dad
giving me anything. I started to earn my own money in sixth
grade, and I bought my first car in ninth grade (in those days,
in Kansas, you could get a driver's license at 14). </p>

<p>Understanding my background, can you picture my reaction when
my strong-willed, 16-year-old son drove me to the airport and
then kissed and hugged me good-bye in front of everyone? I
cried-and that was something else I didn't think I was allowed to
do! This is a reward for the gifts you give that money can't buy
-- an indescribable, priceless gift from your child. </p>

<p>When Brian was a senior in college, Myrllis and I attended his
last home football game. During half-time he was to receive his
all-American football award. When his mother and I walked onto
the field, Brian hugged and kissed his mother. Then he turned and
did the same to me. I was blown away! I wept then, and I weep now
as I write these words. It is only by God's grace that my son
would give such a gift to his father. God intervened in my life
with a substitute father, and my terrific wife taught me how to
nurture our children. If I can learn to be affectionate with my
sons, you can learn to be affectionate with yours. </p>

<p>You may avoid touching your daughters for fear that it might
be improper. Sexual abuse is a reality, but most men know the
difference between a fatherly touch or embrace and a sensual one.
A daughter needs to be held, consoled, and touched by her loving
father. If you avoid touching your daughter after her twelfth or
thirteenth birthday, she might satisfy her need for touch by
being touched inappropriately in the backseat of a car. </p>

<p>Kathy is 16 and struggling with what type of boys she thinks
she wants to date. But an even bigger question for her is:
&quot;Why did my dad stop treating me like he did before I turned
13? It's like he's rejecting me because I'm growing up or
something. He even stopped hugging and kissing me good night. I
feel like I did something wrong. Maybe he doesn't like me
anymore.&quot; </p>

<p>We can affirm our children's worth by helping them feel
appreciated. </p>

<p>FEELING SIGNIFICANT </p>

<p>Children love to know that they have something to offer. When
we take them seriously, we show that we think they are valuable. </p>

<p>A number of years ago, a fellow Youth for Christ staff member
taught me (Dave) a lesson. Steve had graduated from seminary and
was leaving to take a position with a church. At his going away
party he slipped me a note that read: &quot;I will learn from you
if I think you can learn from me&quot; In a gentle way, Steve was
confronting me with my arrogance. In our relationship and
relative positions on staff, I wanted to teach him and give him
advice.Yet I was closed to his suggestions. The teaching only
went one way. The result was a lopsided relationship in which I
was not allowing Steve to feel significant. </p>

<p>Parents love to give speeches, pouring forth profound advice
by the mouthful. And we get upset if our children fall to listen
with rapt attention and follow through down to the smallest
detail. Perhaps our children would be more open to learning from
us if we were open to learning from them. </p>

<p>When we think of arguments, we often think of adolescents.
They are moving toward independence, trying out adult roles, and
throwing their weight around. And as they discover their minds
and learn how to think, they want to challenge Mom and Dad
intellectually, arguing about everything from studies to
politics. It takes patience to listen quietly to teenagers
interesting opinions. The temptation is to argue and refute them
at every point. But don't shut teens out with your eloquence or
impatience. Be open. Take them seriously. Who knows, you may even
learn something! </p>

<p>Even small children appreciate being taken seriously. Whatever
you do, don't make fun of their attempts to offer advice or a
possible solution to a problem. When I (Dave) was four years old,
I awoke my father, who was napping on the couch. At first he was
angry-until he saw the flames coming from the stove. Not all of
your children's interruptions will be that dramatic or helpful,
but listen to what they are saying. Children want to know that
they have value, that they have something to contribute. </p>

<p>Help your kids feel significant. </p>

<p><i>My dad was very busy when I was a child, but I could always
manage to get his attention. I can still see him sifting at his
desk during my preschool years. He was In the final year Of his
doctoral studies at the University of Southern California, and
the pressures were intense. Nevertheless, my brother and I took
priority. I would climb on the chair behind him and spend an hour
or two on his lap or even on his shoulders. He never seemed to
mind. Every now and then he would stop to toss me In the air or
play a game. These moments, even more than gifts and surprises,
were the way he expressed genuine love to this wide-eyed child.</i>
</p>

<p><i>Danae Dobson</i> </p>

<p>A nurturing father reaches out-is proactive in offering
affirmation or comfort. He takes the initiative in giving gifts
that last. Accepting children unconditionally lets them know that
you know they exist: &quot;I am' &quot; Affirming their worth by
helping them feel wanted, appreciated, and significant lets
children know that you know they have value. </p>

<p>&quot;I AM SOMEBODY </p>

<p>THINK IT THROUGH </p>

<p>1. When you were very young, what caused you to feel
insignificant and worthless? </p>

<p>2. What caused you to feel important and valuable? </p>

<p>3. What did your parents do to affirm you as a worthwhile
person? </p>

<p>4. In what ways do our parents' expectations for us affect how
we feel about ourselves? </p>

<p>5. How do your children know that they are wanted? </p>

<p>6. What can you do to show your children that you appreciate
them? </p>

<p>7. What can you do with or for each child in the next week to
affirm their significance? </p>

<h2>Point Man: How A Man Can Lead His Family</h2>

<p><b>Leading your family through the moral chaos of the nineties
is like leading a small patrol through enemy territory. Snipers
around the bend. Booby traps to your right. Land mines
everywhere. Take a look at the casualty list: One out of two
marriages end in divorce; sixty percent of all teens are sexually
active; every 86 seconds a teenager attempts suicide, sixty
percent of American high school seniors have used drugs. If your
family is going to make it through the jungle intact, they will
need a trained, God-appointed leader at the point. So equip
yourself for the battle. And learn how to lead your family
successfully through the hazards and ambushes the enemy has
planned.</b> </p>

    <li>By Steve Farrar</li>
</ul>

<p>A lot of rock stars die young. It seems to go with the
territory. Whether it's from a plane crash or a drug overdose, it
seems to happen frequently.</p>

<p>Still, it was especially stunning to read the newspaper on
February 4, 1983, and find that Karen Carpenter had died at the
age of thirty-two. Even more baffling was what killed her. it
wasn't a plane crash, and it wasn't a drug overdose. Karen
Carpenter died from anorexia nervosa.</p>

<p>When we heard the news, most of us said, What? It was the
first time many of us had ever heard of the sickness. Karen
Carpenter had been anorexic for years, and most of us had no idea
what the illness was. </p>

<p>Anorexia nervosa Is extreme body emaciation caused by an
emotional or psychological aversion to food and eating. The
condition occurs predominantly In young women whose body weight
may drop to half of normal. In contrast to victims of famine,
sufferers from anorexia nervosa are often able to maintain their
strength and daily activities at approximately normal levels.
They appear to be unconcerned with their undernourished state and
do not feel hungry. In laymen&#146;s terms, a young woman with
anorexia nervosa avoids food.</p>

<p>I'm convinced there Is such a thing as spiritual anorexia--and
the enemy has been incredibly successful in spreading it. In the
spiritual realm, it is not partial to women. Thousands of
Christian men have spiritual anorexia, and that is why they are
Ineffective in leading their families. What is spiritual
anorexia? Spiritual anorexia is an aversion to reading the
Scriptures.</p>

<p>We have all seen tragic pictures of children in Ethiopia. Many
of them are so weak they cannot stand up. Anorexic men are just
as weak spiritually as those children are physically. Why? They
both lack nutritious food.</p>

<p>The words of Jesus recorded In Matthew 4:4 prove the point:
&quot;Man does not live on bread alone, but on every word that
comes from the mouth of God.'</p>

<p>Observe carefully the words of Deuteronomy 32:46-47:
&quot;Take to heart all the words I have solemnly declared to you
this day, so that you may command your children to obey carefully
all the words of this law. They are not just idle words for
you--they are your life.&quot; No wonder the enemy wants to keep
us from the Scriptures.</p>

<p>C.S. Lewis wrote a wonderful little book titled The Screwtape
Letters. The book records the letters of an old and wise demon
named Screwtape to his young nephew Wormwood, a rookie at
spiritual warfare. Wormwood has been assigned to influence a
certain man away from Christianity. Lewis cleverly and humorously
describes the different methods the enemy will employ to keep us
from any kind of spiritual growth. It's a wonderful book that
contains much insight and wisdom.</p>

<p>But as Dr. Martyn Lloyd-Jones has pointed out, it has one
major defect. Lewis does not deal with the question of reading
the Word of God. The crafty old uncle gives no instruction to his
young nephew about keeping his intended victim away from the
Bible. Yet this is precisely what the enemy attempts to do. It
may be his primary goal. He will go to any extreme to keep us
from taking in Scripture. This is one of his most consistent
tactics, and he is relentless in it. He does not want us reading
God's Word. He wants us spiritually anorexic.</p>

<p>George Gallup, the famous pollster, is a committed Christian
who was recently interviewed by Leadership magazine. Leadership
asked Gallup whether any of his poll results had surprised him.
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; he answered. &quot;I'm amazed at the low
level of Bible knowledge. It's shocking to see that only 42
percent know that Jesus was the one who delivered the Sermon on
the Mount ... Are they reading the Bible?</p>

<p>From our studies, the Bible is clearly not being read.
it&#146;s revered, but not read.&quot;'</p>

<p>Gallup is describing spiritual anorexia. The vast majority of
men I know who are spiritual anorexics believe that the Bible is
inspired by God. Most of them own several translations of the
Bible, including at least one study Bible. They hold it in high
esteem, yet they rarely read it. Except at church. When they
remember to bring it.</p>

<p>When I was working on my doctorate, I asked more than a
thousand Christian men across the United States how often in an
average week they interacted with the Lord through the
Scriptures. Forty-five percent reported one time a week or less.
The majority of these men are committed Christians and attend
church more than once a week. They are not on the fringes of the
church. Most would be considered pillars of their local
congregations. Yet nearly half of them are spiritu&#31;ally
anorexic. Is It possible that nearly fifty percent of the
Christian men who are called to lead their families are
spiritually anorexic? Probably to a man they would tell you they
revere God's Word. My friend, the enemy does not mind if you
revere the Bible, just so long as you don't feed from it. He will
do whatever he can to keep you from interacting with the
Scripture.</p>

<p>For a number of years, I was a spiritual anorexic. I wasn't
growing in my Christian life, and no wonder. My intake of the
Word was hit and miss. I always meant to read the Scripture, but
somehow other things crowded out my time. I would plan on reading
Scripture just before I went to bed, but by the time I hit the
sack I was just too tired. I&#146;ll get up early and do it in
the morning, I would say to myself. But when morning came, It got
crowded out again. Day after day, week after week, month after
month, I had the best of intentions. But somehow I never got into
a consistent pattern. It took several years before I realized I
was cutting myself off from the only source of spiritual
nutrition. I had to change my priorities. As a result, I made a
personal commitment to begin each day by reading Scripture. I've
been doing this now for years. And yet every single morning, I am
tempted to skip my reading. Amazing! Allow me to describe the
situation.</p>

<p>As I come down the stairs, straight ahead of me is the front
door. I know that just outside that door Is a fresh, brand new,
hot-off-the-press newspaper. I love newspapers. I love to scan
the front page, then turn to the sports section and drink in
every word. My idea of a great vacation is to go where I can get
a copy of the Los Angeles Times (my favorite newspaper), then
spend the first hour of each day reading through Its immensity.</p>

<p>Every morning at home, as I step off the stairs, I have to
make a decision. What I want to do is open the door and pick up
the paper. What I need to do is make a left turn, go over to the
bookshelf in the family room, and get my Bible. Every single
morning, its the same dilemma! Nearly every morning of my life, I
have to make a conscious effort to read the Bible. You'd think it
would get easier the longer I make that choice. But It
doesn&#146;t, at least not for me. The temptation to do something
else Is always there. I consider my time in the Word to be a
morning briefing. Before I go out to face the day, I need to be
briefed by the Lord. The briefing serves different functions.</p>

<p>First it reminds me that there is a God who is ruling the
affairs of my life.</p>

<p>Society lives as though there is no God, and I need to be
reminded before I face the day that there Is a God who is in
control of my life and circumstances.</p>

<p>Second, I need to be reminded of what is true..</p>

<p>God's Word gives me a dose of reality. There is right and
wrong; there are consequences for making wrong choices; the Ten
Commandments are still the standard for life; I am not to repay
evil for evil; etc. My morning briefing gives a perspective that
I don't get in the world. I need God's commentary on life every
day. A Christian man in this society is swimming upstream against
the current. Without the constant nutrition of the Word, he will
soon tire and be dragged off by the sheer force of the current. A
solid education of biblical truth is no option for the family
leader. Samuel Johnson put it this way: &quot;The supreme end of
education is expert discernment in all thine power to tell the
good from the bad, the genuine from the counterfeit, and to
prefer the good and the genuine to the bad and the
counterfeit.&quot; The Bible gives me that discernment every
morning that I open its pages.</p>

<p>Third, the morning briefing reinforces my convictions.</p>

<p>It's not easy to hold onto convictions when you're in the
minority. You and I live in a society that is constantly trying
to chip away at our biblical convictions. My time in the
Scripture each morning underscores why I hold those convictions.
We are in a war for our families, and we cannot afford to
compromise the divine absolutes given us. When a soldier begins
to question his convictions about the morality of his cause, his
effectiveness vanishes. That's precisely what happened to some of
our soldiers in Vietnam. </p>

<p>As I read and ponder the Scriptures, I am forced to evaluate
my convictions. Perhaps some of them don't agree with God's Word
and need to be changed. Or maybe I've started to compromise
convictions I&#146;ve always held. As I am exposed to Scripture,
I find encouragement to stand firm in the truth and not negotiate
what the Bible clearly teaches. Each day I have to make choices
based on my convictions. That is why it is vital not to miss the
morning briefing. I need God's input to make consistently right
choices.</p>

<p>I must feed on Scripture every day, just as a soldier on the
front lines must eat K rations. I must have a steady diet of
spiritual vitamins and minerals if I am going to be in any
condition to fight. I cannot afford to be spiritually anorexic
when I've been given the responsibility to lead my family. A
malnourished man is worthless in hand-to-hand combat. Because he
has no strength, he is easy prey for the enemy. Bulimic Men.</p>

<p>As dangerous as anorexia is, something else afflicting
Christian men is even worse. It is spiritual bulimia.</p>

<p>To understand spiritual bulimia, we must take a look at the
physical variety. Dr. Raymond Vath describes it this way:
&quot;Bulimia is an Illness with recurrent, compulsive episodes
of binge eating followed by self-induced vomiting and/or purging
with laxatives.</p>

<p>This disorder, too, normally afflicts young women. But
spiritual bulimia is especially contagious to Christian men.</p>

<p>Spiritually speaking, bulimia is the inconsistent reading or
hearing of the Word without personal application. A young girl
with bulimia will binge and take In a tremendous amount of food,
only to quickly vomit, thus denying her body the nutrients it
needs.</p>

<p>The danger in the Christian life comes when I listen to a
sermon or go to a Christian seminar or listen to a series of
teaching tapes without applying the truth I hear to my life. That
is spiritual bulimia..</p>

<p>Spiritual bulimia is an aversion to applying the Scripture to
my Life. Scriptural facts may be in my mind, but I am not
integrating them into my life. I am chewing the food and
swallowing it, but only for awhile. Then I get rid of the food,
preventing digestion. Without digestion, I cannot benefit from
the nutri&#31;ents in the food. Without meditation leading to
application, there is no spiritual digestion, and I continue to
lose strength.</p>

<p>Let me explain it from a different angle. The opposite of up
is down. The opposite of happy is sad. The opposite of on is off.
Now let me ask you something. What is the opposite of ignorance?
&quot;Knowledge, you say.</p>

<p>When people come to know Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, they
are spiritual infants. They are spiritually ignorant. That's why
we put them into Sunday school classes, small group Bible
studies, hand them several good tapes, and tell them when they
can hear some good Bible teaching on the radio. Those are all
very good ideas. We do this so they can move from spiritual
ignorance to spiritual knowledge.</p>

<p>But here is where we sometimes make a critical mistake... and
plant the seeds of spiritual bulimia. As Howard Hendricks has
pointed out, In the Christian life the opposite of ignorance is
not knowledge, but obedience. God does not want to take a new
Christian and move him from ignorance to knowledge. He wants to
move him from ignorance to knowledge to obedience.. Do you
remember James 1:22? James says, 'But prove yourselves doers of
the word, and not merely hearers who delude themselves&quot;
(NASB).</p>

<p>James describes spiritual bulimia. The man who hears the Word
of God has received knowledge. But knowledge is not the goal, the
goal is to do the Word. The man must obey. It is foolish to hear
the Word without obeying it. In the Christian life, it is God's
plan to move us from ignorance to knowledge to obedience.
Obedience means that I apply His Word to my life and
circumstances. If I don't do that, then I am banging and purging.
I am eating the Word and running into some bathroom to throw up
the spiritual truth I've just heard.</p>

<p>Do you remember the two men I described earlier in this book?
The first left a well-paying professional position to take a much
smaller salary working for a Christian organization. He was the
one studying the Christian book on marriage with his secretary.
Chapter after chapter in that book identified principles from
Scripture designed to help a man grow in his love for his wife.
This guy read those chapters and got so excited that he would
tell other people to buy the book. Then he would go where no one
was watching and vomit up the scriptural truths that so excited
him.</p>

<p>The second man I described was in his early sixties, a
respected Christian leader in the community who left his wife of
forty years for a girl younger than his daughters. That man was a
spiritual bulimic. He would sit In church every Sunday and listen
carefully to make sure the sermon was doctrinally pure. Then he
would go home, vomit the Word of God, and call his girlfriend. He
knew the Word. He just didn't do it. That is spiritual bulimia.</p>

<p>Both men sought scriptural knowledge. Both appeared to have an
appetite for spiritual truth. Both had &quot;quiet times.&quot;
And both left their families. Why? Because both thought the goal
was to go from spiritual ignorance to spiritual knowledge. It
isn't. The goal is to go from ignorance to knowledge to
obedience. While they were both 'hearers' of the Word, neither
were doers. </p>

<p>You don't have to commit adultery to be spiritually bulimic. A
person has spiritual bulimia when he consistently refuses to
apply a known scriptural principle to his life. </p>

<p>Ezra was neither anorexic nor bulimic. The Scripture simply
states that, &quot;Ezra had set his heart to study the law of the
LORD, and to practice it' (Ezra 7:10, NASB). That&#146;s what it
means to be a spiritual self-starter. The man who sets his heart
to study the Scriptures does not have spiritual anorexia. The man
who desires to apply the Scriptures to his life does not have
spiritual bulimia. </p>

<p>Psalm 1 deals with the issue of spiritual anorexia. Tins first
Psalm contains two key verses pertinent to our discussion. Let's
note verse two: 'But his delight is in the law of the LORD, and
on his law be meditates day and night.' </p>

<p>Psalm 1 contrasts the righteous man with the wicked man. One
key characteristic of the righteous man is that he delights in
the law of the Lord. The phrase 'law of the Lord' Is a synonym
for the entire written revelation of God. The word law basically
means &quot;direction&quot; or &quot;instructions. </p>

<p>The righteous man is not anorexic. He delights in getting
clear direction from the Word of God, and this divine direction
gives him satisfaction. </p>

<p>The key word in this verse is &quot;meditates.&quot; Warren
Wiersbe says that meditation is to the soul what digestion is to
the body. That is, meditation is spiritual digestion. If a man is
either anorexic or bulimic, he will not meditate. And that means
he receives none of Scripture's nourishment. </p>

<p>Meditation requires reading, but It Is possible to read
without meditating. The emphasis here is to read with
understanding, to ponder the significance of what God says in His
Word. Such a man understands that the Scriptures are his source
of spiritual instruction and nutrition, chock-full of spiritual
vitamins and minerals. He knows it's his only source of spiritual
nutrition. The Bible is the meat and potatoes of our spiritual
life.</p>

<p>The Christian view of meditation Is exactly the reverse of its
Eastern rival. In the Eastern version, you empty your mind by
chanting some meaningless syllable; In the Christian practice,
you fill it with the truth of God's Word in order to ponder the
biblical ramifications for your Life.</p>

<p>Over one hundred years ago, George Mueller described the
benefits of Christian meditation. Read lengthy quote slowly and
carefully to get the full significance of Mueller&#146;s wisdom:</p>

<p>I saw more clearly than ever, that the first great and primary
business to which I ought to attend every day was to have my soul
happy in the Lord. The first thing to be concerned about was not
how much I might serve the Lord, how I might glorify the Lord;
but how I might get my soul into a happy state, and how my inner
man might be nourished... Now I saw that the most important thing
I had to do was to give myself to the reading of the Word of God
and to meditation on it, that thus my heart might be comforted,
encouraged, warned, reproved, acted; and that thus, whilst
meditating, my heart might be brought into experiential communion
with the Lord. I began, therefore, to meditate on the New
Testament, from the beginning, early in the morning ...for the
sake of obtaining food for my own soul. And yet now, since God
has taught me this point, it is as plain to me as anything, that
the first thing a child of God has to do morning by morning is to
obtain food for his inner man. </p>

<p>As the outward man is not fit for work for any length of time,
except we take food, and as this is one of the first things we do
in the morning, so it should be with the inner man ... Now what
is the food for the inner man: not prayer, but the Word of God:
and here again not the simple reading of the Word of God, so that
it only passes through our minds, just as water runs through a
pipe, but considering what we read, pondering over it, and
applying it to our hearts....</p>

<p>The antidote for spiritual anorexia and bulimia is scriptural
meditation. Meditation enables us to digest the truth of God's
Word. A superficial, quick reading of Scripture doesn't cut it.
To use Mueller&#146;s phrase, that's no different than water
running through a pipe.</p>

<p>Are you feeling overwhelmed and discouraged in your walk with
Christ? Are you defeated and spiritually ineffective? Have you
lost your excitement and enthusiasm in following hard after
Christ? Have you so given in to habitual sin that it now
threatens to sink you? Have you been duped by the enemy into
ignoring the Scripture? Has your schedule become so crowded that
you haven't picked up your Bible in weeks? As you step on the
spiritual scales, do you find yourself weighing in at less than
half of your normal weight? If so, you have been conned into
living as though you can survive without the Bible. The result is
defeat and malnourishment.</p>

<p>My friend, you cannot live without the Bible. It is your life.</p>

<p>Don't lose heart! There is a way to turn it around, but you
will not do so until you grasp several facts. To become a
spiritual self-starter, you must develop a personal plan for
spiritual growth. That's what this chapter and the next are all
about. These two chapters go together. They are a unit. I fill in
some blanks in the next chapter that I'll leave empty in this
one. So stay with me.</p>

<p>Where do you start? Let me offer several suggestions that
others have found workable. Ponder these carefully and then pick
one or more that could work well for you . Each of them has the
same objective: To give you time to interact with the Word and
therefore enjoy a nourishing intake of divine wisdom. 1. Read
through the Bible in one year.</p>

<p>Some of you may have tried this. Perhaps you started well in
Genesis, made it through Exodus, and died a slow death in
Leviticus. Several guides are available to keep this from
happening. I have been reading the Bible through every year for
several years.</p>

<p>If this is of interest to you, I recommend you get The One
Year Bible, published by Tyndale House. This work enables you to
get through the entire Bible in one year. The text is divided
into daily readings. Each day you read a section from the Old
Testament, the New Testament, and a section each from Psalms and
Proverbs. The beauty of this is that you can start on any date
and jump right into a systematized approach to the Scripture. I
highly recommend it. On the same level are The Daily Walk Bible
(Tyndale) and The Narrated Bible (Harvest House). Both are
chock-full of pertinent information that win make your daily time
in the Word extremely valuable. Any of these three Bibles will
get you through the Scripture in one year and help you to grow.
They are available at any Christian bookstore.</p>

<p>2. Listen to the Bible.</p>

<p>Some of you have unbelievable commutes. The entire Bible is
available on cassette tape from numerous companies. Guys with
long commutes can pop in a tape instead of listening to the
radio. You can stop the tape at certain points and think about
what you are hearing and how you can apply it that day at the
office or when you get home. Others can listen on their Walkmans
as they are out jogging. It would be relatively easy to get
through the entire Bible in a year just by utilizing your commute
or workout times.</p>

<p>3. Start a Scripture memory program.</p>

<p>One of the best ways to lodge the Scriptures in your mind is
the Topical Memory System; published by the Navigators. This is a
convenient set of small cards with printed verses that you can
carry in your wallet or keep on the dash of your car. it comes
with a guidebook to get you started. Thousands of men all over
the world have used this tremendous tool. It's available in any
Christian bookstore. 4. Get involved in Bible Study Fellowship.</p>

<p>This solid organization offers classes all over the country.
It features a five-year course designed to ground you in the Word
of God. Weekly assignments keep you involved in a practical study
throughout the week.</p>

<p>5. Form a small accountability group.</p>

<p>I've seen guys all over the country do this. An accountability
group is simply a small group of guys who get together either
every week or every two weeks for breakfast or lunch. It can be
two guys or five guys -- but not much more than that.</p>

<p>The purpose is simply to get together and check in with each
other. There is really no agenda other than being honest. The
discussion should center around each man giving a report on his
spiritual disciplines, his job, his family, and anything else the
other men should know about. If you had a rough time with
temptation, you should clue them in. If you are facing a personal
crisis at home or on the job, you should let them in on it and
seek their counsel and prayers.</p>

<p>Obviously, these are men that you know and trust. Everything
is confidential. The value of such a group is that it will
sharpen you as a spiritual leader of your home. &quot;As iron
sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another' (Proverbs 27:17).</p>

<p>I know a group of guys who decided to meet for breakfast just
one time to try this. Four years later, they're still meeting
every week. Find a good friend and go for it. The Benefits of
Scriptural Meditation</p>

<p>Tremendous personal benefits come from the practice of
Scriptural meditation. When you took your current job,
undoubtedly one of the things you looked at closely was the
benefit package. The benefit package of Psalm 1 is incomparable.
The package, offered to men who meditate on God's Word, is
described in verse three: 'And he will be like a tree firmly
planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in its
season, and its leaf does not wither; and in whatever he does, he
prospers&quot; (NASB).</p>

<p>'The man who meditates on the Word of God is like a mature,
magnificent tree. Such a tree is not only impressive in strength,
it's also a thing of beauty. The next time you get an
opportunity, go outside and walk around the block. Look for the
largest tree on your street, and then take a few minutes to scope
it out in detail.</p>

<p>A fully developed oak tree is a magnificent specimen of God's
creation. We are impressed with its commanding and imposing
presence. That describes precisely the man who has his roots sunk
deep into the truth of God's Word.</p>

<p>Did you know that the most critical part of a tree Is its root
system? Though many folks believe &quot;a tree's spreading
superstructure is matched by its underpinnings, in fact the two
are not mirror images; the roots may run out as far as three
times the crown ... A typical 40 foot tall tree every day takes
in 50 gallons of dissolved nutrients from the soil.</p>

<p>We can only look at the part of the tree that is above the
ground. But the amazing thing about such a tree is what is
underground. The reason such a tree is so large and impressive is
the width and breadth of its root system.</p>

<p>That's precisely the point the writer makes in Psalm 1. A man
who wants to be spiritually mature must put his roots deep in the
Word of God. Growth comes no other way. No wonder the enemy tries
to keep us from the Word.</p>

<p>I grew up in a home with an oak tree right in the middle of
the house. It wasn't a red oak, a black oak, or even a white oak.
It's the kind of oak described in Isaiah 61:3, and it's called an
oak of righteousness. I&#146;m referring to my dad.</p>

<p>Please note that I didn't call him an oak of perfection. But
in my opinion, he is an oak of righteousness. I've watched my dad
now for forty years. He has never been in full-time ministry. He
was and is a businessman. I've seen my dad weather some tough
storms. Those of you in real estate know that it tends to be
feast or famine.</p>

<p>When my dad was in his early forties, he lost everything.
Wiped out financially, he had to start all over-with three boys
ready to enter college. It's one thing to be at square one when
you're twenty-one; it's quite another when you're forty-three.</p>

<p>I watched him as he saw everything he had collapse. He went
from having assets to having nothing but liabilities. He went
from a new, spacious home to a small apartment. He literally went
from a Cadillac to a Volkswagon. He went from being near the top
of the ladder to the bottom.</p>

<p>That's hard on a man. Every day when my dad got up, misery and
disappointment were waiting for him. Most of us deal with fear of
failure, but my dad actually experienced business failure. I'm
sure he was embarrassed and humiliated. That's how I would have
felt. Some of you reading this know exactly what that feels like,
because you are currently going through similar circumstances.</p>

<p>But you should know something about this catastrophe. My dad
never stopped being an oak. Oaks can withstand storms that uproot
other trees because of their root system. That perfectly
describes my dad.</p>

<p>The great fighter Joe Louis once said, &quot;I don't like
money actually, but it quiets my nerves.&quot; But what do you do
when the money isn't there? How do you quiet your nerves when one
look at your checkbook opens the acid valve to your stomach?</p>

<p>For as long as I've known my dad, he has gotten up early. He
gets up around 5:45 to meet with the Lord. That's a standing
appointment he's kept every day for more than forty years. The
very first thing my dad does each morning is to pick up his
Bible, worn and used, its margins full of notes and its pages
frayed.</p>

<p>I can remember several times as a little boy waking up early
and going into the living room to see my dad kneeling in front of
the couch with his Bible open in front of him. While it was still
dark, he was taking in his fifty gallons of nutrients from the
soil of God's word.</p>

    <li>By Ken Canfield, Ph.D.</li>
</ul>

<p>Bob's dad was an alcoholic. Bob could count on his dad coming
home ,every Friday night to get cleaned up so he could go get
drunk. When his father wasn't drunk and tried to deal with the
real world, he often verbally abused Bob, hurling names and
epithets Bob's way; telling Bob, &quot;You can't do anything
right!&quot; and dishing out sarcasm at the dinner table. His dad
also would get physical with Bob's mother, sometimes slapping her
at the end of an argument, sometimes shoving her against a
counter.</p>

<p>One Friday evening, when Bob was ten, he climbed up into a
tree as his father left the house. Perched between two branches,
he watched his father enter their blue '55 Buick. As his dad
turned the key and began to pull away toward the liquor store,
Bob yelled, &quot;I hate you! I wish you were dead! I wish you
were dead!&quot;</p>

<p>The little boy got his wish. Two hours later, Bob's father was
in a car accident that ended his life. The last scene of Bob and
his dad together-the '55 Buick and Bob's cutting last
words-haunted Bob throughout his life.</p>

<p>Like his great-grandfather, grandfather, and father before
him, Bob too became an alcoholic. Sometimes it almost seemed as
if he were acting out a script. Eventually, Bob realized there
had to be something more to this life, and he began a pilgrimage
that led him into a deep spiritual faith. He stopped drinking.
But it wasn't until Bob began to come to terms with his childhood
that he began to finally heal in his damaged heart.</p>

<p>One night, he had a vivid dream. The same images that had
haunted him his entire life returned: sitting in a tree, looking
out over the driveway, watching his father get into the '55
Buick. But this time the event did not repeat itself. In the
strange and rapid transition of dream scenery, Bob found himself
beside the car, looking into the driver's side window. As the man
behind the wheel turned his face, Bob saw that it was not his
father. It was Jesus. Rolling down the window, he looked at Bob
and then said, &quot;Get in, Bob. It's OK. You can ride with
me.&quot;</p>

<p>That night was a turning point. The words of Jesus carried an
invitation for relationship and started the process that would
lead him to forgive his dad. For so long, Bob had been carrying
around the baggage of guilt, anger, and many other deep emotional
rags of a torn relationship. It was time to let go, accept
forgiveness, and move on. Through a long process, Bob has been
able to forgive himself and his father. By allowing himself to
grieve, he has overcome the deep pain of his childhood. The
four-generation cycle of alcoholism in his family has been
broken. Hopefully, his own children will never know the pain of
such blatant abuse and neglect.</p>

<p>As fathers, many of us need to reach a point of resolution in
our feelings toward our fathers. For Bob and David Meece (chapter
1) the issue was an alcoholic dad. Your father and you may have
struggled in a different area; yet the feelings will be similar.
Whether your feelings are anger, envy, loss, estrangement, or
even hatred, you must deal with them. Only then can you be a
healthy, strong father for your own children.</p>

<p>In the previous chapter, you learned to recognize ways in
which your father affected you for good and for bad. I asked you
to take a long and probably painful look inside, to see how you
are like your father and how you are different. I suggested that
you look at the way your father reared you to see if any patterns
emerged from your father's fathering. If you found many deficit
accounts, I asked you to accept and grieve the loss. indeed, I
asked of you a great deal.</p>

<p>Now, for many of you, I will ask of you what may seem
impossible-to attempt to resolve the relationship with your
father by extending forgiveness. I will suggest you create an
event with your father that acts as the signpost for a new
direction. Either face-to-face with him, or visiting his grave
site, or through an objective third party, express your feelings
to him, sharing with him what you've learned in the first step of
recognition. If you need to confess anything as a son, be bold
and own up to it. But more critical, if you need to forgive him
for any words or actions, be bold and extend him forgiveness. All
along, honor your father and state your commitment to a renewed
relationship with him.</p>

<p>This, I know, is a frightening step. But it is necessary. What
is the use of dredging up emotions, patterns, and psychological
and spiritual damage if we do not intend to resolve these
stirred-up feelings and wounds? It would be like walking into a
field of beehives without knowledge of the pathway out. If you
don't move on to the next step, with the goal of a new
relationship with your father, you are likely to be left feeling
stung by regret or anger. if, however, you move ahead, you can
create a landmark that will send you confidently on your way as
you father your own kids, and which will be large enough to be
visible as you pass by it going on toward the future struggles of
your children's adolescence and adulthood.</p>

<p>By resolving your feelings toward your father and hopefully
establishing some guidelines for a renewed relationship you will
finally find freedom from repeating the mistakes of your father's
fathering. </p>

<p>Those who use a compass to navigate must learn to contend with
&quot;magnetic pull.&quot; There are magnetic lines of force that
extend through the earth, but they do not converge at the North
Pole. Instead, they converge somewhere in the Arctic Circle. Your
compass takes a reading off this point. Thus a compass does not
automatically point to true north. Instead, it points to
&quot;magnetic north.&quot; If you stand precisely at a certain
longitude-from Lake Superior to Alabama's Gulf Coast-then your
compass pointing to magnetic north would also happen to be
pointing to true north. But if you go west of this line, your
compass will veer east as well as north. Similarly, if you take
your compass east of the magnetic line, the needle would point a
little toward northwest.</p>

<p>A father's power is like &quot;magnetic pull.&quot; We cannot
escape his influence on our lives, even as adults. When you were
a child, you were a map maker, trying to make sense of this
strange world. Not surprisingly, like any map maker, you sought
reference points to chart your discoveries-your parents, and, for
most boys, your father in particular. &quot;What does it mean to
be a man?&quot; you asked, and then you likely consulted your
father's model to find out, just like a hiker consults his
compass. &quot;What does it mean to go out into the world and
work a job?&quot; &quot;What does it mean to be a father?&quot;
As we saw in the first step of recognition, your father has a
great deal of pull; he has magnetic pull.</p>

<p>We cannot, and should not, deny the pull of our fathers. They
have given us direction and are important to our identities. But
for each of us, our fathers are not really true north. Your
father is a human being who falls short of the original design
for fathers. Some fathers fall far short. Absent fathers, abusive
fathers, critical fathers-they all fall far short. If you try to
take your bearings from these men, you may wind up lost in the
wilderness. The research proves that many sons of such fathers
do. For example, psychologist and author Jane Drew points out
that children of abusive fathers are at high risk of being
abusive themselves., But all fathers veer a few degrees from true
north.</p>

<p>FINDING TRUE NORTH: HOW TO ADJUST YOUR COMPASS</p>

<p>This is a pretty desperate dilemma if you are relying on your
compass to keep you from getting lost. But the wise backpacker
knows about &quot;magnetic north&quot; and makes the necessary
adjustments to find his way accurately through the woods. Good
maps tell you the degree of difference between magnetic north and
tiii@ It's compass declination, and it helps you adjust your
compass reading. For example, a topographical map of the Grand
Canyon gives a compass declination of 15 degrees east. That means
if you were hiking at the Grand Canyon and you wanted to head
north, you would find north on your compass, but then mentally
move the compass reading 15 degrees to the west. That would point
you to true north. You could then take off confidently, assured
that you will reach the campfire before dark.</p>

<p>Likewise, the step of resolution bridges the difference
between magnetic north and true north. You meet with your father
in one form or another, but then take what you've learned through
the process of resolution. In this process, you express your
feelings, confess, and (where necessary) forgive, and honor your
father. When you take these steps and make a commitment to a
renewed relationship, it's like you are adding the degrees of
compass declination to your compass reading. You have now plotted
true north-what fathering is supposed to be. Where once you had
been ordering your life according to a false reading, now you
choose a new and sure landmark, and you follow it into healing,
into confidence, into the effective fathering of your children.</p>

<p>I can hear the objections: But why do I need to go to my
father? Why can't I simply learn correct directions from other
men and wise books? Or, The guy has been dead twenty years. I
never really knew him. One struggling man in California summed up
what many feel: &quot;But I can't talk to my father-besides, what
good would it do?&quot; The answer is simple when you leave your
feelings about your father unresolved, you invite trouble.
Recognizing that your father is magnetic north and not true north
is only part of the process; you then must be able to compensate
without overreacting.</p>

<p>Tim grew up with a father who seldom let him help with a
project. If his father was driving nails, for instance, and Tim
took up a hammer and tried to drive one too, his father would
inevitably take the hammer from him, saying, &quot;No, no, you're
doing it all wrong; let me show you.&quot; Then, he would finish
the job for his son. &quot;I never felt I did anything well
enough for my father,&quot; Tim recalls bitterly As an adult, Tim
is now a consummate perfectionist. God forbid that he ever go
into the compass-making business.</p>

<p>I believe you cannot truly be a healed father until you have
resolved yourself as a son.</p>

<p>With my own father, I came to understand that our relationship
had been damaged and needed to be resolved. When I was growing up
in Wichita, my father worked as a technician for Beech Aircraft.
I never really respected what my father did for a living; he had
never completed his college education because he was too busy
paying the bills for our family of six. Later I realized he was
highly skilled and valued by the company. But in my teenage mind,
Dad was just an hourly paid factory worker.</p>

<p>In high school I began to run with a from the other side of
the tracks-the &quot;better&quot; side. I think now it
intimidated my father to see me come home in my friend's Mercedes
Benz. One day I arrived home from a long weekend with my rich
friends. Dad was eating a bowl of ice cream; I sat down at the
table, and our conversation quickly disintegrated into an
argument. Finally he said, &quot;I bet you think I'm just a dumb
factory worker.&quot; I turned to him, stared him in the eyes,
and with all my teenage insolence, I told him: &quot;That's
right, you're just a dumb factory worker.&quot;</p>

<p>He turned away And remained away.</p>

<p>Over the next two decades, I forgot the incident. Meanwhile,
changes were occurring in my life. I married my wife Dee. We had
one child, then two, then three, and four. Soon I was the father
of five children-and a concerned father, not only for my own
sake, but also for the sake of all fathers out there. Suddenly,
this man who did so little to honor his own dad had founded the
National Center for Fathering.</p>

<p>My dad never asked about what I did for a living. And although
my family (including five of his grandkids) lived just three
hours north of Wichita, Dad had only visited us twice in nine
years.</p>

<p>I asked my dad for a visit; I knew we had to talk. I needed to
resolve what I had done wrong and ask for forgiveness, as well as
express my feelings about my relationship with him. There were
far too many issues unresolved. My commitment to dealing with the
issues was the spark of the process of resolution.</p>

<p>THE PROCESS OF RESOLUTION</p>

<p>There is no one magic method for resolving your relationship
with your father. The methods are many and varied. However, I do
believe that the process will include all or parts of the
following five elements:</p>

<p>1. An exchange between the two of you</p>

<p>2. An expression of your feelings about the past</p>

<p>3. A time of confession (and restitution if needed)</p>

<p>4. A time of forgiveness (if necessary)</p>

<p>5. A commitment to a new relationship</p>

<p>For a resolution to occur, you must first open a formal
dialogue with your father; you must be ready for an honest
exchange of ideas and thoughts. The element of
&quot;exchange&quot; in my resolution was a face to-face visit
with my dad; we talked in the car. My friend Jeff flew home one
Christmas. On one slow evening, he invited his dad out for a
walk. They made it only as far as the railroad-tie fence in the
front yard before sitting down to talk. You may choose to call
your dad, swing by his house, make a pot of coffee, and talk.</p>

<p>I will grant that there are two big obstacles to arranging for
this exchange. One is fear. When Dick Goldberg, a Philadelphia
screenwriter and playwright, got married in 1970, his father took
him for a walk. His father tried to tell Dick how much he meant
to him. &quot;I changed the subject,&quot; recalls Goldberg.
&quot;I wasn't ready to hear that. I couldn&#146;t handle it.</p>

<p>Two decades later, Goldberg worked up the courage to tell his
seventy-nine-year-old father how much he admired and cared about
him. &quot;My father was moved,&quot; says Goldberg. &quot;Once
you've done it, it becomes easier. You get over the threshold of
anxiety about what the response will be. You know what it will
be: reinforcement and joy&quot;</p>

<p>Second, such an exchange for most adult men represents a deep
conversation, something they can hardly imagine with their
fathers, much less accomplish. After extensive research, author
Ralph Keyes wrote, &quot;I've discovered that many other men have
felt the same difficulty [that I have] communicating with their
fathers. There was always a stiffness in the air between us, as
if we were both guests at a party, and the host had gone off
without introducing us.</p>

<p>Yet, despite the distance, we must also be aware that we are
powerfully drawn to our fathers. Some psychoanalysts were
studying the dreams of men who were about to become fathers.
Amazingly, often the expectant father's father would appear in a
dream. This led Luis Zayas to comment: &quot;The specific
presence of the men's fathers in their dreams supports previous
psychoanalytic reports of a process of reworking, perhaps
resolution, in a man's relationship to his father as he begins to
consolidate his own paternal identity&quot;'</p>

<p>More than likely, you will have to take the initiative for
setting up a face-to-face exchange with your father. With so much
on the line, it is not wrong to hope for the best. But there are
no guarantees. Your father may not welcome such an open exchange.
You may be shut down by such remarks as, &quot;You shouldn't say
those things.... You always asked for too much.... You're just
trying to blame me for your problems.&quot;</p>

<p>During this critical exchange with your father, you must
always remember to concentrate on elements of resolution that are
under your control. Your immediate goal, remember, is to resolve
your feelings, attitudes, and actions as a son. You can
accomplish this even in the face of your father's opposition.</p>

<p>But what if your father is no longer available to meet with
you? Maybe you never knew your dad, or he refuses to see you, or
you cannot locate him, or he is deceased. Samuel Osherson, author
of Finding Our Fathers, writes, &quot;In such cases one is
deprived of the actual emotional healing that comes from reaching
common ground with one's father, hearing and seeing a new bond
forged between the generations.&quot;</p>

<p>But the process of resolution I've outlined need not always
involve a face-to-face meeting with your father. If your father
has passed away and you still feel the pain of his presence, go
to the cemetery and attempt to resolve your feelings. This forces
you to come to terms with whatever inheritance he has left you,
and provides a quiet place where you can bury the pain,
resentment, and bitterness that may have bound you.</p>

<p>An exchange can also involve an objective third party, such as
a friend, a support group, or a small group. Hugh, a big Texan
who had a statewide reputation as a cold and calculating trial
attorney, came one evening to where a group of men had gathered
to discuss the subject of fathering. Hugh was concerned about his
relationship with his three daughters. As the meeting began, we
discussed the need to resolve our feelings about our fathers.
Because it was a small group, we went around and gave each man
the opportunity to tell his story. Hugh's turn came ... and the
merciless trial attorney broke down weeping. When he began to
groan and weep uncontrollably, it made everyone, particularly
those who knew him, sit up and listen closely. Finally, he
cleared his throat. &quot;I have never told anyone my feelings
about my father,&quot; he said.</p>

<p>As the story unfolded, his father was committed to long-term
psychiatric care when Hugh was just a young child. Hugh
occasionally saw his dad but was kept from any prolonged
exposure, and soon he grew embarrassed of his mentally ill
father. Hugh's father was a diabetic, and one night after he
escaped from the hospital he died from a lack of insulin. He was
on his way home; Hugh believes it was to see him.</p>

<p>What happened the night Hugh shared his story with us was as
miraculous as his father's death was tragic. He had longed to be
resolved to his father and to be held in his arms, but it never
happened. Hugh's father died more than thirty-five years ago, but
that evening this group of men listened, affirmed, and hugged
Hugh. They listened to the things he wanted to say to his father
and helped him through the process of resolution.</p>

<p>A face-to-face exchange, of course, requires an exchange. You
must be willing to disclose your feelings, and you must know what
you need to communicate. Marvin Allen, director of the Texas
Men's Institute in San Antonio, recommends you begin the
conversation by asking, &quot;What was your childhood like,
Dad?&quot; or &quot;What was your father like?&quot; Invariably,
Allen claims, the father will describe a man much like himself.
At that point, the son has an opportunity to say, &quot;Dad, I
know how you felt, because I had a father just like that.&quot;</p>

<p>With such words, a meaningful conversation begins.</p>

<p>As you enter into the dialogue, you can choose to focus on
your grievances or your grieving. In other words, you can
emphasize your list of what your father did wrong, or you can
instead talk about how you felt about what your father did wrong.
The latter is the best approach. Focusing on your feelings allows
you to release them.</p>

<p>For most sons, their feelings have been bottled up over the
years, building enormous pressure. I suspect many men would ask,
&quot;Why in the world would I want to deal with these
emotions?&quot; It's easier just to forget we have such sloppy
things. But the fact is we can no more stop having emotions than
we can stop thinking thoughts or making decisions. Emotions are
part of who we are as human beings, even the male half of the
species.</p>

<p>Because men often have not been taught about emotions, we've
missed out on learning the great lesson that there are
appropriate, self-controlled, gracious, even masculine ways of
expressing what we feel. If we do not learn to use such ways of
expressing our emotions, I believe one or two things can occur.
First, our emotions might find inappropriate and uncontrolled
means of expression. We may turn pain into anger, and anger can
result in violent behavior, possibly even abuse toward our own
children. Or we may feel abandoned and sink like sediment into a
case of depression. A second possibility is we may allow our
emotions to collect inside us, petrify, and weigh us down like
weights around our ankles so that we can't find the freedom to
express emotions when we want to. As a father, I don't doubt that
deep inside you, you long to love and laugh with your children,
to hold them in your arms and tell them how deeply you care for
them. Some of you may not be able to freely express such
sentiments. They are trapped behind the emotions for your father.</p>

<p>When you express your feelings toward your father, you must
commit yourself to the manner in which you release them. it
should be a slow, carefully controlled release of emotion, not an
explosion. This is critical. You should seek to avoid shaming
your father with uiii,i.@ and highly charged accusations. The
entire process of seeking to build a new relationship with your
father must always be bathed in honor and respect for the office
of father.</p>

<p>The process of resolution offers us that opportunity I suggest
you verbally thank your father for what he did give you that was
good. &quot;Dad, I remember the time you drove all the way to
Kansas City just to see me play in that basketball game. You were
the only father there, and I was proud that you came. Thank you.
&quot;Dad, you were always gentle and kind with Mom. That made me
feel good and taught me a lot about how to treat my wife. Thank
you.&quot; Some of you may have to stretch to an infinite degree
to find something to thank your father for, but stretch until you
find something. Don't initiate an exchange with your dad until
you have something in mind to honor him with, even if it is,
&quot;Dad, thank you for sending that postcard, letting me know
where you were&quot; or &quot;Dad, thank you for giving me
life.&quot;</p>

<p>You have a need to honor your father. Elva McAllaster, a
retired college professor, writes, &quot;In deep subliminal ways,
we want to honor a father, admire him, respect him, be praised
and valued by him.&quot;' I have met too many men-and I was one
of them in my teenage years-who rush into a confrontation with
their fathers. They heaped on him page after page of what he did
wrong. In essence, what sons like this do is reverse roles with
their fathers. Now they are the dads, angrily lecturing their
sons who are forced to sit mutely on the edge of their beds.</p>

<p>These combative sons are not breaking cycles, they are
continuing in them-directing their emotion this time toward their
father as they might also do toward their wives, children, and
friends. Admittedly, there is a greater thrill of power in being
the prosecutor, throwing out your accusations, recommending a
sentence. But when you talk about your feelings, you give your
dad an opportunity to hear you and fulfill one of the greatest
roles of a father-that of the sympathetic listener. In a sense,
you have granted him a second chance. As he listens to you and
your pain, you paint a picture of the problem in such a way that
he does not have to solve a puzzle-as he has often done in the
past-to meet your need. Meeting your need, in this moment, is
simple: &quot;I love you and I'm proud of you, Son.&quot;</p>

<p>Now, all of this is not to say that a confrontation should not
take place, if that is precisely what is needed. But let the
facts and your emotions confront your father, and not your harsh
words.</p>

<p>Some people believe that confronting a father's behavior, or
rebuking him, is never warranted. I disagree. Honoring our
fathers means not ignoring the dishonorable as much as it means
recognizing that which is honorable. For the sake of the
relationship, we willingly engage our fathers in a discussion of
right and wrong. The apostle Paul, in a letter to his prot@g@ and
spiritual son, Timothy, tells him, &quot;Do not be harsh with or
strike at an older man, but appeal to him, and urge him as if he
were your father.&quot;' Confrontation, as long as it is done in
a gentle manner, is not only permitted but encouraged.</p>

<p>Where we have dishonored our fathers we confess that to them.
We must be careful here. Sometimes, we seek forgiveness where
none is needed. Research indicates children have a tendency to
blame themselves for their parents' divorce: &quot;If I had only
been a better kid, then Mom and Dad wouldn't be upset, and Dad
wouldn't have left.&quot; In an even greater leap of logic,
children also occasionally blame themselves for their father's
death.' If you are a fatherless child, you are not responsible
for your fatherlessness.</p>

<p>In my resolution, however, I had some genuine issues to
confess. I remember Dad and I were parked in front of my house. I
asked him if he remembered when I called him a &quot;dumb factory
worker.&quot; He stared out his side of the window and mumbled,
&quot;not really,&quot; in such a way that it was clear-yes, he
did.</p>

<p>&quot;Dad,&quot; I said, &quot;I know I caused you a lot of
pain back then. I saw it in your face. And I want you to know
that I'm sorry I did that. I'm really sorry</p>

<p>He still didn't look back at me. &quot;Oh, that's OK,&quot; he
said. &quot;That's water under the bridge. We just have to forget
about those things.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I know, Dad. But do you forgive me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well ... I guess,&quot; he muttered. &quot;Sure.&quot;</p>

<p>We talked some more, and the conversation on the subject
slowly died out. We decided to go inside. His hand went to get
the keys, his gaze fixed ahead, but then he slowly turned to me,
looked me straight in the eyes, and asked me, &quot;By the way,
what do you do?&quot;</p>

<p>I could barely answer him. This man who had never expressed
any curiosity in my vocation had just asked me what I do.</p>

<p>I was forgiven.</p>

<p>Confession is a means by which we claim ownership of the
relationship. We admit that just as our father influenced us, so
we influenced him. We, too, have done things to cause him pain.
In our exchange, we are doing more than just reconciling our
feelings; we are reconciling our actions as well. The way to
reconcile the actions of the past is to confess those actions
which harmed the relationship. One definition of the word
&quot;reconcile&quot; reads: &quot;to remove all enmity and leave
no irdpeciment to unity and peace.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>The companion of confession is forgiveness. Forgiving our
fathers is the other action under our control. Actually,
forgiveness is probably a more looming issue than confession.
Some of us carry some very deep wounds inflicted by the men who
were entrusted with our care. And I understand the outcry of
those of you who might say, &quot;Forgive him? No way! Don't you
know how badly he hurt me? I'll never forgive him for what he did
to me (or to my mother).&quot;</p>

<p>But understand that in asking you to forgive your father, I am
not asking you to condone his behavior or nonchalantly pretend
like nothing happened. Forgiveness resolutely faces the facts
(with all their pain) and then consciously decides not to hold
those actions against him.</p>

<p>Maybe your father once told you he wished he had one of the
neighbor's kids as a son instead of you. How do you react if the
pain is still great? You could send your bitterness out like a
collection agency thug to pound on your father's door and exact
payment, but what good would that do? it would probably only
force your father to barricade himself further inside his house,
away from you. When you forgive him, you move on with your life
and devote your energy to more pressing matters-like raising your
own children. You no longer demand that he give you what he has
proven he is incapable, or unwilling, to give.</p>

<p>Forgiveness is not dependent on your father's repentance or
response. In Making Peace with Your Father, David Stoop writes,
&quot;Our father may be dead. He may still pose a danger to our
well-being so that we cannot approach him for resolution. He may
simply be unwilling to resolve. This does not, however, mean we
cannot forgive him. Forgiveness is something we do on our own
initiative with or without his cooperation.&quot; And he adds,
&quot;If our aim is truly to make peace with our father and to
move on in a life of joyful wholeness, we have no choice but to
forgive him.&quot;&quot;</p>

<p>You may have to allow yourself some time to truly forgive your
father. Don't necessarily expect that in one face-to-face meeting
with your father you will be able to so quickly forgive him, as
if it was no more than turning on a light switch. Give yourself
some space, but, at the same time, commit yourself to the
discipline of forgiveness. It may take many meetings with your
dad to genuinely forgive him.</p>

<p>Expressing your feelings resolves your emotions. Confessing,
forgiving, and honoring resolves your actions. In so doing, the
door has been opened for the new relationship with your father.</p>

<p>You must commit yourself to such a direction. &quot;Dad, I
know some things have not been very good between us, but with the
years that you and I have left together, I'm going to do my part
to make things better. I'll always be your son, and you'll always
be my father.&quot;</p>

<p>Now is the time. If you have not already done so, and if you
are able, you need to speak the three words which are rarely
spoken between father and son.</p>

<p>&quot;I love you.&quot; &quot;Dad, I love you.&quot;</p>

<p>It is a landmark. Authors Robert Bly and Gordon Dalbey have
led us in thinking about rites of passage-the moment when a boy
changes into man.&quot; We recognize that there is something
substantially different between manhood and boyhood, but when
does the transition occur? As Dalbey has pointed out, American
culture, has few recognizable rites of passage, unlike African
cultures for example, where an elaborate ceremony calls a boy out
to join the men of the tribe and learn the male ways.</p>

<p>I believe there is a similar passage between sonship and
fatherhood, and that the act of resolution can act as a rite of
passage. This doesn't mean we ever stop being sons, or that a
true man wholly abandons certain boyish qualities. However, such
actions as making a woman pregnant and seeing the child come to
term do not make a man a true father.</p>

<p>A year ago, I was sitting next to a tall, lean youth on a
plane. He was a high school all-American basketball player who
was being flown in for a college recruiting effort. I told him
what I did at the National Center for Fathering, which got us
talking about his fatherless childhood, as well as his young
friends who already had children. &quot;Anyone can make a
baby,&quot; this young man told me, &quot;but it takes a man to
be a father.&quot; This African-American athlete expressed wisdom
beyond his years. We live in a nation of male baby-makers; how
many fathers do we really have?</p>

<p>Resolution can be an event which serves as a rite of passage
between sonship and fatherhood. Essentially you tell your father,
&quot;Dad, up until now my energies and my emotions have been
spent following you, even attempting to please you. Who I've been
and what I've done have been because I am your son. But now, I
have children of my own and I must take those energies and
emotions and devote them to their lives.&quot;</p>

<p>As a result of resolving your feelings, you achieve a degree
of closure on your sonship. You have grasped the baton; the next
leg of the race is yours to run.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><b>Families Where Grace Is In
Place</b></font></p>

<p><b>Getting free from the burden of pressuring, controlling and
manipulating your spouse and children</b></p>

<p><b>When people spend their lives trying to transform or fix
their spouses and their kids, the natural result is exhaustion,
depression and the hopeless sense of wanting to bail out of it
all. Here&#146;s a message about how God&#146;s grace can
transform relationships within a marriage and family. The first
step is learning the simple difference between God&#146;s job and
ours. God&#146;s part is to fix and change. Our responsibility is
to depend on the holy Spirit, serve our families and to help
equip them to be all they can be. The Christian family&#146;s
ultimate goals of harmony, obedience and full potential can be
arrived at without using legalistic and manipulative methods. No
wonder Bill Hybels called it, &quot;The single best book on the
family that I&#146;ve read in recent years.&quot;</b></p>

</ul>

<p>Mark was one of the most dedicated Christian men I'd ever met.
In the community, he had a sterling reputation as a business and
civic leader; in his church, he was a hardworking deacon and an
excellent Sunday school teacher. In large part, his apparent
success at everything he put his hand to came from a &quot;can
do&quot; attitude. He often sacrificed his own comfort and needs
to help someone else or to work for some higher goal. When
problems came up for his wife and kids, Mark directed them to
what he always did: &quot;Quit complaining-when you focus on a
problem, you become a problem. Just do the right thing. It
doesn't matter whether you like it or not. The kingdom of God is
not a democracy.&quot;</p>

<p>One day, reality gave Mark an alarming wakeup call. His wife,
Karin, began to suffer symptoms of a breakdown and checked
herself into a local health clinic. Mark received the emergency
call at work. He rushed to her bedside and, holding her hand,
tried to offer comfort. &quot;You can lick this, hon. I don't
know what's happening here, but if you'll just call on the
Lord&quot;</p>

<p>Karin exploded. &quot;Look at me, Mark! Look at me. Do you see
what's happening to me? Have you ever really seen me or what I
need? Do you really know the kids, or what they need? I
didn&#146;t marry you to have an 'answer man.' And if you tell me
one more time, 'Just pray about it,' I'll go over the edge. Stop
giving us your mechanical answers, and love us.&quot; Tears of
frustration that had been building for years-finally choked off
her plea.</p>

<p>Two of their three children had come to the clinic with Karin.
Their eyes, full of tears, met his-and all Mark could see,
suddenly, belatedly, was the depth of pain they carried, pain
he'd stifled in them. All he could hear in his mind were the
years of Christian principles he'd cited to his family-the
standards Christians were supposed to live up to in order to be
good Christians. Had he been wrong somehow, even while he was
speaking the &quot;right&quot; words? On the other hand, maybe
this was just some kind of spiritual attack.</p>

<p>Mark's twelve-year-old daughter was sobbing too hard to speak.
But his teenaged son looked him in the eye and, in the most
impassioned voice Mark had ever heard, pleaded with him.
&quot;Dad, we love you. But you make us feel like we're never
going to be good enough. Please listen to what Mom's saying. Help
her!&quot;</p>

<p>As Mark later told me, his sorts plea led him to a watershed
decision: Once they got Karin through this crisis, he had to
reexamine the way he was living his Christian life. He still
believed with all his heart that the Bible was true-but there was
something missing in the way he'd been taught to apply biblical
principles. As he said when he called to set up the appointment,
&quot;It's like I learned the letter of the law, but the Spirit
is missing. I thought that only happened in Old Testament
lives-but I think I've been a pretty legalistic New Testament
Christian. I dorft know how it happened. What am I missing?&quot;</p>

<p>The more I got to know Mark, the more I could understand his
confusion. He was a good father and husband in many senses of the
word. Above all, he loved Karin and the kids. He wanted them to
learn Christian-living principles because he loved God and
believed that Christianity is the best thing going.</p>

<p>Eventually, both he and Karin came to understand the major
source of the relationship breakdown had occurred long before it
showed up in KarirYs physical and emotional collapse. Even though
Karin had become a consummate pretender, nevertheless she was
more often aware of relationship stress, and more likely to
experience actual physical and emotional symptoms when pain and
needs were ignored. Because Mark really is a compassionate man,
he was willing to listen deeply to Karirfs heart needs for the
first time so he could understand where he'd taken a wrong turn
in the path.</p>

<p>And because of his willing-to-learn attitude, this is the
conclusion he himself voiced after not too many sessions: &quot;I
always thought I was doing the loving and right thing by
directing my family just to act on godly principles. I thought
that doing and obedience were the simple answers to all our needs
and problems. I just didn't see that I was making them perform
right on the outside, while inside their hearts were still aching
for some real compassion. if I'd given them the compassion
first-as a foundation to stand on they would have had more real
power inside. I was really blind to the fact that I was just
making them work real hard, without giving them emotional and
spiritual fuel to get them through a day. Man, I really blew
it.&quot;</p>

<p>Mark is only one of countless Christian men and women who have
been taught by churches and seminar leaders that spiritual life
results from performing according to certain principles. He had
been taught to gauge spiritual success by outward performance
standards, and had not been shown the internal steps that lead to
real, from-the-heart-out empowerment and transformation. He had
not been shown how to live.</p>

<p>As a result, Mark thought that unsolved problems were proof he
had failed as a Christian man, father, and husband. Whenever his
wife and children sent out signals that communicated, &quot;I
can't do it,&quot; or &quot;I need help,&quot; he believed that
his job as &quot;the family problem solver&quot; was to find the
right action for them to take to resolve the problem and
encourage them to work hard at it. It is little wonder that many
men like Mark, and especially their families, feel as though they
are on an endless performance-treadmill, with no rest in sight.
Little wonder that so many Christians, in working harder to reach
a solution, burn themselves out and, like Karin, nearly go over
the edge.</p>

<p>Certainly, not every Christian who wants to grow in their
commitment will wind up like Mark and Karin. In no way do I mean
to suggest that. But when will we all wake up to the message:
Solutions should build us up, not wear us out. And if our
solutions are killing us, maybe it's time to change course.</p>

<p>Three Cursefull Courses</p>

<p>On a fundamental level, most of us wrongly believe that we
must work harder to overcome problems. And when problems
continue, our answer is much like Mark's: &quot;Work
harder.&quot; But what happens when all our hard work fails?</p>

<p>There are several courses of action people choose in order to
avoid the shaming admission that their self-effort is inadequate.
In this chapter, we will focus on the various well-intended, but
curse-full courses of action a man or woman might choose to
follow in trying to make his/her marriage work. Unfortunately,
avoiding deeper issues or trying harder, which many Christian
couples do, actually causes them to wait far too long to ask for
help. In other words, choosing one of these alternatives
postpones the solution.</p>

<p>1.Denying the Problem</p>

<p>If you are married, how long had you lived with your spouse
before realizing that your relationship wasn't working out the
way you'd thought it would? Most people who come to me for
counseling reply, &quot;Six months.&quot; It is significant to
note that this tends to be the answer of people who have been
married a year, five years, ten years, or forty years. How have
they managed to get by, then, for the balance of the time when
their relationship was in a state of breakdown?</p>

<p>The first alternative most of us choose is to deny the
presence of the problem. Why do we do this? I'd like to suggest
it is because most of us feel it is our job to keep each other
happy by means of our good behavior, whether or not our partner
gives us the real love and acceptance we need. We refuse to
confront an issue because we might hurt the person or make him
mad. We don't realize this is a sad effort to control the
behavior or feelings of others. Depending on how long we can keep
up the facade, the easiest way to maintain our false sense of
peace is to deny the presence of a problem. This means we live in
fundamental dishonesty, because untrue things are being said, and
the true things, which need to be said, are treated as taboo.</p>

<p>So many complicating factors are at work here. Any time one
partner in a marriage, for instance, sees a problem, denial
trains them to say, inwardly: I must be imagining it altogether.
My &quot;radar&quot; must be defective. Or they say, There must
be something about me that caused the problem in the first place.
Or, what would people think? Consequently, they will choose not
to confront the issue. Of course, the problem is perpetuated.
This relationship is held together on the basis of what is not
said: This is denial.</p>

<p>Consider Danine, who I introduced earlier, and who thought it
was her Christian duty to keep her husband, Rick, going to
church. The truth was this: Rick didn't really want to go to
church. He didrf t want to go to the Friday night Bible study. In
fact, he didrft really care about God at all. But Danine thought
it was her job to get him to care. She had tried, she was tired,
and she wanted me to help her do her job. What follows is the
rest of our conversation:</p>

<p>JEFF- Instead of going through two days of hinting, plotting,
and bugging, why don't you simply inform Rick, in time for him to
get ready, that you'll be leaving for church?</p>

<p>DANINE.- What if he doesn&#146;t get ready?</p>

<p>JEFF.- Then go without him.</p>

<p>DANINE.- Well, what should I tell everyone who asks where he
is?</p>

<p>JEFF, What have you been telling them so far?</p>

<p>DANINE- That he's sick, or out of town. Or anything I can
think of.</p>

<p>JEFF, Why don&#146;t you tell them the truth?</p>

<p>DANINE.- What-that Rick would rather stay home and watch
professional wrestling?</p>

<p>JEFF.- Is that the truth?</p>

<p>DANINE.- Yes. That or cartoons!</p>

<p>JEFF.- Well, tell them that.</p>

<p>DANINE, But if I told them that, what would people think?</p>

<p>JEFF.- People would think what is true that Rick cares more
about professional wrestling than church.</p>

<p>DANINE., But how would that look?</p>

<p>JEFF' It would look like Rick cares about church as little as
he really does....</p>

<p>Danine had been living this way for many years, and doing so
in order to control people's opinion of her husband. And, I
think, to control their opinion of her, as well. She was doing it
out of a false understanding of submission, which she had learned
from church leaders who told her that performance, not inner
heart transformation, is what the Christian life is all about. By
taking on responsibility for other people's perception of Rick's
behavior, she was helping Rick stay home-the exact opposite of
what she wished would happen. This is not true submission. True
submission is empowering or transforming. This is called lying.</p>

<p>I have heard painful reports from many people who force
themselves to visit their families for the holidays. The reason
it takes such a gargantuan effort for many people to visit their
parents, siblings, or other family members is because it's very
painful to be with them. Many people find themselves belittled,
corrected, told what terrible parents they are, or find
themselves on the losing end of comparisons.</p>

<p>I often ask, &quot;Why dorf t you talk to your family about
how hurtful their behavior is?&quot; Here is a sampling of the
replies:</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want the relationship to be strained.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That wouldn't be nice.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That wouldn't be honoring to my parents.&quot;</p>

<p>And in response I want to say: &quot;The relationships are
already strained. Is it nicer to come up with new lies each year
about why you can't visit? Is it somehow evil or unchristian
simply to tell the truth, and then try to build the relationship.
Do you think that treating other adult family members like babies
who are not capable of handling the truth is what honoring means?
Many people do!&quot;</p>

<p>Ephesians 4:25 says, &quot;Laying aside falsehood, speak
truth.&quot; Yet, how many Christians refuse to speak the truth
about hard or unpleasant issues in order to keep up a facade of
peace, only to sacrifice true peace on the inside. One unhappy
day they wake up and realize that there was never real peace on
the outside either. A lot of people sacrifice their integrity and
try to tiptoe around difficult family members, attempting to
protect a &quot;closeness&quot; with them that doesn't even
exist. No wonder people are tired.</p>

<p>2. Fixing the Other Person</p>

<p>The second alternative you might choose is to try to
&quot;fix&quot; the behavior of your spouse. The fact that your
peace and well-being depends on your spouse's performance leads
us to an interesting point-one you may never have considered: If
your peace and happiness depends on your spouse, then that person
has become a false god to you. When your spouse is not performing
up to your expectations, do you believe it is your job to fix
his/her behavior? Then you will always live in a rut: You will
always be working hard to restore your spouse to a level of
&quot;right&quot; behavior, or lose all sense of calm and
closeness. But the truth is, the &quot;peace&quot; is only
external, and only temporary. The relationship feels like a
rollercoaster ride, with its highs coming from your self-effort
and the other person's effort.</p>

<p>With the help of a diagram begun in the previous chapter, I
want to show the dynamics of how a relationship functions when
one member tries to fix the other person.</p>

<p>The first situation that can occur, when you depend on your
spouse, is triggered when your spouse simply lacks those traits
you desire. It means that your spouse is inadequate in your view.
No one wants to believe their source of well-being is inadequate.
Therefore, you respond by exerting some kind of pressure, hoping
to cause your spouse to perform. You wrongly assume that this
will meet your needs.</p>

<p>Notice how this works in the following examples.</p>

<p>YOU: Why don't you talk to me? We never just sit and talk
about things. You talk to your friends and family. Why don't you
talk to me?</p>

<p>SPOUSE: All right. Let's talk. What do you want to talk about?
Pick a subject.</p>

<p>YOU': Well, I shouldn't have to ask. Why do I have to make a
big deal just to get you to talk to me? Before we were married we
used to talk all of the time. Now, I can barely get a yes or no
answer out of you.</p>

<p>SPOUSE: See! When I don't talk to you I'm in trouble, and when
I offer to talk to you I'm in trouble. Nothing I do pleases you.</p>

<p>Should people who are married spend time communicating with
each other? Absolutely. But this scenario is not really about
communicating. It's about meeting the needs of intimacy and
attention. But more than that, it's about expectations.</p>

<p>The third scenario that often occurs in a marriage is that a
man or woman attempts to fix him/herself in the hope of changing
his/ her spouse. Very simply put, we sometimes tell ourselves: If
I get myself straightened out then he/she will change.</p>

<p>The primary example of this is the kind of false submission
that is too often encouraged by many Christian pastors, teachers,
and seminar leaders. We will consider the characteristics of true
submission later. Too often we are taught to go along with
something outwardly, while inwardly we strongly disagree. This is
not submission. It is pretending.</p>

<p>John, for example, set his sights on buying a new little
electric motor for his small fishing boat. Andrea wasrft really
happy with John's idea. Early in their marriage, they'd had some
loud arguments about money that made Andrea feel very
uncomfortable, a feeling she really didryt like at all. She had
learned, however, that a different tactic brought about the
result she wanted: \Vhen John talked about the motor he wanted to
buy, Andrea simply said nothing at all. It was not exactly that
she gave John the silent treatment, but there was enough coolness
that John read her silent message: I don't want you to buy the
motor. Go ahead and buy it if you want to, but I won't be happy
if you do. John and Andrea's pastor had recently taught about the
husband's need to love and serve his wife and family. After
picking up enough chilly signals, John thought about what his
pastor had said, and decided that the best and most loving thing
to do was to drop the idea of buying the motor for his fishing
boat and not bring it up again. John hated it when Andrea went
silent on him. It made him feel unmanly in some way.</p>

<p>Is this an example of submitting to your spouse in love? No.
Andrea's silence was not submission. And John did not want to
submit himself to the discomfort of honest dialogue, which might
have led to true consensus. He wanted outward peace with Andrea
at any price. With this approach, John would never come to
understand Andrea's hopes or fears at a deep level, and never
deal honestly with the resentment he came to feel whenever he
felt his plans were stifled. This is not a one-flesh marriage; it
is a win-lose relationship.</p>

<p>Saralyn's difficulties with Bruce ran along similar lines.
After two years of marriage, she found that most of the major
responsibilities fell to her, including seeing that bills were
paid on time, that their cars were serviced regularly, that
child-training matters were dealt with.</p>

<p>Bruce was a deacon in their church and led an adult Bible
study, so most of their friends complimented him on what a
wonderful, dedicated Christian husband and father he was-though
nothing was further from the truth. When it came to his family,
Bruce was actually quite irresponsible. He often forgot to pay
bills because he preferred to spend his evenings glued to the
television. Rather than taking a truly active role in guiding and
training their three children, an angry shout was supposed to
change their misbehavior.</p>

<p>\Vhen Saralyn periodically wore herself out carrying all the
weight Bruce refused to pick up, she would try to raise whatever
issue was weighing her down the most. Bruce would explode and
accuse her of being critical. If she persisted, pleading with him
to take on more of the load, he would sometimes get so enraged
that he slammed the wall with his fist-and then resorted to the
one &quot;knock-out punch&quot; that always worked: &quot;You're
pushing me-and that proves what the real problem is here. You've
got a controlling, rebellious spirit.&quot; Then he would quote
and misquote scriptures at her, until she was Bible-beaten into
her place again.</p>

<p>When Saralyn came to see me, it was little wonder she was on
the verge of an emotional collapse. She had a washed-out,
hopeless look in her eyes. She was sure that she was a terrible
Christian because, try as she might to &quot;submit&quot; to
Bruce, her heart kept telling her something was missing from his
concept of what a Christian marriage should be. Her submission
was not from the heart or the spirit-it was a knuckling under, a
fear of Bruce's uncontrolled, childish anger. Their pastor was
commending Bruce for keeping his home in order, based on the
superficial signs he saw in public. Saralyn was seeing things as
they really were, and suffering with the sad discrepancy. This,
as I say, is not submission; it is keeping peace merely to avoid
a &quot;spiritual wife-beating.&quot;</p>

<p>When anyone &quot;submits&quot; outwardly in order to escape
fear, ease guilt, or to &quot;prove&quot; their spirituality,
there is no real submission. True submission releases us from
fear, helps us face and change behaviors that make us guilt7y,
and causes us to grow stronger in spirit. Accept no substitutes.</p>

<p>The Serious Matter of False Submission</p>

<p>Because false submission is such a widespread problem, eroding
otherwise good Christian marriages, I want to address it in a
little more detail. Let's examine it by walking through another
real life counseling situation.</p>

<p>Not long ago, a couple came to me for counseling. Their
relationship hadn't worked for five and a half of the six years
they had been married. The wife, Chris, recited incident after
incident of how Carl made decisions regardless of what she
thought. For a long time she had pretended to agree, thinking
this would soften his heart. (Notice the attempt at
&quot;fixing&quot; going on here.) Carl wasn't changing though,
and Chris felt she had lost her own integrity, as well. If she
ever hinted that she didn't like his decision, Carl began to
complain mercilessly about her to everyone, until she was simply
worn out. Now she harbored resentment that was deeply embeded,
and it was beginning to spill into other areas of their
relationship.</p>

<p>After almost twenty minutes of listening to Chris's
explanation, Carl folded his arms across his chest and asked me,
&quot;What do you think it means when the Bible says that the
wife is supposed to be subject to the husband?&quot; (Further on,
I'll tell you what I told Carl.)</p>

<p>My purpose now is to cement this concept in your mind: Chris,
like a lot of other Christian wives, really did care about doing
what the Scriptures said. But because of the power manipulations
of this very unchristlike husband, she fell into the trap of
playing a &quot;peace at-any-price&quot; game.</p>

<p>Need I say it again? This is not submission; nor is it
spiritual husbandry in the humility of Christ. Simply put, if
you've got to demand or force submission, or pretend it, you do
not know what it is.</p>

<p>Conclusion: This Doesn't Work</p>

<p>The reason these various &quot;try-hard&quot; solutions can't
possibly work is that no man or woman is powerful enough to
provide life and value to their spouse. Spouses weren't created
by God to &quot;fix&quot; Spouses. Jesus was given to provide
life and value to each one of us.</p>

<p>Isn't this all rather theological sounding? Yes it is, but it
leads to the reasons why, on a very practical level, the
relationships I have described simply cannot work: A relationship
in which performance is demanded or expected is a no-win
situation for both parties.</p>

<p>Can you think of a time when you knew that the only reason
someone did, a certain thing for you was because you pressured
them until they gave in? Didn't it seem empty? Or perhaps you are
the one who gives in under pressure. In either case, the action
is just a pacification, a compromise, and you know it.</p>

<p>When a relationship devolves into a win-lose exercise, it will
eventually wear out. Love will evaporate, and hearts and minds
will turn to various forms of escape. This is a serious
matter-whether the marriage remains outwardly intact or ends in
divorce-and it is the topic of the next chapter.</p>

<h2>Before The Ring</h2>

<p><br>
<b>Impatient people grab a good dater and head for the alter.
They believe the proverb that saysHe who hesitates is lost. When
they find someone they like, they don&#146;t want to risk losing
him or her. This is not a good proverb to follow when considering
marriage. </b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By William L. Coleman</li>
</ul>

<p>How do you know when infatuation is growing into love? How can
you tell if the early excitement you feel will develop into
caring and genuine love? One of the sure signs of love is an
increasing patience with each other. </p>

<p>Patience isn't one of the characteristics we ordinarily think
of when we discuss young love. Phrases like
&quot;impetuous,&quot; &quot;can't wait,&quot; or &quot;love at
first sight&quot; are the ones that come to mind when we hear
about a young couple considering marriage. It's almost as if
there is a law that says true love is impatient. </p>

<p>Not so. Genuine love is characterized by patience. </p>

<p>If love is real, it has time to slow down and examine itself.
Love takes time to ask what is best for each person involved, not
just today but in the future as well. If you are in too much of a
hurry what you feel is probably another four-letter word that
begins with L. Lust. And a relationship fueled by lust will last
about as long as a piece of dynamite with a lit fuse. </p>

<p>Patience is one of the primary evidences we have that, given
the right fuel, a relationship can last a long time.</p>

<p>Before you consider engagement, determine whether either of
you has a problem with impatience and consider where that problem
will lead you one, two, or five years from now. The lack of
patience is evidenced by the following: </p>

<ul>
    <li>One pushes to do things the other doesn't want to do. </li>
    <li>One is accelerating your physical relationship faster
        than the other is comfortable with. </li>
    <li>One demands the other to make decisions immediately. </li>
    <li>One establishes the timetable and the other must follow. </li>
    <li>One is under pressure a great deal of the time. </li>
    <li>One Of you wants the relationship to be more spontaneous.
    </li>
    <li>One of you is expected to be available whenever the other
        calls. </li>
</ul>

<p>How many of those seven traits are true in your relationship?
What percentage of the time are they true? Let's consider the
subject from another angle. Check this list to see how patient
your partner is. </p>

<p>Does he or she remain unperturbed when you want to spend the
evening alone or with other friends?<br>
Does he or she ever tell you to take your time making up your
mind?<br>
Does he or she ever say, &quot;We won't do anything about this
until you are ready&quot;?<br>
Is he or she willing to delay marriage until you receive the
approval of family?<br>
Does he or she usually give you ample warning before you go
someplace together?<br>
These signs of thoughtfulness indicate that you are dealing with
a patient person.<br>
Immediate satisfaction vs. long-range satisfaction </p>

<p>Before sealing your pledge with an engagement ring, ask if you
are sacrificing the future in your haste to grab the present
moment. Many couples that enjoy a great first six months of
marriage spend the next six years in agony. </p>

<p>The Bible shares some excellent wisdom: </p>

<p>To establish a relationship that will improve over time it
must have a solid foundation from the beginning. Some people
excel at dating and superficial relationships. They enjoy
partying, socializing, flirting, giving presents, making small
talk, and joking around. </p>

<p>The same people may have serious trouble handling conflict and
may run from any situation that requires honest reflection and
interaction. </p>

<p>Impatient people grab a good dater and head for the altar.
They believe the proverb that says &quot;He who hesitates is
lost.&quot; When they find someone they like, they don't want to
risk losing him or her. This is not a good proverb to follow when
considering marriage. A better one is, &quot;Patience is the key
of joy, but haste is the key of sorrow.&quot; Marriages that
begin with fireworks may end up as scattered ashes. </p>

<p>If you've ever tried to build a campfire, you know the
importance of seasoned wood. Green wood (or recently cut wood)
does not burn well. It makes a lot of smoke, but never a roaring
fire. Seasoned wood, on the other hand, makes a terrific fire. </p>

<p>The same is true of relationships. &quot;Green&quot;
relationships do not burn well because they haven't been
seasoned. They create a lot of smoke, making couples believe
there's a fire, but there's not. Only time and experience can
season a relationship. </p>

<p>How much time does it take to establish a good relationship?
Who can say? Only the people involved can know. No one can tell
you how long it takes to get to know each other. </p>

<p>Patience and the quality of a relationship </p>

<p>Patience involves far more than waiting to set the wedding
date. Over the years patience will have a great deal to do with
the fiber of your relationship. </p>

<p>&quot;When Don wants an answer, he wants it right now,&quot;
Gail grumbled. &quot;He may have thought about his plan for days,
certainly for hours; but when he pops it on me, I have ten
minutes to make up my mind. And I had better agree with his plan,
I can tell you that.&quot; </p>

<p>People who are impatient create panic in the people around
them. They're like a fire alarm. When they have the spark of an
idea, their sirens blare, urgently insisting that everyone get
moving immediately. </p>

<p>Urgent personalities keep everyone in an uproar. They are
difficult people to live with because they expect everyone else
to share their concept of time. They do not allow others the
privilege of thinking things over. </p>

<p>Patient people are less likely to cause panic. They smooth
troubled waters by respecting the people they love. </p>

<p>The Scriptures say, &quot;A patient man calms a quarrel&quot;
(Proverbs 15:8). </p>

<p>Good life partners make their spouses part of the program.
They don't callously dump their own personal goals on another.
Patient people take time to plan their vacations together. They
encourage each other to think things over and to contribute
personal feelings, hopes, and convictions to the discussion.
Impatient partners steam roll their mates. </p>

<p>Impatience creates anger, resentment, and bitterness. You can
count on it. Impatience is a form of contempt and eventually the
beleaguered partner perceives it as exactly that. </p>

<p>&quot;If Rod had let me learn to fish at my own speed,&quot;
Barb said with frustration, &quot;I would probably still be going
to the lake with him. But he wanted me to do everything right now
and do it correctly. I baited the hook wrong. I held the line too
tight. When I didn't catch anything, he made fun of me. So I
don't go anymore.&quot; </p>

<p>Patient with self </p>

<p>While you are getting to know each other, make a few mental
notes about how you each treat yourselves. Are you both patient
or do you mercilessly berate yourselves when you make a mistake? </p>

<p>People who have no patience with themselves probably lack
patience with others. And if they demand perfection from
themselves, they will expect it from their mates and offspring.
This can cause tremendous grief. </p>

<p>Patience is one of the fruits of the Spirit (see Galatians
5:22), and the good news is that God will help us gain patience
if we want it. </p>

<p>When we allow Jesus Christ to control us, He dramatically
alters our values. Incidents that formerly caused us to fly off
the handle no longer get such an explosive reaction. God helps us
appreciate what is really important in life and relationships. </p>

<p>Don't sit around and think about patience. Discuss it. Explain
to each other what makes you impatient and ask for help to
improve. Encourage each other to share experiences. Of what are
you most tolerant and what makes you edgy and nervous? How can
you help each other? </p>

<p>Patience isn't like height -- something you either have or
don't have. You can learn patience, improve it as a skill, and
create a stronger relationship. </p>

<p>GETTING TO KNOW YOU... </p>

<p>1. How would you describe your level of patience?<br>
How would you describe the patience of the person you care about?<br>
2. How can you begin to change if necessary?<br>
What can you do to help yourself concentrate more on long-range
satisfaction and less on immediate gratification? </p>

<h2>Secret Choices</h2>

<p><b>Life is a series of choices, most of them so small we
scarcely realize that we're making them. Or why. Sometimes we
call them &quot;reactions&quot; and disclaim responsibility for
them, not recognizing that reactions are choices, too. We seldom
give thought to where these small, secret choices are taking us
and whether or not we want to go there. Though our choices are
small when counted one at a time, their cumulative effect is more
powerful than we can imagine. In reality, these private choices
direct our steps, determine our behavior, change the quality of
our relationships and in the end, shape our lives. Where are your
choices taking you? Or more specifically, are your secret choices
moving you in a positive direction toward a successful marriage? </b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Ed Wheat, M.D. and Gloria Okes Perkin</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;This ... my lover, this my friend&quot; (Song of Songs
5:16). We have another crucial question for you: What kind of
emotional climate are you creating with your secret choices? Is
it an environment of love, nurturing, and intimacy? Or, distance,
neglect.... indifference? </p>

<p>Your first reaction may be to opt for a gray area somewhere in
between. Couples sometimes answer, &quot;Well, we're not doing
all that great, but we're not doing so bad either. On a scale of
one to ten, give us a five. </p>

<p>The truth is, you are continuing to move in one direction or
the other, and at some point, however subtle the change, the
scales will clearly shift to show what has been happening all
along. Although you may not realize it, you are growing closer or
drifting farther apart every day of your marriage. Even the
smallest choice - whether to curl up next to your mate on the
couch or plump down in a chair across the room - is taking you
toward one of two opposing poles: emotional distance or intimacy.
</p>

<p>Because of the demands of daily living, we can go for periods
of time without realizing what is happening in our relationship.
Sometimes we're not even aware of our secret choices because we
assume ourselves to be something that we're not. We may pride
ourselves on being the kind of marriage partner with a capacity
for intimate closeness, but our actions communicate something
quite different to our mate. We may describe ourselves as loving,
nurturing individuals, but this has little effect on how we
behave. Our will which decides what will happen - has chosen
otherwise, and our conduct reflects our true choice. </p>

<p>This is why we emphasize the adjective secret when speaking of
the choices that determine the success of our marriage. These
choices, which take us in one direction or the other, happen on
the inside first. Afterward, because of subtle clues communicated
through our behavior and attitudes, our husband or wife can sense
that change is taking place on the inside, 11 where the meanings
are.&quot; Still later, the results (positive or negative) can be
seen by all. </p>

<p>When changes are perceived as negative, the question is, Have
we changed, or is our partner beginning to know us as we really
are? After all, dating affords the opportunity to put on our
nicest face, our most agreeable personality, and our best
behavior. When we live together twenty-four hours a day in the
bonding of marriage, such well-meaning pretense is no longer
possible. Under the glare of reality, unrealistic expectations
can cause many a problem and forge major obstacles to the
enjoyment of intimacy. Because you can only build a rewarding,
intimate relationship with a person who is well known to you and
lovingly understood and accepted, it's important to learn to
relate to the one you actually married, not to the idealized
person you dreamed of marrying. </p>

<p>In real life your &quot;prince&quot; may refuse to hold hands
with you at the park. Your &quot;princess&quot; may criticize you
and take your boss's side. Your lover may roll over and go to
sleep instead of cuddling you in his arms for a good-night chat.
Your sweetheart may watch TV until 2:00 A.M. when you want her to
go to bed with you at 10:00. It may not be as bad as that, or it
might be worse. Any genuine relationship which offers the
magic&quot; of love also contains the seed of disappointments,
flaws, and failures. </p>

<p>Few of us are aware of that reality at the beginning of
marriage, for our expectations run high. When we meet the person
who seems to fill in the lonely spaces in our heart, and the
feeling is shared, we say it's too good to be true, but we
believe that it is true anyhow! We desperately want to believe we
have found the ideal love relationship which will fulfill all of
our dreams. After marriage, when discontent slips in, when we
discover that our partner is less than &quot;a perfect fit&quot;
as a mate, and that our relationship is less than the perfection
we counted on, this may disappoint us and disturb us, but it can
also mark the beginning of our true love affair. Wisdom tells us
that although life will not be a perpetual honeymoon, something
much better, much richer, can be ours if we're willing to direct
our secret choices toward building love-filled intimacy with the
real person we married. </p>

<p>This means, of course, that we have to be real, too, and
unafraid of revealing ourselves in an intimate relationship. </p>

<p>Nothing is more real than intimacy, and to build it in our
marriage, we need to begin by converting our false assumptions
about ourselves and our unrealistic expectations of our mate and
marriage into reality-based thinking. </p>

<p>Our goal in this chapter is to help you use your secret
choices to develop that incomparable closeness of an intimate
marriage in which you share the restful assurance that you are
fully known and deeply loved. You may have had intimate friends
who enriched your life, but this should surpass any other
relationship, for intimacy in marriage is as close as two human
beings can get. As the quote from the Song of Songs at the
beginning of this chapter suggests, an intimate marriage involves
two roles in combination: lover and best friend. Intimacy enjoyed
in the security of marriage offers us the ultimate pleasures of
life and, at the same time, heals our innermost loneliness as
nothing else can. </p>

<p>To make the best choices for intimacy, it's necessary to grasp
the key position of intimacy in a goo marriage. This example from
the world of architecture offers some interesting parallels.
Picture a stone arch representing your love relationship. The
stone looks strong enough, but in order to maintain its
structure, this arch needs a keystone. Although the keystone is
only one of a number of associated part, (just as intimacy is
only one aspect of your relationship), it is the key element that
holds the others together. It does this by causing the downward
pressure on the arch to be evenly exerted throughout the whole
structure. </p>

<p>The same thing happens when two people share everything in
their lives through the experience of intimacy. All the pressures
of life, bearing down on the marriage and on either or both of
the partners, become evenly shared and their impact lessened by
the presence of intimacy. Medical doctors have found that an
intimate relationship between a husband and wife can determine
how well that couple masters the crises of life. A high degree of
intimacy can also provide shelter and relief from the ordinary
tensions of life. Life becomes richer and more colorful when
shared with an intimate partner; it offers love and laughter,
pleasure and stability. In fact, we believe the secret of staying
in love for any married couple can be summed up in this one
potent word: intimacy. </p>

<p>Recall the picture of the arch: Its keystone fits into the top
of the arch in the central position, strengthening the entire
structure; at the same time it provides an ornamental touch. The
keystone is seen by all, ifs decorative, and its essential When
thinking of the opportunities to build intimacy in your
relationship, remember the lesson of the keystone. </p>

<p>Intimacy in marriage can be defined this way: The intimate
relationship of husband and wife is a deeply satisfying closeness
of mind, heart, body, and spirit which is shared and experienced
by two equals who relate as lovers and best friends in the
permanent context of marriage. </p>

<p>But keep in mind that marriage never guarantees the delights
of intimacy. If you read the current magazines, you know that
couples seem to have great difficulty achieving this intimacy.
Yet they all expect it, and, without it, marriages often
disintegrate. Even in stable marriages, couples sometimes admit
to an emptiness at the core of their relationship because one or
both do not know how to become intimate lovers or are afraid to
try. </p>

<p>You can be the happy exception. Be assured that God desires
you to have the best, and in a world of shifting relationships,
the two of you can experience an ongoing, always growing intimacy
which is so different from the norm that a world of lonely people
will want to know your secret. </p>

<p>The secret involves understanding the inmost workings of an
intimate relationship and then learning to make moment-by-moment
choices based on your knowledge, like a good athlete making the
right moves without conscious decisions because he or she has
thought it all through ahead of time. </p>

<p>One thing is certain: You cannot create intimacy by making an
intellectual choice to do it. You can love someone with
unconditional love by the choice of your will and continue to do
so, whether or not the person responds. But it takes two for
intimacy, and response is its &quot;life blood.&quot; How then
can you use your secret choices to obtain intimacy? By doing
those things which will enhance it, promote it, and give it room
to grow. By providing an emotional climate which will nurture it
in your marriage and cause it to grow. </p>

<p>Here are the guidelines we have found helpful in understanding
intimacy and &quot;growing it&quot; in marriage. </p>

<p>TEN GUIDELINES FOR INTIMACY IN MARRIAGE </p>

<p>1. Always remember that intimacy depends on the experience of
shared feelings. </p>

<p>Intimacy is experiential in nature. It is not perceived in the
mind as something that should be there: It is felt instinctively
and viscerally. You know intuitively - your feelings tell you -
whether your intimacy is flourishing or fading. You know if
something is wrong between you, and you feel relief the moment
everything is all right again. In this private, most personal
relationship, the two of you become so finely tuned to one
another that you can be constantly alert and responsive to one
another's fluctuations of feeling and well-being at any given
moment. </p>

<p>2. Learn, by practice, to express your inner feelings to one
another. </p>

<p>In shallow relationships, not much exchange of information
about inner selves takes place. By contrast, in a meaningful
relationship, people reveal how they feel and why, sharing their
personal history of sorrows, joys, accomplishments,
disappointments, changes, and growth. </p>

<p>A common problem with this sharing is that the husband may
find it difficult to talk about his feelings. It's been a
long-held notion that women are more emotional than men, but this
is only part truth, if truth at all. According to recent
research, men and women respond emotionally to events with equal
intensity. The real difference is that women are more able to
describe their responses and reactions in emotional terms. Women
can usually tell you what they're feeling at the moment. A man
can talk about what's happening, but may have difficulty
expressing how he feels about it. </p>

<p>3. Display a mutual respect for one another, a mutual hunger
to know one another better, and a growing delight in one another.
</p>

<p>Intimacy develops between two respected equals who share their
inner lives because they want to, because they have a vital
interest in one another's thoughts and feelings. If one partner
is seemingly not interested, the effect may be withdrawal on the
other side too. </p>

<p>4. Remember that sex is no substitute for intimacy. </p>

<p>This is something that women understand, but men sometimes do
not. Women have both the need and desire to relate in other ways
before they are ready for sex. They tend to be social before they
are sexual; in contrast, men have been conditioned to be
primarily sexual and to express their needs for intimacy through
intercourse. </p>

<p>For instance, when a man comes home to his wife after a week
away on business, she wants to hug him and kiss him and talk to
him and feel close to him again. He wants to regain closeness by
immediately having intercourse with her. She's hurt because
&quot;all he wants is my body.&quot; He's hurt because she has
misunderstood his attempt to be intimate through sexual
lovemaking, and he feels rejected. </p>

<p>Men may see no fine shade of difference between sex and
intimacy, but their wives will, unless sex takes place after the
exchange of mutual tenderness in an environment of emotional
closeness. Impersonal sex intensifies loneliness; true sexual
intimacy has great power to refresh the entire marriage. </p>

<p>5. Fill your marriage with tender, nonsexual physical
touching. </p>

<p>Consider the dictionary definition of caress: An act of
endearment, a tender or loving embrace. To touch, stroke, pat -
tenderly, lovingly, or softly. This is what we are suggesting:
touching as a communication of private intimacy, not as a sexual
signal. Try hugs, holding hands, and all the gentle gestures
which say so much. Even a smile or a wink across the room builds
the enjoyment of intimacy. Eye contact provides the spark of
understanding that you need. Hold hands when you pray; take time
for closeness morning and night; sit so that you are touching in
some way instead of choosing chairs across the room; leave each
other and greet each other with a special kiss. This kind of
touching becomes the tangible base of your intimate relationship.
</p>

<p>We will have more to say about touching in the next chapter,
for it is also an important part of nurturing. </p>

<p>6. Maintain the we perspective. </p>

<p>When we talk to couples who are having problems with intimacy,
invariably their sentences begin with I. </p>

<p>Seldom, if ever, do they use we. People who are only
interested in themselves just do not have the capacity to build
an intimate relationship, even though they may crave the benefits
of intimacy. </p>

<p>7. Communicate approval and acceptance of one another. </p>

<p>Everyone fears disapproval, especially from the one we love
most. This fear is probably the greatest hindrance to intimacy in
an otherwise good marriage. As a husband explained, &quot;It
isn't that my wife rejects me. She's really very loving. But
she's always pointing out to me - in a nice way, of course - what
I did wrong or what I should have done instead. I get so tired of
the feeling that she's disapproving of me. I know I don't quite
measure up, and I can't enjoy being close to her anymore.&quot; </p>

<p>Granted, you will have differences of opinion and even strong
clashes as you learn to resolve conflicts in your new life
together. But you need to communicate an approval and acceptance
of one another that runs far deeper than these surface matters.
When you disagree on an issue, do it gently in a respectful way.
Always discuss in the context of love for your partner, which is
more important than the issue at hand. </p>

<p>Also remember that the major impact of communication comes
from body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice. You
may be communicating disapproval in those modes even though your
words say something else. Of all the things you wear, your
expression is the most important. </p>

<p>8. Recognize and overcome fear of intimacy by building trust
in actions, words, and attitudes. </p>

<p>Although people need and even long for intimacy, they
sometimes react to it with fear. Or withdraw if it becomes a
possibility. Why? Because intimacy represents a mutual need for
closeness, and people are often afraid to need someone else. In
the past they may have been let down and disappointed by those
they depended on (sometimes parents), and they do not want to
risk it again. Or they are afraid of revealing their true self to
their lover (a necessity in an intimate relationship), afraid
that if the lover knew what was 'behind the mask&quot; they would
be abandoned. </p>

<p>Other related fears include fear of criticism, fear of
rejection, and fear of being used. All these fears can be put
under one umbrella labeled: I am afraid of being hurt. </p>

<p>Without trust, no real emotional intimacy is possible. To
build this trust in your relationship, follow these basic
principles: </p>

<p>a. Always be very kind to one another. </p>

<p>b. Never reject the other, or shut the door to touching,
talking, or sharing your life with your mate. </p>

<p>c. Build trust through faithfulness. (See chapter three of our
new-marriage handbook, The First Years of Forever.) </p>

<p>9. Maintain the spirit of discovery in your relationship. </p>

<p>When you married, each of you left your old world to form a
new one together. You have entered into a new reality where two
are in the process of becoming one. And the new world you longed
for when you fell in love is now yours for the taking. It's up to
you to explore the territory, take dominion over it, and make it
what you both want it to be. Think of yourselves as pioneers who,
because you are entering new territory, must explore it and
establish your lives in the new world. </p>

<p>10. Follow the pattern of Ephesians 4:22 - 24 in making your
choices for intimacy. </p>

<p>Begin by considering what will happen if you ignore the need
to create an emotional climate of intimacy in your relationship,
The alternative is emotional distance, with its inevitable
components of disinterest, or distrust, or even dislike and open
hostility. The prefix dis generally denotes separation, negation,
or reversal. If the two of you want to build a love-filled,
lasting marriage, it's safe to assume that you don't want
separation from one another, or negatives in your relationship,
or reversals of all you have hoped for. </p>

<p><b>Have you ever wondered why all the nice things you do for
your spouse or children can go unappreciated? Did you know that
each of us has a primary love language? For example if your
primary love language is &#145;acts of service&#146;, chances are
that&#146;s also how you like to express your love. But if your
wife or child&#146;s primary love language is &#145;quality
time&#146;, your acts of service and way of expressing your love
will miss the mark. Once you identify and learn to speak your
spouse, son or daughter&#146;s love language, you&#146;ll
discover the key to a loving marriage and family environment.
Love need not evaporate after the wedding, but in order to keep
it alive most of us will have to put forth the effort to learn a
secondary love language.<br>

    <li>By Gary Chapman</li>
</ul>

<p>How can we speak each other's love language when we are full
of hurt, anger, and resentment over past failures? The answer to
that question lies in the essential nature of our humanity. We
are creatures of choice. That means that we have the capacity to
make poor choices, which all of us have done. We have spoken
critical words, and we have done hurtful things. We are not proud
of those choices, although they may have seemed justified at the
moment. Poor choices in the past don't mean that we must make
them in the future. Instead we can say, &quot;I'm sorry. I know I
have hurt you, but I would like to make the future different. I
would like to love you in your language. I would like to meet
your needs.&quot; I have seen marriages rescued from the brink of
divorce when couples make the choice to love.</p>

<p>Love doesn't erase the past, but it makes the future
different. When we choose active expressions of love in the
primary love language of our spouse, we create an emotional
climate where we can deal with our past conflicts and failures.</p>

<p>Brent was in my office, stone-faced and unfeeling. He had
come, not by his own initiative, but at my request. A week
earlier his wife, Becky, had been sitting in the same chair,
weeping uncontrollably. Between her outbursts of tears, she
managed to verbalize that Brent had told her that he no longer
loved her and that he was leaving. She was devastated.</p>

<p>When she regained her composure she said, &quot;We have both
worked so hard the last two or three years. I knew that we were
not spending as much time together as we used to, but I thought
we were working for a common goal. I cannot believe what he is
saying. He has always been such a kind and caring person. He is
such a good father to our children. &quot; She continued,
&quot;How could he do this to us?&quot;</p>

<p>I listened as she described their twelve years of marriage. It
was a story I had heard many times before. They had an exciting
courtship, got married at the height of the &quot;in love
experience,&quot; had the typical adjustments in the early days
of marriage, and pursued the American dream. In due time, they
came down off the emotional high of the &quot;in love
experience&quot; but did not learn to speak each other's love
language sufficiently. She had lived with a love tank only half
full for the last several years. But she had received enough
expressions of love to make her think that everything was OK.
However, his love tank was empty.</p>

<p>I told Becky that I would see if Brent would talk with me. I
told Brent on the phone, &quot;As you know, Becky came to see me
and told me about her struggle with what is happening in the
marriage. I want to help her, but in order to do so, I need to
know what you are thinking.&quot;</p>

<p>He agreed without hesitation, and now he sat in my office. His
outward appearance was in stark contrast to Becky's. She had been
weeping uncontrollably, but he was stoic. I had the impression,
however, that his weeping had taken place weeks or perhaps months
ago and that it had been an inward weeping. The story Brent told
confirmed my hunch.</p>

<p>&quot;I just don't love her anymore,&quot; he said. &quot;I
haven't loved her for a long time. I don't want to hurt her, but
we are not close. Our relationship has become empty. I don't
enjoy being with her anymore. I don't know what happened. I wish
it were different, but I don't have any feelings for her.&quot;</p>

<p>Brent was thinking and feeling what hundreds of thousands of
husbands have thought and felt through the years. It's the
&quot;I don't love her anymore&quot; mindset that gives men the
emotional freedom to seek love with someone else. The same is
true for wives who use the same excuse.</p>

<p>I sympathized with Brent, for I have been there. Thousands of
husbands and wives have been there-emotionally empty, wanting to
do the right thing, not wanting to hurt anyone, but being pushed
by their emotional needs to seek love outside the marriage.
Fortunately, I had discovered in the earlier years of my own
marriage the difference between the &quot;in love
experience&quot; and the &quot;emotional need&quot; to feel
loved. Most in our society have not yet learned that difference.
The movies, the &quot;soaps,&quot; and the romantic magazines
have intertwined these two loves, thus adding to our confusion.
But they are, in fact, quite distinct.</p>

<p>The &quot;in love experience&quot; that we discussed in
chapter 3 is on the level of instinct. It is not premeditated; it
simply happens in the normal context of male-female
relationships. It can be fostered or quenched, but it does not
arise by conscious choice. It is short-lived (usually two years
or less) and seems to serve for humankind the same function as
the mating call of the Canada geese.</p>

<p>The &quot;in love experience&quot; temporarily meets one's
emotional need for love. It gives us the feeling that someone
cares, that someone admires us and appreciates us. Our emotions
soar with the thought that another person sees us as number one,
that he or she is willing to devote time and energies exclusively
to our relationship. For a brief period, however long it lasts,
our emotional need for love is met. Our tank is full; we can
conquer the world. Nothing is impossible. For many individuals,
it is the first time they have ever lived with a full emotional
tank, and it is euphoric.</p>

<p>In time, however, we come down from that natural high back to
the real world. If our spouse has learned to speak our primary
love language, our need for love will continue to be satisfied.
If, on the other hand, he or she does not speak our love
language, our tank will slowly drain, and we will no longer feel
loved. Meeting that need in one's spouse is definitely a choice.
If I learn the emotional love language of my spouse and speak it
frequently, she will continue to feel loved. When she comes down
from the obsession of the &quot;in love experience,&quot; she
will hardly even miss it because her emotional love tank will
continue to be filled. However, if I have not learned her primary
love language or have chosen not to speak it, when she descends
from the emotional high, she will have the natural yearnings of
unmet emotional need. After some years of living with an empty
love tank, she will likely &quot;fall in love&quot; with someone
else and the cycle will begin again.</p>

<p>Meeting my wife's need for love is a choice I make each day.
If I know her primary love language and choose to speak it, her
deepest emotional need will be met and she will feel secure in my
love. If she does the same for me, my emotional needs are met and
both of us live with a full tank. In a state of emotional
contentment, both of us will give our creative energies to many
wholesome projects Outside the marriage while we continue to keep
our marriage exciting and growing.</p>

<p>With all of that in my mind, I looked back at the dead-pan
face of Brent and wondered if I could help him. I knew in my
heart that he was probably already involved with another &quot;in
love experience.&quot; I wondered if it was in the beginning
stages or at its height. Few men, suffering from an empty
emotional love tank, leave their marriage until they have
prospects of meeting that need somewhere else.</p>

<p>Brent was honest and revealed that he had been in love with
someone else for several months. He had hoped that the feelings
would go away and that he could work things out with his wife.
But things at home had gotten worse, and his love for the other
woman had increased. He Could not imagine living without his new
lover.</p>

<p>I sympathized with Brent in his dilemna. He sincerely did not
want to hurt his wife or his children, but at the same time, he
felt he deserved a life of happiness. I told him the statistics
on second marriages (60 percent ending in divorce). He was
surprised to hear that but was certain that he Would beat the
odds. I told him about the research on the effects of divorce on
children but he was convinced that he would continue to be a good
father to his children and that they would get over the trauma of
the divorce. I talked to Brent about the issues in this book and
explained the difference between the experience Of falling in
love and the deep emotional need to feel loved. I explained the
five love languages and challenged him to give his marriage
another chance. All the while, I knew that my intellectual and
reasoned approach to marriage compared to the emotional high that
he was experiencing was like pitting a BB gun against an
automatic weapon. He expressed appreciation for my concern and
asked that I do everything possible to help Becky. But he assured
me that he saw no hope for the marriage.</p>

<p>One month later, I received a call from Brent. He indicated
that he would like to talk with me again. This time when he
entered my office he was noticeably disturbed. He was not the
calm, cool man I had seen before. His lover had begun to come
down off the emotional high, and she was observing things in
Brent that she did not like. She was withdrawing from the
relationship, and he was crushed. Tears came to his eyes as he
told me how much she meant to him and how unbearable it was to
experience her rejection.</p>

<p>I listened sympathetically for an hour before Brent ever asked
for my advice. I told him how sympathetic I was to his pain and
indicated that what he was experiencing was the natural emotional
grief from a loss and that the grief would not go away overnight.
I explained, however, that the experience was inevitable. I
reminded him of the temporary nature of the &quot;in love
experience,&quot; that sooner or later, we always come down from
the high to the real world. Some fall out of love before they get
married; others, after they get married. He agreed that it was
better now than later.</p>

<p>After some time, I suggested that perhaps the crisis was a
good time for him and his wife to get some marriage counseling. I
reminded him that true, long-lasting emotional love is a choice
and that emotional love could be reborn in his marriage if he and
his wife learned to love each other in the right love languages.
He agreed to marriage counseling. and nine months later, Brent
and Becky left my office with a reborn marriage. When I saw Brent
three years later, he told me what a wonderful marriage he had
and thanked me for helping him at a crucial time in his life. He
told me that the grief over losing the other lover had been gone
for more than two years. He smiled and said, &quot;My tank has
never been so full, and Becky is the happiest woman you are ever
going to meet.&quot;</p>

<p>Fortunately Brent was the benefactor of what I call the
disequilibrium of the &quot;in love experience.&quot; That is,
almost never do two people fall in love on the same day, and
almost never do they fall out of love on the same day. You don't
have to be a social scientist to discover that truth. Just listen
to 10 country and western songs. Brent's lover happened to have
fallen out of love at an opportune time.</p>

<p>In the nine months that I counseled Brent and Becky, we worked
through numerous conflicts that they had never resolved before.
But the key to the rebirth of their marriage was discovering each
other's primary love language and choosing to speak it
frequently.</p>

<p>Let me return to the question I raised in chapter 9.
&quot;What if the love language of your spouse is something that
doesn't come naturally for you?&quot; I am often asked this
question at seminars, and my answer is, &quot;So?&quot;</p>

<p>My wife's love language is &quot;Acts of Service.&quot; One of
the things I do for her regularly as an act of love is to vacuum
the floors- Do you think that vacuuming floors comes naturally
for me? My mother used to make me vacuum -through junior high and
high school, I couldn't go play ball on Saturday until I finished
vacuuming the entire house. In those days, I said to myself,
&quot;When I get Out of here, one thing I an not going to do: I
am not going to vacuum houses. I'll get myself a wife to do
that.&quot;</p>

<p>But I vacuum our house now, and I vacuum it regularly. And
there is only one reason I vacuum our house. Love. You couldn't
pay me enough to vacuum a house, but I do it for love. You see',
when an action doesn't come naturally to you, it is a greater
expression of love. My wife knows that when I vacuum the house,
it's nothing but 100 percent pure, unadulterated love, and I get
credit for the whole thing!</p>

<p>Someone says, &quot;But Dr. Chapman, that's different. I know
that my spouse's love language is physical touch, and I am not a
toucher. I never saw my mother and father hug each other. They
never hugged me, Dr. Chapman. I am just not a toucher. What am I
going to do?&quot;</p>

<p>Do you have two hands? Can you put them together? Now, imagine
that you have your spouse in the middle and pull him/her toward
you. I'll bet that if you hug your spouse three thousand times,
it will begin to feel more comfortable. But ultimately, comfort
is not the issue. We are talking about love, and love is
something you do for someone else, not something you do for
yourself. Most of us do many things each day that do not come
&quot;naturally&quot; for us. For some of us, that is getting out
of bed in the morning. We go against our feelings and get out of
bed. Why? Because we believe there is something worthwhile to do
that day. And normally, before the day is over, we feel good
about having gotten up. Our actions preceded our emotions.</p>

<p>The same is true with love. We discover the primary love
language of our spouse, and we choose to speak it whether or not
it is natural for us. We are not claiming to have warm, excited
feelings. We are simply choosing to do it for his or her benefit.
We want to meet our spouse's emotional need, and we reach out to
speak his love language. In so doing, his emotional love tank is
filled and chances are he will reciprocate and speak our
language. When he does our emotions return, and our love tank
begins to fill.</p>

<p>Love is a choice. And either partner can start the process
today.</p>

<h2>The Family Book Of Christian Values </h2>

<p><b>A wonderful collection of stories and verse, ancient and

<p><b>The Boy Who Always Finished What He Started</b><br>
</p>

<p>Even as a young boy, Thomas Edison demonstrated the
truthfulness of the famous comment he made later in life:
&quot;Genius is 1% inspiration and 99% perspiration.&quot; <br>
One day during the critical period of the Civil War, a newsboy in
Detroit went into the office where he daily obtained his supply
of papers. <br>
&quot;What is the news?&quot; he questioned.<br>
&quot;Haven't you heard?&quot; asked another newsboy who stood
nearby. &quot;There has just been a big battle at Pittsburgh
Landing.&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh!&quot; exclaimed the boy, and he extracted a pencil from
his pocket and began to make some calculations. </p>

<p>What are you trying to figure out, Tom?&quot; the other boy
asked.<br>
&quot;How many papers I shall need today,&quot; he replied, as he
turned and approached the circulation manager's desk.<br>
&quot;I want one thousand newspapers,&quot; said young Edison.<br>
The circulation manager of the Detroit Free Press looked in
amazement at the lad who made this astonishing request.<br>
&quot;Have you the money?&quot; he asked.<br>
&quot;No, sir&quot; replied Edison.<br>
&quot;Then get out.&quot;<br>
</p>

<p>The boy went directly upstairs to the office of the publisher.<br>
&quot;I want fifteen hundred papers, Mr. Storey,&quot; said the
boy. Then he explained that the people along the line of the
railroad where he had a run as train newsboy would be eager to
get the news of the battle of Pittsburgh Landing.<br>
&quot;Can you pay for them?&quot; asked Mr. Storey.<br>
&quot;As soon as I sell them,&quot; answered the boy. Mr. Storey
wrote something on a slip of paper and the boy took it down to
the circulation manager. Fifteen hundred!&quot; growled the man.
&quot;I thought you only wanted a thousand!&quot;<br>
&quot;Oh, I thought I might as well be refused fifteen hundred
papers as a thousand,&quot; grinned the boy. And that is the
spirit that helped Thomas Edison, the world's greatest inventor,
to success. </p>

<p>Tom knew that the people along the line would be anxious to
hear the news. He had no money, but he had courage and, what is
better, the habit of thinking things out, that is, of thinking
ahead. Usually he sold about sixty papers along this train route.
How could he sell fifteen hundred?<br>
He had thought that all out in advance. He went to a telegraph
operator who was fond of reading, and said to him, &quot;If you
will wire ahead to every stop that there has been a big battle
and that I am coming with papers telling the story and giving a
list of the dead and wounded, I will send you a daily paper and
two magazines a month for six months.&quot; Thus bargained young
Edison.<br>
&#147;I will do it,&quot; agreed the operator.<br>
When young Edison reached his first stop, Utica, there was a
large crowd of people waiting at the station. </p>

<p>&quot;At first I thought the crowd was going on an
excursion,&quot; said Mr. Edison in relating the incident,
&quot;but I soon realized they were waiting for the papers. I
sold more than half of my papers there, and at Mount Clemens and
Port Huron I sold the remainder.&quot; </p>

<p>As a young man, and with only a dollar in his pocket, Thomas
Edison went to New York City looking for work. Three nights he
slept on park benches. One day he went without food. While he was
in the office of a gold and stock indicator company the stock
ticker stopped and there was great excitement. </p>

<p>He said, &quot;I think I can fix it for you.&quot; He opened
the ticker lifted a loose contact sprint that had fallen between
the wheels, and it started up again. Just as he did this the man
who had a big interest in the ticker service saw him. &quot;We
are having trouble with this service. If you can keep it going
for us I will give you three hundred dollars a month,&quot; he
said. </p>

<p>&quot;I was amazed when I heard this,&quot; Mr. Edison said
later, &quot;but I remained calm and agreed to do it,. demanding
an advance in 'good faith.' I really did not want it for 'good
faith' but for food, as I had not eaten for nearly thirty
hours.&quot;<br>
Mr. Edison learned why the ticker would not work well and
improved it, securing a patent. When the company asked him for
how much he would sell it, he thought of asking five thousand
dol&#31;lars. &quot;I will let the company make the first
offer,&quot; he said to himself. They gave him forty thousand
dollars; so he made exactly thirty-five thousand dollars by using
his judgment. </p>

<p>All the world knows of his rapid rise after that. This money
enabled him to build a laboratory and carry on experiments. He
invented the quadruplex telegraph, the incandescent light, the
phonograph, moving pictures, speaking parts of the telephone,
appliances for use on electric railways, storage batteries, and
scores of other great things. </p>

<p><b>The Village Blacksmith</b><br>
HENRY WADSWORTH LONGFELLOW<br>
<br>
We talk about role models. The village blacksmith has always been
a favorite of ours. </p>

<p>Under a spreading chestnut-tree<br>
The village smithy stands;<br>
The smith, a mighty man is he,<br>
With large and sinewy hands;<br>
And the muscles of his brawny arms<br>
Are strong as iron bands. </p>

<p>His hair is crisp, and black, and long;<br>
His face is like the tan;<br>
His brow is wet with honest sweat,<br>
He earns whate'er he can,<br>
And looks the whole world in the face,<br>
For his owes not any man.<br>
</p>

<p>Week in, week out, from morn till night,<br>
You can hear his bellows blow;<br>
You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,<br>
With measured beat and slow,<br>
Like a sexton ringing the village bell,<br>
When the evening sun is low.<br>
</p>

<p>And children coming home from school<br>
Look in at the open door;<br>
They love to see the flaming forge,<br>
And hear the bellows roar,<br>
And catch the burning sparks that fly<br>
Like chaff from a threshing-floor.<br>
</p>

<p>He goes on Sunday to the church,<br>
And sits among his boys;<br>
He hears the parson pray and preach,<br>
He hears his daughter's voice<br>
Singing in the village choir,<br>
And it makes his heart rejoice. </p>

<p>It sounds to him like her mother's voice<br>
Singing in Paradise!<br>
He needs must think of her once more,<br>
How in the grave she lies;<br>
And with his hard, rough hand he wipes<br>
A tear out of his eyes. </p>

<p>Toiling, - rejoicing, - sorrowing,<br>
Onward throughout life he goes;<br>
Each morning sees some task begin,<br>
Each evening sees it close;<br>
Something attempted, something done,<br>
Has earned a night's repose. </p>

<p>Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,<br>
For the lesson thou has taught!<br>
Thus at the flaming forge of life<br>
Our fortunes must be wrought;<br>
Thus on its sounding anvil shaped<br>
Each burning deed and thought. </p>

<p><b>The Little Red Hen</b><br>
HELEN DEAN FISH </p>

<p>This favorite nursery still reminds us that Laziness and
selfishness are never attractive. </p>

<p>Once upon a time there was a little red hen who lived in a
little house on the edge of a big forest. She could cook and she
could sew, and she swept and dusted that little house every day.<br>
She had a garden where she planted corn and potatoes and peas and
sunflowers.<br>
With the little red hen lived a cat and a rat and a mouse. The
little red hen cooked their meals and took good care of them, but
they were very lazy and never did anything to help her.<br>
One morning the sun came up bright and early and woke the little
red hen. She popped out of bed and prepared the breakfast: a
saucer of cream for the cat, a bowl of corn for the rat, and a
plate of wheat for the mouse. And a little blue dish of
breadcrumbs for herself.<br>
Then she woke the cat, the rat, and the mouse. The cat washed
himself and the rat and mouse brushed their whiskers, and they
all sat down to breakfast, and ate up every bit. When she had
washed and dried the dishes and the little blue dish, and put
them away, and swept the kitchen with her little broom, the
little red hen said, &quot;Today I think I will bake a beautiful
cake.&quot;<br>
The cat said, &quot;Goody!&quot;<br>
The rat said, &quot;Goody! Goody!&quot;<br>
The mouse said, &quot;Goody! Goody! Goody!&quot;<br>
Then the little red hen asked, &quot;Who will go to the woodpile
and fetch some wood to heat the oven and bake my beautiful
cake?&quot;<br>
The cat said, &quot;I won't.&quot;<br>
The rat said, &quot;I won't.&quot;<br>
The mouse said, &quot;I won't.&quot;<br>
So the little red hen said, &quot;'Then I'll have to go and do
it, myself.&quot; And she did. Then the little red hen said,
&quot;Who will go to the meadow and milk the cow and bring fresh
milk to put in my beautiful cake?&quot;<br>
The cat said, &quot;I won't.&quot;<br>
The rat said, &quot;I won't.&quot;<br>
The mouse said, &quot;I won't.&quot;<br>
So the little red hen said, &quot;Then I'll have to go and do it
myself.&quot;<br>
So she did.<br>
Then the little red hen said,Who will go to the nest and find
eggs to beat into my beautiful cake?&quot;<br>
The cat said, I won't.&quot;<br>
The rat said, &quot;I won't.&quot;<br>
The mouse said, &quot;I won't.&quot;<br>
And the little red hen said, &quot;Then I must go and do it
myself.&quot;<br>
So she did.<br>
Then the little red hen said, &quot;Who will go to the shop and
buy butter and sugar and flour to put in my beautiful cake?&quot;<br>
The cat said. &quot;I won't.&quot;<br>
The rat said, &quot;I won't.'<br>
The mouse said, &quot;I won't.<br>
And the little red hen said, &quot;Then I must go and do it
myself &quot;<br>
</p>

<p>So she did.<br>
Then the little red hen took a bowl and a big spoon and mixed
butter and sugar and eggs and milk and flour. And she beat the
dough and put it in three pans and put them in the oven. The cat
sat by the oven door and waited.<br>
The rat sat by the oven door and sniffed.<br>
</p>

<p>The mouse sat by the oven door and looked as if she were
getting ready to nibble. </p>

<p>When the cake was baked to a turn, the little red hen took it
out of the oven and it smelled so delicious that the cat and the
rat and the mouse frisked about the floor. It smelled so
delicious that the old fox far away in his den in the forest, and
all the little kitfoxes, sniffed the air and said, &quot;What is
that beautiful smell?&quot;<br>
The old fox said, &quot;It smells to me as if the little red hen
is baking today.&quot; And pretty soon he took down the sack that
hung by the door of the den, and said to his wife: &quot;I think
I'll go see the little red hen. Perhaps I can bring a nice fresh
cake home for the kits. And perhaps I will bring the little red
hen home, too. She will make us a fine dinner. So put the pot on
to boil and wait.&quot;<br>
And the old fox came out of the forest and loped along very
softly toward the little red hen's house. In the meantime the
little red hen set the layers of cake on the table to cool, and
then she took a bowl and made frosting. First she spread the
frosting on the first layer. Then she put the second layer on top
of that and frosted-all over, very carefully. And then she put
the third layer on top of that and frosted all over the whole
cake, very carefully. And it looked perfectly delicious. </p>

<p>Then the little red hen said, &quot;Now who will help me eat
the cake?&quot;<br>
The cat said, &quot;I will!&quot;<br>
The rat said, &quot;I will!&quot;<br>
And the mouse said, &quot;I will!&quot;<br>
But the little red hen said, &quot;No you won't, I'm going to eat
it myself!&quot;<br>
Just then the old fox put his head in the window. </p>

<p>When the little red hen saw him, she was so frightened that
she flew up to the top of the cabinet and hid behind the clock.<br>
The cat hid under the bed.<br>
The rat went into his big hole behind the stove.<br>
And the mouse went into her little hole behind the door. </p>

<p>The fox came in the kitchen door and looked all around.
&quot;Nobody home?&quot; he asked. &quot;But my, what a fine
cake! I might as well eat it up.<br>
And he was about to gobble the cake when the little red hen flew
down at him in a rage and tried to drive him away by flapping her
wings and pecking at him. The old fox laughed, &quot;Ha!
Ha!&quot; and grabbed the little red hen and popped her in his
sack and tied her up and went out of the house so fast that he
forgot the cake.<br>
He loped along toward his den. But the sun was hot and the fox
had come a long way and when he saw a shady tree by the roadside
he lay down to rest for a bit. And before he knew it, he had
fallen asleep. As soon as the little red hen heard him snore, she
took her little pair of scissors out of her apron pocket and
snipped a hole in the sack just big enough to creep out of. When
she was out she quickly found a rock that weighed about as much
as she did, and put it in the hole she had cut. Then she took her
needle and thread and sewed up the hole.<br>
Then she ran toward home as fast as she could run.<br>
When the old fox woke from his nap he grabbed the sack and
started off home. He was in such a hurry to put the little red
hen in the pot to boil that he didn't notice that it was a rock
bouncing in the sack on his back instead of the little red hen.
When he got to his den the little kits ran out and said,
&quot;Oh, Father, have you brought us the good cake?&quot;<br>
Then the fox remembered that he had forgotten to bring the cake
but he said, &quot;No, my dears, but I have something much
better, a plump little red hen.&quot; And he opened the sack and
his wife took the lid off the boiling pot and he dropped in the
rock with a great splash. So then the old fox knew that the wise
little red hen had out-witted him again. He was very cross and
the fox's family had no dinner at all that day. But the little
red hen ran home across the fields until she came to the little
house, and there was the cake safe and sound on the table looking
more delicious than ever.<br>
</p>

<p>The cat heard her and came out from under the bed.<br>
The rat came out of his hole behind the stove.<br>
And the mouse came from behind the door. </p>

<p>They were so glad to see their dear little red hen safe at
home again that they promised they would never be selfish and
lazy any more.<br>
So the little red hen forgave them and they were very happy and
ate the cake all up -- every crumb of it. </p>

as a simple fishing boat - the one that took Jesus across the Sea
of Galilee. Can you guess what the third tree becomes? The full

<p>Once upon a mountaintop, three little trees stood and dreamed
of what they wanted to become when they grew up.</p>

<p>The first little tree looked up at the stars twinkling like
diamonds above him. &quot;I want to hold treasure,&quot; he said.
&quot;I want to be covered with gold and filled with precious
stones. I will be the most beautiful treasure chest in the world!</p>

<p>The second little tree looked out at the small stream
trickling by on its way to the ocean. &quot;I want to be a strong
sailing ship,&quot; he said. &quot;I want to travel mighty waters
and carry powerful kings. I will be the strongest ship in the
world!&quot;</p>

<p>The third little tree looked down into the valley below where
busy men and busy women worked in a busy town. &quot;I don't want
to leave this mountaintop at all,&quot; she said. &quot;I want to
grow so tall that when people stop to look at me they will raise
their eyes to heaven and think of God. I will be the tallest tree
in the world!&quot;</p>

<p>Years passed. 'I&#146;ve rains came, the sun shone, and the
little trees grew tall.</p>

<p>One day three woodcutters climbed the mountain.</p>

<p>The first woodcutter looked at the first tree and said,
&quot;This tree is beautiful. It is perfect for me.&quot; With a
swoop of his shining axe, the first tree fell.</p>

<p>&quot;Now I shall be made into a beautiful chest,&quot;
thought the first tree. &quot;I shall hold wonderful
treasure.&quot;</p>

<p>The second woodcutter looked at the second tree and said,
&quot;This tree is strong. It is perfect for me.&quot; With a
swoop of his shining axe, the second tree fell.</p>

<p>Now I shall sail mighty waters,&quot; thought the second tree.
&quot;I shall be a strong ship fit for kings!&quot;</p>

<p>The third tree felt her heart sink when the last woodcutter
looked her way. She stood straight and tall and pointed bravely
to heaven.</p>

<p>But the woodcutter never even looked up. &quot;Any kind of
tree will do for me,&quot; he muttered. With a swoop of his
shining axe, the third tree fell.</p>

<p>The first tree rejoiced when the woodcutter brought him to a
carpenter's shop, but the busy carpenter was not thinking about
treasure chests. Instead his workworn hands fashioned the tree
into a feed box for animals.</p>

<p>The once-beautiful tree was not covered with gold or filled
with treasure. He was coated with sawdust and filled with hay for
hungry farm animals...</p>

and you'll appreciate your folks more!</b></p>

    <li>By Joey O&#146;Connor</li>
</ul>

<p>Restriction. Been there.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things in this life that get grounded.
Elec-tricians. Heavy machinery. Airplanes during blizzards.
Wash-ers and dryers. And teenagers.</p>

<p>When you get nailed for getting in too late or get caught
cheating on a test, there are two types of sentences. The first
is a simple grounding. When you're simply grounded, it means
you've got either home or bedroom duty. If your room is loaded
with TV, VCR, cable channel, satellite dish, CD stereo, telephone
with call waiting, FAX machine, personal computer with 1200 baud
modem, you basically still have contact with the outside world.</p>

<p>But if you get grounded for life, you might as well kiss
good-bye any hope of celebrating your 50th wedding anniversary.
Grounded for life means life in your bedroom with no possi-bility
of parole except bathroom privileges. Then you know things are
going to get worse before they get better. You're history, cheese
steak, dog meat, a goner, an object of ridicule at school, dust,
in deep yogurt, busted, convicted, an outcast, a menace to
society, and a forgotten lost soul amongst the shipwreck of
humanity. Grounded for life is as far as you can imagine into the
future. It is eternity times a million.</p>

<p>Grounded for life is no simple threat. It is a reality
enforced by parents who lock you up and throw away the key.
Grounded for life is the grandisimo way parents say, &quot;Adios
... hasta la bye-bye.&quot;</p>

<p>TIIE SCRIPTURE</p>

<p>Our fathers disciplined us for a little while as they thought
best; but God disciplines us for our good, that we may share in
his holiness.</p>

<p>Hebrews 12: 10</p>

<p>OK, so you agree that being grounded for life is not the way
you want to spend your next sixty years. You still want to get
your driver's license, go to your senior prom, play sports,
graduate, find a career, get married, and have 3.8 kids someday.
Not being grounded for life will enable you to see the sunshine,
hang out with friends, and enjoy some simple pleasures in life,
like getting out of your bedroom.</p>

<p>Why do some parents go to such extremes when you fail to dump
the trash after being asked four times to take it out? Why do
parents impose sentences with no regard for your constitutional
rights? What kind of parent would impose such stiff penalties on
their own offspring? Even the Bible says that our fathers
disciplined us for &quot;a little while,&quot; but not for life!</p>

<p>Believe it or not, your parents have not been to the Har-vard
Correctional School of Adolescent Discipline and Development.
God's Word says that most parents discipline their sons and
daughters as they think best, which accounts for a significant
margin of error. In other words, your par-ents may not be pros in
the area of discipline, grounding, restriction, and the revoking
of privileges. Your parents are in the position of disciplining
you as they think best. That's not always an easy or fun position
to be in.</p>

<p>How is God different from your parents? God disciplines you so
that you can share in something very special: his hoh-ness.
Discipline has a lot more to do with giving direction than giving
punishment. God disciplines you for your own good, so that you
learn to walk in his ways and always follow him .God wants you to
share in his holiness because he wants you to be
&quot;whole&quot; in him. Discipline is a process by which you
get rid of the things that make holes, so you can take on the
char-acteristics of God that will make you whole. When you're
whole, you'll never be restricted. Wholeness in Christ means
freedom. Freedom from sin. Freedom from guilt and regret. </p>

<p>THE STRATEGY</p>

<p>Ten Grounded-for-Life Ideas</p>

<p>1. Paint your bedroom with 10,281 coats of paint.</p>

<p>2. Breed a herd of hamsters so they can gnaw through your
bedroom wall and provide an escape route. </p>

<p>3. Organize your monster truck card collection.</p>

<p>4. Call a realtor and arrange for your parents' home to be
sold.</p>

<p>5. Use your mattress as a boogie board to safely jump out the
window.</p>

<p>6. Peel off the drywall and create a neo-construction
dec-orating theme.</p>

<p>7. Start a Bedroom Sale mail-order business.</p>

<p>8. Join Inmates Anonymous.</p>

<p>9. Hold your little sister as a hostage to negotiate your
release.</p>

<p>10.Read these verses about God's holiness to learn how God
wants to share his holiness with you: Hebrews 12:14, Romans 6:22,
Romans 12: 1, 1 Corinthians 1:30, I Peter 1: 15.</p>

<p>*************************</p>

<p>Don&#146;t take the car -- you&#146;ll kill yourself!</p>

<p>THE SITUATION</p>

<p>A few years ago during Easter vacation, forty high school
students and six leaders from the youth group I led went to
Mexicali, Mexico, for a week of working with local churches,
teenagers, and runny-nosed kids. After spending seven days living
in talcum powder-like dust, eating canned food, and sleeping on
rock-hard ground, we packed up and headed back to the U.S.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes after crossing the border, while travel-ing on
a two-lane desert road, our group of vans came upon a motorcycle
accident. As we slowly drove by, we saw two women kneeling in the
middle of the road, blood all over their hands, hunched over a
teenage boy while desperately trying to pump life into him by
giving him CPR. We pulled over, and two of our staff, one a
paramedic, the other a nurse, attempted to take control of the
chaotic scene. With her son's blood all over her face, hands, and
soaking her jeans from the knees down, the boy's mother was
absolutely hysterical. His father walked around in a dazed, numb
state, knowing that his critically injured son probably wouldn't
survive. Ryan, thirteen years old, clung to me with a vise grip,
screaming and crying for his fifteen-year-old brother, Sean, not
to die. For the next forty-five minutes, our staff struggled to
save Sean's life.</p>

<p>As we waited for the ambulance to arrive, we found out that
the family of four, Mom, Dad, Sean, and Ryan, plus two family
friends, were spending the Easter vacation riding motorcycles in
the desert. Sean and his dad were ahead of the other four on a
dirt road that intersected the highway. Immediately after
crossing the highway, Sean turned around to go back to the
others. Not looking before he crossed the highway, he didn't see
a car rapidly approaching him at 60-70 mph. Sean was hit,
launched into the air, and thrown onto the pavement like a rag
doll. Struck by a car weighing a thousand pounds more than he,
his helmet didn't help much. After the longest forty-five minutes
of our lives, the paramedics and police finally arrived. Sean,
only fifteen years old, was declared dead.</p>

<p>THE SCRIPTURE</p>

<p>Now choose life, so that you and your children may live and
that you may love the LORD your God, listen to his voice, and
hold fast to him. For the LORD is your life....</p>

<p>Deuteronomy 30:19-20</p>

<p>The intense screams of Sean's mother and younger brother
shattered the desert's silence, while the students in our vans
shuddered as they watched this family begin the painful process
of grief. Our leaders cleaned Sean's blood off their hands, and
we returned to the vans and drove to a rest stop. For the next
hour, our team of students and leaders cried, prayed together,
hugged one another, and shared what we were feeling to try to
make sense of what had just happened. A fifteen-year-old guy was
gone-dead, his life finished.</p>

<p>Students shared such thoughts as, &quot;That could have been
me.&quot; &quot;He was just like one of us.&quot; &quot;He will
never get his dri-ver's license or graduate from high school ...
things I look forward to and take for granted.&quot; Sean's death
is a grim, graphic reminder of the fine line dividing the
two-lane high-way of life and death.</p>

<p>Traveling to Mexico for many years on work projects with
teenagers, I've had many parents ask me important ques-tions such
as, Is it safe to drive in Mexico? Will my son or daughter be OK?
How many times have you taken students on long driving trips?
What kinds of cars are you driving in? Hearing questions like
those, I've been able to make a sim-ple observation: Your parents
are concerned about your safety. VVhenever you get in a car, they
want to be sure that you'll get out safely.</p>

<p>Not only are your parents concerned about your safety, but so
is God. When you get behind the wheel of a car or hop in a car
loaded with your friends, choosing life means doing all the stuff
your folks remind you about: wearing seat-belts, not picking up
hitch-hikers, no stunt-car driving or Mario Andretti aspirations.
Safe driving is a practical way to choose life so you can
experience all the life God has pre-pared for you.</p>

<p>THE STRATEGY</p>

<p>Think about someone you know who has been injured or was
killed in a car accident. Not a very pleasant thought, is it?
What were the conditions surrounding the accident? Who was at
fault? How could the accident have been avoided? How could safer
driving have made a difference?</p>

<p>No one ever thinks, 'Oh, I think I'll go get in a car wreck
today.&quot; Accidents happen when we least expect them. That's
why it's critical to make decisions that choose life and not
death. Here are a few things to think about when getting into a
car:</p>

<p>Are all four wheels on the car?</p>

<p>Who's driving?</p>

<p>Does the car have a spare tire?</p>

<p>What are the road conditions?</p>

<p>Is the car working properly?</p>

<p>Does the driver have insurance?</p>

<p>Has the driver ever been cited for speeding or car acci-dents?</p>

<p>What kind of reputation as a driver does the person behind the
wheel have?</p>

<p>Does the car have airbags?</p>

<p>Does your friend have permission to be driving?</p>

<p>Is the car stolen?</p>

<p>If I&#146;ve told you once, I&#146;ve told you a thousand
times: you&#146;re not going to the rock concert AND THAT IS

<p>THE SITUATION</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, is this Mrs. Green? This is Mark and Brian from
the KLOS Radio Morning Show.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, this is Mrs. Green. Can I ask what you're calling
about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Green, yesterday we received a phone call from your
son, Jeremy. He told us that you won't let him go to the upcoming
Guns &amp; Roses concert. He called to ask us if we'd give you a
call to convince you to let him go.&quot;</p>

<p>'Jeremy and I have already discussed this concert many times.
I told him that I think he's too young for concerts and that he's
not going.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh come on, Mrs. Green! One rock concert isn't going to
destroy your son's life. Not every kid is on drugs and alco-hol,
you know?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The answer is no. I've already told Jeremy why I don't
want him to go. Besides, the tickets are too expensive. I won't
pay for something I don't support.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Tell you what, Mrs. Green, if you letieremy go to the
concert, KLOS will give him two Guns &amp; Roses tickets for
free! It won't cost you a nickel.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, Mom! Free concert tickets! PLEEEAASSEE ... Can I
go?&quot;</p>

<p>'Jeremy, is that you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I'm on the other line.&quot;</p>

<p>'Jeremy, I don't like this one bit. We've already discussed
this. If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times,
you're not going to the concert, and that's final!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Mrs. Green, Mrs. Green, what if we throw in a limo and
an escort?&quot;</p>

<p>Click.</p>

<p>THE SCRIPTURE</p>

<p>The father of a righteous man has great joy; he who has a wise
son delights in him. May your father and mother be glad; may she
who gave you birth rejoice!</p>

<p>Proverbs 23:24-25</p>

<p>The story you've just read is true. The names have been
changed to protect the innocent and to keep me from get-ting into
trouble. Yes, the Mark &amp; Brian Show did call Mrs.Green, and
she wasn't too happy about it. Little did she real-ize that she
was being listened to by thousands of L.A. commutors on their way
to work. Knowing when to accept defeat will keep you from chafing
your parents raw with incessant pleas and bargains in order to
get your way. Knowing when to accept defeat will also keep you
from getting grounded. Jeremy was clever; the only problem was
that he was clue-less about how far he could push his mom.
Needless to say, Jeremy got shafted for his creative KLOS stunt.
Mrs. Green had drawn her line in the sand, and Jeremy had
attempted to cross it. Jeremy did not know how to accept defeat.</p>

<p>There are going to be numerous times when you and your folks
don't agree on what kind of clothes are acceptable, who you pick
for friends, what curfew time should be, when you can date, and
hundreds of other decisions you wish you could make without their
input or advice. Sometimes your parents will tell you exactly
what their final decision is, with reasons that aren't crystal
clear. Then, like The Shad, they'll head for the rim with a
fitfully-extended, 360 degree slam-dunk &quot;and that's
FINAL!&quot;</p>

<p>When the discussion ends with a period, you have the choice to
accept defeat or to try to throw in your own excla-mation point.
Exclamation points don't earn extra points. So what do you do?
Realize that sometimes you win and some-times you lose. The Bible
says to make your parents glad they gave birth to you. That's why
God wants you to be cool to your parents instead of a drag to
them. Accepting defeat shows them you're old enough to handle
things in a mature way, even when it means backing down from
something you really want to do. People who don't know how to
accept defeat are setting themselves up for big disasters. Even
Mark and Brian had to accept defeat.</p>

<p>THE STRATEGY</p>

<p>When do you have the hardest time accepting defeat from your
parents? What was the last situation that caused the most
disagreement between you and them? How did the sit-uation resolve
itself? What did you learn from it? To better understand what
tangles your relationship with your parents, write down the
things that you most often disagree about, like you did in
chapter five. Then write down your position and the reasons why
you feel like you do. Next write down your parents position and
the reasons why they feel like they do. Compare what you just
wrote. What possible options do you have that you might not have
considered? Is there any way that either side could compromise?
What would be the best resolution, a win/win solution, to you and
your parents' differences? After you've looked at every possible
angle of the situation, and when you aren't in the heat of
battle, go talk to your parents about what you wrote and see if
you can reach some agreement in these areas.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Breaking Your Comfort Zones<br>
And 49 other extremely radical <br>
ways to live for God<br>
</b></h2>

<p><b>&quot;Comfort Zones&quot; are selfish little spaces where
you can zone out, veg out, space out and turn into a spiritual
Jabba the Hut. Don&#146;t go there! Incredible spiritual
adventures await when you start breaking your comfort zones. When
you let yourself slip into cushy cocoons you aren&#146;t living
dangerously for God. You&#146;re not on the edge where he wants
you to be. In this book, you&#146;ll read about other teenagers
like you who struggle everyday with temptations and bad habits
but yet truly desire a radical relationship with God.</b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Joey O&#146;Connor</li>
</ul>

<p>Between guys and girls, it's usually the guys who get blamed
for being hormonally hungry and sexually aggressive. Sorry gals,
not this time.</p>

<p>Jeremy is a junior in high school, a good-looking, goofy
surfer guy. Jeremy&#146;s also excited about his faith in God and
has made a significant commitment to follow Christ even though
his surfer friends think differently. He's been involved in the
hi h school ministry for three years, and by staying plugged into
the ministry, Jeremy&#146;s developed a lot of friends who
encourage one another to take a radical stand for Jesus.</p>

<p>This past summer, after hanging out at the beach all day,
Jeremy and a girl/friend (that's girl-SLASH-friend ... they
weren't dating) went to his house to get something to eat. Jeremy
and Lisa had some snacks and then sat down to watch television.
What Jeremy didn't know was that Lisa liked him and wanted to
develop a much closer relationship. What Lisa didn't know was
that because of Jeremy is commitment to Christ, Jeremy had set
some sexual standards that were different than hers. Lisa was on
fire for Jeremy, but Jeremy was on fire for God. As they were
watching television and drinking sodas, Lisa hinted in a subtle,
nonaggressive way about her true feelings for Jeremy:
&quot;Jeremy, would you like to make love to me?&quot;</p>

<p>While most guys would have spewed Pepsi through their nostrils
at a question like that, Jeremy jumped all over Lisa with a
different approach.</p>

<p>&quot;Whattaya talking about, Lisa? No way ... we don't need
to do that!&quot;</p>

<p>Grabbing his Bible, Jeremy sat down and began sharing with
Lisa how a personal relationship with God is far more fulfilling
than the temporary pleasures of sex. Lisa, who didn't know God,
wanted a very personal relationship with Jeremy. Instead of
taking advantage of Lisa's offer, Jeremy took a radical stand for
God. By keeping Christ first in his life, Jeremy avoided hurting
God, Lisa, and himself by giving in to temptation. That's
standing on the edge for Jesus. I'd score Jeremy a perfect
&quot;IO&quot; for breaking his comfort zones.</p>

<p>The devil led him to Jerusalem and had him stand on the
highest point of the temple. &quot;if you are the Son of
God,&quot; he said, &quot;throw yourself down from here. For it
is written: 'He will command his angels concerning you to guard
you carefully; they will lift you up in their hands, so that you
will not strike your foot against a stone.&quot;' Jesus answered,
&quot;It says: 'Do not put the Lord your God to the test.&quot;'</p>

<p>Luke 4:9-13</p>

<p>Lisa's sexual aggressiveness toward Jeremy is the type of
thing a lot of teenage guys fantasize about happening to them. If
you're a guy wishing you knew someone like Lisa, don't be fooled.
Sexual promiscuity doesn't make you more confident, self-assured,
and secure in a relationship. More often than not, being sexually
active in a dating relationship produces feelings of insecurity,
guilt, sexual confusion, and regret once the relationship is
over. Students who hop from one sexual relationship to the next
never develop the critical skills needed for long-term, stable
relationships.</p>

<p>Jeremy isn't perfect, and his decision to take a stand for God
doesn't guarantee that he'll always make good sexual decisions.
My prayer is that Jeremy will continue to make positive sexual
decisions and that God will continue to provide Jeremy the
strength he needs to stand for him.</p>

<p>Taking a stand for God means being willing to stand against
temptation. In Luke 4, the devil tossed out many tantalizing
temptations to throw Jesus off course. On top of the temple,
Jesus was faced with taking a stand for God or falling for
Satan's tricks. Satan offered Jesus food, pleasure, power, and
even safety from a swan dive off the top of the temple. But Jesus
knew better ... the momentary satisfaction of self-centered sin
could have eternal consequences.</p>

<p>For forty days and nights, Jesus faced every imaginable
temptation, but the Bible only tells us of three. How many other
temptations did Jesus have to endure? If you struggle with sexual
temptation, then you aren't abnormal or alone. Jesus understands
what you're going through and he wants to provide you a way out.
If you want to stand firm against sexual temptation or any other
sin that's constantly nipping at your heels like an ugly,
overgrown rodent (or poodle), here are some ideas that might
help:</p>

<p>(1) Ask yourself, &quot;What temptations do I struggle with
most? &quot; The first step to steering clear of temptation is
knowing the type of weeds that grow in your spiritual garden.</p>

<p>(2) Avoid temptations that trip you up. Don't put yourself in
situations or environments that cause you to stumble.</p>

<p>(3) Apply God's Word to temptation. For every temptation Jesus
faced, he bonked Satan upside the head with a scriptural 2 by 4
he learned, memorized, and used to stand strong. (4) Ask others
for help. You can stay strong by asking a friend to stand with
you in your struggle against sin. Christianity is meant to be
lived with others, not alone. Though you may face temptations
when you're all by yourself, knowing that others are standing
with you and praying for you can make all the difference in the
world.</p>

<p>Take a few minutes to write out a game plan for taking on
temptation. Temptation will always try to keep you inside your
comfort zones. By God's Spirit, you can send those suckers right
back over to Satan's side. When you're done, spend some time
praying for God's strength to stand with Jesus.</p>

<p>1. Ask yourself, &quot;What temptations do I struggle with
most?&quot;</p>

<p>2. Avoid temptations that trip you up. What kind of situations
contribute to crumbling in your faith instead of standing?</p>

<p>3. Apply God's Word to temptation. Engrave these verses on
your heart: Proverbs 4:23, 1 Corinthians 10:13, James 1:5, Mark
14:38, Romans 12:21.</p>

<p>4. Ask others for help. Who is someone you can talk to and
pray with?</p>

<p>Jumps, Bumps, and Thumps</p>

<p>&quot;Who's going to go first? we cried, after eyeing a mogul
that we thought would make a good ski jump.</p>

<p>&quot;I will! &quot; yelled Dave, as he pushed off with his
skis and poles. Dave picked up speed going down the hill, hit the
jump, and landed, gliding to a smooth stop.</p>

<p>Trevor, Ian, and I stood a hundred yards ahead of him eagerly
anticipating our turn.</p>

<p>&quot;My turn,&quot; Trevor hooted, as he initiated his first
turn to set up for the jump. Ian and I watched as Trevor pushed
and pumped his way down the hill, his ski poles generating more
and more speed.</p>

<p>&quot;He's going pretty fast, &quot; Ian commented, as we
watched Trevor make his final approach to the jump. Almost twenty
feet before the jump, Trevor made his last turn, racing toward
the smooth launch pad, but as he did, his right ski caught the
inside edge. Thrown off balance, Trevor attempted to recover and
get his skis in line. (How does the line go? But to no avail ...</p>

<p>Now a spinning, exploding wave of snow, Trevor blasted
sideways off the jump, his body thrown out of control, his speed,
momentum, and weight determining the chaos yet to come. The
little girl came first. As a sweet, innocent eight-year-old
smoothly snowplowed down the hill, Trevor blindsided her like a
ferocious freight train clobbering a helpless Hyundai. After
nailing the little girl, Trevor, the screaming snowball of
disaster, blasted on and took out her father right at the knees.
The accident, on par with ABC's Wide World of Sport&#146;s agony
of defeat maneuvers, didn't look good. Nobody was getting up.</p>

<p>Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up. </p>

<p>James 4: 1 0</p>

<p>The accident scene was a mess. The little girl was screaming,
&quot;Daddy! Daddy! Are you okay?&quot; The father was in agony,
holding his knee, struggling to keep from screaming. Ian, who had
skied down the hill to get the ski patrol, was now getting chewed
out by the man's wife, who had witnessed the whole accident from
the ski lodge. Physically unhurt, but with his pride severely
wounded, Trevor quietly sat in the snow as the ski patrol took
control of the scene.</p>

<p>Admitting fault can be hazardous to your pride. Especially
when someone gets hurt and it just so happens to be your fault.
Trevor wasn't planning on catching an edge, losing his balance,
and becoming a human bowling ball. The strike he scored was a
strike against him.</p>

<p>Later, when everyone was down in the ski patrol office, Trevor
apologized to the man he'd hit, who was now heading to the
hospital. Hanging his head low and apologizing profusely, he
tried to explain what had happened. One of the ski patrol men got
Trevor's attention, then asked the injured man if he wanted to
press charges for the accident. Trevor got a panicked look on his
face. Generously, the injured man said, &quot;No, that's okay. If
I was his age, I probably would have done the same thing. It
takes a man to say you're sorry and own up to making a
mistake.&quot; Like that, Trevor was off the hook. According to
state law, the man could have pressed charges against Trevor for
causing the accident. Maybe if Trevor hadn't humbled himself,
admitted his mistake, and asked for forgiveness, the man might
have thought differently.</p>

<p>Admitting you're wrong, even when it is an accident, takes
courage most people don't have. Taking responsibility for your
mistakes gives you a shot at receiving forgiveness. Receiving
forgiveness and pardon is a whole lot better than getting charges
pressed against you. It also prevents selfish pride from taking
control of your life. Yes, owning up is a thump against your
pride, but it could be the jump you need to get you out of your
comfort zone.</p>

<p>How has your pride gotten you into trouble? When was a time
you were injured or had your feelings hurt by someone, and they
wouldn't admit they were wrong? How did that make you feel? Read
these verses about pride and humility. Consider how God wants you
to break your comfort zones by becoming a person of humility.</p>

<p>When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with humility comes
wisdom.</p>

<p>Proverbs 11:2</p>

<p>Before his downfall a man's heart is proud, but humility comes
before honor.</p>

<p>Proverbs 18:12</p>

<p>Do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, but in
humility consider others better than yourselves.</p>

<p>Philippians 2:3</p>

<p>Who is wise and understanding among you? Let him show it by
his good life, by deeds done in the humility that comes from
wisdom.</p>

<p>James 3:13</p>

<p>Focusing Your Fears</p>

<p>&quot;Where's Tiffany! someone screamed as our six-person raft
smashed through a second huge, foaming wall of churning water.</p>

<p>&quot;Don't stop paddling! &quot; Craig, our river guide,
yelled back as we blasted our soaking wet way through the
bone-chilling, fear-provoking rapid we had nervously anticipated
tall day: Satan's Cesspool.</p>

<p>Thankful that its smell didn't live up to its name, Satan's
Cesspool is one of the most difficult rapids on the South Fork of
the American River. This monster rapid is a
Full-Cycle-Deep-Rinse-Scrub-Sucking-Vortex-Maytag-X-1000-Hang-You-Out-to-Dry-Special.
It's the heart-stopping, adrenaline-dripping type of rapid
that'll rinse out even the most stubborn earwax. The type of
rapid you don't want to fall in.</p>

<p>Heading into the rapid, Tiffany, wearing a bright red life
jacket, was sitting on the middle right side of the boat directly
in front of me. As Craig shouted directions and commands, we
plunged down the steep drop and rushed up a steep wall of water
banking off a rock.</p>

<p>&quot;Hard right!&quot; Craig screamed.</p>

<p>Paddles dug in. Spraying water eliminated any clear sense of
direction. Hoots and hollers shrieked over the thundering rapids.
Making a sweeping, banking arc off the pounding wall of water,
the left side of the raft went high. The three helpless gravity
victims on the lower right side of the raft struggled to hang on.
At least two of us did.</p>

<p>Kerplop!</p>

<p>Not realizing the powerful hydrodynamics of white-water
rafting, Tiffany flipped off the right side of the raft quicker
than you can say Whirlpool Washer. Ejecting out back first, feet
flailing over her head, she looked like a frogman diving off for
a reconnaissance mission. Nice technique!</p>

<p>Immediately, we blasted into the second foaming turn, but I
didn't see Tiffany break the surface. Was she behind us? In front
of us? All of a sudden, in the middle of the second turn, I saw a
round lump pop up through the gray rubber bottom of the raft and
then disappear. (Remember, we're still battling this carbonated
sucker of a rapid.) Again, the lump appeared, making a round
impression from underneath the raft's bottom.</p>

<p>Oh no, I thought to myself. That's Tiffany trying to come up
for air!</p>

<p>But Jesus immediately said to them: &quot;Take courage! It is
1. Don't be afraid.&quot; &quot;Lord, if it's you,&quot; Peter
replied, &quot;tell me to come to you on the water.&quot;
&quot;Come,&quot; he said. Then Peter got down out of the boat,
walked on the water and came toward Jesus. But when he saw the
wind, he was afraid and, beginning to sink, cried out,
&quot;Lord, save me!&quot;</p>

<p>Matthew 14:27-30</p>

<p>Peter and the rest of the disciples are white-water rafting on
the sea of Galilee. A storm has snuck up on them, brewing a bit
of a Satan's Cesspool. In surfing terms, the disciples are
getting thrashed. Pounded. Worked. Ready to circle the drain. All
of a sudden, through the pounding waves, Jesus appears and tells
them not to be afraid. There's no need to fear, he's with them.
Peter's so excited to see Jesus that he asks for barefoot surfing
lessons. As his toes are getting wet walking to Jesus, Peter
pulls a Tiffany maneuver. Seeing the surging waves and
salt-spraying wind, Peter flips out and begins to sink.</p>

<p>When have your fears made you take your eyes off Jesus? What
has happened in the past week that has caused you to sink instead
of stand in your faith?</p>

<p>You can focus your fears, seeing them in God's perspective,
when you put your eyes on Jesus. Sometimes that's really hard to
do. You can't physically see Jesus. You can't grab his hand and
hold on tight. Especially when you're underneath a raft trying to
come up for air.</p>

<p>just like Tiffany bumping her head on the bottom of the raft,
fear can make you feel like you're never coming up for air. Fear
chokes out faith. it sucks away at faith like the churning waters
of Satan's Cesspool. Fear keeps you focused on your difficulties,
problems, and circumstances. It does anything it can to keep your
attention off Jesus, the very One who wants to ease your fears.
Your faith in Christ is like Tiffany's life jacket. When you're
under pressure, getting held down by pounding waves, your faith
is what helps you break the surface of the water. Faith in Christ
gets oxygen to your fear-filled heart. Jesus doesn't promise to
take away all your problems and struggles, but he does promise to
give you his presence and his peace in the midst of your fears.
&quot;Take courage! It is I. Don't be afraid.&quot; Go ahead,
flush your fears. Focus your eyes on Jesus.</p>

<p>Getting a permanent press dunking in Satan's Cesspool a
fear-inducing experience few people look forward to. is</p>

<p>The same is true if you experience the same types of fears as
so many other teenagers: Will I make friends at my new school
this year? Will she say yes or no if I ask her out? Will I get
beat up after school again? is my dad going to come home drunk
again tonight? Am I pregnant? Do people really like me?</p>

<p>God wants you to live in his peace and not fear. What is a
specific fear that keeps you in your comfort zones, the kind that
takes your eyes off God? How can you give God your fears today so
you can get back in the boat and head toward smoother waters?
Sometimes it takes awhile to pry our fingers off our fears. Let
Jesus help you with that important process today. He wants you to
live in his freedom. Not fear.</p>

<p>PS. After swallowing 3.5 gallons of the American River,
Tiffany finally popped up and was quite thankful for her faith,
er ... life jacket.</p>

<p><b>A young adult&#146;s guide to a meaningful future. Poised
on the edge of their future, young adults face crucial questions
about identity, education, marriage, career, God&#146;s will,
life&#146;s meaning, and much more. &quot;In the blink of an
eye,&quot; says Dr. James Dobson, &quot;this generation will
inherit the businesses, institutions, and governments of the
world.&quot; Are you prepared to meat the challenge? You can be.
Life on the Edge is a book that helps young adults make right
choices, get control of the lives and look forward to a
meaningful future.<br>

    <li>By Dr. James Dobson</li>
</ul>

<p>If you are between sixteen and twenty-six years of age, this
book is written specifically for you. Others are welcome to read
along with us, of course, but the ideas are aimed directly at
those moving through what we will call the &quot;critical
decade.&quot;</p>

<p>Some of the most dramatic and permanent changes in life
usually occur during those ten short years. A person is
transformed from a kid who's still living at home and eating at
the parents' table, to a full-fledged adult who should be earning
a living and taking complete charge of his or her life. Most of
the decisions that will shape the next fifty years will be made
in this era, including the choice of an occupation, perhaps the
decision to marry, and the establishment of values and principles
by which life will be governed.</p>

<p>What makes this period even more significant is the impact of
early mistakes and errors in judgment. They can undermine all
that is to follow. A bricklayer knows he must be very careful to
get his foundation absolutely straight; any wobble in the bricks
at the bottom will create an even greater tilt as the wall goes
up. So it is in life.</p>

<p>This momentous journey through the critical decade reminds me
of a trip our family took to Kenya and Tanzania a few years ago.
The highlight of our tour was a visit to the Serengeti, a
magnificent national park where legendary African animals roam
wild and free. It had rained all day before we arrived, and the
unpaved roads were extremely muddy. Before we had driven fifteen
miles into the park, our car slid into a ditch and bogged down to
the axles in thick, African mud. We would have certainly spent
the night out there on the savanna if it had not been for a
native in a double-wheeled truck who gave us a hand.</p>

<p>Later that afternoon we came to a stretch of road that was
even more torn up and muddy. There it divided and ran parallel
for several hundred yards before coming back together. It was
obvious that drivers earlier that day had forged the new trail to
get around a mudhole, but we had no way of knowing on which side
it lay. We sat there for a moment trying to decide which road to
take. If we made a mistake, we would probably get stuck again and
have to sleep in the car without dinner, toothbrushes, bathroom
facilities, or even water to drink.</p>

<p>Our seventeen-year-old son, Ryan, then volunteered to help.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll run ahead and look at the road,&quot; he said.
&quot;Then I'll wave to let you know which way to go.&quot;</p>

<p>The missionary who was with us said, &quot;Uhm, Ryan, I don't
think that is a very good idea. You just don&#146;t know what
might be out there in the tall grass.&quot;</p>

<p>Eventually we chose what looked like the best road and were
indeed able to get through. But when we reached the place where
the two tra ils came back together, a surprise was waiting for
us. A huge male lion was crouched in the grass off to one side.
He rolled his big yellow eyes toward us and dared us to take him
on. Large cats like that one consider humans to be just another
easy dinner. They can cover ioo yards in less than three seconds
and woul&amp;t hesitate to devour any city dweller who was
foolish enough to tempt them.</p>

<p>Ryan looked at the lion and agreed that he probably ought to
stay in the car!</p>

<p>BUT WHAT ABOUT THOSE MUDHOLES?</p>

<p>In a manner of speaking, our experience on the Serengeti
illustrates the passage from late adolescence to young adulthood.
The journey goes smoothly and uneventfully for some individuals.
They drive right through without a hitch. But a surprisingly
large number of us encounter unexpected &quot;mudholes&quot; that
trap and hold us at an immature stage of development. Still
others are plagued by predators lurking in the tall grass. Among
them are an addiction to alcohol or drugs, marriage to the wrong
person, failure to achieve a coveted dream, suicide, homicide, or
various criminal offenses. It is very easy to get off the trail
and into the ditch in the morning of our lives.</p>

<p>Permit me another illustration that comes to mind. I was
invited a few years ago to take a three-day whitewater rafting
trip down the Rogue River in Oregon. A friend and experienced
rafter, Dr. Richard Hosley, said to me as we were preparing to
launch the gear, &quot;One thing you'll soon learn is that the
river s always boss.&quot; I didn&#146;t know what he meant then,
but three days later I understood that principle very clearly.</p>

<p>Rather than floating on the raft for fifty miles in relative
serenity and safety, I chose to paddle along behind in a plastic
eight-foot canoe. And on the second afternoon, I insisted on
rowing this flimsy craft into the most treacherous part of the
river. It was a bad decision.</p>

<p>Ahead lay a section of the river known as the Coffeepot&quot;,
so named because the narrowing of the rock-walled banks create an
unpredictable, bubbling current that has been known to suck small
boats and their passengers below the surface without warning.
Several men and women have drowned in that precise spot, one of
them only the summer before. But ignorance is bliss, and blissful
I was.</p>

<p>I seemed to be handling the task quite well for the first few
minutes ... before everything came unraveled. Then I was caught
in the current flowing around a large rock and was capsized in
the turbulent water. It seemed like an eternity before I came to
the surface, only to find breathing impossible. A bandanna that
had been around my neck was now plastered across my mouth and
held there by my glasses, which were strapped to my head. just as
I clawed free and gasped f or air, churning water hit me in the
face and gurgled into my lungs. Again, I came up coughing and
sputtering before taking another trip 1 below the surface. By
then I was desperate for air and keenly aware that the Coffeepot
was only a hundred yards downstream.</p>

<p>A kind of panic gripped me that I had not experienced since
childhood! I definitely considered the possibility that I was
drowning.</p>

<p>You see, I have a nagging little habit of breathing every few
minutes and don't cope well when prevented from doing so. I knew
that getting sucked under again at that moment might be the end
of the line. My family and friends watched helplessly from the
raft as I bobbed through the rapids and into the narrowest
section of the river. They were unable to reach me because the
current had carried them farther downstream.</p>

<p>By using his incredible rafting skill, however, Dr. Hosley
managed to &quot;hold&quot; the raft by maneuvering it to an eddy
at the side of the river. There it spun until I caught up and
grabbed the rope that rims the upper exterior structure. I could
not pull myself into the craft because of the rapids, my soaked
clothing, and the distance of the rope above my head. That's why
I expected Dr. Hosley to help me aboard. Instead, I noticed that
he was struggling with the oars and looking very concerned. I
learned later what was worrying him. He feared that the large
raft would be thrown against the vertical rock walls bordering
the Coffeepot and that I would be crushed by its massive force.</p>

<p>Indeed, the raft was thrown against the wall, but I saw it
coming. Using all of the strength left within me, I pulled my
feet up and sprang off the rock, propelling myself high enough on
the raft to scramble on board. I then collapsed 'n the bottom of
the craft and stayed there sucking air for about thirty minutes.</p>

<p>The only casualty from the experience is a matter of
collegiate pride. Dr. Hosley was wearing a shirt with his beloved
Stanford University named across the front. It survived the trip.
But somewhere on the bottom of the Rogue River in dishonor lies a
watersoaked hat bearing the logo of the University of Southern
California. It was a sad moment in the historic rivalry of the
two schools. At least I didn&#146;t wind up lying on the rocky
bottom clutching my USC banner!</p>

<p>You can probably see how this story relates to our theme. Life
is like the beautiful Rogue River in some ways. There are long
stretches when the water is calm and serene. You can see your
reflection as you lean out of the raft. The scenery is gorgeous,
and the river carries you peacefully downstream. Then without
warning you are propelled into the white water. Suddenly, you're
gasping for air and struggling to keep your head above water. At
the moment when you think you might be drowning, you float right
into the turmoil of the Coffeepot.</p>

<p>Please understand that this WILL happen to you sooner or
later. No one travels down the river of life without encountering
turbulence. You might as well brace yourself for it. There will
be moments of serenity and beauty when you lean back and take in
the wonder. But there will also be times of sheer terror when
you'll be tossed out of the boat and at the mercy of the good
Lord. It's all part of the ride. That's why it is necessary
before those crises arrive to get yourself stabilized-to figure
out who you are and what you will do when the pressure is on.</p>

<p>THEY CALL IT THE &quot;CRITICAL DECADE&quot;</p>

<p>Your next ten years will pose hundreds of important questions
for which secure answers may be slow in coming. I struggled with
many of them when I was in college, such as, What will I do with
my life?</p>

<p>What kind of woman should I marry? Where will I find her? Will
our love last a lifetime? What are my strengths and weaknesses?
Should I plan to attend graduate school? Can I qualify for
admission? Am I talented enough to make it professionally? And
what about God? Where does He fit into my plans, and how can I
know His will? I recall pondering these questions and thinking
how helpful it would be to talk with someone who had a few
answers-someone who understood what I was facing. But like most
of MY friends, I never asked for help. The years rolled on, and I
gradually bobbed and weaved my way through the white water.</p>

<p>Of course, it was easier to go it alone when I was young. The
river was less turbulent in those years. I grew up in the
&quot;Happy Days&quot; of the fifties, when life was not as
complicated. There were no drugs in my racially mixed, public
high school. Can you believe it? Not once did I hear of anyone
selling or using illegal substances while I was a student there.
And very little alcohol was consumed by today's standards. None
of my friends made a habit of drinking. In fact, I went to
parties every Friday night after football games and rarely saw
booze being consumed. It happened, I'm sure, but primarily among
those who had a reputation for being on the wild side. There were
no punkers, no skinheads, no neo-Nazis, no freaks, no witches,
and no gay or lesbian activists in those days. And the music of
that era was pretty tame by comparison.</p>

<p>No doubt, some of my classmates lost their virginity during
their school years. Sex is not a recent discovery, and it was
certainly on our minds in those bygone days.</p>

<p>Obviously, some students did more than think about it. Every
now and then, a girl came up pregnant (it was called being
&quot;in trouble&quot; then), and she was immediately packed off
to some secret location. I never knew where she went. Still, the
idea of saving oneself for marriage made a lot of sense. Morality
was fashionable. Students who slept around were disrespected by
their peers.</p>

<p>Promiscuous girls were called &quot;slurs,&quot; and
promiscuous boys were said to be &quot;on the make.&quot; Couples
living together out of wedlock were &quot;living in sin&quot; or
&quot;shacking up.&quot; It never occurred to us that virginity
was a curse to be gotten rid of or that adults expected us to
copulate like animals in heat. That wicked notion would come
along in the modern era, when everyone from the school nurse to a
misguided surgeon general seemed to be chanting, &quot;Do it
often. Do it right. Use a condom every night.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, and most importantly, students in the fifties were
often receptive to spiritual influences. They were not all
Christians of course, but many of us were. Our faith shaped the
way we behaved, too. For example, God's name was rarely used
profanely. The punctuation of speech with vulgarity and
Irreverence did not become fashionable for most teenagers until
the late sixties, when it was popularized by decadent film and
television industries. They also taught many members of your
parents' generation to engage in casual sex and to disregard the
commandments of God. Many revolutionary changes occurred during
the late sixties when that generation of young adults suddenly
went a little crazy. They've paid a big price for it, too.</p>

<p>My point is that the world in which you live has become much
more immoral than it was just a few decades ago. It is not
uncommon now for twelve-year-olds to have babies and
fifteen-year-olds to shoot each other and seventeen-year-olds to
be addicted to hard drugs and eighteen-year-olds to be infected
with the AIDS virus. And violence has become a way of
life-especially for kids living in the inner city. A child in the
United States is fifteen times more likely to be killed by
gunfire than a kid growing up in Northern Ireland, which has a
long history of violence.' Some children have to sleep in
bathtubs at night just to be protected from drive-by shootings.
Yes, our culture has gone into a kind of moral free fall that has
implications for everyone who is young. Consequently, you are
forced to deal with pressures and temptations that previous
generations did not have to face.</p>

<p>One of the most important decisions to be made in the next few
years will focus on a life's work-and occupation-or a skill you
hope to develop. That choice is often extremely difficult. How
can you predict what you'll want to be doing when you're forty or
fifty or sixty years old? You're obligated to guess, based on
very limited information. You may not even know what the work is
really like, yet you enroll yourself in a lengthy academic
program to train for it.</p>

<p>The decisions you make under those circumstances may lock you
into something you will later hate. And there are social
pressures that influence your choices. For example, many young
women secretly want to be wives and mothers, but are afraid to
admit it 'in todays &quot;liberated&quot; society.</p>

<p>Furthermore, how can a girl plan to do something that requires
the participation of another person-a husband who will be worthy
of loving her and living with her for the rest of her life?
Marriage may or may not be in the picture for her. Yes, there's
plenty to consider 'in the critical decade.</p>

<p>I feel very fortunate to have stumbled into a profession when
I was young that I have been able to do reasonably well. If I had
been born in Jesus' time and had been required to earn a living
with my hands, perhaps in carpentry or stonemasonry, I would have
probably starved to death. I can see myself sitting outside the
temple in Jerusalem with a sign that read, &quot;Will work for
food.&quot; Craftsmanship is just not in nature. I earned my only
high school D in woodworking class, and that was a gift from my
teacher, Mr. Peterson. I spent an entire semester trying to make
a box in which to store shoeshine stuff What a waste! At least
that experience helped me rule out a few occupational abilities.
Carpentry and cabinetry were two of them.</p>

<p>THINGS TO CONSIDER WHEN CHOOSING A PROFESSION</p>

<p>You'll have to rule some things in and out, too. Indeed, to
make an informed decision about a profession, you'll need to get
six essential components together, as follows:</p>

<p>1. It must be something you genuinely like to do. This choice
requires you to identify your own strengths, weaknesses and
interests. (Some excellent psychometric tests are available to
help with this need.)</p>

<p>2. It must be something you have the ability to do. You might
want to be an attorney but lack the talent to do the academic
work and pass the bar examination. </p>

<p>3. It must be something you can earn a living by doing. You
might want to be an artist, but if people don&#146;t buy your
paintings you could starve while sitting at your easel.</p>

<p>4. It must be something you are permitted to do. You might
make a wonderful physician and could handle the training but
can't gain entrance to medical school. I went through a Ph.D.
program in graduate school with a fellow student who was washed
out after seven years of classwork. He made it to the last big
exam before his professors told him, &quot;You're out.&quot;</p>

<p>5. It must be something that brings cultural affirmation. In
other words, most people need to feel some measure of respect
from their contemporaries for what they do. This is one reason
women have found it difficult to stay home and raise their
children.</p>

<p>6. Most importantly for the genuine believer, it must be
something that you feel God approves of. How do you determine the
will of God about so personal a decision? That 's a critical
matter I&#146;II discuss presently.</p>

<p>What makes it so tough to choose an occupation is that all six
of these requirements must be met at the same time. If you get
five of them down but you don&#146;t like what you have selected,
you're in trouble. If you get five together but are rejected by
the required professional schools, you are blocked. If you get
five lined up but you can&#146;t earn a living at the job of your
choice, the system falls. Every link in the chain must connect.</p>

<p>Given this challenge, it isn&#146;t surprising that so many
young people flounder during the critical decade. They become
immobilized for years not knowing what to do next. They sit
around their parents' house plunking on a guitar and waiting for
a dish to rattle in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Young adults in this situation remind me of rockets sitting on
the launch pad. Their engines are roaring and belching smoke and
fire, but nothing moves. The spacecraft was made to blast its way
through the stratosphere, but there it sits as if bolted to the
pad. I've met many men and women in their early twenties whose
rockets just would not lift them off the ground. And yes, I've
known a few whose engines blew up and scattered the debris of
broken dreams all over the launch pad.</p>

<p>The mission sometimes falls because an individual refuses to
include God in his lofty lans. The Psalmist wrote, &quot;Except
the LORD build the house, they labor in vain that build it:
except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh but in vain.
(PS. 127:I KJV). Those words offer incredible meaning for those
of you who are just getting started in life. Whatever you try to
do, whether it is to build or defend, will be useless if you do
it in your own strength. That may sound very old fashioned, but I
promise you it is true. Furthermore, the Lord will not settle for
second place in your life.</p>

<h2>Darwin On Trial</h2>

<p><br>
<b>The controversial book that rocked the scientific
establishment! Why? It shows that the theory of evolution is
based not on fact but on faith -- faith in philosophical
naturalism. </b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Phillip E. Johnson</li>
</ul>

<p>IN 1981 the state legislature of Louisiana passed a law
requiring that if &quot;evolution-science&quot; is taught in the
public schools, the schools must also provide balanced treatment
for something called creation-science.&quot; The statute was a
direct challenge to the scientific orthodoxy of today, which is
that all living things evolved by a gradual, natural process-from
nonliving matter to simple microorganisms, leading eventually to
man. Evolution is taught in the public schools (and presented in
the media) not as a theory but as a fact, the &quot;fact of
evolution.&quot; There are nonetheless many dissidents, some with
advanced scientific degrees, who deny that evolution is a fact
and who insist that an intelligent Creator caused all living
things to come into being in furtherance of a purpose. </p>

<p>The conflict requires careful explanation, because the terms
are confusing. The concept of creation in itself does not imply
opposition to evolution, if evolution means only a gradual
process by which one kind of living creature changes into
something different. A Creator might well have employed such a
gradual process as a means of creation. &quot;Evolution&quot;
contradicts &quot;creation&quot; only when it is explicitly or
tacitly defined as fully naturalistic evolution -- meaning
evolution that is not directed by any purposeful intelligence. </p>

<p>Similarly, &quot;creation&quot; contradicts evolution only
when it means sudden creation, rather than creation by
progressive development. For example, the term
&quot;creation-science,&quot; as used in the Louisiana law, is
commonly understood to refer to a movement of Christian
fundamentalists based upon an extremely literal interpretation of
the Bible. Creation-scientists do not merely insist that life was
created; they insist that the job was completed in six days no
more than ten thousand years ago, and that all evolution since
that time has involved trivial modifications rather than basic
changes. Because creation-science has been the subject of so much
controversy and media attention, many people assume that anyone
who advocates creation&quot; endorses the &quot;young earth&quot;
position and attributes the existence of fossils to Noah's flood.
Clearing up that confusion is one of the purposes of this book. </p>

<p>The Louisiana statute and comparable laws in other states grew
out of the long-standing efforts of Christian fundamentalists to
reassert the scientific vitality of the Biblical narrative of
creation against its Darwinist rival. The great landmark in this
Bible-science conflict was the famous Scopes case, the
&quot;monkey trial&quot; of the 1920s, which most Americans know
in the legendary version portrayed in the play and movie Inherit
the Wind. The legend tells of religious fanatics who invade a
school classroom to persecute an inoffensive science teacher, and
of a heroic defense lawyer who symbolizes reason itself in its
endless battle against superstition. </p>

<p>As with many legendary incidents the historical record is more
complex. The Tennessee legislature had passed as a symbolic
measure a statute prohibiting the teaching of evolution, which
the governor signed only with the explicit understanding that the
ban would not be enforced. Opponents of the law (and some people
who just wanted to put Dayton, Tennessee, on the map) engineered
a test case. A former substitute teacher named Scopes, who wasn't
sure whether he had ever actually taught evolution, volunteered
to be the defendant. </p>

<p>The case became a media circus because of the colorful
attorneys involved. William Jennings Bryan, three-time Democratic
presidential candidate and secretary of state under President
Woodrow Wilson, led the prosecution. Bryan was a Bible believer
but not an uncompromising literalist, in that he thought that the
&quot;days&quot; of Genesis referred not to 24-hour periods but
to historical ages of indefinite duration. He opposed Darwinism
largely because he thought that its acceptance had encouraged the
ethic of ruthless competition that underlay such evils as German
militarism and robber baron capitalism. </p>

<p>The Scopes defense team was led by the famous criminal lawyer
and agnostic lecturer Clarence Darrow. Darrow maneuvered Bryan
into taking the stand as an expert witness on the Bible and
humiliated him in a devastating cross-examination. Having
achieved his main purpose, Darrow admitted that his client had
violated the statute and invited the jury to convict. The trial
thus ended in a conviction and a nominal fine of $ 100. On
appeal, the Tennessee supreme court threw out the fine on a
technicality but held the statute constitutional. From a legal
standpoint the outcome was inconclusive, but as presented to the
world by the sarcastic journalist H. L. Mencken, and later by
Broadway and Hollywood, the &quot; monkey trial&quot; was a
public relations triumph for Darwinism. </p>

<p>The scientific establishment was not exactly covering itself
with glory at the time, however. Although he did not appear at
the trial, the principal spokesman for evolution during the 1920s
was Henry Fairfield Osborn, Director of the American Museum of
Natural History. Osborn relied heavily upon the notorious
PiItdown Man fossil, now known to be a fraud, and he was
delighted to confirm the discovery of a supposedly pre-human
fossil tooth by the paleontologist Harold Cooke in Bryan's home
state of Nebraska. Thereafter Osborn prominently featured
&quot;Nebraska Man&quot; (scientific designation: Hesperopithecus
haroldcookii) in his antifundamentalist newspaper articles and
radio broadcasts, until the tooth was discovered to be from a
peccary, a kind of pig. If Osborn had been cross-examined by a
lawyer as clever as Clarence Darrow, and satirized by a columnist
as ruthless as H. L. Mencken, he would have looked as silly as
Bryan. </p>

<p>The anti-evolution statutes of the 1920s were not enforced,
but textbook publishers tended to say as little as possible about
evolution to avoid controversy The Supreme Court eventually held
the statutes unconstitutional in 1968, but by then the
fundamentalists had changed their objective. Creation research
institutes were founded, and books began to appear which attacked
the orthodox interpretation of the scientific evidence and argued
that the geological and fossil record could be harmonized with
the Biblical account. None of this literature was taken seriously
by the scientific establishment or the mass media, but the
creation-scientists themselves became increasingly confident that
they had a scientific case to make. </p>

<p>They also began to see that it was possible to turn the
principles of liberal constitutional law to their advantage by
claiming a right to debate evolutionists on equal terms in school
science classes. Their goal was no longer to suppress the
teaching of evolution, but to get a fair hearing for their own
viewpoint. If there is a case to be made for both sides of a
scientific controversy, why should public school students, for
example, hear only one side? Creation-scientists emphasized that
they wanted to present only the scientific arguments in the
schools; the Bible itself was not to be taught. </p>

<p>Of course mainstream science does not agree that there are two
sides to the controversy, and regards creation-science as a
fraud. Equal time for creation-science in biology classes, the
Darwinists like to say, is like equal time for the theory that it
is the stork that brings babies. But the consensus view of the
scientific establishment is not enshrined in the Constitution.
Lawmakers are entitled to act on different assumptions, at least
to the extent that the courts will let them. </p>

<p>Louisiana's statute never went into effect because a federal
judge promptly held it unconstitutional as an &quot;establishment
of religion.&quot; In 1987 the Supreme Court of the United States
affirmed this decision by a seven to two majority. The Louisiana
law was unconstitutional, said the majority opinion by justice
William Brennan, because its purpose &quot;was clearly to advance
the religious viewpoint that a supernatural being created
humankind.&quot; Not so, said the dissenting opinion by justice
Antonin Scalia, because &quot;The people of Louisiana, including
those who are Christian fundamentalists, are quite entitled, as a
secular matter, to have whatever scientific evidence there may be
against evolution presented in their schools, just as Mr. Scopes
was entitled to present whatever scientific evidence there was
for it.&quot; </p>

<p>Both justice Brennan and justice Scalia were in a sense right.
The Constitution excludes religious advocacy from public school
classrooms, and to say that a supernatural being created mankind
is certainly to advocate a religious position. On the other hand,
the Louisiana legislature had acted on the premise that
legitimate scientific objections to &quot;evolution&quot; were
being suppressed. Some might doubt that such objections exist,
but the Supreme Court could not overrule the legislature&#146;s
judgment on a disputed scientific question, especially
considering that the state had been given no opportunity to show
what balanced treatment would mean in practice. In addition, the
creation-scientists were arguing that the teaching of evolution
itself had a religious objective, namely to discredit the idea
that a supernatural being created mankind. Taking all this into
account, justice Scalia thought that the Constitution permitted
the legislature to give people offended by the allegedly dogmatic
teaching of evolution a fair opportunity to reply. </p>

<p>As a legal scholar, one point that attracted my attention in
the Supreme Court case was the way terms like &quot;science&quot;
and &quot;religion&quot; are used to imply conclusions that
judges and educators might be unwilling to state explicitly. If
we say that naturalistic evolution is science, and supernatural
creation is religion, the effect is not very different from
saying that the former is true and the latter is fantasy. When
the doctrines of science are taught as fact, then whatever those
doctrines exclude cannot be true. By the use of labels,
objections to naturalistic evolution can be dismissed without a
fair hearing. </p>

<p>My suspicions were confirmed by the &quot;friend of the
court&quot; argument submitted by the influential National
Academy of Sciences, representing the nation's most prestigious
scientists. Creation science is not science, said the Academy in
its argument to the Supreme Court, because </p>

<p>it fails to display the most basic characteristic of science:
reliance upon naturalistic explanations. Instead, proponents of
'creation-science&quot; hold that the creation of the universe,
the earth, living things, and man was accomplished through
supernatural means inaccessible to human understanding. </p>

<p>Because creationists cannot perform scientific research to
establish the reality of supernatural creation-that being by
definition impossible-the Academy described their efforts as
aimed primarily at discrediting evolutionary theory. </p>

<p>&quot;Creation-science&quot; is thus manifestly a device
designed to dilute the persuasiveness of the theory of evolution.
The dualistic mode of analysis and the negative argumentation
employed to accomplish this dilution is, moreover, antithetical
to the scientific method. </p>

<p>The Academy thus defined &quot;science&quot; in such a way
that advocates of supernatural creation may neither argue for
their own position nor dispute the claims of the scientific
establishment. That may be one way to win an argument, but it is
not satisfying to anyone who thinks it possible that God really
did have something to do with creating mankind, or that some of
the claims that scientists make under the heading of
&quot;evolution&quot; may be false. </p>

<p>I approach the creation-evolution dispute not as a scientist
but as a professor of law, which means among other things that I
know something about the ways that words are used in arguments.
What first drew my attention to the question was the way the
rules of argument seemed to be structured to make it impossible
to question whether what we are being told about evolution is
really true. For example, the Academy's rule against negative
argument automatically eliminates the possibility that science
has not discovered how complex organisms could have developed.
However wrong the current answer may be, it stands until a better
answer arrives. It is as if a criminal defendant were not allowed
to present an alibi unless he could also show who did commit the
crime. </p>

<p>A second point that caught my attention was that the very
persons who insist upon keeping religion and science separate are
eager to use their science as a basis for pronouncements about
religion. The literature of Darwinism is full of anti-theistic
conclusions, such as that the universe was not designed and has
no purpose, and that we humans are the product of blind natural
processes that care nothing about us. What is more, these
statements are not presented as personal opinions but as the
logical implications of evolutionary science. </p>

<p>Another factor that makes evolutionary science seem a lot like
religion is the evident zeal of Darwinists to evangelize the
world, by insisting than even non-scientists accept the truth of
their theory as a matter of moral obligation. Richard Dawkins, an
Oxford Zoologist who is one of the most influential figures in
evolutionary science, is unabashedly explicit about the religious
side of Darwinism. His 1986 book The Blind Watchmaker is at one
level about biology, but at a more fundamental level it is a
sustained argument for atheism. According to Dawkins,
&quot;Darwin made it possible to be an intellectually fulfilled
atheist.&quot; </p>

<p>When he contemplates the perfidy of those who refuse to
believe, Dawkins can scarcely restrain his fury &quot;It is
absolutely safe to say that, if you meet somebody who claims not
to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid or
insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).&quot;
Dawkins went on to explain, by the way, that what he dislikes
particularly about creationists is that they are intolerant. </p>

<p>We must therefore believe in evolution or go to the madhouse,
but what precisely is it that we are required to believe?
&quot;Evolution&quot; can mean anything from the uncontroversial
statement that bacteria evolve&quot; resistance to antibiotics to
the grand metaphysical claim that the universe and mankind
&quot;evolved&quot; entirely by purposeless, mechanical forces. A
word that elastic is likely to mislead, by implying that we know
as much about the grand claim as we do about the small one. </p>

<p>That very point was the theme of a remarkable lecture given by
Colin Patterson at the American Museum of Natural History in
1981. Patterson is a senior paleontologist at the British Natural
History Museum and the author of that museum's general text on
evolution. His lecture compared creationism (not
creation-science) with evolution, and characterized both as
scientifically vacuous concepts which are held primarily on the
basis of faith. Many of the specific points in the lecture are
technical, but two are of particular importance for this
introductory chapter. First, Patterson asked his audience of
experts a question which reflected his own doubts about much of
what has been thought to be secure knowledge about evolution: </p>

<p>Can you tell me anything you know about evolution, any one
thing ... that is true? I tried that question on the geology
staff at the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer
I got was silence. I tried it on the members of the Evolutionary
Morphology seminar in the University of Chicago, a very
prestigious body of evolutionists, and all I got there was
silence for a long time and eventually one person said &quot;I do
know one thing-it ought not to be taught in high school.&quot; </p>

<p>Patterson suggested that both evolution and creation are forms
of pseudo-knowledge, concepts which seem to imply information but
do not. One point of comparison was particularly striking. A
common objection to creationism in pre-Darwinian times was that
no one could say anything about the mechanism of creation.
Creationists simply pointed to the &quot;fact&quot; of creation
and conceded ignorance of the means. But now, according to
Patterson, Darwin's theory of natural selection is under fire and
scientists are no longer sure of its general validity.
Evolutionists increasingly talk like creationists in that they
point to a fact but cannot provide an explanation of the means. </p>

<p>Patterson was being deliberately provocative, and I do not
mean to imply that his skeptical views are widely supported in
the scientific community. On the contrary, Patterson came under
heavy fire from Darwinists after somebody circulated a bootleg
transcript of the lecture, and he eventually disavowed the whole
business. Whether or not he meant to speak for public
attribution, however, he was making an important point. We can
point to a mystery and call it &quot;evolution,&quot; but this is
only a label. The important question is not whether scientists
have agreed on a label, but how much they know about how complex
living beings like ourselves came into existence. </p>

<p>Irving Kristol is a prominent social theorist with a talent
for recognizing ideological obfuscation, and he applied that
talent to Darwinism in an essay in The New York Times. Kristol
observed that Darwinian theory, which explains complex life as
the product of small genetic mutations and &quot;survival of the
fittest,&quot; is known to be valid only for variations within
the biological species. That Darwinian evolution can gradually
transform one kind of creature into another is merely a
biological hypothesis, not a fact. He noted that science abounds
with rival opinions about the origin of life and that some
scientists have questioned whether the word &quot;evolution&quot;
carries much meaning. Kristol conceded that creation-science is a
matter of faith and not science, and should not be taught in the
schools, but he thought that its defenders still had a point: </p>

<p>It is reasonable to suppose that if evolution were taught more
cautiously, as a conglomerate idea consisting of conflicting
hypotheses rather than as an unchallengeable certainty, it would
be far less controversial. As things now stand, the religious
fundamentalists are not far off the mark when they assert that
evolution, as generally taught, has an unwarranted anti-religious
edge to it. </p>

<p>One famous evolutionist who might have been expected to be
sympathetic to Kristol's point would be Harvard Professor Stephen
Jay Gould. In 1980 Gould published a paper in a scientific
journal predicting the emergence of &quot;a new and general
theory of evolution&quot; to replace the neo-Darwinian synthesis.
Gould wrote that, although he had been &quot;beguiled&quot; by
the unifying power of the Darwinist synthesis when he studied it
as a graduate student in the 1960s, the weight of the evidence
had driven him to the reluctant conclusion that the synthesis,
&quot;as a general proposition, is effectively dead, despite its
persistence as textbook orthodoxy.&quot; The dogmatic teaching of
that dead textbook orthodoxy was precisely what Kristol was
criticizing. </p>

<p>Gould nonetheless wrote a reply to Kristol that put this
outsider firmly in his place. Gould denied that textbook bias was
more prevalent in evolution than in other fields of science,
denied that evolutionary science is anti-religous, and insisted
that &quot;Darwinian selection ... will remain a central focus of
more inclusive evolutionary theories.&quot; His main point was
that Kristol had ignored a &quot;central distinction between
secure fact and healthy debate about theory.&quot; Biologists do
teach evolutionary theory as a conglomerate idea consisting of
conflicting hypotheses, Gould wrote, but evolution is also a fact
of nature, as well established as the fact that the earth
revolves around the sun. </p>

<p>As an outside observer who enjoys following the literature of
evolution and its conflicts, I have become accustomed to seeing
this sort of evasive response to criticism. When outsiders
question whether the theory of evolution is as secure as we have
been led to believe, we are firmly told that such questions are
out of order. The arguments among the experts are said to be
about matters of detail, such as the precise timescale and
mechanism of evolutionary transformations. These disagreements
are signs not of crisis but of healthy creative ferment within
the field, and in any case there is no room for doubt whatever
about something called the &quot;fact&quot; of evolution. </p>

<p>But consider Colin Patterson's point that a fact of evolution
is vacuous unless it comes with a supporting theory. Absent an
explanation of how fundamental transformations can occur, the
bare statement that &quot;humans evolved from fish&quot; is not
impressive. What makes the fish story impressive, and credible,
is that scientists think they know how a fish can be changed into
a human without miraculous intervention. </p>

<p>Charles Darwin made evolution a scientific concept by showing,
or claiming to have shown, that major transformations could occur
in very small steps by purely natural means, so that time,
chance, and differential survival could take the place of a
miracle. If Darwin's scenario of gradual adaptive change is
wrong, then &quot;evolution&quot; may be no more than a label we
attach to the observation that men and fish have certain common
features, Such as the vertebrate body plan. </p>

<p>Disagreements about the mechanism of evolution are therefore
of fundamental importance to those of us who want to know whether
the scientists really know as much as they have been claiming to
know. An adequate theory of how evolution works is particularly
indispensable when evolution is deemed to imply, as countless
Darwinists have insisted, that purposeless material mechanisms
are responsible for our existence. &quot;Evolution&quot; in the
sense in which these scientists use the term is a mechanistic
process, and so the content of any &quot;fact&quot; that is left
when the mechanism is subtracted is thoroughly obscure. </p>

<p>In the chapters to follow I will look at the evidence to see
whether a mechanism is known that can accomplish the large-scale
changes which the theory of evolution supposes to have occurred,
such as the change from single-celled bacteria to complex plants
and animals, from fish to mammals, and from apes to men. If the
neoDarwinist mechanism will not do the job, and if instead of an
established replacement we have only what Gould and Kristol
agreed to call &quot;a conglomerate idea consisting of
conflicting hypotheses,&quot; then we may conclude that the
scientists do not in fact know how large-scale evolution could
have occurred. We will th en have to consider whether a
&quot;fact of evolution&quot; can be separated from Darwin's
theory. Our investigation will require us to explore the new
evidence revealed by molecular studies, the state of research
into the origin of life, and the rules of scientific inquiry. </p>

<p>Before undertaking this task I should say something about my
qualifications and purpose. I am not a scientist but an academic
lawyer by profession, with a specialty in analyzing the logic of
arguments and identifying the assumptions that lie behind those
arguments. This background is more appropriate than one might
think, because what people believe about evolution and Darwinism
depends very heavily on the kind of logic they employ and the
kind of assumptions they make. Being a scientist is not
necessarily an advantage when dealing with a very broad topic
like evolution, which cuts across many scientific disciplines and
also involves issues of philosophy. Practicing scientist are of
necessity highly sp ecial sized, and a scientist outside his
field of expertise is just another layman. </p>

<p>Access to the relevant scientific information presents no
great difficulty. Charles Darwin and T. H. Huxley wrote for the
general reader, and the same is true of the giants of the
neo-Darwinist synthesis such as Theodosius Dobzhansky, George
Gaylord Simpson, and Julian Huxley. Current authors who address
the general public and who are eminent among scientists include
Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Dawkins, Douglas Futuyma, and a host
of other experts who are named in the research notes to each
chapter. </p>

<p>Most of the professional scientific literature is available in
the premier scientific journals Nature and Science, the most
prestigious scientific organs in Britain and America
respectively, and at a some&#31;what more popular level in the
British New Scientist and the Scientific American. Philosophers
and historians have also produced well informed books. In short
the available literature is voluminous, and the leading
scientific figures have always assumed that nonscientist readers
can understand the essential evidence. But evidence never speaks
for itself; it has meaning only in the context of rules of
reasoning which determine what may be considered and what counts
as evidence. Those rules of reasoning are what I particularly
want to examine. </p>

<p>The last subject I should address before beginning is my
personal religious outlook, because readers are bound to wonder
and because I do not exempt myself from the general rule that
bias must be acknowledged and examined. I am a philosophical
theist and a Christian. I believe that a God exists who could
create out of nothing if He wanted to do so, but who might have
chosen to work through a natural evolutionary process instead. I
am not a defender of creation-science, and in fact I am not
concerned in this book with addressing any conflicts between the
Biblical accounts and the scientific evidence. </p>

<p>My purpose is to examine the scientific evidence on its own
terms, being careful to distinguish the evidence itself from any
religious or philosophical bias that might distort our
interpretation of that evidence. I assume that the
creation-scientists are biased by their precommitment to Biblical
fundamentalism, and I will have very little to say about their
position. The question I want to investigate is whether Darwinism
is based upon a fair assessment of the scientific evidence, or
whether it is another kind of fundamentalism. </p>

<p>Do we really know for certain that there exists some natural
process by which human beings and all other living beings could
have evolved from microbial ancestors, and eventually from
nonliving matter? When the National Academy of Sciences tells us
that reliance upon naturalistic explanations is the most basic
characteristic of science, is it implying that scientists somehow
know that a Creator played no part in the creation of the world
and its forms of life? Can something be non-science but true, or
does non-science mean nonsense? Given the emphatic endorsement of
naturalistic evolution by the scientific community, can outsiders
even contemplate the possibility that this officially established
doctrine might be false? Well, come along and let us see. </p>

<h2>Women Leaving The Workplace</h2>

<p><b>Parents have only one chance to raise their children. If
they squander that chance, most will regret it the rest of their
lives. Most of the Christian community have sanctioned the
concept that mothers should be at home when their children need
them. But we haven&#146;t done a very good job of teaching young
families how to accomplish this without destroying their finances
-- and sometimes their marriages. </b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Larry Burkett</li>
</ul>

<p>On our stay-at-home-mom survey we asked, &quot;Did your
husband support [your decision] or object to you quitting your
job?&quot; Ninety-two percent said their husbands heartily
supported their decisions. But that still leaves 8 percent who
either objected or flatly opposed the loss of their wives'
incomes. There are a myriad of reasons why a husband might object
to his wife, and mother of their children, quitting her job to
stay at home.</p>

<p>The first and most obvious reason: 'We can't make it on one
income.&quot;</p>

<p>The second reason: 'We would have to give up all the little
extras that make life livable.&quot; </p>

<p>The third reason: &quot;I just don't agree that our children
would be better off with my wife at home.&quot; (This is
particularly true if the husband came from a home where both
parents worked and he has never known another lifestyle.) </p>

<p>More than any other single factor in the last several decades,
the feminist movement of the sixties and seventies weakened the
perceived value of stay-at-home moms and promoted the ideal of a
working woman's worth. This concept meshed perfectly with the
liberal agenda of devaluing the family unit in general. Feminists
presented stay-at-home moms as the equivalent of an oppressed
minority. </p>

<p>This same liberal mentality has promulgated the use of
taxpayers' money in an attempt to solve all the social problems
of America. in reality, this philosophy further undermined the
family by raising the tax rates and pushing more women into the
work force. The burden put on families through these incessant
tax increases, to support &quot;entitlement&quot; programs, has
removed a major entitlement: a mother's right to stay home with
her children if she wants to. </p>

<p>The massive amounts of money necessary to fund welfare, urban
renewal,&quot; and other social experiments didn't just happen to
coincide with the feminist &quot;liberation&quot; movement. It
was part and parcel with the great &quot;sexual revolution.&quot;
</p>

<p>Does this mean there was a planned conspiracy to force women
(and mothers) out of the home and into the office? That's hard to
say with any degree of certainty, but the result has been just
that. It's sad that the feminists believe full-time mothers are
an oppressed minority in need of liberation. </p>

<p>The children are the losers and are not represented in this
great liberation movement. One must assume the feminists believe
that with social programs like Head Start in place children are
better off as wards of the state while their mothers work. More
than once, leaders of the feminist's movement have espoused the
idea that, indeed, children would be better off under the care
and supervision of &quot;professionals,&quot; rather than
full-time mothers who are throwbacks to the Ozzie and Harriet
era. </p>

<p>Therefore, it is not surprising that many men raised in the
sixties and seventies support the idea that wives should work-and
even expect them to. </p>

<p>The Christian community has done little to counter the
working-mother movement. And, in fact, Christian families have
about the same ratio of working wives and mothers as nonChristian
families do, if our surveys are reasonably accurate. More
recently, a significant trend back to full-time moms has
developed, but working mothers still significantly outnumber
full-time moms. </p>

<p>But, as I said earlier, the issue of whether mothers should
work will not be resolved in this book. So, the question then
becomes: &quot;What can a working mother who wants to stay home
do when faced with a reluctant or recalcitrant husband?&quot; </p>

<p>For those who are married to Christians, the appeal should be
made from a biblical perspective. For those who are married to
nonbelievers, most likely the decision will boil down to the
finances of the situation. I first would like to address the
Christian spouse. </p>

<p>The Biblical Basis Without getting too theological, I'd like
to link some biblical concepts together that deal with
husband/wife relationships. </p>

<p>Therefore, by scriptural definition, the following principle
applies: A husband and wife are to be one-respecting each other
as partners. If a wife has prayed about her decision to return
home and feels a peace from the Lord about it, and the husband
cannot point to some specific principle directing her not to do
so, he should yield to her spiritual discernment in this issue. </p>

<p>Conversely, a wife and mother who wants to continue working,
even though her husband would rather have her return home, must
also provide a clear biblical justification for continuing to
work. I firmly believe that a strong biblical case can be made
for mothers not to work outside the home while there are children
at home. But what about the other side? Can a case be made for
the mother working outside the home? Very possibly. </p>

<p>If financial commitments have been made based on two incomes
and there is no conceivable way they can be met by only one
working spouse, the commitment to honor a vow is the paramount
principle. We are told by Solomon that God requires us to honor
our vows. &quot;It is better that you should not vow than that
you should vow and not pay&quot; (Ecclesiastes 5:5). </p>

<p>Simply put, a working mother needs to make the necessary
adjustments in spending to pay down some of the debt before
quitting her job. This will help to defuse the argument of her
reluctant husband --that they cannot afford for her to quit. </p>

<p>In countering the arguments of a reluctant husband, one thing
is evident in the hundreds of letters I reviewed: Both husband
and wife must be willing to accept the changes in lifestyle that
result from the loss of one income. </p>

<p>All of the logical arguments (biblical or otherwise) for a
mother to stay home with her children are basically irrelevant if
the husband has his mind set against it-just as would be true if
the husband wanted his wife to return home and she were set
against it. So I clearly recognize that the arguments presented
here are for the benefit of women whose husbands are part of a
team looking for the best possible solutions. </p>

<p>If you are married to a man who simply cannot be persuaded by
any logical arguments (biblical or otherwise), you need to be
realistic. After you have made your feelings known and have
presented all the available facts, if your husband is still
intractable, you need to turn this area over to the Lord and let
Him do the convincing, in His timing. Many a reluctant husband
has been redirected by a godly wife who simply trusted the Lord
to change her husband's heart. </p>

<p>We&#146;ll be one income short </p>

<p>What about the argument, &quot;If we can't live on two incomes
now, how would we ever make it on just one?&quot; The truth is,
you can't ... unless some changes are made. As we discussed
previously, it really is a matter of priorities. Are the
conveniences and indulgences made possible by two incomes more
important than the investment that a mother can make in the lives
of the children? All too often in our society the indulgences win
out. </p>

<p>Eric wrote to share his experience as the husband of a
stay-at-home mom. He conclud&#31;ed that once the adjustment was
made they hardly noticed the difference. Most of us could testify
to this truth. Nicer homes, fancier cars, and expensive vacations
make virtually no difference in the social development of
children. </p>

<p>When Jennifer became pregnant, we were both working full time.
Our combined incomes came to over 50 thousand dollars per year It
was her conviction to be a 'Stay at home mom'. I reluctantly
agreed to her staying home part time-after all, we were the
typical fresh out of college couple, who, when we got a bunch of
money, knew how to spend it! We had a new house and two new
cars-and of course we had to have our weekly date! </p>

<p>&quot;After Brianne was born Jennifer cut back to three days a
week at the hospital It took some discipline, but we managed
fine. I began to get an attitude check about priorities after
going to a Youth Conflicts Seminar and got a financial attitude
check after reading your Financial Guide for Young Couples. God
put it in my heart to get out of debt in two years. </p>

<p>I believe He spoke greatly through your book, but He had also
put a great desire to preach and minister in me. I desired
greatly to go to Seminary, but knew our debt load made it nearly
impossible. We started 'tightening our belts more and paid the
last car note about a year later God sold our house (I didn't do
anything but pray and put a 'For Sale by Owner sign in the front
yard) and we were on our way to Seminary completely debt free.
There was just one problem: Brianne was four years old and my
crazy wife got the nutty notion to stay home with her FULL TIME! </p>

<p>&quot;You must understand the magnitude of this: not only
would I have to find a job that was able to keep us alive, but we
also had to pay for Seminary. Jennifer and I both had our minds
set to not borrow any money to do this, but frankly, I was very
skeptical -- I was counting on her working at least part time!
'We moved and God provided me a job two months later (we had
saved up enough to last us two months). Jennifer opted to stay
home and homeschool Brianne. After two years of Seminary I am
making 7 thousand dollars less than I was back home (28, 000/yr);
Jennifer is at home; we are debt-free,- we pay for Seminary
(except books, which are provided by our home church) in cash; we
have a 'rainy days' savings of approximately 600 dollars (so
far); and we even get to eat out pretty much when we want! </p>

<p>'Yes it can be done-praise God! </p>

<p>&quot;A Big PS, - We also give over 10% of my gross pay to the
church and donate to two other ministries!&quot; More often than
not, our problem is not a lack of money, it's a lack of faith. We
are told by James, &quot;You do not have because you do not
ask&quot; (James 4:2). And he goes on to say that sometimes we
ask with wrong motives. </p>

<p>Asking God to provide the resources to allow a mother to stay
home with her children is a right motive. Remember God delights
in doing the impossible. </p>

<p>Nicole, one of the women who responded to our survey, told of
her struggle with her husband. He was so adamant about her
continuing to work that he threatened to leave if she quit. </p>

<p>'I struggled with the guilt of packing my children off to a
sitter every morning. Then I just decided that if God didn't
change my husband&#146;s heart I would continue to work and learn
to accept it. It was a long difficult struggle. </p>

<p>&quot;Often I would cry all the way to the office where I
worked But after a while I began to feel a peace about my
position. I just prayed that God would be the protector of my
children. 'After all,'I told myself, 'there are millions of
mothers who work and their children seem to do okay.' But when I
would pick up my children and sometimes they would be crying over
some incident at the day care, my heart told me that being home
would be better. </p>

<p>&quot;But there was simply no other choice available to me,
and every time I mentioned it to my husband he would storm out of
the room. The thing that hurt most was that he told me he
wouldn't have married me if he had thought I wasn't willing to
pull my own weight. Often his parting words were, 'Sure, Id like
to stay home and loaf too, but if I have to work you have to
work'. </p>

<p>&quot;This went on for nearly another year until our youngest
daughter started school. Then one evening while we were eating
she asked a question about sex that no six year old should have
even known. My husband nearly choked at the graphic question, and
asked her, Where did you hear about that?'She replied, 'Oh some
of the boys at day care showed us. . . .' </p>

<p>&quot;My husband&#146;s attitude went from wild rage to
remorse. That night he said, 'You were right. It&#146;s time you
came home. I can't believe I've been so blind'. </p>

<p>&quot;I have been a stay-at-home mother for nearly two years
now, and I love it. We don't take the long vacations we used to,
and we don't trade cars (Or trucks) every two years, but our
children are doing so much better now. Tell all the mothers: You
can't lose by waiting on the Lord. </p>

<p>A word of caution</p>

<p>Several of the women who responded to our survey gave some
stern advice: &quot;Know your spouse well before undertaking this
decision.&quot; Some of them told of additional conflicts and
even divorces because of the changes in lifestyles after they
quit work. </p>

<p>One of the most common warnings was to look for the danger
signs and not be naive about the current trend in our society.
Some men (and women) simply are not willing to sacrifice their
lifestyles for their children, even if they know it's the right
thing to do. </p>

<p>This especially seems to be true in situations where the
husbands agree (mostly to avoid an argument) but are not really
committed to the process. Rather than be totally honest and admit
they don't want to make the adjustments, they go along but harbor
resentments. </p>

<p>Several women, looking back, said there were some key
indicators they ignored, such as comments like, &quot;Okay, if
YOU can make it work&quot;; or, &quot;I don't care if you quit
work, but don't expect me to give up my (bowling, drinking,
fishing).&quot; </p>

<p>It is unfortunate that there are some pretty self-centered
people in this world. I pray that you aren't married to one, but
sometimes even the best of people are; opposites attract. The
struggle of working a job while your heart is at home is very
difficult, but being a single parent is a lot worse. </p>

<p>If a husband is not willing to make the necessary adjustments
in lifestyle that will allow his wife to stay at home with their
children (assuming that is her desire), a woman should take that
as a sign of greater problems and seek spiritual and marital
counseling first. </p>

<p>As Jesus said in Luke 16: 1 0: Anyone who is not trustworthy
with money is simply not trustworthy (paraphrased). </p>

<p>I hesitated to address so many negatives, but I felt I would
be remiss not to address the dark side of leaving the work force
over a spouse's objections. </p>

<p>Alexis wrote us the heart-wrenching story of her husband's
betrayal. Probably he eventually would have left the marriage
anyway, but because she had left her career the situation was
made worse. </p>

<p>&quot;[After] our first child was born I stayed home for about
four years. My husband would tell me how much he enjoyed my being
home, but deep down he didn't. </p>

<p>&quot;I wish I would have gotten the stars out of my eyes and
really understood what my husband was trying to tell me before we
were married. He wanted things-a house-a car, etc. I wanted a
family, family togetherness. After ten years of marriage my
husband never really got what he wanted. </p>

<p>'When I stayed at home with the kids deep down he didn't like
it. Men I went back to work he wasn't happy because he said I
wasn't making enough money for someone with a degree. He went
back to school to get his masters degree... met a woman ... told
me he was in love with her .. and started spending his time with
her. I was about eight months pregnant. As I write this he has
filed for divorce. The baby is 3 months old. And I am looking for
a job.</p>

<p>'I feel like no one really respects stay at home moms. When
you have a job people look up to you, but when you do the same
job at home people act like you are lazy.</p>

<p>&quot;I hope you ask women to really be sure they understand
their husbands before they make the move ... and may God use
[your book] to bless women to have understanding and wisdom
(God&#146;s wisdom) to make the best choice for their families.</p>

<p>I'll pick up a letter (the last page of a four page letter)
from Kimberly, who told of her heartache after her husband also
left. </p>

<p>'I&#146;m sure I don't have to tell you how difficult it is to
enter the work force again after a 13 year absence. I can never
replace those lost years, lost earnings and career opportunities.
I cannot even pick up where I left off. Entry level, minimum wage
jobs are all that I can expect.</p>

<p>&quot;If I am blessed again with an opportunity for love and
marriage I will not put myself in that position of jeopardy
again. I know it will be a burden on my family life not to be a
work-at home wife and mom. But since I cannot count on the laws
to protect me, I must protect myself and any who are in my care
as best I can. Any women who think this could never happen to
them are especially at risk.</p>

<p>Fortunately, this is not the norm; it is the exception. To
balance this negative perspective, I would like to share one of
the many responses we received from supportive husbands of
full-time moms. As Rick testifies, God still speaks to men too.</p>

<p>'When our sons were ages 8 and 5, my wife Deborah was working.
With our combined salaries we were doing pretty well, making ends
meet and saving for the boy&#146;s education. We had about
$20,000 put aside for their elementary and secondary education
with plans to save more for college. &quot;One day Deborah said
she felt God was leading her to quit her job and stay home with
the boys. My first reaction was pure horror. I am a statistician
and was able to quickly figure out that not only would there be
no college in our boys' future, but we would go $5,000 in the red
annually without Deborah&#146;s salary, even with a frugal
budget. </p>

<p>&quot;We were already tithers and were active members of a
church. We went to see the pastor and, to my horror a second
time, he said he thought we should trust God: Deborah should quit
her job to stay home and raise Joshua and Jason. </p>

<p>&quot;Despite the loss of [Deborah&#146;s] income, we
continued to tithe. That&#146;s when God began to do miracles. On
one occasion we were within 24 hours of having our home
foreclosed. We had told no one. That night the assistant pastor
of the church handed us a check for $200. He said God had told
him we needed it. We needed exactly $200 to make the mortgage
payment. </p>

<p>&quot;On another occasion, we had about $ 1, 000 in debts that
urgently needed to be paid. We told no one. An elder of the
church handed us a check for $1,000 saying much the same thing
the assistant pastor had said.</p>

<p>&quot;Having Deborah at home with [the boys] made a tremendous
difference in their development. Joshua was a very slow learner
before then. He repeated every grade in school, even though he
was attending a private [Christian] school. He began to improve
his school work with his mother at home. Despite our tight
budget, we kept him and Jason in a Christian school with the
money we had set aside for their education. We refused to touch
that money for any other purpose and it paid off. </p>

<p>&quot;And what of college? We had no money for college, but we
didn't need it. Joshua decided on his own that he wanted to go
into the Army. The Army later paid for nearly all of his higher
education. Jason's grades were so good that he earned a full
academic scholarship for four years of college. He graduated from
college with high honors and has taken post-graduate courses too.
</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if things would have turned out so well if
Deborah hadn't stayed home with [our] children. I think I need to
share at least one more testimony-just for those husbands who
have that nagging doubt about giving up their wives'
&quot;security&quot; Kevin says that God is security enough. </p>

<p>&quot;My wife and I were married in 1984 .... and both worked.
We failed to do many of the things you recommended-we did not
save a significant amount of her income, did not live on a
budget, or practice good stewardship of the resources God had
blessed us with. </p>

<p>'We were the typical young couple with two nice incomes and no
children. We drove new cars, had nice new clothes, the latest
consumer technology, and basically spent money on what we pleased
without too much thought. To our credit, we did not run up any
significant amount of consumer or credit card debt. [My
wife&#146;s father] taught her not to rely on credit -- I'm glad!
</p>

<p>&quot;[Because of a major bank failure in our area] local real
estate values plummeted. We were shocked to discover that the
house we still owed $69,000 on was only worth $36,000. We were
stunned. Needless to say, we spent much time in prayer. We made
the decision to sell the house and pay off the debt. We did have
just enough money in savings and stock to cover the difference.
It left us with nothing to buy a new home with, however. </p>

<p>&quot;In the middle of this dark hour, God sent a ray of light
-- Patty learned that she was pregnant. </p>

<p>Immediately we were faced with a decision. Should Patty
continue to work after the baby was born? We really needed the
money. In our hearts, we both knew the right answer was no-Patty
needed to be a stay at home mom. The Lord blessed our commitment
to keep Patty at home. She was able to work through her 8th month
of pregnancy. We saved every penny she made [and] made a down
payment on the rent house we were living in. God provided me with
enough income to meet our needs. We saw miracle after miracle
happen in our lives.</p>

<p>I can say that we&#146;ve learned some wonderful lessons. God
has taken care of us and honored our commitment to keep Patty at
home. </p>

issues and ministry</b></font></p>

<p><b>Here is an honest, sincere, compassionate, and
knowledgeable treatment of current information on the problems
involving homosexuality in today&#146;s world. There is also an
appendix at the end of this excerpt listing a sampling a books by
various authors who have either personally dealt with
homosexuality or have ministered to them in a professional way.</b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>Edited by Michael Mazzalongo</li>
</ul>

<p>The debate over homosexuality and the Bible - specifically,
whether or not the Bible condemns homosexual acts in all cases -
will do no less than rip the body of Christ apart within the next
decade. It will force believers to declare, in black and white
terms, where they stand on issues of sexuality and biblical
interpretation. And the emotions generated during the debate
will, as always, color and cloud the issue.</p>

<p>You are already participating in the battle. Whether you're a
fighter, a family member impacted by a loved one's homosexuality,
or an interested party, at some point you'll be approached by
someone who will claim that Scripture doesn't forbid homosexual
practices. That person's argument will force you to give an
answer for your beliefs, part of which should include a response
to what I call the &quot;Pro-Gay Theology.&quot;</p>

<p>In essence, Pro-Gay Theology argues that, while the Bible is
authoritative, it is either not fully authoritative (it is
subject to error in certain social issues) or it has been
traditionally misinterpreted in the area of homosexuality. It is,
as I see it, a system of beliefs based on objections to the
traditional viewpoint of Scripture and sexuality.</p>

<p>&quot;Our pews are empty and our outdated attitudes about sex
have a great deal to do with it,&quot; complains Marvin Ellison,
professor of Christian Ethics at Bangor Theological Seminary in
Maine. The good professor would have us believe that our
attitudes toward sex should reflect those of our culture, that
filling pews is more vital than objective truth. Yet Dr. Greg
Bahnsen of the Southern California Center for Christian Studies
insists that &quot;when the church begins to look and sound like
the world, there is no compelling rationale for its continued
existence.</p>

<p>The dilemma of homosexuality for many Christians also fuels
the objections of many pro-gay advocates. They claim that their
attraction to the same sex feels perfectly normal and natural.
&quot;If it seems natural,&quot; they say, &quot;must it not
therefore be God-given?&quot;</p>

<p>While a specific scriptural response to this question is
detailed later, a general look at the question and a bit of
history will shed some light on the beliefs of the pro-gay
apologist.</p>

<p>The advent of the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan
Community Churches (UFMCC), founded in 1968 sparked a new
approach to homosexuality and religion. The UFMCC, attended
largely but not exclusively by self-identified Gay Christians,
claimed there was no conflict between homosexuality and
Christianity. The initial precepts that the church (and the
budding Gay Christian movement) was founded on were rather
general: God loves gays as much as He loves anyone else, the
gospel invitation is extended to everyone regardless of
orientation, and since gays found little refuge in the Christian
church at large, a new fellowship was needed to welcome them and
affirm their total personhood, homosexuality included.</p>

<p>They were right in many ways. God indeed loves gays as much as
anyone else, the gospel invitation is certainly open to them, and
the church's response to them has generally been very poor and
often hostile. Their interpretation of Scripture, however, causes
many Christians, myself included, to take serious issue with
their position. Their testimonies seem to show a pattern of
placing personal experience above biblical standards. &quot;If
I'm still gay after trying not to be,&quot; they seem to say,
&quot;then God must have made me this way and so there must be a
better way of looking at the Bible.&quot;</p>

<p>What lies behind such cavalier use of the Scriptures? Some
would say rebellion, others would say a reprobate mind. I say
it's deception.</p>

<p>Deception is an element of the end times which is seldom
stressed, usually because turmoil in the Mideast or ecumenical
trends steal the spotlight during discussions of Bible prophecy.
Yet deception is a recurring theme in both Christ's and Paul's
descriptions of the last days.</p>

<p>The disciples came to Him privately, saying... &quot;What will
be the sign of Your coming, and of the end of the age?&quot; And
Jesus answered ... &quot;Take heed that no one deceives you&quot;
(Matthew 24:3, 4).</p>

<p>Many false prophets will rise up and deceive many (Matthew
24:11).</p>

<p>So as to deceive, if possible, even the elect (Matthew 24:24).</p>

<p>God will send them strong delusion, that they should believe a
lie (2 Thessalonians 2:1 1).</p>

<p>Evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving
and being deceived (2 Timothy 3:13).</p>

<p>The deception of the end times, which for many reasons I
believe we're living in, has an easy target in those of us
indoctrinated by the self-love philosophy promoted in the 1970's
and solidified recently even in the church. This philosophy
expresses itself through a variety of modem heresies, including
the &quot;Name it and claim it&quot; teachings, the Positive
Confession Movement, and the Pro-Gay Theology. Particularly
vulnerable is the Christian with homosexual desires, who is often
seduced into thinking that seemingly natural inclinations are in
and of themselves justification for violating biblical standards.</p>

<p>When I was being interviewed by comedienne Joan Rivers on her
talk show, this philosophy came through to me with new clarity.
Regarding my stance on homosexuality, she asked me, &quot;But if
God gave us these feelings, how can it be wrong to express
them?&quot; She was sincere. Like many people, she assumed the
very presence of a feeling indicates its divine origins. &quot;If
it feels good, do it,&quot; we used to say. Today's version goes
several steps further. &quot;If it feels good, sanctify it!&quot;</p>

<p>Deception usually expresses itself in a challenge to God's
Word. &quot;Has God indeed said?&quot; the serpent intoned in
Genesis 3. &quot;Does the Bible really say?&quot; the liberal
theorist asks. Same song, second verse. And the appeal of
deception is usually to the area of life we are the least willing
to yield to God's authority.</p>

<p>That, as I see it, is why we are in the midst of this debate.
Below I've listed the most common points of pro-gay theology as
&quot;Objections,&quot; because they represent objections to
common views on homosexuality and Christianity. &quot;Respon ses
are also included. They will, I hope, be of help to you when your
biblical position is challenged. As always, you'll need to
include your own insights and observations.</p>

<p>General Objections</p>

<p>Objection 1. Jesus said, &quot;Come to me, all you who are
weary and burdened,&quot; not just &quot;Come unto me all you
that are heterosexual.&quot; The gospel is for everyone,
including gays.</p>

<p>Response. True, Christ's invitation is to everyone. Most
Christians who believe homosexuality is unnatural do not believe
that homosexuals cannot be saved - only that they, like all of
us, are called on to repent of all aspects of life that are
contrary to God's standards. (Remember that the first word of
Christ's public ministry recorded in Matthew 4:17 is
&quot;Repent.&quot;) We are all called to repent just as surely
as we are all called to salvation. Further, to say that no change
in behavior or heart is necessary after conversion is to deny the
very need for conversion in the first place. The Scriptures teach
that Christ takes us as we are, then begins to bring all areas of
our life, sexuality included, into subjection to Him, as modeled
in His conversation with a woman taken in adultery:</p>

<p>Jesus said to her, &quot;Neither do I condemn you (I take you
as you are]; go and sin no more&quot; [repent] (John 8: 1 1).</p>

<p>Objection 2. If gays didn't ask for their orientation, then
God must have created it, so how could He condemn it?</p>

<p>Response. There is nothing in Scripture to suggest that if a
thing seems natural it is inevitably God-given. But there is much
in Scripture which condemns many &quot;natural&quot; states and
desires:</p>

<p>The natural man does not receive the things of ... God (I
Corinthians 2:14).</p>

<p>[You] were [before conversion] by nature children of wrath
(Ephesians 2:3).</p>

<p>The carnal mind is enmity against God, for it is not subject
to the law of God, nor indeed can it be (Romans 8:7).</p>

<p>Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity (Psalm 51:5).</p>

<p>The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately
wicked; who can know it? Ueremiah 17:9).</p>

<p>Objection 3. The church has shown condemnation, not love, to
gays.</p>

<p>Response. True, in many respects. The problem here is not the
church's adherence to biblical principles, but the harsh way that
many Christians have promoted those principles (The Bible
condemns homosexual acts, so gays are horrible people) and the
church-sanctioned actions that have been taken against
homosexuals. This once held true for other areas of behavior as
well. For example, in Puritan times if a woman was found to have
gossiped, she was tied to a stool, dunked in a lake, and held
underwater for as long as a minute. Likewise, if a man neglected
his attendance at church, he was put into wooden stocks for
public humiliation. The problem was not the fact that the church
denounced gossip or lack of fellowship, but the cruel treatment
that people guilty of these things received. The answer is a
balanced, compassionate method of promoting biblical truth, not a
negating of that truth.</p>

<p>Objection 4. People use Bible verses to justify violence
against gays, so it's potentially harmful to quote the Bible when
criticizing homosexual behavior.</p>

<p>Response. The perverse use of certain Scriptures to justify
violence is nothing new, and is remedied by proper use, not
banishment, of those Scriptures. We wouldn't consider (I hope)
neglecting to teach the Scriptures in which Jesus claims to be
the only way to salvation because certain groups have used that
claim to persecute people of other faiths! If a book, like the
Bible, is misused, the problem is the misuse and not the tool
itself.</p>

<p>Objection 5. People are saved on the basis of their faith in
Christ, not their sexuality, be it homo or heterosexual.</p>

<p>Response. Affirming heterosexuality as the biblical norm is
not an implication that heterosexuality saves people, any more
than affirming the biblical injunctions against stealing does not
imply that honesty saves people. Salvation through Christ and
sexual morality are two distinct issues that should be kept
separate.</p>

<p>Objection 6. There are many openly gay Christians who love
God, experience spiritual realities, and have specific gifts and
callings just like other Christians.</p>

<p>Response. The presence of spiritual gifts, whether preaching,
evangelism, or any other gifts, is never an indication that the
person in whom those gifts are manifest is justified in all other
areas of life. Nor is the presence of God's Spirit in a believer
proof that the lifestyle of that believer is pleasing to God. A
quick glance at the experience of Christians from New Testament
times to the present shows that Christians can be subject to
serious error in belief or behavior and still manifest a
Christian testimony. The Galatian church had fallen into
legalism, the Ephesian church had lost its primary love for
Christ, and the Corinthian church had suffered schisms and
disorder in its assembly. Yet when these disorders were addressed
by Paul and by Christ Himself, there was no implication that
these churches were filled with unregenerate people. just as
their error in no way nullified their salvation, so their
salvation in no way nullified their error.</p>

<p>Objection 7. Jesus said, &quot;Do not judge, or you too will
be judged,&quot; so when you say that homosexuality is wrong,
you're guilty of being judgmental.</p>

<p>Response. Then we had better do away with huge chunks of the
Old and New Testaments, because they're both full of statements
about right and wrong. Jesus did teach that we cannot accurately
address someone else's sin without first addressing our own
(Matthew 7:14). But then He turns right around in Matthew 7:5 and
tells us that, having examined ourselves, we are to address their
sin! Additional commandments that He gave His disciples could
hardly be fulfilled without first discerning whether a person's
behavior was right or wrong (Luke 9:5; Mark 8:15; Matthew
18:15-19), and statements by other New Testament writers require
judgment on our part when dealing with church discipline,
doctrinal error, and social contacts (Romans 16:17, 1 Corinthians
5:3-5; Galatians 6:1; Ephesians 5:11; 1 Thessalonians 5:14; 2
Thessalonians 3:11-15; 1 John 4: 1).</p>

<p>Objection 8. The Bible teaches us that the main duty of man is
to love God first and then to love his neighbor as himself.
That's got nothing to do with our sex life.</p>

<p>Response. On the contrary, that has everything to do with our
sex life, as it has everything to do with every other part of our
life. The command to love God is not fulfilled just by feeling
love and reverence for Him, but by expressing our love in very
practical ways: &quot;Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with
all thy strength&quot; (Mark 12:30 KJV). Body and soul, mind and
strength - nothing less. If we are unwilling to conform to God's
will in any of these areas, then we have no business saying that
we love Him. The question isn't whether or not we claim to love
God, but whether or not our actions are in harmony with His
expressed will.'</p>

<p>Objection 9. The church used to believe that the Bible
justified slavery, subjugation of women, and other heinous
practices. If Christians were wrong about those issues, who's to
say they aren't also wrong about homosexuality?</p>

<p>Response A. Using that same logic, we'll have to abandon all
absolute views on anything for fear of being wrong.</p>

<p>Response B. Those who justified slavery by biblical passages
misread the passages, quite likely to suit their own prejudice.
Nowhere does the Bible commend slavery; rather, it acknowledges
its existence. Additionally, not all passages translated
&quot;servants&quot; mean literal &quot;slaves,&quot; but often
mean &quot;house servants&quot; or &quot;employees.&quot;</p>

<p>Objection 10. Writers of the Bible knew nothing about loving,
committed relationships between homosexuals. All they knew of
homosexuality was the kind that was practiced in temple
prostitution or idolatrous ceremonies, so of course they
condemned it in that context.</p>

<p>Response A. If the Bible was just another book of theories and
allegories this argument might stand. But if it is indeed
God-inspired, intended as a guide for belief and conduct, then it
is unthinkable that God - who is no respecter of persons - would
be so careless as to offer no guidance in His revealed Word to
the thousands of homosexuals He knew would exist throughout time,
if indeed their relationships were legitimate in His sight.</p>

<p>Response B. Even if it could be proven that there was no such
thing as a &quot;committed homosexual relationship&quot; in
biblical times, biblical authors such as David, Daniel, Ezekiel,
and John were prophetically inspired to write about things that
were to exist in the future as well as things that did exist at
the time of their writings. Surely, if homosexuality was
legitimate and natural, there would have been some reference to
homosexual relationships in the future, if not the present.</p>

<p>Specific Scriptural Objections</p>

<p>But if I were a Christian homosexual, I think this one
question would disturb me most: am I trying to interpret
Scripture in the light of my proclivity, or should I interpret my
proclivity in the light of Scripture? - Paul Mooris, Shadow of
Sodom, 1978</p>

<p>You shall not lie with a male as with a woman. It is an
abomination.... If a man lies with a male as he lies with a
woman, both of them have committed an abomination (Leviticus
18:22; 20:13).</p>

<p>Objection 1. Prohibitions against homosexuality in the
Levitical code have no relevance to us today because Christians
are not under the law (Romans 6:14).</p>

<p>Response. The fact that anything is forbidden in Mosaic law
(which covers issues as diverse as ceremony, diet, sex, and
clothing) does not make for a compelling argument for prohibiting
it today if it is forbidden only under the law and nowhere else
in Scripture. We are indeed under grace and not the law. But it
is notable that God's commandments to abstain from homosexual
acts are contained in chapters 18 and 20 of Leviticus, which deal
primarily with behaviors that are condemned in both the Old and
New Testaments (incest, idolatry, homosexuality, adultery,
witchcraft).</p>

<p>Objection 2. Jesus said nothing about homosexuality in any of
the Gospels. We should base our beliefs on the teachings of
Christ, not Paul or the other New Testament writers.</p>

<p>Response A. First, that doesn't mean He said nothing about
homosexuals during His earthly ministry - only that we have no
record of His doing so. John said that all the books in the world
couldn't contain a full account of Christ's works 1 John 21:25).</p>

<p>Response B. There are several serious offenses Christ doesn't
mention in the Gospels - child molestation, rape, spouse abuse -
yet we wouldn't assume that any of these were acceptable simply
because of their omission from Christ's teaching!</p>

<p>Response C. As important as they are, the teachings of Christ
are not the only focus of the Gospels. His life, work, death, and
resurrection are also accounted for in these books, with the
Acts, Epistles, and Revelation giving more detailed instructions
in areas of conduct and belief</p>

<p>For this reason God gave them up to vile passions. For even
their women exchanged the natural use for what is against nature.
Likewise also the men, leaving the natural use of the woman,
burned in their lust for one another, men with men committing
what is shameful (Romans 1:26, 27).</p>

<p>Objection 3. The people committing homosexual acts in Romans
chapter I were idolaters who worshipped images, not God;
therefore that passage does not condemn homosexuality, but only
idolatry and the subsequent excesses that often go along with it.</p>

<p>Response A. The chapter condemns both idolatry and a variety
of practices (not just homosexual) that sometimes stem from it,
but which are condemned apart from idolatry. For instance,
covetousness and fornication, listed in verse 29 of the same
passage, may have also stemmed from the reprobate nature of the
people described herein, but they are also named as sins in and
of themselves throughout Scripture, as is homosexuality, whatever
the origins.</p>

<p>Response B. Homosexual desires and actions are described in
this passage, independent of idolatry, as being &quot;vile
affections,&quot; &quot;against nature,&quot; and
&quot;unseemly,&quot; again, in and of themselves.</p>

<p>Objection 4. Chapter I of Romans does not condemn
homosexuality, but homosexual acts committed by people who are
really heterosexual. They &quot;changed their nature.&quot; Since
homosexuality was not &quot;natural&quot; to them, they should
not have indulged in it, but the passage does not condemn
homosexual acts between people who are genuinely homosexual.</p>

<p>Response A. Paul's wording here is not nearly that vague. Had
he meant to imply that homosexual attractions were unnatural only
to heterosexuals, he could clearly have said so (as it in the men
who were basically heterosexual became basically homosexual, thus
changing their true nature&quot;). Instead Paul uses wording that
appears even stronger in the original Greek.</p>

<p>The Greek words he uses for &quot;men&quot; and
&quot;women&quot; here are rare in the New Testament, being used
only when the writer wishes to emphasize the gender of the
subject. When we see the word &quot;man&quot; in the Gospels and
Epistles, we are usually seeing a translation of anthropos which
carries a more general meaning (much the way we use
&quot;men&quot; or &quot;fellows&quot; to refer to men in
general, and &quot;male&quot; when we want to emphasize gender
status). Only when New Testament writers similarly wished to
emphasize gender did they resort to the term for man Paul uses
here in Romans 1: arseen, a word used only here and in Matthew
19:4; Mark 10:6; Luke 2:23; and Galatians 3:28, all of which are
Scriptures wanting to emphasize gender to make their point. The
same is true of the term he uses here for &quot;women,&quot;
which is gune in lieu of more common theleia, which is usually
used to refer to women. Gune, like arseen, emphasizes the gender
of the subject and, like are seen, appears in the New Testament
only in verses emphasizing &quot;female.&quot;</p>

<p>These terms are crucial to the argument. Paul especially
emphasizes in Romans I that homosexuality is unnatural to the man
as a male (are seen) and to the woman as a female (gune), not
because of what may or may not be natural to their personality,
but because of what is unnatural to their gender.</p>

<p>Response B. If Paul in this chapter only criticizes homosexual
acts committed by people to whom they did not come
&quot;naturally,&quot; shall we then assume that the rest of the
sins listed in Romans I also are sins only if they are committed
by those to whom they do not come &quot;naturally&quot;?</p>

<p>Response C. These people do not appear to have been
heterosexual men and women committing homosexual acts, since Paul
describes them as &quot;burning in lust&quot; for each other.
&quot;Burning in lust&quot; is an intense phrase which hardly
describes predominantly heterosexual people indulging in
homosexual acts for convenience's sake (as often occurs in
prisons).</p>

<p>Response D. If these people had truly been heterosexual and
were now truly homosexual, thus changing their nature, the
homosexuality itself is still described in clearly derogatory
terms, with no clause stating that it would have been normal if
they had always been homosexual.</p>

<p>Pro-gay apologists are prone to say that, if a person is truly
homosexual, he can never become truly heterosexual, yet they
often quote this passage as an example of truly hetero-sexual
people committing a sin by becoming truly homosexual. Are we then
to assume that a person who is heterosexual can become
homosexual, but a person who is homosexual cannot become
heterosexual? Something's wrong here.</p>

<p>Objection 5. The activity described in Romans I is excessive,
impersonal sex - pure lust without love. That, not homosexuality,
is the problem here.</p>

<p>Response A. Romans I is not a description of a Roman orgy.
Paul in no way indicates that the sexual activity here between
men and men or women and women is highly promiscuous. It is the
very nature of the sexual conduct its that he considers
unnatural.</p>

<p>Response B. When other Scriptures condemn heterosexual lust
and indiscriminate heterosexual wantonness, this also provides
clear guidelines for heterosexual behavior. No such guidelines
exist for homosexual behavior.</p>

<p>Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor
adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites.. .will inherit the
kingdom of God.... knowing this: that the law is not made for a
righteous person, but for the lawless and insubordinate ... for
fornicators, for sodomites (I Corinthians 6:9; 1 Timothy 1:9,
10).</p>

<p>Objection 6. The Greek word arsenokoites, commonly translated
&quot;abusers of themselves with mankind&quot; or
&quot;homosexuals,&quot; did not mean that at all, but meant
&quot;male prostitute.&quot;Response A. The Greek word pomos,
used by Paul and translated &quot;fornicator&quot; in the
passages above and numerous</p>

<p>other places, technically means &quot;male prostitute&quot;
and would certainly be used by Paul when referring to one.
(Although itis sometimes interchangeable with &quot;fornicator,'
the meanings clearly male prostitution, as the word pomos is the
masculine counterpart to pome, which is without exception
translated as &quot;harlot&quot; in the New Testament (e.g.,
Matthew 21:31;Luke 15:30; 1 Corinthians 6:15; Hebrews 11:31;james
2:25). Response B. Arsenokoite is derived from two Greek words
arseen, meaning &quot;male,&quot; and koite, meaning
&quot;couch&quot; or &quot;bed,' usually with a sexual
connotation, as in Hebrews 13:4: &quot;Marriage is honorable in
all, and the bed (koite) is undefiled&quot; (KJV). The
combination of the two terms does not even suggest prostitution -
only sexual contact between two men.</p>

<p>&quot;If people want to accept homosexuality as normal, that
is their option, but they do so against the indisputable teaching
of the Bible.&quot; So say Doctors Glenn Wood and John Dietrich
in The AIDS Epidemic. Balancing Compassion and justice . I agree.
To disregard traditional teaching is risky - it's even more
foolish to disregard the obvious facts: Homosexuality is never
mentioned in Scripture in anything but negative terms, both Old
and New Testament writings contain prohibitions against not only
homosexuality but sexual relations of all kinds outside
heterosexual marriage, and there is nothing in the entire Bible
offering any commendation of or instruction for homosexual
relationships. The pro-gay theology is laid on a very shaky
foundation indeed.</p>

Making Business Your Ministry<br>
</b></font></p>
<p><b>Do you have a heart for ministry but don&#146;t have the time? Have 
you ever considered that you can be a full time minister at your work through your 
thoughts and actions.? &quot;Thank God It&#146;s Monday offers a way to integrate spirituality and 
work. Through personal reflection and practical suggestions, Patrick Klingaman shows 
how we can choose to serve Christ and others in our everyday working situations. I highly 
recommend this book and its application as a balm for worn-down, stressed out working 
people who really want to serve God.&quot; - Rev. Scott W. Hinrichs<br>

<ul TYPE="circle">
<li>By Patrick Klingaman<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Some days, it is hard to imagine anything further from ministry than what happens at work. How 
many Monday mornings do most of us leap out of bed shouting, &quot;Thank God it's Monday. I get to 
go to work to serve God&quot;? Instead, Mondays are often the reason most of us thank God for 
Fridays, when the work week is over.</p>
<p>Maybe you've had a Monday that went like this. You roll over and stare at your alarm clock, hitting 
the snooze button. Gradually your eyes focus on the clock, and you realize you have just enough 
time to dress and run out the door. No coffee this morning.</p>
<p>Late Friday afternoon the boss threw everyone's schedule back with a last-minute project, so now 
you have just enough time to prepare for the big afternoon meeting. You check your messages and 
discover a panic call from a top executive with a problem that can't wait. After playing telephone tag 
with all the various parties required to put out that fire, you now have a lunch hour to prepare for the 
meeting. And everyone who could help copy your handouts has left early for lunch.</p>
<p>The meeting time arrives. The boss enters the boardroom and makes a brief announcement: 
&quot;Earnings have dipped and any presentations for new projects would be pointless.&quot;</p>
<p>Happy Monday!</p>
<p>On days like this it seems impossible to see business as ministry. We just trudge along, muttering 
something about the curse of work (sweat of the brow and all that). Despite such difficult days, 
most of my problem with seeing business as ministry had nothing to do with the nature of the 
workplace. It had to do with my definition of ministry.</p>
<p>It wasn't too many years ago that I shared the world's more conventional view of ministry. Ministry 
is primarily the &quot;godly stuff&quot; that priests, missionaries, and other professional ministers do. It includes 
preaching, teaching, evangelism, and other spiritual tasks. As laypeople, we can help in this ministry 
through service in our church and by sharing the Gospel with those around us.</p>
<p>In recent years, my studies in the New Testament have revealed a dramatically different picture of 
ministry. New Testament writers don't distinguish between religious and secular work as we do. 
Our service to God is not limited to preaching the Gospel and helping in the church body. Rather, 
the Bible teaches us to do everything for God: &quot;And whatever you do, whether in word or deed, do 
it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him&quot; (Col. 3:17).</p>
<p>In that same chapter, Paul instructs slaves to serve their earthly masters as if working for the Lord. 
Those of us who need to work for others for our livelihood have much in common with those 
ancient slaves. Like them, we often answer to unreasonable bosses (masters) and work under less 
than ideal circumstances. Thus, Paul's teachings in verses 23 and 24 should apply to all workers:</p>
<p>Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men, since you 
know that you will receive an inheritance from the Lord as a reward. It is the Lord Christ you are 
serving.</p>
<p>-----------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>New Testament writers don't distinguish between religious and secular work as we do.</p>
<p>------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>Phase One: Work As Duty</p>
<p>Transferring this original vision of ministry to my position in marketing did not occur all at once. The 
change happened in three distinct phases of thinking. The first phase I call the &quot;work is my duty&quot; 
phase. I knew I needed to work because it is something God commands us to do (and I need to 
eat). Paul urged early Christians to &quot;do something g useful&quot; with their hands, so they could provide 
for themselves and others (EPA. 4-28; 1 Tim; 5:8).</p>
<p>Working to avoid becoming a sluggard, although a step in the right direction, hardly made for an 
inspiring approach to my job. I approached work about as gleefully as I approached mowing the 
lawn when I was a teenager. I mowed the lawn only because my father asked me to (repeatedly). I 
certainly had many things I'd rather spend my time doing, but I needed to obey my father.</p>
<p>It is important for us to understand that the vast majority of the people we work with each day are 
firmly entrenched in this phase. Many are waiting for that lucky lottery number or for the Publishers' 
Clearinghouse prize van to pull into their driveway so they can quit their jobs and live a life of 
leisure. In our office, when the lottery prize approaches $50 million, employees pool a few bucks 
each to buy a block of tickets. The pressure to throw your money away is great. If you don't 
contribute and the group wins, you'd be the only person left working in the department.</p>
<p>Phase Two: Work As Ministry Site</p>
<p>As I began to develop a little better understanding of the Bible, I moved on to my second phase of 
thinking. Here, my work world became a place where ministry could possibly occur. For example, 
others might notice the way I work and give me respect (I These. 4:11-12).</p>
<p>Also, I discovered that the workplace is one of the best opportunities for Christians to share their 
faith. In Colossians 4:5, Paul encourages: &quot;Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the 
most of every opportunity.&quot; Few of us have more ongoing contact with &quot;outsiders&quot; than on the job. 
People are able to watch us day in and day out, noticing how we work, how we interact with 
others, and how we handle problems and conflict. Eventually, casual conversations with coworkers 
almost inevitably lead to some kind of opening to share our faith.</p>
<p>When I first moved back to Minnesota after graduate school, the only place I had any meaningful 
contact with non-Christians was at the office. After a ten-year absence, I had lost contact with all 
my childhood friends here. I lived in a large apartment complex with a rapid turnover of tenants, 
whom I rarely even bumped into in the hallways, much less developed relationships with. All my 
new friends were from church. My job became more valuable to me because it was the only place 
for me to practice meaningful evangelism.</p>
<p>God placed me in an ideal spiritual situation in my very first job out of school. I shared an office with 
a woman named Jeanne. Our desks were pushed together so we faced one another, giving us 
ample opportunity to talk. She seemed interested in spiritual matters and my church life, asking me 
lots of questions. Although I felt like a spiritual infant back then, I shared openly what Christ had 
done in my life. Jeanne had also struck up a friendship with another Christian guy in the building, so 
she probably talked more about religious topics than she ever had before.</p>
<p>Several months after leaving that job, Jeanne called me on the phone and told me she had made a 
commitment to Christ. Looking back, it was clear that God's plan was to place believers in the 
place Jeanne spent her days during her time of spiritual interest and decision. I felt God had 
wonderfully used me, although I strongly suspect I played a minor role compared to the other 
Christian who worked in the building. He became her husband.</p>
<p>Despite seeing the importance of sharing my faith at work, I still felt something was lacking. My 
work only seemed to matter to the extent that others were spiritually encouraged by it. Did it matter 
that I excelled at marketing our health care organization? I still didn't see a direct connection 
between my work duties and ministry.</p>
<p>Phase Three: Work As Ministry</p>
<p>The connection came as I entered my third phase of thinking when I came to believe that work itself 
could be ministry. For starters, I learned that God Himself works, and He has given us the job of 
attending to His creation. In Genesis 1:28, God commands: &quot;Be fruitful and increase in number; fill 
the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living 
creature that moves on the ground.&quot; Working in the world, therefore, is part of God's plan. God has 
also blessed each of us with the gifts and abilities to carry out that work. Nowhere in the New 
Testament do we read that those identified spiritual gifts are our sole means for serving God. 
Besides those gifts, God has blessed each of us with inherent abilities and talents related to work. 
To some, He has given great mechanical aptitude; to others an analytical mind. Still others may have 
a natural compassion for others or a creative nature. God has so equipped us for a reason: to use 
and develop those gifts in a way that honors Him. If you seem to be skilled at working with 
numbers, becoming the best accountant or financial analyst you can may be a great way to serve 
God.</p>
<p>Using our natural abilities in our work sounds basic, but career experts estimate that at least half of 
those working are not in jobs suited to their primary interests and abilities. Those abilities become 
hidden and the world loses out as a result.</p>
<p>I know one person who has worked adequately in hospital finance for many years. One day he was 
part of a group giving a presentation on quality. When he stood up to instruct us on his topic, I was 
amazed at the transformation. He was full of energy, passion, and even creativity as a teacher. I was 
so impressed that I asked him to give a guest lecture on health care finance to a class I was 
teaching. There, he was even better. I know there is a shortage of truly exceptional teachers in all 
schools-and I believe this man had the abilities to be one of them.</p>
<p>So what is the value of using our abilities to serve God? All honest work done to honor God can 
contribute to the body of Christ. Look closely at the gifts of the body mentioned in Romans 12:4-8:</p>
<p>Just as each of us has one body with many members, and these members do not all have the same 
function, so in Christ we who are many form one body, and each member belongs to all the others.</p>
<p>We have different gifts, according to the grace given us. If a man's gift is prophesying, let him use it 
in proportion to his faith. If it is serving, let him serve; if it is teaching, let him teach; if it </p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>All honest work done to honor God can contribute to the body of Christ.</p>
<p>----------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
<p>is encouraging, let him encourage; if it is contributing to the needs of others, let him give generously; 
if it is leadership, let him govern diligently; if it is showing mercy, let him do it cheerfully.</p>
<p>How many of the above gifts can only be used in a church ministry setting? Except maybe for 
prophesying, any of these gifts can be used in all areas of our lives, including our work. In fact, one 
could argue that many of these gifts are necessary to become a great manager. Although executive 
greatness is still far from my grasp, I've noticed that I spend a good chunk of my workday serving, 
teaching, encouraging, giving, leading, and even showing mercy.</p>
<p>Sure, we can use those gifts on the job, but does that make it ministry? I don't think we should limit 
ministry to &quot;spiritual&quot; tasks because the actions of God Himself extend beyond the spiritual realm. 
Israel's exodus from Egypt was a result of a series of very tangible, physical acts of God, such as 
the plagues, the Passover, the parting of the Red Sea, and raining down manna for food. So our 
God is not just concerned with our spiritual welfare; He is concerned about the whole person. In 
Luke 12, Jesus tells us not to worry about what we will eat, drink, or wear. He will provide for 
those who &quot;seek His kingdom.&quot;</p>
<p>God Works through Us</p>
<p>How does God provide for us? Spiritually, God provides the Holy Spirit, who acts in the lives of all 
Christians. Ask people how they came to know Christ, and they will often mention that God used 
the actions or words of another Christian to influence their decision for Christ.</p>
<p>God also provides for our material and physical needs through the actions of others. Sometimes that 
provision is directly through the output of one's work. Martin Luther once said that the way a 
cobbler loves his neighbor is by making good shoes. In addition to providing us with food, drink, 
and clothing, a successful business startup will provide jobs for other families.</p>
<p>Is earnestly working to benefit others and provide for their physical needs a ministry comparable in 
importance to preaching the Gospel? The Bible doesn't clearly differentiate one type of ministry as 
being more important than another. It teaches that all the work of the body of Christ, all ministry, is 
important because it is all the work of God. Paul writes in I Corinthians 12:4-6: &quot;There are different 
kinds of gifts, but the same Spirit. There are different kinds of service, but the same Lord. There are 
different kinds of working, but the same God works all of them in all men.&quot;</p>
<p>Work can be good ministry if we commit our work to God and allow Him to work through us. 
Working to provide for the physical needs of our family and others is important for two reasons. 
First, partly through our actions and those of other workers, God fulfills His promise in Luke 12:31 
to provide for those who seek Him. Also, the provision of basic physical needs is often a 
prerequisite for a person being receptive to the Gospel. Missionaries in the Third World don't 
usually go to a village of starving people and simply preach. Their words would fall on deaf ears. 
First, they feed people and help meet life's most basic physical needs. Then spiritual needs can more 
readily be explored.</p>
<p>When I began looking at ministry from a broader perspective, I could see how my work fits in with 
God's plan. For over ten years, I have served in various marketing positions for Healthiest, a system 
of hospitals and health-related services. Our organization's mission is closely tied to Christ's healing 
ministry. With hospital names like St. John's, St. Joseph's, and Bethesda (named after the healing 
pool in John 5:2), one would be hard-pressed to forget our religious ties. Yet health care is still a 
business (a big one at that) and marketing would seem to be as far removed from that healing 
ministry as one could get. Most hospitals did not have marketing departments until census levels 
sharply declined in the 1980s, so many in the field view them as a necessary evil. Some 
administrators feel hospitals should concentrate more time on healing people and less on &quot;hawking 
their wares.&quot;</p>
<p>In seeking spiritual meaning in my work, I looked at how my job of marketing helped our firm serve 
its customers. A health care company's main purpose is to help people recover from illness and 
reach their maximum potential level of health. My job, in marketing, is to identify unmet or undermet 
health needs in the community through market research, then help develop or change services to 
meet those needs, and finally inform the community of our ability to meet those needs. Helping 
identify and meet community health needs seems to me to be a very legitimate and rewarding 
ministry. The efforts of my department have led to the development of unique services needed by 
the community, improved customer access to health services, nd greater awareness of resources 
available to keep people healthier.</p>
<p>Health care may be a little easier tie-in to ministry because of its comparison to the acts of healing in 
the Bible. Yet even a corner service station can play a role in God's ministry. I remember taking 
frequent drives to a friend's house and wondering about the surprising lack of gas stations. This 
long, well-traveled highway ran through a large, prosperous residential area which had many 
retailers. If someone would put a station on this road, I thought, people living here could save the 
time and fuel they now spend hunting for a distant gas station. If the station had service bays to 
work on cars and did quality work, it could ease some of the frustration and inconvenience that 
goes along with a malfunctioning car.</p>
<p>Having such a service within walking distance would be &quot;tremely important to Any good work many 
one-vehicle families. By making life more convenient for people in the neighborhood, that little 
station might contribute to the growth of the community, as well as provide jobs. If those running the 
station are committed Christians and seek to honor God in their business, they could have a real, 
thriving ministry on that corner. (By the way, someone did eventually put a big gas station on that 
highway, and it looks as if business is booming.)</p>
<p>As I began to see how work in industry could serve God, it broke down the limiting walls of my old 
view of ministry. When I used to think about serving in the body of Christ, I didn't look much 
beyond my local church congregation. I now see how God's ministry encompasses all areas of a 
person's life. This has opened my eyes to many new avenues of service to God.</p>
<p>We need to see that ministry is not just activities done by churches and missionaries. Any good 
work done for the glory of God is religous work. It only becomes secular when we leave God out 
of it. According to A.W. Tozer, our motives and attitudes toward work mean everything. It is not 
what a man does that determines whether his work is sacred or secular, it is ivhy he does it. The 
motive is everything. Let a man sanctify the Lord God in his heart and he can thereafter do no 
common act. All he does is good and acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For such a man, 
living itself will be sacramental and the whole world a sanctuary. His entire life will be a priestly 
ministration. As he performs his never so simple task he will hear the voice of the seraphim saying, 
&quot;Holy, Holy, Holy, is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.&quot;</p>

<p>Lou Hager is a properly manager. He's a man who takes
integrity seriously. Before I had the privilege of meeting him at
the company he works for now, his integrity was tested. Lou held
a $40,000 a year position as Superintendent of Maintenance. He
reported to the Vice President of Property Management. Lou's boss
was a back-slapping, foul mouthed individual who was consistently
pushing him to negotiate his people's salaries downward. He would
page Lou at midnight after a fourteen hour day, showing no
concern for Lou's rest or family life. Lou's integrity hit the
wall when his boss ordered him buy materials like carpet and
paint and deliver it to his personal residence... while entering
the tab on the bill sent to the owner of the properties being
managed.<br>
<br>
Because Lou was intentional about his integrity, he couldn't do
it and told his boss so. Lou quit. However the president of the
company called him to find out what had happened. Lou told him
but a second wrong was committed - the president wasn't willing
to do anything for fear of losing a Vice President that
&quot;made things happen.&quot;<br>
<br>
Lou kept his integrity intact and got a new position in a company
with sound, ethical standards for doing business. He was happy
and relieved to be out of the former environment. Later he found
out that he and other employees were to receive several hundred
dollars in back pay as a result of a Labor Board investigation
initiated by another employee of the company. He also watched as
the unethical practices of the Vice President and the lack of
courage of the President brought the company into bankruptcy.
Over the long haul, what goes around, comes around.<br>
<br>
A COMMITMENT TO INTEGRITY</p>

<p><br>
Let's start where the rubber meets the road... with the issue of
your commitment to being a person of Intentional Integrity. By
maintaining your commitment and this focus, you'll find that
you'll begin the process of immunizing yourself against the virus
of dishonesty with God's truths.<br>
<br>
If intentional integrity seems like a difficult commitment, it
is! God has warned us about trying to worship two masters. But
God calls us to a high standard of conduct. Jesus tells us in
Matthew 5:48, &quot;Therefore you are<br>
<br>
to be perfect, as your father in heaven is perfect.&quot; Peter
also tells us in 1 Peter 1: 15,16 &quot;But as he who called you
is holy, so be holy in all you do; for it is written: Be holy,
because I am Holy.&quot; Emphasizing the need for consistency
between faith and conduct, James admonishes us in James 1:22,
&quot;Do not merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourself.
Do what it says.&quot;<br>
<br>
Warren W. Wiersbe states well in his book, The Integrity Crisis
when he says, &quot;Jesus made it clear that integrity involves
the whole of the inner person: the heart, the mind, and the will.
The person with integrity has a single heart. He doesn't try to
love God and the world at the same time...<br>
<br>
&quot;The person with integrity also has a single mind, and
single outlook (&quot;eye&quot;) that keeps life going in the
right direction...<br>
&quot;Jesus also said that the person with integrity has a single
will; he seeks to serve but one master.&quot; (4)<br>
<br>
THE PRACTICALITY OF INTENTIONAL INTEGRITY</p>

<p><br>
Integrity is the principle which gives bridges, buildings,
companies, families and people their completeness and strength.
The word comes from the Latin, &quot;integras,&quot; which means
soundness, whole, complete.<br>
<br>
None of us would drive across a bridge if we knew the steel in
the structure lacked integrity, or the bolts were not tightened,
or the cement was not mixed properly. The same applies to a house
we were about to buy or office space in a high rise building we
were about to rent! We now have over 35 million laws to try to
protect us from those of low integrity. Without integrity people
and bridges suffer from a lack of soundness, wholeness and
completeness and are thus vulnerable to collapse or failure.<br>
<br>
Do you ever think about issues of integrity where you work? Did
you think about it before you hired on? Did you think about the
consequences a lack of integrity within the organization's
leadership, managerial, marketing, sales, employee service and
customer service functions could have on you and your career?<br>
<br>
How important is the issue of integrity to the well-being of your
family? What about family relationships, interpersonal
communications, your budgeting process, your family
problem-solving process or healthy food purchases?<br>
<br>
What about the integrity of a person? Do you want to depend on
and receive services or products produced by people of low
integrity? Do you want to be associated with them? Trust your
life to them?</p>

<p><br>
While we can't control the integrity of others, we can influence
and inspire them by making sure our own integrity is as complete
as possible. Modeling perfect integrity is one way Jesus so
effectively taught others and why he wants us to follow Him and
be salt and light in all dimensions of our lives.</p>

<p>FACE-TO-FACE WITH INTEGRITY</p>

<p>A few years ago I hired a secretary who was to be transferred
from another department in a large public agency to help my
consulting and training team with a major project. I knew how to
check out her competencies and did it well. There was no doubt
she had the skills to do excellent work for the project. She was
outwardly friendly and I thought she would fit in well to the
group. Her former supervisor was well pleased with her, but the
type of work she had been doing in his department was no longer
needed.</p>

<p>After a month on the job it was clear to me and our team that
she was an albatross instead of a contributor. It appeared her
goal was to diligently work at avoiding work. I felt betrayed and
was on a slow, controlled burn. I knew she had the &quot;can
do&quot; to do the work because I had checked it out with
performance tests.</p>

<p>I didn't want to show my anger toward her and instead stuffed
it down and started regularly reviewing the expectations I had
laid out before hiring her. I tightly supervised and coached her
using all of the management and supervision tools at my command
to try to help her become productive.</p>

<p>My efforts were to no avail. It became a game where she
manipulated situations and the environment to her social
advantage. She was intelligent and I was no match. I became
angrier and angrier about the situation.</p>

<p>I blamed her for our project falling behind and felt she had
been dishonest with me during the interview and assessment
process. Finally I verbally blasted her in front of the entire
team at one of our staff meetings. It was embarrassing.</p>

<p>Things got worse. She manipulated things to her
&quot;social&quot; advantage more often and did less and less
work. I finally developed my documentation for her dismissal. I
lost because of her previous glowing evaluations from others and
she was transferred to another department.</p>

<p>When my dishonest rationalizing and debilitating anger had
subsided, I found myself reviewing in my mind this hiring
mistake. Where had I gone wrong? How had I continued to go wrong?
How could I avoid this in the future? The relationship had eaten
up my emotional, physical, time and financial reserves to a point
that the project was in some jeopardy.</p>

<p>I came to realize that I had done great due diligence
regarding her &quot;can do&quot; competencies. What I had failed
to check out was her &quot;will do&quot; motivation to work in a
fast-paced, high energy, high demand training environment. When
she didn't work out in the job, the virus of dishonesty attacked
me. Rather than look inward and accept the responsibility of
where I had failed to do due diligence in hiring her, I became
angry and blamed her.</p>

<p>As I back tracked through her previous work situations, I
discovered that she had been functioning in bureaucratic
environments where little was expected in the way of work
production. What was expected was that it be really good work
when work was done. I found out that she had never faced tight
time demands, sudden changes to be made in training materials,
and so on. Others verified that she had high motivation for
social involvement and friendships. The settings she had been in
gave her ample opportunity to socialize, talk, and make phone
calls to friends with no consequences. She probably assumed
working on our project, since it was in the same public agency,
would be the same. It wasn't so she didn't... couldn't, produce
work at the level we needed. Her natural motivational strengths
in fact opposed it!</p>

<p>Since this episode, I have diligently used surveys and
computer technology to determine the &quot;will do&quot; factors
of a potential employee. In addition to the competency
requirements, I've made clear the operating values and norms to
potential new hires and invited them to visit, talk to others and
assess for themselves if the environment supports their personal
motivational needs.</p>

<p><br>
TIME OUT: Reflect on What? So What? and Now What?</p>

<p>Key Reflections<br>
1. What will it take for you to chose to be a Total Integrity
Management champion?<br>
2. What are the benefits of having intent and commitment to being
a person of integrity?<br>
3. What action steps will you take to &quot;notch up&quot; your
integrity?<br>
</p>

<p>YOU'RE NEEDED AS AN INTEGRITY CHAMPION</p>

<p>The integrity crisis can be turned around by ordinary people
like you and me who are committed to having open hearts, willing
spirits and an intent to think, say and do the right things to
strengthen the integrity of every aspect of our lives.</p>

<p>As an integrity champion, you will serve as a model at home
and in the marketplace. You will demonstrate the stability and
contribution that's possible in a person's life by thinking,
saying and doing what is right. I'm pleased that you're
committing yourself to being an important member of this group of
integrity champions.</p>

<p>Fortunately, there are many others on the integrity journey.
My favorite story about practical and value driven business
leaders from recent history is the great story that came out of
the Johnson and Johnson Tylenol tragedies. The story of these
integrity champions is told well, and in detail, by in Tom
Haggai's book, How the Best Is Won. (5)</p>

<p>The tragedy of poisoned Tylenol hit Johnson and Johnson twice,
in 1982 and again in 1986. Given their respect and serious belief
in the part of the company credo that said, &quot;Never offer for
sale any product that might prove to be a hazard to a person's
health&quot;, high integrity decisions were made based on the
Judeo Christian values deeply inculcated into the company
culture. Company Chairman Jim Burke wanted to uncover convincing
evidence to support his contention that having standards of
integrity based on the Judeo Christian ethical standards for
conduct and morality when making corporate decisions is good
business financially.</p>

<p>Burks staff worked with The Business Round Table's Task Force
on Corporate Responsibility and the Ethics Resource Center in
Washington D.C. to compile a list of twenty-six companies that
met the criteria for ethical, high integrity companies. The
compounded growth of these companies was 10.7 percent over a
thirty year period, which was 1.34 time the growth of our GNP,
and GNP was ten times greater than it was thirty years before.
The net income of these companies turned out to be 21.2 percent
greater than average. If you and I had made an investment of
$30,000 thirty years before in the composite of the Dow Jones we
would have received back $134,000 on our investment. If we had
invested in those companies that the study identified, our
investment of $30,000 would have given us a return of $1,310,714.

<p>This effort clearly supports the proposition that high
integrity companies driven by Judeo Christian ethical standards
for conduct are far more successful financially over the long
term. I believe the same also holds true for individuals, their
families and their careers over the long term.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>BENEFITS OF MANAGING YOUR LIFE, FAMILY AND BUSINESS WITH
INTEGRITY</p>

<p>As a consultant, I've observed that smaller companies that are
the &quot;integrity&quot; brothers and sisters of the 26
companies reported above, also have excellent profit records over
the long term. They too experience longevity, and develop
value-added assets by the time they are sold. I've found that
these smaller companies are also led by ethical, high integrity
leaders who expect highly ethical practices from all who
participate in their enterprises. They also model what they
expect.</p>

<p>A shining example in the secular marketplace is Wetherill and
Associates, Inc. (WAI), an automobile starter replacement parts
manufacturer and sales company in Pennsylvania. The company's
founding president and top management team have strictly adhered
to the Right Action EthicTM that they incorporated into the
company culture from the beginning. &quot;Think, say and do the
right thing&quot; is their simple but powerful personal and
business credo. Very similar to Rotary lnternational's Four-Way
Test of the things we think, say and do. By diligently following
their credo over a fourteen year period, they've enjoyed growing
to $120 million plus in annual revenues. They were also selected
as the number one customer focus company by MCI and Inc. Magazine
in 1994. Their company has also experienced low employee turnover
and high customer loyalty. Everyone... managers, employees,
suppliers and customers are encourage to challenge any personal
or corporate practices which are not perceived as doing the right
thing and the company's team of managers and employees make every
effort to make things right for everyone.</p>

<p>The privilege of working with quality leaders in all types and
sizes of organizations, like WAI, has allowed me to gain the
insights and proven strategies for developing the components of
the Total Integrity ManagementSM System. I've observed these
leaders as they carried out the key functions in their companies
with a focus on intentional integrity.</p>

<p>These leaders of intentional integrity have demonstrated to me
over and over again that &quot;good folks&quot; don't finish
last! I've seen how they set standards and expect the same from
others.</p>

<p>They truly discern the difference between freedom and license.
They expect to be held accountable in terms of personal conduct,
performance and the maintenance of a good company profit margin.
They live well balanced lives. They value integrity within their
marriages and their relationships with their children and other
family members. They value integrity in the people they work with
and exhibit it themselves as they relate to employees, customers
and suppliers. They value and expect integrity in the products
and services they deliver to their customers.</p>

<p>For the most part, they have good health and work at keeping
it. They experience peace of mind and are contented while still
eager to contribute more, serve more and give more. They value
friendships and are valued friends. Their focus is on need over
greed, service vs. being served, and contribution... making their
lives count for something.</p>

<p>They have not fallen into the trap of &quot;business as
usual&quot; by compromising their ethical standards of conduct
for the modern day, conditional approach to integrity. They know
the truth and live it because high ethical standards of conduct
have proven to them to produce multiple dimensions of true
profitability... economic wealth, career and company longevity,
good personal health, good relationships, and family stability
are but a few.</p>

<p>By holding true to high ethical standards for conduct, they
have kept their lives and their businesses on solid rock. They
hold firm to proven standards for conduct regardless of bad
situations, personal whims, opportunities for short term profits,
or personal convenience or advantage. My observations support the
conclusion that the Judeo Christian ethical standards for conduct
serve as a solid foundation for promoting... Consistent ethical
behavior and good performance<br>
Trust<br>
Loyalty<br>
High levels of motivation<br>
High productivity potential<br>
Excellent economic stability<br>
Honesty<br>
People who are consistently productive are firmly committed to
personal performance that is firmly based on Judeo Christian
ethical standards for conduct. Those I've observed who base their
performance on the modern day, conditional approach to integrity,
too often capitulate under pressure and behave in unproductive
and often destructive ways.</p>

INTENTIONAL INTEGRITY ... THE RIGHT PARADIGM</p>

<p>For the past decade I've heard and read much on the subject of
&quot;Total Quality Management&quot; and &quot;Continuous
Measurable Improvement&quot; from organizational improvement
experts. They have given us valuable strategies focused on
improving productivity and economic success. However, I've found
two key components weak or missing from the quality and
continuous improvement formulas if they are to work consistently
and over the long haul: (1) Clear standards for ethical conduct;
and (2) Workable performance accountability processes.</p>

<p>I don't want to come across as suggesting you throw the baby
(TQM) out with the bath water because the soap isn't effective
enough. To the contrary... I urge you to understand and keep the
&quot;stuff' of TQM and strengthen it with 1 and 2 above.</p>

<p>If you are not involved in the business world, you may not
know much about TQM. Any business library will provide you with
more than you will ever need to know. The following elements
included in the criteria for the prestigious Malcolm Baldridge
National Quality Award. I have described them in terms that you
can apply to the management of quality in yourself, your family
and your work place.</p>

<p>Customer-Driven Quality - You, your family members and your
colleagues at work should let quality be judged by your
&quot;customers.&quot; (Spouse, children, employees, consumers.)</p>

<p>Leadership - As a leader at home or elsewhere, you must create
a customer orientation.</p>

<p>Continuous Improvement - Achieving the highest level of
quality requires a well-defined and well-executed approach to
continuous improvement.</p>

<p>Employee Participation and Development - Your organization's
(personal life, family, business) success in improving
performance depends increasingly on the skills and motivation of
those who are part of it and work in it.</p>

<p>Fast Response - Success demands ever-shorter cycles of
improvement and service.</p>

<p>Design Quality and Prevention - Place a strong emphasis on
design quality and achieve problem and waste prevention through
building quality and service into all processes.</p>

<p>Long-Range Outlook - Maintain a strong future orientation and
a willingness to make long-term commitments to all stakeholders.</p>

<p>Management by Fact - Build your organization upon a foundation
of measurement, data and analysis rather than opinion.</p>

<p>Partnership Development - Seek to build internal and external
partnerships to better accomplish your over all goals.</p>

<p>Corporate Responsibility and Citizenship - Have objectives and
ethics that protect public health, public safety, and the
environment.</p>

<p>A CALL TO CHANGE</p>

<p>I'm proposing that you and I join hands with others who are as
committed to Intentional Integrity and who want it to emerge as
the new operational paradigm throughout America. People who want
to see it encompassed by individuals, families, schools,
government, churches and all other institutions throughout the
land. People who are willing to use processes and strategies,
congruent with those found in my Total Integrity Management SM
System, in all dimensions of their lives.</p>

<p>Since sound Judeo Christian Ethical standards for conduct are
at the core of Total Integrity Management, I urge you to
encourage others to adopt them as operating guidelines
personally, at home and at work. They will help definitely help
you integrate the principles of Total Quality Management,
continuous measurable improvement, PLUS Judeo Christian Ethical
Standards for Conduct into your life and you family's and
organization's culture and practices.</p>

<p>Integrity ideally starts with fathers and mothers in their
families and with the board members and top executives in any
given organization. When modeled from the top down, integrity has
a greater chance of becoming an operational reality among members
of the family and among all levels of employees in an
organization. They also have a better chance of being maintained
when under fire, both at home and in the workplace.</p>

<p>TIME OUT: Reflect on What? So What? and Now What?</p>

<p>Key Reflections<br>
1. What are the attributes of your character?<br>
2. What are the benefits of being a person of good character.?<br>
3. What action steps will you take to be accountable for good
conduct?<br>

<p><b>Whereby Shall I Know? </b></p>

<p>October 10th<br>
(From the original language edition) </p>

<p>I thank Thee, O Father...because Thou hast hid these things
from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.
Matthew 11:25</p>

<p>In spiritual relationship we do not grow step by step; we are
either there or we are not. God does not cleanse us more and more
from sin, but when we are in the light, walking in the light, we
are cleansed from all sin. It is a question of obedience, and
instantly the relationship is perfected. Turn away for one second
out of obedience, and darkness and death are at work at once.</p>

<p>All God's revelations are sealed until they are opened to us
by obedience. You will never get them open by philosophy or
thinking. Immediately you obey, a flash of light comes. Let God's
truth work in you by soaking in it, not by worrying into it. The
only way you can get to know is to stop trying to find out and by
being born again. Obey God in the thing He shows you, and
instantly the next thing is opened up. One reads tomes on the
work of the Holy Spirit, when one five minutes of drastic
obedience would make things as clear as a sunbeam. &quot;I
suppose I shall understand these things some day!&quot; You can
understand them now. It is not study that does it, but obedience.
The tiniest fragment of obedience, and heaven opens and the
profoundest truths of God are yours straight away. God will never
reveal more truth about Himself until you have obeyed what you
know already. Beware of becoming &quot;wise and prudent. </p>

<p><b>Must I Listen? </b></p>

<p>February 12th<br>
(From the original language edition) </p>

<p>And they said unto Moses, Speak thou with us and we will hear:
but let not God speak with us, lest we die. Exodus 20:19</p>

<p>We do not consciously disobey God, we simply do not heed Him.
God has given us His commands; there they are, but we do not pay
any attention to them, not because of willful disobedience but
because we do not love and respect Him. &quot;If ye love Me, ye
will keep My commandments.&quot; When once we realize that we
have been &quot;disrespecting&quot; God all the time, we are
covered with shame and humiliation because we have not heeded
Him. </p>

<p>&quot;Speak thou with us ... but let not God speak with
us.&quot; We show how little we love God by preferring to listen
to His servants only. We like to listen to personal testimonies,
but we do not desire that God Himself should speak to us. Why are
we so terrified lest God should speak to us? Because we know that
if God does speak, either the thing must be done or we must tell
God we will not obey Him. If It is only the servant's voice we
hear, we feel it Is not imperative, we can say, &quot;Well, that
is simply your own idea, though I don't deny it is probably God's
truth.&quot; </p>

<p>Am I putting God in the humiliating position of having treated
me as a child of His whilst all the time I have been ignoring
Him? When I do hear Him, the humiliation I have put on Him comes
back on me- &quot;Lord, why was I so dull and so obstinate?&quot;
This is always the result when once we do hear God. The real
delight of hearing Him is tempered with shame in having been so
long in hearing Him. </p>

<p><b>OUR LORD&#146;S SURPRISE VISITS</b> </p>

<p>MARCH 29<br>
(From the updated edition in today&#146;s language) &quot;You
also be ready. . .&quot; (Luke 12:40).</p>

<p>A Christian worker's greatest need is a readiness to face
Jesus Christ at any and every turn. This is not easy, no matter
what our experience has been. This battle is not against sin,
difficulties, or </p>

<p>circumstances, but against being so absorbed in our service to
Jesus Christ that we are not ready to face Jesus Himself at every
turn. The greatest need is not facing our beliefs or doctrines,
or even facing the question of whether or not we are of any use
to Him, but the need is to face Him. </p>

<p>Jesus rarely comes where we expect Him; He appears where we
least expect Him; and always in the most illogical situations.
The only way a servant can remain true to God is to be ready for
the Lord's surprise visits. This readiness will not be brought
about by service, but through intense spiritual reality,
expecting Jesus Christ at every turn. This sense of expectation
will give our life the attitude of childlike wonder He wants it
to have. If we are going to be ready for Jesus Christ, we have to
stop being religious. In other words, we must stop using religion
as if it were some kind of a lofty lifestyle-we must be
spiritually real. </p>

<p>If you are avoiding the call of the religious thinking of
today's world, and instead are &quot;looking unto Jesus&quot;
(Hebrews 12:2), setting your heart on what He wants, and thinking
His thoughts, you will be considered impractical and a
daydreamer. But when He suddenly appears in the work of the heat
of the day, you will be the only one who is ready. You should
trust no one, and even ignore the finest saint on earth if he
blocks your sight of Jesus Christ. </p>

<p><b>Do I know God well enough to know what He wants me to pray?
In what ways do I try to outsmart God by trying to determine a
formula for getting Him to answer prayer? Is my prayer life more
like a playground or a battleground? Chambers&#146; chief
objective in prayer was to know Jesus, to learn His will, and to
get himself aligned with it. How might the world be different --
and your life-- if your motive for prayer were the same?<br>
</b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Oswald Chambers</li>
</ul>

<p>THE JOB of every Christian is to pray. Plain and simple. Yet
we want to do more than simply pray. We want to do something
important for God; we want to be someone important to Him. We
want to build; we want to mobilize; we want to show our strength
and exert our influence. Prayer seems like such a small thing to
do-next to nothing at all in fact.</p>

<p>But that's not what Jesus said. To Him prayer is everything;
it's a duty as well as a privilege, a right as well as a
responsibility.</p>

<p>We tend to use prayer as a last resort, but Jesus wants it to
be our first line of defense. We pray when there's nothing else
we can do, but Jesus wants us to pray before we do anything at
all. Most of us would prefer, however, to spend our time doing
something that will get immediate results. We don't want to wait
for God to resolve mat-ters in His good time because His idea of
&quot;good time&quot; is seldom in sync with ours.</p>

<p>And so we try to help God along. Many times we even try to
answer our own prayers. We have the idea that more people will
become Christians if we can make God look good to them. So we try
to convince them of God's generosity by proving that He answers
prayer. If we can just help God spruce up His image a little, we
can get more people on His side. And that's what He wants us to
do, right?</p>

<p>Wrong. He wants us to pray. Always and about everything.
During times of joy as well as sorrow. He want us to talk to Him,
not about Him. He even wants us to talk to Him about unbelievers
before we talk to unbelievers about Him.</p>

<p>Prayer is not just an exercise routine God has us on; it's our
business, our only business. Prayer is our holy occupation. Plain
and simple.</p>

<p>************************</p>

<p>JESUS says there are times when our heav-enly Father will
appear as if He were a most unnatural father, callous and
indifferent. But remember, says Jesus, I have told you every-one
who asks receives.&quot; When we get into spiritual confusion the
usual way out is to say we have made a blunder, and we go back
instead of forward. &quot;I don't know what to do; I am up
against a stone wall.&quot; Will you &quot;hang in&quot; to what
Jesus said? If there is a shadow on the face of God the Father
just now, remain confident that ultimately He will give His clear
issue as Jesus said. It is not a question of black or white or
right or wrong, of being in communion or out of communion; but a
ques-tion of God taking us by a way which in the meantime we do
not understand.</p>

<p>*************************</p>

<p>THE MEANING of intercession is that we see what God is doing,
consequently there is an intimacy between the child and the
Father which is never impertinent. We must pour into the bosom of
God the cares which give us pain and anxiety in order that He may
solve for us, and before us, the difficulties which we cannot
solve. We injure our spiri-tual life when we dump the whole thing
down before God and say-You do it. That spirit is blind to the
real union with God. We must dump ourselves down in the midst of
our problems and watch God solve them for us. &quot;But I have no
faith&#146; , bring your problems to God and stay with Him while
He solves them, then God Himself and the solution of your
problems will be for ever your own. If we could see the floor of
God's immediate pres-ence, we would find it strewn with the
&quot;toys&quot; of God's children who have said-This is broken,
I can't play with it any more, please give me another present.
C)nly one in a thou-sand sits down in the midst of it all and
says-I will watch my Father mend this.</p>

<p>**************************</p>

<p>WHATEVER you ask in My name, that I will do. When you pray,
remember that it is Jesus Christ who carries out the answer, God
hands over this marvelous power to Him. By His Ascension our Lord
becomes omniscient, all-wise; have we ever had a glimpse of what
that means? The wisdom which He exercised in a limited sphere and
in complete dependence upon His Father while on earth, He can now
exercise in an unlimited sphere. Get on to the supernatural line,
remember that Jesus Christ is omni-scient, and He says, &quot;If
you ask anything in My name, I will do it.&quot; </p>

<p>************************* </p>

<p>THE WAY we react during the day will either hinder or help our
praying. If we allow a state of reaction not born of a simple
relationship to Jesus Christ, we shall have so much wilderness
waste to get through before we can come to God, mists and
shad-ows which come between our conscious life and the
interceding Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is there all the time,
but we have lost sight of Him by allowing things that have not
sprung from our simple relationship to Jesus Christ. Anything
that is so continu-ally with us, even our religious life itself,
that we never really pray in the Holy Spirit, may be a hindrance.
The only one who prays in the Holy Spirit is the child, the
child-spirit in us, the simple spirit of utter confidence in God.</p>

<h2 align="center"><b>Oswald Chambers: Abandoned To God </b></h2>

<p><b>Today we talk of the tremendous challenge of his words, but
during Chamber&#146;s life, his contemporaries spoke more
frequently and fervently of the surprising man they knew. After
meeting Oswald for the first time, one serious young man said,
&quot;I was shocked at what I then considered his undue levity.
He was the most irreverent Reverend I had ever met!&quot;<br>
</b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By David McCasland</li>
</ul>

<p>The cable from Cairo arrived around midday at the stately
London home of Mrs. Reader Harris, head of the Pentecostal League
of Prayer. Hoping it contained good news, Mrs. Harris slit the
envelope and quickly removed the thin paper inside. The message
left her stunned. </p>

<p>OSWALD IN HIS PRESENCE</p>

<p>Her mind raced to link the words with the reality they
conveyed. Oswald gone from this life? But when, why, and how?
People would want to know. But this was wartime, and everyone
understood that letters posted that day in Egypt could take three
weeks to arrive in England-providing the ship convoy eluded the
German submarines. Perhaps she could cable the Y.M.C.A. to
request more information.</p>

<p>Mrs. Harris gazed out the window at the fog-shrouded, barren
trees on Clapham Common. Chambers had loved to walk the grassy
fields of the common with his students from the Bible Training
College, formerly located not fifty yards from where she stood.
Now she must send the news of his passing throughout the League.</p>

<p>Four miles away in East Dulwich, Oswald&#146;s sister,
Gertrude, answered the door of the Chambers&#146; home at 11
Tintagel Crescent.</p>

<p>&quot;A cable? Yes, thank you.&quot;</p>

<p>She returned to the small kitchen where Oswald&#146;s parents,
Clarence and Hannah, sat at the table. Gertrude handed the
envelope to her bearded, white-haired father, three weeks before
his eightieth birthday. Clarence read the words aloud,
&quot;OSWALD IN HIS PRESENCE.&quot;</p>

<p>No details. No explanation of why their youngest son was dead.
This was the way of news in the war. Almost without comprehending
the fact themselves, the three began writing to family members
and friends. &quot;. . . Cable just received from Cairo . . .
Oswald with the Lord . . . will send more as we know.&quot; If
the letters caught the early post, they would reach the others in
England and Scotland by the next morning.</p>

<p>At the time of Chambers&#146; death, American troops had been
in Europe only five months. War fervor still throbbed in the
United States as people sang &quot;I&#146;m a Yankee Doodle
Dandy&quot; and &quot;We won&#146;t come back till it&#146;s
over, over there.&quot; Charlie Chaplin, Mary Pickford, and other
movie stars promoted Liberty bonds, and families prayed for a
quick end to the war. </p>

<p>By the end of 1917, nearly every household in Britain had lost
a husband, father, or son in the war. During the Battle of the
Somme in July, 1916, 600,000 Allied soldiers had been killed. The
Germans had lost half a million men. People who could not absorb
the tragedy on an international scale found themselves torn again
and again by the pain of personal grief. Britain was weary of
rationed food, financial hardships, and broken lives but was
still determined to fight on. The conflict some had predicted
would end in a few months approached its fourth Christmas with no
sign of &quot;peace on earth, good will toward men.&quot; The
only bright spot was General Allenby&#146;s advance in Palestine.
Chambers had been expecting orders to that front when his call
came to &quot;higher service.&quot;</p>

<p>Word of Chambers&#146; death reached the Rev. David Lambert in
Sunderland on Saturday, November 17. &quot;Received the
astounding news that Rev. Oswald Chambers has passed away in
Egypt,&quot; he wrote in a diary letter to his son in France.
&quot;I cannot take it in. Dead e&#146;re his prime. Of all the
men I have known, none have influenced me more. I loved him as my
own soul. I have not felt any blow so much since little Normie
died in 1908. It is not hopeless sorrow or resentment, but sheer
staggerment.</p>

<p>Just over nine years before, Lambert and his wife, Emma, had
met Chambers shortly after losing their youngest son. They had
buried Norman on a bank holiday weekend when the bright sunshine
and happy crowds seemed to mock their sorrow. A month later, when
Chambers came to Sunderland for a League of Prayer Convention,
the grieving young couple longed for a word and a healing touch
from God.</p>

<p>Out of curiosity, Lambert looked in on one of the afternoon
League meetings and was &quot;arrested by the vigorous style and
virile message of a young minister with a Scottish accent.&quot;
Oswald&#146;s subject, Regeneration, &quot;fell like a
lightning-stroke upon the artificiality and manmade activities of
much of the religion of that time.&quot;</p>

<p>Chambers became a guest in their home, a favorite friend of
their children, and the source of lasting spiritual
encouragement. </p>

<p>Lambert paused in the letter to his son and took a yellowed
envelope from his desk drawer. From it, he removed a typical
piece of hurried but succinct correspondence, received from
Oswald in 1909: <br>
My dear Bro. Lambert,</p>

<p>Praise God for your report that the Devil is paying attention
to you-so long as he keeps firing at us you may depend he thinks
that we are worth watching. My hearty greetings to your wife and
bairns.</p>

<p>The &#145;plague of flies&#146; was not peculiar to Egypt-you
will find them in the shape of busy little people that try to get
over the window of your soul and irritate your outlook. God bless
you. </p>

<p>Yours, Oswald Chambers </p>

<p>On November 18, 1917, the day after receiving news of
Oswald&#146;s death, Lambert continued his diary: &quot;The one
thing with me most is the passing of O.C. I recall many scenes of
the past when he first came to Wesley Hall, those marvelous Bible
Readings he gave us. And now he has gone. And yet I realize him
alive in a remarkable way. Not through any sense contact, but as
I realize that Paul and Luther and Spurgeon and Moody and Reader
Harris and the great saints are living. They are. So is O.C., in
the radiance of His Presence.</p>

<p>&quot;On December 5, 1917, the League of Prayer&#146;s
Wednesday evening meeting at Caxton Hall, Westminster, was set
apart as a memorial service for Chambers. After tributes from
League members and friends, Oswald&#146;s eldest brother, Arthur,
took the podium. </p>

<p>He described Oswald as a &quot;young hero of the Cross&quot;
and likened him to Barnabas-&quot; A good man, and full of the
Holy Ghost and of faith&quot;. (Acts 11:24). </p>

<p>&quot;Oswald was a man with an energetic, inspiring
personality,&quot; Arthur said. &quot;Once started in any
direction, he quickly outpaced his teachers. I persuaded him to
pray his first prayer in a prayer meeting, but he soon passed me
by and became a master in intercession. </p>

<p>&quot;He was full of the Holy Ghost and that was the secret of
his happy service. He was absolutely free from worry, living what
he liked to call a &#145;restlessly restful life.&#146;</p>

<p>&quot;Oswald was a good man with no value for mere money or
personal advantage. He would give away to all who asked. He had
no use for those who sought to make much of him instead of the
message he had to bring. &quot;</p>

<p>He was full of faith. How well I remember his return in 1907
from a round-the-world trip on which he felt called to go. He
threw down half-a-crown and said, &#145;There, I&#146;ve been
round the world, all found, on no-pence a week, and have
half-a-crown left.&#146; On the first leg of that voyage, aboard
the S.S. Baltic, he told me he had spoken on spiritual things to
every one of the 1,300 people on board, from the captain to the
boy in the stokehold. </p>

<p>&quot; &#145;Much people was added to the Lord&#146; sums up
the result of his life. His one aim was to be &#145;broken bread
and poured out wine&#146; for the Master. Throughout his life,
his early mornings were given to prayer for others and receiving
the daily anointing which gave him such a skillful touch with
souls both here in England and finally in Egypt.&quot;</p>

<p>The service closed with the singing of one of Oswald&#146;s
favorite hymns, &quot;Love That Wilt Not Let Me Go.&quot;</p>

<p>Ten days later, at another memorial service in Manchester, the
Rev. David Lambert brought the tribute to O.C., outlining the
teaching of the man whose life he called &quot;the finest
commentary on the Sermon on the Mount I know.&quot; All of the
hundreds there who knew the man being remembered could have added
an unforgettable phrase uttered by him, or recalled an act of
kindness, indelibly imprinted on their memory.</p>

<p>Lambert summed up the impact of this life lived so fully for
the Lord: &quot;The most precious thing that has come to many of
us through the message of God&#146;s beloved servant, Oswald
Chambers, is that for the lowliest, least promising, and most
insignificant person, the Great Life is possible. The mightiest
things are made available for ordinary persons in and through
Christ Jesus our Lord. </p>

<p>&quot;God help us to follow him as he followed Christ.&quot;</p>

<p>That should have been the end of it. Oswald Chambers was only
one of hundreds of thousands of British men who died during the
Great War. We could expect his contemporaries to speak of him
from time to time for months or even years, and then the
references would fade with the passing of time and his
generation. Instead, exactly the opposite has happened. Today,
more people know his name and writings than when he was alive.</p>

<p>Long years after Chambers&#146; death, his words are still in
the hearts and on the lips of people around the world. The books
that bear his name are read daily by literally millions of people
in scores of languages. His messages can be found in print, on
audio tapes, calendars, bookmarks, and even refrigerator magnets.
</p>

<p>Why the continued interest in the words of a man who was born
before automobiles, telephones, and electric lights? Why do his
statements sound as if they were written right after he read
today&#146;s newspaper? </p>

<p>The answer lies both in the message and the man. The two are
inseparable. This is the story of their merging into the unique
individual whom the world has refused to forget.</p>

<p>It is also the story of the woman standing at his grave in Old
Cairo, wondering how she could go on without him. </p>

<p>Her given name was Gertrude, but Oswald always called her
Biddy, an affectionate nickname. After Oswald&#146;s death, she
spent the rest of her life giving his words to the world. The
result of her self-sacrificing work under very difficult
conditions was some fifty books bearing his name, but never
mentioning her own. </p>

<p>&quot;When the heart sees what God wants,&quot; Oswald used to
say, &quot;the body must be willing to spend and be spent for
that cause alone.&quot;</p>

<p>Both of them saw, they were willing, and they were spent. What
follows is the story of their utmost for God&#146;s highest.</p>

<h2>The Adversaries</h2>

<p><br>
<b>The Jeremiah Morgans of Ohio and the Seth Coopers of Virginia
share a friendship and faith stretching back two centuries to
Edenford, England. But when the Morgan brothers run slaves to
freedom during a Cooper family visit, a small-scale skirmish
between these Northern and Southern families breaks out,
prophetic of the full-scale war to follow. Can a commitment to
God and family overcome hatred and vendettas? Join a new
generation of Morgans as they experience life and love amidst a
nation at war with itself. </b></p>

<ul type="circle">
    <li>By Jack Cavanaugh</li>
</ul>

<p>A stream of Negro slaves backed out of the two-foot-square
opening high above the ground on the side of the house. Moments
before, a flush panel hid the opening to casual eyes. Now, one by
one, the runaways emerged, feet searching blindly for the first
rung of the splintery ladder. The wooden stairway shivered,
taking on the fear of those descending it. </p>

<p>Marshall Morgan stood at the foot of the ladder with a
musket-rifle in his hands. A young man of twenty-one, he oversaw
the procession. With rare exception, upon reaching the ground,
each slave would cast a suspicious glance in his direction. Their
gaze usually worked its way up from the ground to his chest, his
clean-shaven chin, then his brown eyes. When they reached the
white streak in his full, brown hair, their own eyes bulged with
fright. The unusual birthmark stretched from forehead to crown.
The runaways stared at the streak like it was the mark of Cain.
Over the years Marshall had grown accustomed to the reaction. His
father said it was Marshall's wild streak coming out. </p>

<p>As runaway after runaway poured out of the opening, Marshall
wiped a river of sweat from the side of his head with the back of
one hand. With each new appearance at the top of the ladder, he
grimaced. &quot;Cato, how many are there? </p>

<p>A heavily perspiring, middle-aged Negro slave, his back a maze
of crisscrossed scars, stood beside him. It was a scorching
August day which made it that much hotter for the slaves hiding
in the attic of Thomas Goodin's house.</p>

<p>&quot;Twenty-eight in all, Mas'r Morgan.&quot;</p>

<p>Twenty-eight?&quot; Marshall shouted.</p>

<p>&quot;Is dat not good?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Cato, I only have three skiffs.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;We's fit in 'um. We's see to that,&quot; the runaway
insisted. </p>

<p>Despite the heat, the growing pool of slaves huddled close to
one another. There was more than a dozen of them already, of all
sizes and description. Most were barefoot. Some carried small
bundles of clothes, others carried nothing more than the rags
they were wearing. But as different as they were from one
another, the runaways standing next to Tom Goodin's house were
alike in one thing-without exception, they craned their necks in
the direction of the Ohio River which, though a short distance
away, was still hidden from their view by a ridge. When an
occasional gust of moist air from the river blew over the ridge,
the runaways lifted their faces and sniffed it like bloodhounds
on the scent. For them the Ohio was a mystical river, not unlike
the pearly gates of heaven. It was the frequent setting of
late-night stories told around slave campfires by visionaries who
defended its existence, but who had never seen it themselves. It
was a watery boundary line between two worlds. On this side was
Kentucky and slavery; on the other side was Ohio and freedom. </p>

<p>Marshall Morgan and his two brothers assisted runaways in
crossing the boundary. A secret network of houses and other
resting places were linked like an underground railroad that
transported slaves to freedom. The Morgan brothers' portion of
the fine went from Tom Goodin's house in Kentucky to the Zion
Baptist Church in Cincinnati, Ohio. And though Marshall had
assisted hundreds of runaways across the Ohio River, he never
tired of their reaction when the river of legend came into sight.
He thought of Cato's comment about crowding into the skiffs. Yes,
Cato, somehow you will find a way to fit twenty-eight people into
three skiffs. Of that I have no doubt. Wiping away another stream
of sweat from his temple, Marshall nervously glanced over his
shoulder. While the attention of the slaves was drawn to the
river, his was drawn to the road at the front of the house. He
was expecting unwant&#31;ed company. He hoped to be across the
river when they arrived. </p>

<p>A tuft of trees obstructed his view of the dirt road, so
Marshall looked for rising dust. The air above the road was
clear. Good. But he knew it wouldn't stay that way for long. </p>

<p>There was a break in the flow of traffic down the ladder as a
slight, elderly woman paused on every rung, steadying herself on
each step before continuing. Cato moved to the foot of the ladder
to assist her. The woman's slowness prompted Marshall to cast
another agitated glance toward the road. &quot;Three more steps,
Mother Kinney,&quot; Cato said, reaching out to her. &quot;Three
more steps clos'r to freedom.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Is we at the Ohio?&quot; The old woman planted an
uncertain foot on the ground. </p>

<p>&quot;Nearly there, Mother Kinney, nearly there.&quot; </p>

<p>The woman was bent with age. Her arms and hands and face were
draped with wrinkles wet with perspiration. &quot;Are you the one
ferry'n us 'cross de river to de promised land?&quot; Ancient
eyes stared at the white streak as she spoke. There was a fair
gazing distance between the old runaway's eyes and his, she being
so small and he of good height. </p>

<p>&quot;Yes, ma'am. I'll get you across the river.&quot; </p>

<p>The old woman scoffed at his politeness. &quot;I ain't no
ma&#146;am. jus' Mother Kinney.&quot;</p>

<p>She held out her hand. Marshall reached for it. Two silver
dollars plopped into his palm. </p>

<p>&quot;It's all I got,&quot; she said. 'Will it get me 'cross
dat Ohio River?&quot; </p>

<p>The two coins weighed heavy in Marshall's hand. They
represented untold hours of extra work on some slaveholder's
plantation, or possibly months of late-night basket weaving to
produce a product that sold for pennies. It was the old woman's
lifetime investment in her freedom. From experience, Marshall
knew that runaway slaves with money had a better chance of making
it than those without. Even then there were no guarantees.
Sometimes runaways handed their money to impostors who claimed to
work for the underground railroad. After taking the slaves'
money, the unprincipled men would then turn them over to slave
hunters for a price, making a double profit. </p>

<p>Cato stared hard at Marshall to see what he would do with the
old woman's money. Marshall returned the coins to her. </p>

<p>&quot;I don't want your money, Mother Kinney,&quot; he said.
&quot;You'll need it to start your new life in Canada.&quot; The
old woman couldn't have looked more pleased if the angel Gabriel
himself had just returned the coins. </p>

<p>&quot;See, Mother Kinney?&quot; Cato said. &quot;I tol' you he
was a good man.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I knows he's a good man,&quot; Mother Kinney said rather
testily, &quot;but not 'cause you says he was. I knowed it 'cause
God done tol' me I could trust him.&quot; She patted Marshall on
the arm. &quot;Lot' bless you, Mas'r Morgan,&quot; Mother Kinney
said. &quot;Lor' bless you real good. Now where's dat river I's
heard so much about?&quot; </p>

<p>Cato assisted Mother Kinney to the huddle of runaways next to
the house as the last of them came down the ladder. Marshall
looked to the road again. Still no dust. Maybe the alarm was
false; maybe, just maybe, they'd make it across the river without
being discovered; maybe he should ask Mother Kinney if God spoke
to her about their chances. </p>

<p>&quot;Cato, come here!&quot; Marshall pointed to the ridge
that separated them from the river. &quot;See the elm tree in the
notch of that ridge?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I sees it.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Just beyond that tree there's a path that leads down to
the river. Tom Goodin is there with the skiffs. Get everyone
loaded into them as quickly as you can. Have them hunker down and
cover them with the tarps. Do you got that?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;It's mighty hot fo' tarps, Mas'r Morgan.&quot; </p>

<p>I know, but it can't be helped. Ordinarily we wait until dark.
Today we have no choice. It's not enough just to get you across
the river, Cato. If you're seen you can still be captured and
brought back from the Ohio side.&quot; </p>

<p>I knows dat,&quot; Cato said indignantly. &quot;It's still
gonna be mighty hot under dem tarps.&quot;<br>
&quot;But they're necessary cover. Hurry now.&quot;<br>
&quot;Ain't you comin' wid us?&quot; </p>

<p>Marshall patted Cato on the shoulder and gave him a shove in
the direction of the ridge. &quot;I'm right behind you. Someone
has to put the panel back in place and get rid of this
ladder.&quot; Marshall looked to the road again. A cloud of dust
billowed over it like an approaching storm. &quot;Go, Cato!
Hurry!&quot; he cried. Cato ran for the ridge, yelling for the
slaves to follow him. Marshall dropped his musket-rifle and
vaulted up the ladder. Halfway up he stopped. Below him a column
of runaways bunched up at the notch in the ridge like grains of
sand squeezing through the mid-section of an hourglass. On the
other side of him the cloud of dust loomed closer. Marshall
looked at the opening in the side of the house. No. No time. I
can't let them see me, he thought. Got to get away. </p>

<p>He jumped from the ladder and landed next to his rifle with a
thud. He could hear the horses coming up the road. Two? Three? He
couldn't tell. Grabbing his firearm, Marshall Morgan ran as fast
as he could toward the ridge, frightening the last of the slaves
as he dove past them over the embankment. From behind him came a
grating voice: </p>

<p>&quot;There! Stop right there! Stop or we'll shoot you like
dogs!&quot;<br>
Marshall tumbled down the ridge, slamming into the base of a
bush, his rifle clattering next to him on the ground. Cato and
the first of the runaways had just reached the river's edge. Tom
Goodin was holding the lines of three skiffs. At the sound of the
shouting, the Negroes who bad made it over the ridge froze and
stared in panic in the direction of the voices. Those closest to
Marshall looked at him sprawled against the bush. Their faces
were portraits of shock and disbelief. Could they have come this
far, only to be turned away at heaven's gate?</p>

<p>&quot;Stop dead in your tracks! I swear I'll shoot!&quot; the
voice bellowed. &quot;Ain't shot no slave all day and I'm achin'
to bag me one!&quot;</p>

<p>The voice was drawing closer to the ridge. The eyes of a dozen
slaves pleaded silently to Marshall for help. He scrambled to his
feet. Cato and Goodin were looking his direction too. Motionless,
they waited for some kind of guidance or signal. What should they
do? In horror they watched as Marshall snatched up his rifle and
darted into the bushes. He disappeared upstream before the voice
on the other side of the ridge materialized into a face.</p>

<p>Backing them up against the Ohio River, Frank Toombs held a
steady rifle on the fine of runaway slaves. Tom Goodin, still
holding the lines of the three skiffs in his hand, stood with
them. Toombs, a short, rotund slave hunter, removed his left hand
from his rifle briefly to wipe the sweat from his patchy, bearded
cheeks and reposition the two revolvers in his waistband. He was
in good spirits despite the fact that there were twenty-eight of
them --twenty --nine if you counted Goodin --and only one of him.
The slave hunter chuckled to himself as he surveyed the runaways
standing meekly beside the river. Sheep. That&#146;s what they
are. Sheep waiting to be herded back to their pens. If they
weren't so stupid, he thought, they'd realize they could
overpower me simply by rushing me. Even if he was able to get off
every shot, he could stop only thirteen of them-with six shots
from each pistol and one from the rifle. That would mean fifteen
of them would go free. More than half. Besides, what are the
chances of getting off thirteen shots? But, lucky for him,
runaways didn't think things like that. That's what made his job
so easy. They were sheep. Superior intelligence, that's what made
the difference between him and them, he sniffed. They were no
match for his superior intelligence. </p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Frank! Whatcha got there?&quot; </p>

<p>Toombs jumped at the sound of the voice behind him. A quick
glance over his shoulder brought a grin. &quot;Morgan! Come here!
Look what I got! I bagged me some runaways.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Well, so you have!&quot; Marshall Morgan sauntered down
the ridge to the river's edge, his musket-rifle slung casually
over his shoulder. You captured all of them by yourself?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Watkins and me done it,&quot; the slave hunter
proclaimed proudly. &quot;He's off to Maysville for chains and a
few more hands.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;A good day's work,&quot; Marshall said, surveying the
runaways. A mixture of expressions greeted him ranging from
disgust to outright hatred. </p>

<p>&quot;See what else I got?&quot; Toombs jabbed the rifle
barrel in the direction of the only white man standing among the
runaways. </p>

<p>&quot;Tom Goodin! Is that you?&quot; Marshall said with a tone
of disbelief.<br>
Goodin didn't respond.&quot;Who woulda thought that quiet ol' Tom
Goodin was runnin' slaves,&quot; Toombs said, &quot;him bein' a
deacon in the church and all?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I never would have guessed it,&quot; Marshall replied.<br>
&quot;Neither did anyone else in Maysville when I told &#145;em
so! They wouldn't believe me when I told 'em it was the honest
truth! That's why Watkins and me had to come alone.&quot;<br>
&quot;How did you find out about Goodin?&quot; Marshall asked.<br>
Toombs grinned a jackal's grin. &quot;A runaway,&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;You torture him or something?&quot;</p>

<p>In-tim-ee-da-tion, Toombs boasted. &quot;Just scared it right
outta him. Watkins shoved the end of a rifle barrel in his mouth,
threatened to blow his fool head off!&quot; He laughed
devilishly. &quot;Amazin', ain't it? For all their singin' of
heaven, most of 'em don't want to go to the pearly gates none too
soon. &quot;Need any help with these slaves?&quot; Marshall
asked, taking his rifle from his shoulder. </p>

<p>&quot;Naw, they's not going anywhere,&quot; Toombs said.<br>
&quot;You just don't want to share the reward money,&quot;
Marshall complained.</p>

<p>A twinkle came to Toombs' eye. &quot;Look at it from my point
of view, Morgan. I can split the money two ways or three ways.
Which would you do if you was me? he chortled. Besides, these
worthless folk ain't anythin' I can't handle.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence. &quot;Who would have thought
Tom Goodin was a slave runner?&quot; Marshall said again.</p>

<p>Yeah, who woulda thought?&quot;</p>

<p>And who would have thought that I work with him?&quot;
Marshall Morgan pointed his rifle at the slave hunter's head. </p>

<p>A nervous grin creased the slave hunter's face, then quickly
disappeared. &quot;I find no humor in this, Morgan.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I intend no humor, Frank.&quot; </p>

<p>Toombs fidgeted in place, his rifle still pointed at the
runaways. What ... what are you gonna do?&quot; With teeth
gritted, Marshall answered, &quot;I was thinking about shoving
the barrel of my gun into your mouth to intim-ee-date you into
lowering your gun.&quot; Marshall's face flushed as he fought to
control the wild beast inside him that wanted to tear into the
slave hunter. </p>

<p>Toombs chuckled nervously. &quot;You wouldn't kill me ... I
know you. Seen you in Maysville hundreds of times. Son' of a
preacher. You wouldn't shoot a white man.&quot; </p>

<p>Marshall touched Toombs' bottom lip with the barrel of his
rifle. &quot;You don't know me as well as you think you do,
Marshall seethed. you're wrong about me and slaves. You see, I'm
the conductor of this underground railroad. And I take personal
offense to anyone who disrupts my schedule. Now, do you want to
find out if you're also wrong about my ability kill a slave
hunter?&quot; Trembling with rage, the rifle barrel jerked in his
hands, pinching Toombs' lip between the weapon and his teeth. A
trickle of blood appeared. </p>

<p>Toombs' leaned backward slightly. His tongue tasted the blood
on his hp. &quot;W ... wh ... what do you want me to do?&quot; he
stammered. </p>

<p>&quot;I already told you. Lower your rifle. Let it fall to the
ground.&quot;</p>

<p>A heavily perspiring Frank Toombs dropped his rifle.</p>

<p>&quot;Now the pistols, one at a time.</p>

<p>There were two soft thuds as the pistols hit the ground.</p>

<p>&quot;Them slaves ain't worth it, Morgan!&quot; Toombs said
looking to the ridge in hopes of spotting reinforcements. There
were none.</p>

<p>Marshall read his thoughts. &quot;No way Watkins could be back
this soon,&quot; he said as he kicked the slave hunter's weapons
further out of reach. &quot;He's probably just reaching Maysville
about now. It'll take him the better part of an hour to round up
help and get back here. By then we'll be long gone.&quot; </p>

<p>A look of pleading appeared on Toombs' face. &quot;All right,
all right!&quot; he cried. &quot;I'll cut you in on the reward
money. That's what you want, isn't it? Twenty-eight runaways,
more than enough money to go around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't want the money.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sure you do!&quot; Toombs cried. &quot;Them runaways
ain't nothin' to you! Even if you let 'em go, word will get out
and they'll be picked up by some other slave hunter before they
reach Cincinnati. Then he'll get the money. The way I see it,
someone's gonna get a heap of money for them slaves. Better us
than someone else, right?&quot;</p>

<p>A sober look crossed Marshall's face. &quot;When word gets out
. . . &quot; he pondered Toombs' statement. His thumb played with
the rifle cock. &quot;There's only one way word can get out,
Frank.&quot;</p>

<p>Cato -yelled from the river's edge. &quot;Tha's right, Mas'r
Morgan! Don't let him go. Shoot him! Shoot him!&quot;</p>

<p>Frank Toombs turned white with fright. &quot;You're not gonna
take directions from a Negro, are you, Morgan? Just let me go ...
I promise I won't tell nobody nothin' - - . I promise ... I'm
even willin&#146; to forget we was even here together ... just
don't - - - &quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Into the skiff,&quot; Marshall ordered.</p>

<p>What?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Into the skiff! We're taking you with us.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You can't do that!&quot; Toombs shouted.</p>

<p>&quot;'There's no room!&quot; Cato shouted. &quot;We's too
crowded already. Shoot him!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Either you get in willingly,&quot; Marshall said to
Toombs, &quot;or I'll ask Mr. Cato and a few of his friends to
assist you.&quot;</p>

<p>Cato was breathing heavily. The memory of a dozen scourgings
churned his hatred for the slave hunter.</p>

<p>&quot;Morgan, no ... wait . . . &quot; Toombs pleaded, not
taking his eyes off Cato, &quot;you're forgetting Watkins! By now
half Of Maysville knows about these slaves.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;All they know is what Watkins told them,&quot; Marshall
replied. &quot;And just a few moments ago you said that no one in
Maysville believed you earlier when you told them Tom Goodin was
running slaves. I imagine the good townspeople of Maysville are
going to be mighty irate when they get here and discover it was
all a prank. They'll come looking for slaves, but all they'll
find is quiet Tom Goodin going about his daily chores. of course,
Watkins will persist in his story. But who do you think the
townspeople will believe? Slave hunter Watkins or deacon
Goodin?&quot; </p>

<p>His voice turned harsh. &quot;Now get into the skiff.&quot; At
gunpoint, Frank Toombs lay on the bottom of the first of the
three skiffs. He moaned and complained as runaway after runaway
piled in on top of him. Then, large tarps were thrown over the
skiffs to conceal the human cargo. The heat under the tarps was
stifling, but the only one heard to complain was Toombs and his
voice was muffled by all the bodies stacked on top of him. </p>

<p>After the slaves were loaded, Marshall's anger gradually
subsided and the trembling in his hands stopped. Turning to Tom
Goodin: &quot;Will you be all right?&quot; </p>

<p>Goodin hadn't quite regained his composure. &quot;It will take
a while for my nerves to settle down, but I'll be fine.&quot; He
chuckled nervously. &quot;Marshall . . . thanks. I thought it was
over for us all.&quot; </p>

<p>Marshall patted him on the shoulder. &quot;So did I.&quot; He
turned to board the skiff. Goodin grabbed his arm. &quot;Standing
by the water's edge,&quot; Goodin's voice quivered as he spoke,
&quot;I thought that even if somehow we escaped, I'd have to
become a runaway myself ... leave my home ... you know, once word
got out I was runnin' slaves. But now, it looks like I'll be able
to stay. Can't thank you enough.&quot; </p>

<p>Marshall extended his hand. Goodin gripped it tightly with
both of his hands. &quot;I didn't have time to replace the panel
in the attic,&quot; Marshall said. &quot;You'd best nail it in
place before Watkins returns.&quot; Goodin nodded. Marshall
stepped into a skiff. </p>

<p>&quot;Marshall?&quot; Goodin's eyes were downcast. &quot;Um
... I hope you'll forgive me for what I thought of you when you
ran away. You know, when Toombs and Watkins first appeared. It's
just that I thought you were running out on us.&quot; </p>

<p>Marshall shrugged. &quot;I would have thought the same thing
had it been you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Anyway, thanks again. God be with you, son.&quot;</p>

<p>Gripping a long pole, Marshall Morgan pushed off, and the
first boatload of runaway slaves lumbered into the Ohio River.
Cato and another slave, piloting the second and third skiffs,
launched their boats. As Marshall poled his skiff into deeper
water, the river sloshed over the sides of the over-loaded craft
prompting startled cries from the runaways under the tarp.</p>

<p>&quot;Is we sinkin'?&quot; a male voice cried. </p>

<p>Lay still!&quot; Marshall shouted. We're low in the water, but
if you stay still we'll make it across.&quot; I hope, he added
silently to himself. </p>

<p>From beneath the tarp Marshall could hear the voice of Mother
Kinney. &quot;'Carry us safely &#145;cross dis river, Lor&#146;.
We's Moses in the basket. Float us into de gentle arms of
Pharaoh's daughter.&quot; </p>

<h2>The Dawning Of Deliverance</h2>

<p><br>
<b>Though a daughter of a princess and a count, Mariana has grown
up as a peasant girl in an obscure village. Suddenly she finds
herself thrust back into elite society and must take her rightful
place as an aristocrat. But Mariana wants to do something more
meaningful with her life. Trained as a nurse, she refuses the
easy life of a Russian socialite and goes to the front lines of
Manchuria to care for wounded soldiers. There she is confronted
with the horrible realities of war and death. And she discovers
something else -- a renewal of her relationship with American
reporter Daniel Trent. But Daniel betrayed her once before ...
can she learn to trust him now? Against the tumultuous backdrop
of pre-revolutionary Russia, a compelling story of God&#146;s
power to bring love and freedom. </b></p>

</ul>

<p>Black smoke coughed from the engine's smokestack, streaking
the clear summer sky with an ugly. ribbon, like a battle scar.
The train was passing through the heart of Siberia now. The
Urals, with their lovely green foothills and meadows covered with
violets and kingcups, had been left behind long ago. With Europe
left far behind as well, a new world had opened up before the
mighty iron engine of the Trans-Siberian Railway.</p>

<p>At least it seemed so to Mariana Remizov,, who had never
before traveled beyond St. Petersburg. The flowery steppes and
black earth of Tiumen had been followed by the dismal city of
Omsk, on a sandy plain populated as much by huge mosquitoes as
b\, people. Then had come the flooded Barabinskaya Steppe. In
spite of the swarms of insects, the steppe was like a wonderland
to Mariana. Lakes and swamps bubbled up from the earth in an
eerie fashion. Water surrounded farms, and sometimes even whole
villages looked like floating islands. Amazed, Mariana had gazed
for hours out the dusty train window at the scenes.</p>

<p>Abruptly the steppe had given way, to woodlands, then the
taiga. This vast primeval forest, which appeared as if it had
never seen the blade of an axe, made Mariana realize just how
small the Russia she had always known was, and how much more
there ,Was to her beloved Motherland. She had passed through the
virgin forest as if in a dream, its swampy mists enveloping her
with darkness and cold. She wondered if the sun ever penetrated
the thick canopy of foliage.</p>

<p>Several breakdowns on the way, causing hours of delays, had
provided Mariana ample opportunity to view the countryside. The
trip across Siberia should only take fifteen days, but she had
already been en route for more than two weeks, and she was still
less than two-thirds of the way to her destination. The train was
approaching Irkutsk-&quot;the pearl of Siberia,&quot; as it was
called. No doubt Mariana would only catch a quick glimpse of the
&quot;pearl&quot; as the train made another quick stop at the
station and then resumed its course. There was so much to see,
and so little time. it would take a dozen lifetimes to experience
everything Russia had to offer.</p>

<p>Even with all the changes of scenery and the interminable
drone of the train beneath her, Mariana could still hardly
believe she was more than three thousand miles from home. But she
had made her decision, and there was no turning back. Not that
she wanted to turn back. This was one of the greatest adventures
of her life, almost as life-changing as the day she had left her
adopted Parents&#146; peasant izba in Katyk for the big city of
St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>Mariana could hardly believe the direction her life had taken.
She had grown up in Katyk as the peasant daughter of Anna and
Sergei Christinin. Life in the village was simple and satisfying,
and Mariana could not have imagined anything else.</p>

<p>Mariana had always known that Anna and Sergei were not her
real parents, but her aunt and uncle. They had told her she was
the daughter of Princess Katrina Fedorcenko, Sergei's sister, who
died in childbirth. When her father, Count Dmitri Remizov
eventually returned, the time had come for her to take her
rightful place in Russian society.</p>

<p>That first giant step had sent her catapulting through many
new and exciting and frightening experiences. She had not only
gone from country girl to city girl; she had leaped from peasant
to countess in the blink of an eye. And once she had made that
move, each successive step became easier. Now she hungered for
adventure-she who had once been content with the prospect of
spending all her days in sleepy old Katyk!</p>

<p>Her mama Anna told her it must be from the blood of her real
mother, Katrina, that flowed in her veins. Katrina had had such a
zest for life, Anna said. She was afraid of nothing, always
confident to enter a new situation with gusto. Of course
Mariana's real father, Dtmitri, had no small part in this also.
Stories of his wild exploits, especially in his youth, always
left Mariana in awe.</p>

<p>Mariana wasn't quite so audacious. She had to admit to some
fear of what lay ahead, but, as when she left Katyk, her fear was
mingled with anticipation. Mama Anna had told her that her
apprehension was a positive sign.</p>

<p>&quot;The fear shows your maturity, Mariana; it says you have
good sense. But you don&#146;t let your fear control you. It
doesn't keep you from a new challenge. &quot;</p>

<p>Mama Anna had spoken those words with tears rising in her
eyes. Certainly, a good part of Mariana's courage had come not by
blood but by a lifetime spent in the loving care of a woman who
had met and conquered her own share of fears and challenges.
Mariana knew it must have been hard for Anna to let her adopted
daughter travel halfway around the world, undoubtedly to
encounter many dangers and hardships. Yet Anna had often said
that the goal of parenting was to raise children so they could
eventually step out on their own. Her own dear papa, Yevno, had
taught her that much.</p>

<p>Yes, Mariana had matured in many ways in the years since she
left Katyk. People seemed to think she was pretty and were always
admiring her smooth skin, dark hair, and green eyes -- her
mother&#146;s eyes, people now said. But her hair was apt to be
pulled back into a practical bun, and long hours of study indoors
had left her skin pale and her eyes weak. She was forced to wear
eyeglasses most of the time.</p>

<p>She was twenty-three years old and still unmarried-a fact that
never failed to amaze others, especially those from her village
where girls were usually married by age fifteen or sixteen. As
Countess Mariana Remizov, she had numerous suitors from the best
families in St. Petersburg. But she had too much to see and do
before she could commit her life to another. Singleness didn't
bother Mariana at all, for it was her choice.</p>

<p>Papa Sergei commended her self-awareness, although her real
father, Dmitri, was beside himself with fear that his only
daughter might become an old maid. Her grandmother, Eugenia, was
outraged. &quot;How can you throw your life away, after all I
have done for you!&quot; the woman had ranted.</p>

<p>Dmitri was more tender: &quot;Dear child, you are so
beautiful, so lovely it is such a waste.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just because I'm not married?&quot; Mariana had replied
with some affront-perhaps she had been spending too much time
with the liberal women at the medical school. &quot;That doesn't
mean my life is wasted, Pere. I'm doing something valuable and
important with my life-helping others.&quot; &quot;But you could
do that if you were married.&quot;</p>

<p>Would I have the freedom to follow this call to the East, if I
were married? I don't think so.&quot; &quot;Oh, don't even
mention that, my dear!&quot;</p>

<p>Mariana knew that her father wished she were married just so
she couldn't go on what he called &quot;this fool's journey of
hers.&quot; He wanted her safe and secure on the estate of some
count or prince, surrounded by babies, and booked up with parties
and concerts and ladies' luncheons. A life like his mother's-a
life that, once the initial glamour had dimmed, had become
increasingly empty and meaningless to Mariana.</p>

<p>Thoughts of marriage had, in fact, been a little more frequent
lately. She even told herself that as soon as the war was over,
she would seriously pursue that path. She did want someone
special in her life, and after this current adventure, she would
be ready to give up her freedom for him, whoever he might be.</p>

<p>But a hunger after adventure wasn't the only reason for her
hesitancy. She had to wonder if her spinsterhood was also because
she had been unable to find a suitor who interested her. She had
fallen into the annoying habit of comparing all men to one
particular cocky American. She had neither seen nor heard from
Daniel Trent in nearly four years, yet he still managed to
intrude into her life, especially when she was introduced to an
eligible male. She had met many handsome young men who were far
better looking than that win, little American with his perpetual
smirk, probing eyes, unruly brown hair, and that silly cleft in
his chin. But none who had been more exciting, more stimulating,
more --</p>

<p>More self-centered, arrogant, and insensitive, Mariana
reminded herself sharply. Hadn't he deceived her and won her
friendship in order to write a story about her for his newspaper?</p>

<p>Still, he seemed sincere in repenting of that error. When they
had spoken before he left Russia to return to America and his
sick father, he had seemed so contrite. By then, though, it was
too late. He would be thousands of miles away, and she was
embarking upon a new life at the St. Petersburg Medical School
for Women. It was hardly a good time to begin a romantic
relationship.</p>

<p>She had written to him once in America but never received a
response. Perhaps she should have been more persistent, but she
had been hurt by his silence and it seemed best to surrender to
fate. No doubt he was getting on with his life without her, and
she resigned herself to do the same. And, after four years, it
was apparent she would never see him again.</p>

<p>Why, then, couldn't she forget him? Was there something to
what she had once read about &quot;soul-mates,&quot; two people
who just fit together, who had the right ingredients to perfectly
complement the other? She had felt that way with Daniel -- that
is, before his newspaper article had ruined everything. Well, if
for no other reason, this journey of hers, this adventure, would
be just the right thing to distract her mind from a hopeless
romance, once and for all.</p>

<p>Just then the train jerked to a sudden stop. Mariana was
thrown hard against the back of the seat ahead of her. Several
other passengers were pitched from their seats entirely, one
crashing into Mariana before landing in the aisle. </p>

"If you love me, you will obey what I command.  And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Counselor to be with you forever -- the Spirit of Truth.

<P>I like this verse because obedience is where the rubber meets the road.  We can believe in God, even have oodles of Bible knowledge.  But if we do not put into practice that which we know, of what use is our faith?  Obedience is the key to experiencing the fullness of Christ.  And then, the Holy Spirit lives within us forever, always ready to counsel us so that we may make the best decisions for ourselves and those around us.

<P>Subject: Getting in God's Way

<P>There is no greater thrill than knowing you being used as a
conduit for God's blessings to the world.  When you once get
to that place, and you experience even the slightest taste
of God using you for His purposes it is so overwhelmingly 
awesome that you will wonder how you would/could choose to
be anywhere but there.  Oswald Chambers wrote, in My Utmost
for His Highest,  <P>

God made us, God loves us, and He is Calling us to Himself.
The only sane response is to obey!<P>

If you knew what God wanted you to do, you would do it with
all your heart.  Give it all up to Him, and Trust that He
will direct your path.
<P>
Shabat Shalom, Ya'll

<p>Good book to read - Crucified by Christians</p>

<p>The author addresses the hurts, betrayals in our lives that
often come from Christians. He discusses choices we can make for
responding. One chapter that was very meaniful was the discussion
of the crucifixion. What if Christ had reacted to the betrayal,
abandonment, lonliness, with bitterness and unforgiveness . . .?
Author discusses the darkness that surfaces in our lives through
hurts and the opportunity to deal with it and crucify our natural
responses. When we do that, we grow in Christ and become more
whole.<br>

<p>One of the ways we share our faith is through our
presentations and seminars on family communication and bonding.
The chance to do this in our lives is a gift from God. And we try
to do His work through our God given talents in experiential
education. . The most rewarding for us are the parent-teenanger
adventures. There is so much discussion and openness - it is
fantastic to watch. </p>

<P>When the Vow Breaks.  A Survival and recovery guide for Christians facing divorce.
<BR>Author: Joseph Warren Kniskern

<P>The best divorce manual with a lot of practical advice.  Very indepth scriptures on divorce.
A section on recovery after a divorce.

<P>I could not have paid a counselor or lawyer for all of the good advice this book has.  It was like having a counselor in a book. I didn't have to make appointments or pay for the sessions and it was with me all the time.

<P>I have recently returned to the Lord. I have been backslid for about 12 years. I had no idea what dark forces that I had opened myself up to. I got involved in some very dark things. My testimony is that Jesus is greater than all the darkness of Satan, and has overcome the Kingdom of Satan for anyone who calls upon His name.

<P>14 years ago I was divorced from my wife of 17 years and thought I had lost my children forever. I had very limited contact with them. My daughter returned to the Lord and began praying for me. One evening her Pastor asked if anyone knew some one by the name of Farrell and gave her a message for 
me. After that it didn't take long for God to work a miracle in my life and deliver me from my involvement in the Occult.

<P>My family and my salvation has been restored. I know have a daughter and a son that I thought I had lost forever.

<P>If anyone reads this, I live in Highland Calif, and attend New Life Fellowship. I would enjoy making some new Christian Cyberfriends. EMail me at <A HREF="mailto:FarrellH@genesisnetwork.net">FarrellH@genesisnetwork.net</A>.

<P>You brought up a very broad subject. You mentioned the lady
at Jabob's well. That is a very good point to show that even
a new Christian, fresh out of the devil's grip, can 
influence others for the sake of Christ. But then on the 
other hand, we read in 1 Tim. 4:16 regarding Pastor Timothy
and his influence over others: "Watch your life and doctrine
closely. Persevere in them, because if you do, you will save
both yourself and your hearers." This shows that a spiritual
leader must be walking upright morally as well as teaching
sound doctrine, not only for his sake, but for the sake of
those whom he will influence. Such influence would extend to
one's salvation as clearly cited. Remember, there will be
no sexually immoral, drunkard, thief, greedy, etc. in the
kingdom of God, but such will be thrown into the lake of
fire (1 Cor. 6:9,10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:5-7; Rev. 21:8).

<P>We have many articles at our web site <A HREF="http://www.hhs.net/evangout">http://www.hhs.net/evangout</A> on various subjects, some of
which touch on your initial question.

<P>God bless you.

<p>Subject: Day of worship
<p>It is my understanding that the Sabbath was Saturday, as  practiced by 
the Jews. After Christ rose from the grave on a Sunday, the early Christians 
changed their day of worship, or the Sabbath, to Sunday.

<p>Subject: Literal Interpretation of the Bible. </p>

<p>I believe in Jesus Christ, yet I cannot reconcile the apparent
contradictions of the Bible. There are so many to point out, such
as two creation stories, two flood stories etc... Do I have
suspend my rational thinking in order to accept Jesus Christ? I
don't think so yet so many I speak with demand that I accept,
word for word, the authenticity of the entire bible? Opinions?
Help? </p>

<p>Subject: Biblical Contradictions??? </p>

<p>Although there may seem to be contradictions in the Biblical
account, there are really none when carefully examined. If you
will, could you please elaborate on the specific Scriptures which
you believe are contradictions in the creation and flood stories? </p>

<p>Please consider the accounts of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John
They are completely harmonious even though given from the four
different perspectives of these men. For example, when two people
see a crime or an accident and each relate the story, although
the basic facts will be the same, they will each be told in a different
style, with perhaps one pointing out more elaborate facts than
the other and perhaps one leaving out minor details. </p>

<p>You mentioned that you believe in the Lord Jesus. Since he
placed his endorsement on the Word of God (Matthew 5:18; 24:35;
Mark 13:31; Luke 16:17; John 17:17), we can rely on it. </p>

<p>The Bible itself claims to be the Word of God (2 Timothy
3:16,17). </p>

<p>Looking forward to hearing from you. God bless you. </p>

<p><strong>Subject: Literal interpretation of the bible </strong></p>

<p>We need to let the Bible be it's own expositor. When we
encounter a text that we cannot understand we need to put it
aside for the moment, continue with the entire passage (to
understand the context) and then come back and fill in the pieces
by finding other references of the text in question. Since the
Bible was written by a diverse group of writers, we need to
understand that each wrote in his own style. On the surface it
might appear that there are contradictions in the Bible, yet when
the reader is attentive and respectfully uncover the fundamental
harmony. The Bible, like most things, comes with
&quot;rules&quot; if you please, which by careful application of
these rules and guidance of the Holy Spirit, God's treasures are
revealed. One such &quot;rules&quot; is pertains to literal vs.
symbolic interpretation. Interpret the text as literal when the
context does not use any symbolic language (beasts, horns, etc.)
When symbols are used, we need to interpret them as how the Bible
has defined these symbols and when time is involved, use
prophetic time periods (day-year principle Ez. 4:6, etc.). </p>

<p>Subject: set free! </p>

<p>Tell your friend to try the following, which worked for me.
Have him/her take all cigarettes, ash trays and lighters over to
the trash can. Throw the ash trays and lighters out. Break each
cigarette into two or three pieces and throw them all away.
Either as you do this or after you are done, tell Jesus how sorry
you are and how you want to be free of this disgusting, filthy
habit which ruins your personal testimony, not to mention your
lungs. Tell Jesus you want to live for Him and do whatever would
be pleasing and glorifying to Him from today and for the rest of
your life. When you are tempted by the devil to smoke again, cry
out to God to help you overcome, and He will. &quot;No temptation
has seized you except what is common to man. And God is faithful;
he will not let you be tempted beyond what you can bear. But when
you are tempted, he will also provide a way out so that you can
stand up under it&quot; (1 Cor. 10:13). </p>

<p>Whom the Son sets free is free indeed (John 8:36). Hallelujah!

<p>Hi Kathy! I know what you mean about the Old Testament.
Sometimes you read things that seem almost impossible to do as a
Human Being. In my honest opinion, I believe Jesus came to set us
free from all the bindings of the old law. Jesus said: &quot;I
have not come to abolish the law, but to fulfill it&quot;. That
may not be verbatim, but I believe I know what he meant. He has
paid all the &quot;prices&quot; for those who believe in him. He
was the sacrifice for our sins, and became our intercessor before
God Almighty. That's great news! Hope this helps you out. </p>

<p>I personally prefer the King James Version of the Bible and do
<br>
not trust any other. I pray before I read the Word that the Holy
Spirit <br>
permits the understanding of God's Word that I don't distort or
misconstrue <br>
its meaning. I am suspicious of the potential harm that one can
obtain from <br>
New International versions, Living or American Bibles. Maybe I
feel they are <br>
diluted or too convenient. If the Bible does not suit our needs
let us modify <br>
the Bible to soothe or satiate our needs under the pretext of
what? allegded <br>
understanding? Let us pray we will all be called to Jesus's
Altar. If I am <br>
wrong! I beg your indulgence and ask forgiveness from God all the
way down to <br>
mortal man. </p>

<p>Subject: My son is schizophrenic</p>

<p>From: Carol Wilson<br>
Marrero, LA<br>
<br>
To whom it may concern:<br>
<br>
With a heavy heart and dwindling hope, I once again sit down to
send a<br>
fresh batch of letters out to anyone I can find in hope that
somewhere<br>
someone will listen and help me save my son. This is not a letter<br>
requesting funds but one requesting public support.<br>
<br>
We are the parents of a 15 year old boy who was diagnosed 2 years
ago<br>
with schizoaffective disorder/schizophrenia. This summer, we
learned he<br>
also has a genetic condition known as Klinefelter Syndrome.
Klinefelter<br>
Syndrome males have cells with the genetic chromosomal makeup of
47,XXY<br>
as opposed to 46,XY. Our son is a mosaic with 47,XXY on 93% of
his cells<br>
and 46,XY on the other 7%. The condition causes hypogonadism,
among<br>
other things, and requires testosterone replacement therapies.<br>
<br>
Due to his psychiatric history, I have found doctors are
unwilling to<br>
treat his low testosterone levels on an outpatient basis, and
medically<br>
necessary treatment is withheld. There is also a pharmacological
by-play<br>
that occurs with hormones and anti-psychotics, so doctors have to
be very<br>
careful to all work together to treat this young man in a
specialized<br>
way.<br>
<br>
Two years ago when our son was first diagnosed with
schizoaffective<br>
disorder, the Louisiana state psychiatrist, Dr. Charmaine
Semenuik, who<br>
had the courage to make such a diagnosis on one so young told us
he was<br>
in need of the structure and care a residential facility provided
and<br>
that we could not afford to pay for his treatments. We were not
ready to<br>
believe that, so we have spent the last two years and great sums
of money<br>
to obtain treatments and to maintain him at home and in the
community.<br>
But faith died in the face of reality.<br>
<br>
Now, 9 hospitalizations and thousands of dollars later, we have
come to<br>
realize our son must get the level of care intermediate placement
in a<br>
neuro-psychiatric facility will provide so that one day he will
be able<br>
to live in the community. His current outpatient psychiatrist,
Dr.<br>
Padmini Nagaraj, as well as his former doctor, Dr. Robert
Detrinis, have<br>
both told us our son needs this high level of care. At the
National<br>
Institutes of Health, our son was determined to be
multi-dimensionally<br>
impaired and of a small group of children who need the services
of a<br>
highly structured program for a while to achieve success.
Additionally,<br>
Dr. Mark Forman of Tulane Medical Center did an evaluation and
concurs<br>
with everyone's findings. We love our son dearly and have not
wanted to<br>
send him away for treatment, but there comes a time when love is
strong<br>
enough to make a tough decision.<br>
<br>
Sadly, our state does not offer such services. Further, the
insurance<br>
we have through my husband's company does not have good coverage
for<br>
mental illness issues and will not cover this level of care. I
guess<br>
Medicaid wasted so much money on fraudulent long-term psychiatric<br>
services (as evidenced by the Times-Picayune series by Chris
Adams,<br>
&quot;Medicaid Madness,&quot; written last year)and is moving
toward in home<br>
neuropsychiatric placements only, regardless of the clinical
condition,<br>
with supposed services in the community, that they have cut
entirely the<br>
program to finance intermediate neuropsychiatric care.<br>
<br>
Also, my son only qualifies for Medicaid when out of the home for
30 days<br>
or more, so community services are not available to us, and we
cannot<br>
afford private ones. The waiver programs that waive parental
income for<br>
the children's Medicaid provision are for the developmentally
disabled<br>
only, and even there, it is a waiting list of about 9,000, but
those<br>
families are able to access supports and services denied to us.
So in<br>
the community, my son will be where he has been for the last 2
years,<br>
without services or support except 30 days per year acute care in
a<br>
psychiatric hospital through our private insurance to stabilize
acute<br>
episodes and not to rehabilitate his condition and condition him
to med<br>
compliance, and he also will be allowed 50 medicine checks per
year with<br>
a psychiatrist. Not to mention that quite a few of the programs
for his<br>
diagnosis are for those 18 or older. For two years, I have
written<br>
letters, made phone calls, and knocked on doors to locate support
and<br>
services only to be denied.<br>
<br>
Although we have located an appropriate placement in Austin,
Texas, where<br>
they are experienced in treating boys of both of our son's
particular<br>
diagnoses and where they are a Louisiana Medicaid provider, there
are no<br>
funds or coverage for treatment. Medicaid coverage or state
coverage in<br>
this state for long-term care for adolescents falls into 3
categories:<br>
those with IQs below 65, those who were removed from violent or<br>
neglectful home environments, and juvenile offenders. Giving up
custody<br>
to the state would result in disaster for our son and the
services he<br>
needs not being accessed since he does not meet the above
criteria for<br>
placement. How can the state care for my son better than I can?<br>
<br>
Additionally, to accomplish such a thing, I would have to press
false<br>
charges against my son as an ungovernable juvenile, which in all<br>
likelihood would result in this incredibly naive and not very
street<br>
smart kid being placed in a juvenile residential facility for
deviant<br>
juveniles where he would be at risk to be taken advantage of or
to learn<br>
deviant behaviors. As things continue, without immediate
treatment, he<br>
will become entwined needlessly in the juvenile justice system
through<br>
misperception of a situation or he will fall prey to substance
abuse. It<br>
happens all the time, and we all know it. What a nightmare! The
thought<br>
of going such a route and losing my son in such a senseless
manner makes<br>
me quite ill.<br>
<br>
The service providers I believe are beginning to see our son's
need for<br>
an out of the home placement, but they are insisting I give up
custody<br>
and that he be placed in an inappropriate placement. I was told
recently<br>
that such placements as I seek in Texas would be available to us
if my<br>
son were a victim of brain trauma or brain injury. I contend that<br>
neurobiological brain disorders are the evidence of brain insult
of some<br>
type. I also feel it is not right for a federally funded program
such<br>
as Medicaid to pay for the developmentally disabled to receive
this level<br>
of service but not the psychiatrically disabled. Is that not in<br>
violation of the American's with Disablities Act? Were not the
federal<br>
guidelines written in such a way as to make states responsible
for the<br>
care of their mentally ill and not to exempt them from covering
these<br>
people?<br>
<br>
Somewhere we have to realize you cannot put a fiscal value on a
human<br>
life. Some way has to be found where my son can acquire Medicaid
or<br>
other coverage for the treatments he needs in Austin, Texas. And
some way<br>
must be found to approve him for services in Austin. At some
point, we<br>
have to stop passing out emotional bandaids and begin doing
advanced<br>
reconstructive surgery. Only then can we even hope to save this
young<br>
man's life. My husband is a professional and has a good job, but
with 5<br>
children, medical debt, assisting one child in college, and other<br>
necessities, the $400-$500 perday of our son's care is beyond us.
We<br>
have always been honest, solid, hard-working Americans. Why
should we be<br>
required to give up custody of our child because we cannot afford
medical<br>
care? Why should our child be denied appropriate medical care
because of<br>
the convenience of the state?<br>
<br>
When will we alleviate the suffering of the mentally ill with
timely and<br>
appropriate treatments and not base their care on financial
restraints?<br>
When will we begin to realize that mental illness left untreated
or not<br>
properly treated is a terminal illness too?<br>
<br>
I was informed Monday, October 21, that Louisiana Medicaid no
longer<br>
pays for intermediate residential psychiatric care for the<br>
psychiatrically disabled children or adolescents. I further have
been<br>
informed that the state of Louisiana will not assume
responsibility for<br>
his care either. I also am aware that at the facility in Texas
where my<br>
son is approved for treatment is a Louisiana girl there at the
expense of<br>
the state of Louisiana, but she is in custody of the state of
Louisiana.<br>
Again, why should parents have to yield custody to obtain
treatments?<br>
<br>
I am not asking for my son to be locked away. I am asking for
medically<br>
necessary treatments for 6 months to a year in a facility where
he would<br>
not be in a lockdown unit and could receive appropriate medical<br>
interventions that will save him from becoming another Michael
Cochran of<br>
the 48 Hours broadcast of October 24. He also will be in a
program to<br>
prepare him to live in the community. When he is 18, if he lives
that<br>
long and we are able to stabilize and rehabilitate him now, he
will be<br>
able to fully access available community supports and services on
his<br>
own, much better than we can for him at this time. As I read the
federal<br>
guidelines, minors under the age of 21 are the responsibility of
the<br>
state to provide coverage for on an inpatient basis (including<br>
residential care) for a mental illness if such care is deemed<br>
medically necessary and for a definite period of time and the
patient's<br>
condition is reasonably expected to improve to the point that
such<br>
inpatient care will no longer be necessary. The HCFA states that
the<br>
goal of the legislature was to leave the care of the mentally ill
with<br>
the state, but to provide Medicaid coverage for the mentally ill
under 21<br>
and over 65.<br>
<br>
Currently, my son is at Southeast State Mental Hospital where he
has been<br>
for the last month, and where through our efforts, we were able
to push<br>
for a lifting of time constraints since he is not stable enough
to return<br>
home. We were able to gain about 3 months while Dr. Forman
continues to<br>
monitor and evaluate his pharmacological condition and to see to
what<br>
extent he needs antipsychotics. However, Southeast does not have
the<br>
program to meet my son's needs beyond that 3 months, or even less
if they<br>
are able to establish a pharmacological program for my son. Four
days<br>
off all medications, and he has already gone from a model patient
to<br>
someone who has punched 2 holes in the wall. As Dr. Nagaraj has
written,<br>
his behavior problems are secondary to medication compliance.<br>
<br>
I have also spoken with Dr. Paul Balson, the chief psychiatrist
for the<br>
state of Louisiana, and found him to be compassionate and
intelligent and<br>
knowledgeable about the plight of the mentally ill in this state.
He has<br>
patiently explained to me that folks of my son's diagnosis have a
very<br>
difficult time in the family home without the structure and
emotional<br>
sterility necessary for stabilization.<br>
<br>
Most sources sincerely wish me luck in this fight for services,
but<br>
caution me about the impossibility of winning. I do not want to
have to<br>
move, as Dr. Ron Boudreaux of DHHS told me many folks have done
to<br>
secure medical treatments for a Louisiana citizen. When my son
becomes<br>
18, if things continue along this course this battle will become
even<br>
more impossible to win, and I will have lost a son to this
devastating<br>
disease.<br>
<br>
Even though he is retiring and leaving office, Senator Johnston's
office<br>
has been of a tremendous help and support. Constituent Services
of<br>
Governor Mike Foster's office informed me the governor could not
get<br>
involved because if he did for our family, he would have to for
every<br>
other family in the state of Louisiana. I guess I made the
mistake of<br>
thinking that the governor is elected to serve the needs of all
the<br>
people he represents. Perhaps your office will tell me the same
thing.<br>
Other state and federal legislators have ignored me, or I have
been told<br>
by their offices that there is nothing they can or will do.<br>
<br>
And, so, I write to you. Surely you must be able to know some way
we can<br>
keep this boy from being another sad statistic. Dr. Ron Boudreaux
of the<br>
Mental Health division of the Louisiana DHHS told me on Monday,
October<br>
28, that this level of care is no longer available in Louisiana
because<br>
&quot;it is not appropriate for the vast majority.&quot; But, all
these doctors<br>
who have clinically evaluated my son from the private, state, and<br>
national sectors cannot be wrong in saying he is one of the
minority for<br>
whom the level of care is a must. The vast majority of people do
not<br>
require the wheelchair ramps at the public library either, but
the ADA<br>
says they must be there for the minority. I contend this level of
care<br>
was never intended to be abolished by state programs but to be
there for<br>
that minority like my son who must have it. He did say he
instructed the<br>
providers in Jefferson Parish to give my son's case &quot;special<br>
consideration&quot; for community supports and services, but I
realize the<br>
extremely limited amount that is available to us will not be
enough, and<br>
we will be putting a bandaid on a situation in need of
reconstructive<br>
surgery. I also have to wonder who will give special
consideration to<br>
the other Dougs out there.<br>
<br>
Perhaps I am wasting my time, and those of you to whom I now
write will<br>
say with the service providers who, never having met my son or
clinically<br>
evaluated him or visited the facility I have found for his
medical<br>
treatments, feel that the doctors who have evaluated and treated
my son<br>
are wrong and that my son does not need this level of care.
Forgive me if<br>
I sound tired and angry and frustrated. I am all those things,
but I am<br>
also a mother who will move mountains if I have to for my child
and the<br>
minority of other children like him who cannot speak for
themselves.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>
<br>
Sincerely,<br>
<br>
Carol Wilson<br>

<p>Subject: My son is schizophrenic</p>

<p>Dear Carol,<br>
Thank you for sharing the heartwrenching story of your son with
me. I have <br>
always thought that each of us suffers some type of mental
illness to one <br>
degree or another, in one form or another and for one period or
another in <br>
their life. For who is to determine what &quot;normal behavoir or
normal thoughts&quot; <br>
are?<br>
<br>
You mentioned your son punched two holes in the wall recently. So
did the <br>
father of my best friend when we were kids growing up. Yet he was
not <br>
considered mentally ill. I don't mean to trivialize your son's
situation. I <br>
only point out that each of us wrestles with anger, irrational
fear, confused <br>
thinking and a whole host of seemingly &quot;ucontrollable&quot;
thoughts of varying <br>
degrees every day. <br>
<br>
I believe that mental illness can be --though not most of the
time-- a <br>
physical imparment. But what causes it? Are some born with it?
Obviously, <br>
yes. And what of schizophrenia: are you born with it or is a
learned response <br>
to fear? Studies have shown that fear releases certain chemicals
in your <br>
brain. Is it possible that over time, these chemicals can alter
your <br>
nuerologic system? (please forgive any typos as I don't have
spell check). <br>
And if so, why are some people more predisposed to irrational
fear than <br>
others?<br>
<br>
In your letter you did not mention anything about your faith or
where God is <br>
in all of this. Because you wrote to me, I assume that you are a
believer in <br>
Christ or at least a believer but perhaps one who believes only
and trusts <br>
little.<br>
More importantly perhaps, you did not mention what your son's
faith is.<br>
<br>
Whether your son's condition is caused by a reaction to accute
irrational fear <br>
or by a physical imparment/handicap, God can help. God empowers
all kinds of <br>
people with severe physical and mental imparements to live
productive lives, <br>
or to at least, live in His peace. Certainly your son is aware of
his <br>
condition. Inbetween moments of acute behavior, what he THINKS
about his <br>
condition is almost certain to worsen it. I'm sure it has already
consumed <br>
his thought life. So much so, that he has developed all kinds of
&quot;misbeliefs&quot; <br>
about himself, such as:<br>
&quot;I'm partially mentally retarded and I cannot change&quot;,
or<br>
&quot;I'm schizophrenic and I cannot change&quot;, or<br>
&quot;I have an imbalance of hormones and I cannot change&quot;,
or<br>
&quot;I'm damaged goods and I can never adopt to it or be at
peace&quot; or<br>
&quot;God has forsaken me.&quot;<br>
<br>
Whatever physically mental imparements your son has, they are
probably <br>
magnified by the misbeliefs he has told himself about his
condition. May I <br>
suggest you and your son read the book &quot;Telling Yourself The
Truth&quot;. Just <br>
understanding this would be a great relief to him. You can order
it through <br>
our website CHRISTIANdigest.com or through any Christian
bookstore.<br>
<br>
Can your son be trained to control his thoughts and behavior
without the help <br>
of drugs? I believe he can. If Helen Keller who could not speak,
could not <br>
see and could not hear- and was emotionally &quot;out of
control&quot; with her thoughts <br>
and behavior, could learn to live at peace and live a productive
life, there <br>
is hope. Imagine being born into this world deaf, dumb and blind.
Let your <br>
mind imagine it for a moment. How miserable and hopeless it would
be to try <br>
to control your thoughts under such conditions. Now think of the
advantage <br>
your son has in that he can see, can hear and can speak. And
although his <br>
thinking is impaired, he can read and reason.<br>
<br>
Does your son know Jesus Christ? Does he have a relationship with
Him? Has <br>
your son relinqued total control of his life and thoughts to
Christ? Has he <br>
asked Christ to live in him?<br>
Does your son know that:<br>
&quot;I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me&quot;<br>
&quot;God has a plan for his life that is good and not evil&quot;<br>
<br>
I beleive that you can teach your son that although he has a
physical <br>
imparement that can cause confusion in his thinking (and hence
emotions and <br>
behavior), that he can learn to recognize the wrong thinking and
give those <br>
thoughts over to the Lord. And by all means, he can be taught not
to live a <br>
life waiting in apprehension of the next wave of confusion, but
to be <br>
proactive in his thinking. To make a conscious, willful effort to
fill his <br>
mind with the facts that God loves him. That God cares for him.
That Christ <br>
lives within him. That the Holy Spirit who Jesus calls the Spirit
of Truth, <br>
is ALWAYS with him, ready and able to help him with his thought
life. These <br>
are the facts. This is truth. Do you believe it? Does your son
believe It?<br>
<br>
He'll need lots of love and encouragement from you and especially
from his <br>
father his entire life. But I believe he can learn to live with
joy and at <br>
peace. With God, all things are possible. He may never run his
own company, <br>
but God does have a plan for him. Maybe it is working with
animals, maybe it <br>
is in counselling others with similiar challanges.<br>
<br>
If you haven't already done so, may I suggest that:<br>
1. You and your son and his dad if he will, get down on your
knees and commit <br>
the rest of your lives to Christ, each and every day.<br>
2. Believe and trust in the Lord to work out His plan in your
son's life.<br>
3. Seek Christian psychiatric counseling from the Minearth Meyer
clinic who by <br>
the way, deals with schizophrenia at 800 639-5433 or 972 907-1972<br>
4. Start educating your son on all the things he can do to keep
his thought <br>
life proactive on peaceful, truthful thoughts by reading the
Bible every day <br>
as well as other Christian counseling and living books.<br>
<br>
I will be praying for your son and your family.<br>
<br>
God Bless,<br>
<br>

<p>Subject: fear</p>

<p>My wife and I have been married for 20 years. In all that time
we have struggled with communication. She has over the last 4-6
years totally moved away from me emotionally. She won't talk...
this problem goes back to the beginning of our relationship and
before.. can anyone out there point me to anything on the
internet about the fear of confrontations? I believe my wife is
trapped in fear that she can't deal with and I don't know how to
help her. </p>

<P>Does anyone have a comment on my dad getting remarried and having our family picture taken.  All my brothers and I are getting together for the first time in about ten years, and I would like a family picture of them and the nieces but Dad remarried last week.  Should we include Dad--I think so but I don't want any hard feelings,  either from Dad or Mom or or my brothers.  No one wants to feel excluded but then
I don't want anyone to be uncomfortable.  I would like a picture with all members in it so that we have a nice time line; but not if we all have long faces.

<P>Comments, please.

<P>I guess that depends on the relationship between your father and
mother. 
 For the sake of their children, I hope they will be able to get together
in a 
civil manner (maybe if they pray for peace  that will help).  Are you
planning 
on including your dads new wife?  I would suggest simply talking to your 
parents and getting their feelings.  Go from there.

<p>Subject: Reconcilliation in Separation <br>
</p>

<p>Prior to my separation from my wife of 28 years some 19 months<br>
ago I had the constant feeling that I was drowning. My health <br>
was deteriorating and I was needing to take more and more <br>
tranquilizers and antidepressants to get through each day. I <br>
was retired from work due to ill health and suffer from <br>
diabetes and a number of different illnesses, however I was <br>
unable to accept my place in the family. I was no longer the <br>
head, or the second in charge, but I came just below the <br>
children. I felt un-loved, my needs were not being met and I <br>
felt desperatly unhappy and a burden to the world.</p>

<p>My ex-wife was loyal to me, as a nurse she understood the <br>
various physical needs that I had, if I was in serious<br>
trouble she would give me assistance as a patient, however I <br>
had no position in our family anymore. She was very involved <br>
in a job which she took very seriously, she was given a car <br>
by her employer, often she needed to travel long distances and<br>
stay away from home over night. Her life was totally full and<br>
there really wasn't any room in it for me.</p>

<p>We attended counselling a number of times before I left,<br>
however I didn't believe that my lot would change while I <br>
lived with her. My ex-wife told me that I would go insane, commit
suicide, be <br>
unable to do voluntry work at our local church and ruin the<br>
lives of our children if left her.</p>

<p>Since leaving my health has improved, I am now working and my<br>
life seems to be coming back together. My relationship with <br>
my kids is improving and I am friends with another lady.<br>
God is still real to me and I believe that he is continuing to <br>
work out his purpose through me.</p>

<p>Peter.</p>

from the separation my husband had asked for and seeking consolation, had 
begun to see another man.  So I was pregnant and did not know who was the 
father.  I told my ex and he was happy, convinced that we'd make a go of it 
somehow.  Next thing I knew he changed his mind and wanted a divorce.  I went 
ahead with the pregnancy and had a beautiful baby boy.  I am re-married and my 
husbands name is on the birth certificate because we didn't want our son to 
have any bad feelings about who he belonged to.  It felt like the right thing 
to do at the time.  I married a man who was and still is my best friend in the 
whole world.  My question is when my son grows up, should I tell him that my 
husband is not his biological father and that I don't know who that is?  My 
husband doesn't want to because he doesn't want to hurt the child.

<P>I am adopted myself.  Since I was 4 years old.  Now 42.  My
suggestion would be, don't tell him.  No need to.  Let him
enjoy the security of a family that has a real live mom and
dad.  You enjoy it, let him enjoy it.  Be prepared however for
the day that it might come out.  If it does, be totally honest
and let God do the rest.  I grew up knowing I was adopted. I
used it against my adopted parents when I got angry with them.
Not a good move at all.  God Bless and enjoy that child.  We 
all do.

<p>Subject: Divorced and pregnant </p>

<p>When Jesus said, &quot;the truth shall set you free&quot; He
wasn't kidding. All of us deserve to know the truth about who we
are and where we come from. I grew up in a home where everything
was told except the truth. My mother died of chronic depression,
my oldest sister committed suicide (after the truth came out
about her daughter conceived in another marriage and adopted),
and my stepsister is an alcoholic. As for me, I hurt, but I face
the truth and speak the truth in love. Truth will not diminish
the pain, love added to the truth helps us walk through it and
grow. </p>

<P>A friend of mine was going through a lot of personal and relationship problems 
with her husband (which I was friends with both).  She is a Christian and a mother
of two.  He is not a Christian. The relationship started very 
young (because of a pregnancy) and has been very rocky (a lot of abuse (physcial 
and mental).  In December she became very depressed and after understanding what 
she was going through I helped her move out of her situation. In a way, I was 
helping a friend (the wife), and betraying another (the husband).  The
relationship seemed ended a long time before the seperation and I started a 
relationship with her.  I became very involved with her and her two kids while
she was going through her divorce.  Our relationship became very serious and we
started living with each other and made financial commitments together.  With her
divorce almost finalized, we break up.  Our relationship slowly became more and
more arguing and talk of change, but never a lot happening.  I decided to break
up after she took a weekend to herself and the kids and just stayed away from
home. She knew we had our first counseling appointment on Saturday which we
had been waiting for a long time. It hurt me that she didn't care and didn't want
to go. I really didn't want her to go, but I let anger take control over my
mind and I regret this strongly.  After talking about our relationship, she
told me she felt she never really tried in her marriage (where she tried more
than her spouse) and was going to try to see if he would take her back (He
became involved in another relationship himself that he is living with the girl).
Her big reason for trying again is because he is the father of her children.
She doesn't want to try in our relationship again because she says we started
wrong and the guilt she has from leaving her husband and than getting involved
with me before she was even divorced has kept us from being happy.  <br>
I accept she needs to try to get back together or make sure she has done
everything she could to keep the marriage together, but she doesn't want to give
us a try again.  Just a week before, we were talking about getting engaged after
her divorced and it bothers me she feels this way.  She says if things do not work
out with her marriage (that is still pending final hearing), she will move to her
Sister's in another state.<br>
I really want her to give us another try if things don't work out with her 
marriage.  If a relationship on that level is not possible at the time for us,
I don't want to lose our "best-friend" relationship.  She says I will always be in 
her heart and we'll always be friends, but we both agree if things work out in
her marriage, that wouldn't be possible.  Not sure if their is anything I could do.
<p>
We had something beautiful, but she feels it was wrong in God's eyes and she 
should try getting back with the father of her children who was very abusive
towards her.  I really need to know what other people think about our relationship
and if she is right in her feelings.

<P>Jay,<BR>

The most loving and friendly thing a person could possibly
tell you is that you and she were in adultery and headed
for the lake of fire, according to God (Rev. 21:8). 
<BR>
<BR>

She does not have Scriptural grounds for divorce, according 
to the Lord Jesus (Matt. 5:32 and 19:9) and the Apostle
Paul (1 Cor. 7:10-15). 
<BR>
<BR>

You both need to repent and get saved. Ask God to have mercy
on you for your sexual immorality, and put this woman out of
your mind. She is right that it is not right in God's eyes
for you to live together or to be "married." If she 
divorces her husband, she must remain unmarried, as Paul
stated to the Corinthians.
<BR>
<BR>

If you are eligible for marriage, then you need to look for
someone else who is also eligible, and wait until AFTER you
are legitimately married IN GOD'S EYES before you have sex.
You do not want to be committing continuous adultery 
as Jesus spoke about.
<BR>
<BR>

This life is a test (Jam. 1:12; Rev. 2:10,11; 3:10). The
stakes are eternal. Only the minority will pass the test and
enter through the narrow gate that leads to life (Matt. 7:
13,14). The vast majority will be thrown into the lake of
fire (Rev. 20:15; 21:8). Don't get yourself snared by an
illegitimate marriage that may bring much temporal pleasure
and comfort now, but reap eternal torment in fire and
incredible regret over such later.
<BR>
<BR>

It is not always God's will to remarry as 1 Cor. 7:11 clearly
states.

<p>Subject: Divorce/Friendship <br>
</p>

<p>Dear Jay:</p>

<p>Anytime you are dealing with a person suffering through the
disintegration of a marriage, you're going to be dealing with a
roller coaster ride of emotions and doubts and pain. Since she
wants to try to reconcile with her husband, it is your duty as a
true friend to do all you can to help her in that endeavor, as
that would be the best possible outcome for her and her family
(barring the possibility of abuse). Divorce is a messy business,
and almost never in the best interests of anyone except perhaps
the Divorce Lawyers. It is very scary for a woman, especially
with young children, to face the possibility of life alone. You
were a convenient way-station for her...someone she chose to lean
on. It feels good to have someone need you, but sooner or later,
she has to make a decision. It is best that you not try too hard
to influence her against her husband, as you are now quite
prejudiced in your opinion, wanting her yourself. Back off, and
let her try to work things out...In marriage, a husband and wife
become &quot;One Flesh&quot;... If a marriage breaks up, it is
literlly tearing apart of that One Flesh...It is truly that
awful. We know. And even after healing, the scars from that
tearing will never completely go away. <br>
God Bless you and have a Joyful Christmas<br>
J&amp;D<br>
<br>

<P>After 22 years of marriage my husband announced he was filing for 
divorce.  He says he doesn't want to deal with my depression and "mood swings" 
any longer.  We are both Christians and I thought he meant what he said on our 
wedding day about "in sickness & in health, for better or worse".  He says 
that if divorce is not what God wants for us that God will let him know.  I am 
looking for any Scripture references that I can share with him that shows that 
God intends for us to work on resolving our problems and not divorcing.  Thank 
you in advance.

<p>Subject: Saving Marriage</p>

<p>There are several Scriptures in the Bible regarding divorce
and the fact <br>
that God is definately against it. However, I would like to focus
on the mood <br>
swing and depression problems you are having because I can speak
from <br>
experience. <br>
<br>
Have you sought any medical treatment, whether it be from your
family doctor <br>
or a psychiatrist? There is help available for those of us who
suffer from <br>
these problems. I should know because I have received help. God
tells us in <br>
his Word that He will help those who help themselves. You must do
your part <br>
to get better and don't expect God to take care of the problems
by Himself, He <br>
will guide you to the answers. <br>
<br>
For those who have never suffered from depression have a hard
time knowing <br>
what it is like. Try to explain how you feel to your husband.
Maybe even get <br>
some books on the subject. It's not easy and it will take some
time, but I <br>
would hate to see 22years of marriage go down the drain. I wish
you luck and <br>
may God be with you. If you have any questions, please feel free
to email me <br>
(Rick) or my wife Susan.</p>

<p>Subject: Divorce </p>

<p>I have been married for over 26 years. My wife and I are just
at the pre-separation stage. I do not look at her as a piece of
plastic. She was chosen by God for me, and truly represents the
finest that He could ever offer. I guess that we are having difficulty
appreciating each other's own Love Language, even though I have
begged her to forgive my past mistakes (many, including verbal abuse..)
and stand beside me and go forward. She is a Christian, but seems
unable to forgive despite our efforts at counseling since late
1991, and my efforts to learn of the need to control anger, that anger
is not a sin- just decide what, when, and how much is appropriate-
to do with it. I discovered this internet site today and read the
offering of &quot;The Five Languages of Love&quot;. I just ordered
2 books and hope that serving each other's needs in this way will
work for us and our family. Please pray for us for victory in
Christ! I truly love my wife, un-conditionaly, and want this union
to finally bloom in its Glorious radiance. I hope that you will
be able to reconcile your problem(s) as well, and will offer prayer
as well. </p>

<p>God Bless!! </p>

<p>Subject: Divorce, How to stop it </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>John 10:12-15 speaks of the difference between a good shepherd
and a hireling. The hireling &quot;leaveth the sheep and
fleeth&quot; when he &quot;seeth the wolf coming.&quot; Many people
today marry as hirelings. When the wolf comes, they flee. This
curses the earth (spoken of in Malachi) and turns parents' hearts
away from their children and from each other. A Christ-like
marriage involves God. It is not a business arrangement that can
be dissolved when troubles come. In a business arrangement the
parties marry to obtain benefits and will stay only as long as
they're receiving what they bargained for. Christ-like love is
unconditional. It involves a Good Shepherd-type person who will
lay down their life for their spouse. I write this from an
article I recently read. And I write as one who thought about
leaving my husband at one time. Deep in my heart I knew I had not
really ever loved him with an unconditional love. I needed to
sacrifice more time and energy for my husband. </p>

<P>Subject: Marriage
<P>
My wife of 18 years  has "suddenly" stated she no longer loves me and has moved in with another man.  Our marriage has been stormy but loving. In fact until now my love of her has been unshakeable.  The past 2 years have been extreamly difficult. Our teenage son had started to experiment with drugs and had run away. In addition we had to move because of the clousure of the plant were I worked.  Things looked like they were comming together.  Our son was going to return home, seek counseling, and return to school.  <BR>
<BR>

Then my wife went to a high school reunion.  In the space of a weekend her affections were directed to a man who does drugs and has few aspirations and no "worries".  I must add that my wife suffers from depression and has been drinking heavily the last several months.  She has deserted me and her 3 children.  I think it is due to her inability to cope with the chalanges of our son and the conflicts which will arise.  Her previous method of dealing with the children was to let them do whatever they wanted.  The children and I are in therapy now. I love my wife but she is out of control. She has run away from all responsibilty.  I want her to get help and return to her family who loves her. What do we do???<BR>

I pray every day for her and do not know what else to do.
<BR>
<BR>

Thank you.

<P>Subject: Children Now Membership Information

<P>Hello,<BR>

 My name is Daniel McGrew. I am having a very serious family problem at this 
time. It involves children, our children, my children. If you can provide any 
help, please let me know. If you cannot provide help, like everyone else, 
please at least send advice or an opinion.<BR>
 Four and a half years ago, DSS (Child Protective Services) in Texas 
discovered something. They discovered that my niece was systematically beating 
her own children with clothes hangers. They found this out because, she sent 
two of her children to the hospitol, she grabbed them by the feet and swung 
them head first into a wall. This very nearly killed them. Thier heads swelled 
up like watermelons, I saw them myself, after she did this to them. DSS 
stepped in and took them away. Finding that the biological mother could not be 
rehabilitated, they searched for someone in the family to adopt the children. 
They found my wife and I we able and willing to adopt them all. There were 
five children at the time. They decided to allow the mother to pick who the 
children went to. The mother was in jail at the time, for this abuse. She 
picked a woman on probation, convicted for her second felony, to take three of 
the children. (DSS had already begun a home-study on my wife and I, and 
stopped it halfway through). She sent two of the other children to woman 
convicted of abandonment of her own six children. Not nice. Last week this 
woman was thrown in jail again for abandonment. The woman who had the three 
children, her health was failing, so she gave them over to me and my wife. 
They are of course brothers and sisters, my great-nieces and nephew. Now DSS 
has taken the two children from the woman convicted of abandonment and put 
them into foster care. I sent my wife to Texas to pick them up. DSS would not 
let her have them, even though we have thier three sisters. They would not 
even let thier three sisters visit them. Stupid. The reason DSS gives for 
this, is they want to rehabilitate the woman convicted of abandonment. So DSS 
wants to keep the brother and sister in foster care until she is 
rehabilitated, for 90 days. In my opinion DSS has no interest in keeping 
families together, they are intentionall keeping this one apart. They are also 
violating a United Nations Convention on children's rights. It says that 
public (government) agencies should strive to keep a family together. I have 
offered them this, and tried to achieve it for this family for over four and 
half years. But, DSS fights me everytime and I can't understand why. They 
wanted someone to adopt the children, my wife and I said that we would be glad 
to. Then they changed thier minds again. What is wrong with Child Protective 
Services in America. They are ruining children left and right, by the 
thousands. They offer children no future security at all. These children have 
been move from person to person, home to home four times over four and half 
years. <BR>

        Now, I cannot imagine why. You think that it might be me. I don't know, you 
tell me. I am a nurse, am in the United States Air Force Reserves, my wife is 
a housewife, she takes real good care of the children that we have, they are 
on the A and B honor roll, we take them to Vacation Bible School, we take the 
to Church, we gave them swimming lessons at the YMCA. What is wrong with Child 
Protective Services in Texas, I think that it may have just a little bit too 
much power and not enough sense to use it wisely, to actually help children. 
Because from what I've seen, it hasn't done anything but make six children 
extremely miserable. There are six now, the last one is not a year old yet, 
and if child protective services has it's way, this is one little girl who may 
never see her brother and sister. Child Protective Services is simply being 
mean and evil. Why would they violate a United Nations Convention on 
Children's Rights. Why can't they make these children happy, they have had 
four years to make these children happy, and they can't do it. Give me and my 
wife a chance, I know that we can. The Lord is with us, I know that we can. <BR>

                        Sincerely,<BR>

                                Daniel L. McGrew

Steak knife is because, when I was a little boy I cut my fingers in half with 
a steak knife, while helping my dad clean a table. My fingers are fine now. 
That was over fifteen years ago.

<p>Subject: children and
divorce</font></p>

<p>For my children, the
divorce, was tough to go thorugh but as they have grown they
comment on many things positively.</font></p>

<p>1) They see me as much
happier</font></p>

<p>2) They see a different
family life, when they thought there was only one way and they
see my life now as better</font></p>

<p>3) Both their Dad and i have
always told them they were always loved and it wasn't their
fault- this has made them releived and guilt free</font></p>

<p>4) Both parents have always
acted civily towards each other so they are not afraid of
conflict in public ie at school functions- this was a big concernof
theirs</font></p>

<p>5) My children say other
things in their life have been tougher than their parents divorce
ie ajusting to their new step-mother</font></p>

<p>Subject: Family</p>

<p>As Christians, our family extends beyond blood. As a woman,
married, divorced, and remarried, having been raised in a blended
family, and also trying to put one together; acceptance is the
issue. God accepts us as we are. We are to be brothers and
sisters in Him. However, one good choice to make is have just
brothers and sisters in one, and dad with you all in another. I
am sure you are on the right track. 1 John 4:7-8 Merry Christmas </p>

<p>Subject: Not in Love with my wife</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">I fear that I have committed a
huge sin against my wife and myself.<br>
I fooled myself into thinking that I loved my wife (of 16 months)
and<br>
now I ahave &quot;come clean&quot; with her. She is upset and
about to leave me<br>
for good. The thing is, I *know* I care deeply about her, and
want to live<br>
my life with her. But the litmus test for love is I Corinthians
13, and<br>
those sentiments do not describe how I feel about her.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If we do divorce, this will be
tragic for both of us, but moreso for her since<br>
her love for me is true. She is very depressed about his right
now, and that<br>
is understandable. I don't want her to feel this pain. I have
been praying that<br>
God can change my heart so I can really love her the way she
deserves.<br>
I know I should have considered all of this before we got
married, but that is<br>
water under the bridge now. God does not condone divorce except
for <br>
infedelity, so I just pray that we can salvage this. It will,
however,<br>
take a change inside me.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">If there's any advice someone can
give (as well as prayers) I would<br>
greatly appreciate it.<br>

<p>Subject: love is a decision, and God can help </p>

<p>You say you don't love your wife well enough, Who are you to
say that? God can love her through you just ask Him to, then
you'll be giving her the very very best. Just decide, (which I
think you did when you married her) that you want to love her,
and let God work through you. Of course this will also strengthen
your own walk with God, as you learn to lean on Him for strength
and guidance in your EVERYDAY life. </p>

<p>Subject: not in love with wife </p>

<p>Kevin.....GOOD NEWS!!! Open your Bible and check out 1Cor.13
again. Put in Jesus' name everywhere it says &quot;love&quot;.
You would have to be perfect in order to love your wife according to
all these beautiful examples. This is a love we grow into (as are
all Godly attributes) as we grow in our relationship with the
Lord. Our journey in growing spiritually is not much different
than our physical process. At first we are totally dependant on
our parents, then rolling, crawling, feeding ourselves..... You
get the picture....growing up and learning from our human parents...their
habits, mannerisms...etc. </p>

<p>In these ways we also grow into the likeness of our Heavenly
Father. At times, admittedly, a painfully slow process ... But,
consider the promises of God....He promises to not stop until we
are complete. Cool huh? </p>

<p>Love is a gift from our Lord and the basis of all He has done
for each of us...Your words &quot;I fooled myself into thinking
that I loved my wife&quot; suggests you have much more power than
the Lord you serve. Yet, your statement &quot;I *know* I care
deeply about her&quot; tells me YOU DO LOVE HER. Love is not a
feeling....it is a commitment, a choice to not give up
caring...no matter what...Just as our Lord does for us...(&quot;I
will NEVER leave you nor forsake you....)&quot;Feelings&quot; are
like a summer storm....here and gone....never knowing when the
next clump of clouds will appear and the thunder and lightning
will return......but we know....there will always be another
summer and with it another clump of storm clouds....(at least until
Jesus returns and makes all things new!!!) Yet...can we prove to
anyone that there even was a storm last summer?? One warm day and
a hot wind and the evidence disappears. </p>

<p>Please keep in mind also...The Bible teaches us that we have a
REAL ENEMY...the devil(satan), whose job discription is: to
steal,kill and destroy....any way he can, I might add. He is also
a master of deceit...If you allow him to destroy your marriage...how
is knowing Jesus making any of us any different than the world??? could
it be that the enemy is attacking your marriage because you have the
potential of witnessing through your union? you need to consider
the depth of attack on the family in our culture today in America
as well as all over the world. Adam and Eve were the first
family...and began getting attacked by satan even way back
then...... I know the anguish your wife is experiencing at
hearing that you are not &quot;in love&quot; with her...I also
lived through this experience. It put me in a position to find
out what love is and what love is not. (Remember...the only
reliable source of TRUTH is: THE WORD OF GOD. Definition of Love:
GOD IS LOVE. </p>

<p>My husband and I have a deeper, more loving relationship now
than we did before our crisis...neither of us would have believed
such &quot;oneness&quot; possible...yet we believed our Lord who raises
the dead, makes the blind to see, heals the leper etc.,etc.,etc......could
do the IMPOSSIBLE in our marriage. He did...and we are no different
than you or your wife.(just older probably) He is SO TRUSTWORTHY. Please
do not depend on your feelings. They lie. (and don't forget who
the &quot;father of lies&quot; is....) Jeremiah 29:11 </p>

<p>Subject: Divorce and Faith </p>

<p>What should a person do when his spouse has moved out pushed
and finalize a divorce and began seeing someone within
immediately moving out. Should we continue in Faith that god will
help staright out this marriage based on our vows and commit to
him for better or worse. Or should we try to pick up the pieces
and rebuild our life with what is life? How can someone just trow
away 12 years and begin starting over with someone new? </p>

<p>Subject: divorce and faith </p>

<p>I would encourage you to ask the Lord to show you
&quot;TRUTH&quot; concerning your &quot;war&quot;. You marriage
has been attacked by our unseen enemy using the things of this world
(remember: the garden of eden story? the enemy deceived the woman by getting
her to question what God meant, then he told her God was lying,
then rewrote Gods' meaning and she believed it!!) Our enemy still uses
the same old line/lies. Getting us to question or rationalize
what we know is the Truth according to God's Word........Our
enemy is still in the business of destroying marriages and families.... The
real question is: Why don't we learn how to stand on God's Truth????
(&quot;we are more than conquerors&quot;)(Greater is He that is
in us, than he that is in the world....) </p>

<p>Please be aware of the unseen war that we, as Christians, are
involved in. It is the enemies job in this war to steal, kill and
destroy our faith, witness, our relationships.... anything that
has the potential to honor to our King. (trying to get us to look
just like the world, so no one will believe Jesus makes us
different) </p>

<p>Our enemy is also described as &quot;the father of
lies&quot;.....and does his job too well. When our marriages are
attacked, we seem only able to see with our eyes, ears, and feelings......
We must learn to ask our King to show us the TRUTH, behind what
we see, hear and feel in our flesh. Please remember: as BELIEVERS
IN OUR LORD AND HIS WORD..... &quot;we are not fighting against
people made of flesh and blood, but against persons without
bodies--the evil rulers of the unseen world, those mighty satanic
beings and great evil princes of darkness who rule this world; and
against huge numbers of wicked spirits in the spirit world.&quot;
Ephesians 6:12 (Living Bible) </p>

<p>Please do not look at the &quot;wind and the waves&quot; the
things that are happening around you....With the help of a few
committed soldiers in the army of God you can learn through this
war to keep your eyes on Jesus and walk on water.... Learn to
stand on the promises of God and His word...Learn the real Truth
about the kind of Love God has for all of us. (and we should have
for others when we allow Jesus to live His life through us) I
Corinthians 13:4-8 (Living Bible) Love is very patient and kind, never
jealous or envious, never boastful or proud, Never haughty or
selfish or rude. Love does not demand its own way. It is not
irritable or touchy. It does not hold grudges and will hardly
even notice when others do it wrong. It is never glad about injustice,
but rejoices whenever TRUTH wins out. If you love someone you
will be loyal to him no matter what the cost. You will always
believe in him, always expect the best of him, and always stand
your ground in defending him. ....Love goes on forever....(Never
gives up) </p>

<p>Be aware...No one can win a war alone. No matter how the
modern movies portray the heroe....Our war in the spiritual realm
is real and we need to learn how to stand back to back as Christian
brothers and sisters...defending each other, protecting each
other, repairing each other (when needed), and at times carrying each other....all
while the war rages around us....keeping our eyes on Jesus (and HIS WORD). </p>

<p>In closing, I will encourage you....NEVER GIVE UP. My marriage
also became a war zone....Because of my love and commitment to
our King,I was not willing to allow the enemy a victory. Our Lord
Jesus is still in the business of raising the dead.(Even
marriages that the enemy has seemed to have killed.) It has been
5 years since our reconciliation and we both continue to praise
the Lord for teaching us the TRUTH about REAL LOVE through the
death and resurrection of our marriage. </p>

<p>Subject: Divorce Depression</p>

<p>We know what pain you are going through, having both gone
through the break up of our first Marriages. Healing is very
slow, and you often receive little support from the church or
other Christians...they just don't know how to handle the thorny
issue of divorce. We are currently working with a young operation
known as DivorceCare. perhaps there may be a group meeting
somewhere near you. If not, perhaps as you heal, you may be able
to help others suffering your grief. It is not easy recovering
from the trauma of the tearing apart of the &quot;One Flesh&quot;
of a marriage. Our prayers are with you.<br>

<p>Subject: Divorce for the believer</p>

<p>I am looking for guidance in establishing a Christian support
ministry <br>
for believers who find themselves divorced or facing divorce. It
is an <br>
extremely heavy burden to place on a believer that he/she is
condemned as an <br>
adulterer if they wish to remarry after divorce. The fact of the
matter is, we <br>
are all sinners, and to say or think that it is any other way, we
deceive <br>
ourselves, and the truth is not in us! Is any man or woman more
or less sinful <br>
than another? Does God keep score? Is a divorced person who
remarries the only <br>
one faced with being in a state of sin? Did not our Lord say that
merely <br>
looking upon a woman to lust after her is adultery? Who can
escape? No one <br>
except by the grace of God in Jesus Christ. Thanks be to God. </p>

<p>Subject: <a href="qaMsg46.htm">Divorce for the believer</a> /
Posted by <a href="mailto:Nolan@albany.net">Nolan@albany.net</a>
(Diane Nolan)</p>

<p>My husband and I have a very solid, happy, christian marriage.
Every day we thank the Lord together for the miracle he worked in
allowing us to find one another. We are at peace with one another
and active in our church. </p>

<p>We have both been married and divorced before. Both were very
early marriages, both ended over 10 years ago, and both
ex-spouses have remarried happily and now have children. Both
divorces were mutually agreed upon by both parties at the time. I
should add that my husband and I met a couple of years ago...we
are from different states originally and were not acquainted at
the time of our divorces. </p>

<p>Anyway, we are doing the best we can. I do not believe in my
heart that Jesus actually intended for me (I am 31) or for that
matter, my husband, to live out the rest of our days alone. </p>

<p>I think that being a christian family is God's will for us. </p>

<p>I simply think that the dogmatic, legalistic viewpoint held by
a certain group who has posted a message on this forum
exemplifies a judgemental, and negative, hate-filled viewpoint. </p>

<p>What would that writer have us do...divorce each other now?
Break up the families of our ex-spouses and remarry people who
are virtual strangers now? </p>

<p>Excuse my impassioned response, but I believe in the God of
salvation from sin, redemption, forgiveness, mercy, grace... need
I go on? The Jesus who forgave the woman at the well of her
previous 4 marriages...the God of second chances... and of love,
a &quot;friend that sticketh closer than a brother&quot; and who
expects us to make the most of the life he has given us, even if
that means messing up as a teenager and starting over again. </p>

<p>Thank you. </p>

<p>Subject: responsibility of a spouse being abused<br>
</p>

<p>My marriage was full of arguing and fighting. I was thrown up
against <br>
the wall once, thrown off the bed once, locked in a bathroom and
forgotten, <br>
almost injured with a moving car, forced phusically to pick up
something, and <br>
the grand finale was when I was thrown over his head out into the
yard. I <br>
took a few years to decide to go through with a divorce. I had no
<br>
documentation I was abused. He lied in court about everything.
This man was <br>
supposed to be my loving husband. I divorced him and during the
divorce I met <br>
someone with whom I found the traits I have always wanted in a
husband. I <br>
struggled with the issue of divorce for 15 years, and after we
did counseling <br>
for a few years, and he still kept telling me I was
&quot;crazy&quot;, I should leave, I <br>
hated him and the kids, etc...I decided to go through with a
divorce. <br>
I remarried and have never been more happy in my life. I want to
please God. <br>
I don't think he wants people to be abused and stay in that
situation. I <br>
remarried and hope that God will allow me to finish my life with
some degree <br>
of happiness.<br>

<p>Subject: Marriage<br>
</p>

<p>To start with I have done some research in my Bible and also
prayed<br>
about it. And the answer I came up with is, I need to listen<br>
to a wiser person than I. I have started a relationship with a<br>
young lady. She is divorced and I have never been married.<br>
Her husband &quot;discovered&quot; that he was gay and filed the
divorce <br>
papers. According to what I have read, the is the equivalent<br>
of giving her a divorce certificate. This woman is a good
Christian<br>
and is really torn-up by the whole thing. I hope, God willing,<br>
that I may marry this woman someday. I hope that someone will<br>
give an insite that I have overlooked.</p>

<p>Subject: Marriage</p>

<p><br>
Dana - </p>

<p>If indeed, this young lady's husband divorced her because he
got involved in an adulterous relationship (How else would he
have discovered his new sexual preference?) She has grounds,
Biblically speaking, for her divorce. Despite this, she is still
going to suffer great pain and grief over the tearing of her
marriage bonds. Healing is slow, no matter who is at
&quot;fault&quot; Find the counsel of a mature Christian friend
or pastor, as divorce is a rocky road for a believer, and often
other Christians throw more stumbling blocks in the way of your
recovery. </p>

<p>Keep in mind what the Bible says about marriage. It is where
two are made &quot;One Flesh&quot;. If you plan to marry, realize
that the tearing apart of that union will leave its scars. A new
marriage is an attempt to reenter into a relationship of Oneness.
The bond is precious, but as you know, not impervious. The bonds
of your friend's marriage were broken by her unfaithful spouse.
She is not guilty. But she is wounded. Treat her kindly and let
the Spirit guide you as you develop your friendship. Don't rush
into marriage, it will not heal the wounds...If you are meant to
marry, you will know...be patient. And keep praying! Have a
blessed new year. </p>

<p>DAN </p>

<p><strong>Subject: Adultery, Divorce and Remarriage from the
Bible </strong></p>

<p>As a person who has spent thousands of hours reading and
studying the Bible, the following is my input: </p>

<p>(1) To divorce over &quot;incompatibility and neglect&quot; is
not a legitimate reason according to the Word of God! Please note
Matt. 5:32: </p>

<p>&quot;But I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except
for marital unfaithfulness, causes her to commit adultery, and
anyone who marries a woman so divorced commits adultery.&quot; </p>

<p>Similarly, Matt. 19:9 says: </p>

<p>&quot;I tell you that anyone who divorces his wife, except for
marital unfaithfulness, and marries another woman commits
adultery.&quot; </p>

<p>These statements about divorce and remarriage were given by
the Lord Jesus. Clearly, He stated marital unfaithfulness (sexual
immorality) is the only cause for a divorce! Hence, if one
divorces his spouse for any other reason besides sexual
immorality, regardless what that reason is, he is indicted by
these verses! If such a person would then &quot;marry&quot;
another, not only would he be committing adultery, but the person
he &quot;marries&quot; would likewise be committing adultery!
When we consider passages like 1 Cor. 6:9,10 and Rev. 21:8, we
can only conclude such will result in that person being thrown
into the lake of fire, that is, unless that adultery ceases and
they find forgiveness. </p>

<p>The Apostle Paul gave these instructions about remarriage: </p>

<p>&quot;To the married I give this command (not I, but the
Lord): A wife must not separate from her husband. But if she
does, SHE MUST REMAIN UNMARRIED OR ELSE BE RECONCILED TO HER
HUSBAND. And a husband must not divorce his wife. To the rest I
say this (I, not the Lord): If any brother has a wife who is not
a believer and she is willing to live with him, he must not
divorce her. And if a woman has a husband who is not a believer
and he is willing to live with her, she must not divorce him ...
But if the unbeliever leaves, let him do so. A believing man or
woman is not bound in such circumstances; God has called us to
live in peace&quot; (1 Cor. 7:10-15). </p>

<p>Paul stated the only other reason to divorce would be if one
spouse got saved and the other left because of it. Then the saved
spouse would be free to remarry. </p>

<p>(2) You may mention getting forgiven for &quot;divorcing our
spouses.&quot; Please know that there is no such thing in
Scripture as getting forgiven from the sin of divorce! This
subtle twisting of the Word regarding getting forgiven over the
sin of divorce has led some to go through with it, then remarry
another who really is not eligible for one reason or another. </p>

<p>(3) When Jesus spoke of committing adultery over an
illegitimate marriage as cited in Matt. 5:32; 19:9, a
CONTINUOUS-TENSE ADULTERY is what would result. This would be
impossible if one would illegitimately marry a person, then
&quot;repent&quot; of his sin of divorce and his sin of
illegitimate marriage and go on as if it was now a marriage
recognized by God. </p>

<p>(4) You may say you are so much in love and desire to serve
the Lord together as husband and wife. Such is an impossibility.
Neither of you two can ever be recognized from God's perspective
as bound together by Him as husband and wife! This statement,
though it may seem hard, is the truth, based on Scripture. The
best way for you two to serve the Lord is to begin to stop
entertaining the thought that you two would like to get married.
This is like two people saying &quot;We want to rob a bank and
then serve the Lord.&quot; </p>

<p>(5) To say you know of other &quot;Christian couples&quot; who
are both divorced and remarried and have good solid marriages and
serve the Lord well is irrelevant! What other people have or
don't have or do or don't do has nothing to do with us
individually. We are to go by the Word of God regardless if
anyone else goes by it or not. It seems like you are trying to
find every possible reason to &quot;marry&quot; outside of the
will of God to justify your action, even to the point of looking
at others who have done a similar thing. </p>

<p>Granted, there are many people who are illegitimately married.
Such are committing continuous adultery from God's perspective
and really are not &quot;Christian&quot; as they may profess to
be. It is impossible to be a Christian and to be sexually immoral
at the same time. There is no such thing as once saved always
saved. So if you think you can both divorce, then marry each
other and be spiritually safe, based upon eternal security, you
are Scripturally mistaken. Eternal security is a rampant heresy
that has multitudes in danger of Hell without such knowing
they're in this type of danger. [Please see our web site for
information exposing and refuting the heresy of eternal security
as well as many other topics of relevance to us all.] </p>

<p>This life is a test (Jam. 1:12; Rev. 2:10,11; 3:10). The
stakes are eternal. Only the minority will pass the test and
enter through the narrow gate that leads to life (Matt. 7:13,14).
The vast majority will be thrown into the lake of fire (Rev.
20:15; 21:8). Don't get yourself snared by an illegitimate
marriage that may bring much temporal pleasure and comfort now,
but reap an eternal torment in fire and great regret over such
later. </p>

<p>It is not always God's will to remarry as 1 Cor. 7:11 clearly
states. </p>

<p>Stay in the Bible and go by ITS counsel. Think beyond the
grave. </p>

<p>Parenting/work at home moms</p>
<p>Do you have a job that you can do from home part time? If so, it is a <br>
wonderful alternative to working full time. I currently work for a company <br>
that promotes the &quot;family&quot; and have been blessed with a job as a marketing <br>
writer. I work two full days at the office and leave my son (8 month old) with <br>
a wonderful sitter. Then on the other three days I work from home, I have <br>
another babysitter who comes to my home and watches him while I work in my <br>
home office. I get to &quot;come out for visits&quot; with him, breastfeed, and tip-toe <br>
into his room to watch him sleep. It's a great way to be able to be with your <br>
children AND have a career at the same time! Of course, if I could afford to <br>
quit full time -- my advice to you is DO IT!! Children need their parents more <br>
than ever these days. Good luck to you. And I'd be very interested in knowing <br>
what you decide.</p>

<P> Parenting/children's sleeping arrangements
<P>My husband's ex-wife has custody of the children (girl 6, boy, 5).  We 
have no problem but one, they still sleep in the same bedroom together at her 
home.  She says this is perfectly fine until they are 10 or 12, we disagree.  
I would like input from other Christian Families.

<p>Subject: sleeping arrangements
</p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">I'de have to agree that for now it is OK, but knowing what I know about child development (BS in Elem Ed, AS in Early Childhood Ed) I'de have to adjust that age down a bit from 10-12.<BR>

I'de say you are quickly approaching the age at which they should be seperated.  Think about whether you would want these children (or whether they would want to) undress in front of even close friends of this age.  Similar standards should be applied to brothers and sisters, because children learn modesty at about the time in thier lives that they need it.  If they are modest enough that they don't want to be seen by the other, then they should have their own space. However, I have to take this a step further, and ask why it is ok to put two girls (or boys) together, and not a boy and a girl, I roomed with a sister and hated having to undress with her in the room.  Each child's individual personality should be taken into account.  I know a family who had a 10 and 13 year old boy and girl (respectively) and they still roomed together and wouldn't have it any other, though the sister was quickly approaching a change.  The point is.. take the children, and their personality and maturity, and relationship with their sibling into account, bottom end 3-5 top end 10-12. Depends on ALOT of different things.

<p><strong>Subject:</strong> <strong>When should parents keep
quiet?</strong></p>

<p>I think parents never stop feeling the love they have always <br>
felt for their kids. Mine are 28 and 26 and the pain I see in
their lives <br>
whether it is past or coming up never ends. They think that their
parents <br>
were never young and had the same feelings they have right now. I
dont know <br>
how to let them see that they reasons we talk to them now is that
we just can't <br>
stand to see the problems they are headed for. </p>

<p>My 28 year old is now living with his girlfriend with plans of
marriage very soon.<br>
They are not right for each other personality wise and who knows
their child better than a parent. <br>
She is trying to alienate him from his family and because he
loves her now he <br>
feels he is in the middle. We are at our wits end and don't know
how to handle <br>
this one. He is at th very peak of his life he has worked for
thru 5 years of <br>
college and 5 years in the military. Do we keep quiet and watch
this fiasco <br>
play its course or where are in the spot of christian parents,
allowed to <br>
express our opinion. I have tried to contact Dr. Dobson and do
not know <br>
how. </p>

<p>thank you.</p>

<P>One of the favorite verses of those who hold to the once saved always saved teaching is John 10:28, "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish; no one can snatch them out of my hand." However, many people neglect to quote verse 27: "My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and THEY FOLLOW ME." The verb "follow" is continuous-tense in the Greek. No one can snatch any who are continually following Jesus. It is an obviously conditional promise.

<P>There is also an obvious condition to the very heart of Paul's gospel message. 1 Cor. 15:2 states: "By this gospel you are saved, IF YOU hold firmly to the word I preached to you. OTHERWISE, YOU HAVE BELIEVED IN VAIN." Why is it that most of the eternal security people skip over this verse when quoting Paul's gospel of Christ's death, burial and resurrection? The answer is obvious.

<P>The writer of Hebrews told the Christians: "We have come to share in Christ IF WE HOLD firmly TILL THE END the confidence we had at first" (Heb. 3:14). It doesn't say that God will unconditionally hold us firmly till the end.

<P>Lastly, God Himself, who knows all there is to know about His own grace and keeping power, spoke these words from His throne after the finished work of Christ was completed on the cross: "But the cowardly, the unbelieving, the vile, the murderers, the sexually immoral, those who practice magic arts, the idolaters
and all liars--their place will be in the fiery lake of
burning sulfur. This is the second death" (Rev. 21:8).
Notice there is no fine print which reads, "unless they
were ever saved." There is no difference between a
sexually immoral person who was never saved and a saved
person who later becomes sexually immoral and dies in
an unrepentant state (1 Cor. 6:9,10; Eph. 5:5-7; Gal.
5:19-21). Notice also that the "unbelieving" are not
the only ones who go to the lake of fire, as the
Calvinists teach. Furthermore, the once saved always
saved teaching is a "license for immorality" (Jude 4),
since it teaches that if you were ever saved and then
become sexually immoral, you will still go to Heaven
even if you do not repent. If this isn't a license for
immorality, then a license for immorality does not
exist.

<p>Subject: Eternal Security</p>

<p>The reason I believe in eternal security is because Jesus told
me in His Word that when the Holy Spirit comes to dwell in me
that He will never leave me till I go to the Father. That to me
is eternal security. Besides if you think that becoming sexually
impure is a way to loose your salvation then why did Jesus have
to come and die on the Cross. You seem to believe that you are
the one that can hold your salvation and this is so untrue of
what the Bible as a whole teaches. Sure you can take scripture
out of context and seem to prove a point but in my heart there is
nothing that csn change the fact that Jesus lives there and is
there until He returns to take me home to Him. If we could save
ourselves by staying away from sin then Jesus would not have had
to go to the Cross too cover that sin with His precious sin. As
for a license too sin, if Jesus lives in your heart you have a
conviction of that sin when you committ it and confession is the
next response, I know I still sin everyday. Is lying, stealing,
gossipping,etc.,etc., any less sin in God's eyes' than sexually
immmorality? </p>

 My name is Daniel McGrew. I am having a very serious family problem at this 
time. It involves children, our children, my children. If you can provide any 
help, please let me know. If you cannot provide help, like everyone else, 
please at least send advice or an opinion.<BR>
 Four and a half years ago, DSS (Child Protective Services) in Texas 
discovered something. They discovered that my niece was systematically beating 
her own children with clothes hangers. They found this out because, she sent 
two of her children to the hospitol, she grabbed them by the feet and swung 
them head first into a wall. This very nearly killed them. Thier heads swelled 
up like watermelons, I saw them myself, after she did this to them. DSS 
stepped in and took them away. Finding that the biological mother could not be 
rehabilitated, they searched for someone in the family to adopt the children. 
They found my wife and I we able and willing to adopt them all. There were 
five children at the time. They decided to allow the mother to pick who the 
children went to. The mother was in jail at the time, for this abuse. She 
picked a woman on probation, convicted for her second felony, to take three of 
the children. (DSS had already begun a home-study on my wife and I, and 
stopped it halfway through). She sent two of the other children to woman 
convicted of abandonment of her own six children. Not nice. Last week this 
woman was thrown in jail again for abandonment. The woman who had the three 
children, her health was failing, so she gave them over to me and my wife. 
They are of course brothers and sisters, my great-nieces and nephew. Now DSS 
has taken the two children from the woman convicted of abandonment and put 
them into foster care. I sent my wife to Texas to pick them up. DSS would not 
let her have them, even though we have thier three sisters. They would not 
even let thier three sisters visit them. Stupid. The reason DSS gives for 
this, is they want to rehabilitate the woman convicted of abandonment. So DSS 
wants to keep the brother and sister in foster care until she is 
rehabilitated, for 90 days. In my opinion DSS has no interest in keeping 
families together, they are intentionall keeping this one apart. They are also 
violating a United Nations Convention on children's rights. It says that 
public (government) agencies should strive to keep a family together. I have 
offered them this, and tried to achieve it for this family for over four and 
half years. But, DSS fights me everytime and I can't understand why. They 
wanted someone to adopt the children, my wife and I said that we would be glad 
to. Then they changed thier minds again. What is wrong with Child Protective 
Services in America. They are ruining children left and right, by the 
thousands. They offer children no future security at all. These children have 
been move from person to person, home to home four times over four and half 
years. <BR>

        Now, I cannot imagine why. You think that it might be me. I don't know, you 
tell me. I am a nurse, am in the United States Air Force Reserves, my wife is 
a housewife, she takes real good care of the children that we have, they are 
on the A and B honor roll, we take them to Vacation Bible School, we take the 
to Church, we gave them swimming lessons at the YMCA. What is wrong with Child 
Protective Services in Texas, I think that it may have just a little bit too 
much power and not enough sense to use it wisely, to actually help children. 
Because from what I've seen, it hasn't done anything but make six children 
extremely miserable. There are six now, the last one is not a year old yet, 
and if child protective services has it's way, this is one little girl who may 
never see her brother and sister. Child Protective Services is simply being 
mean and evil. Why would they violate a United Nations Convention on 
Children's Rights. Why can't they make these children happy, they have had 
four years to make these children happy, and they can't do it. Give me and my 
wife a chance, I know that we can. The Lord is with us, I know that we can. <BR>

                        Sincerely,<BR>

                                Daniel L. McGrew

<P>
Steak knife is because, when I was a little boy I cut my fingers in half with 
a steak knife, while helping my dad clean a table. My fingers are fine now. 
That was over fifteen years ago.
